	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I have been hearing applications brought within Hague Convention proceedings concerning two children known as, D (who is 14) and K (who is 9). The matter was listed before me for three days. The parties very sensibly engaged in collaborative and ultimately successful negotiations for much of the first day resulting in the compromise of many issues. The compromise reached was manifestly in the best interests of the children. However there were outstanding issues of (a) leave for the applicant to withdraw his application and (b) an application by the applicant for recognition of rights of parental responsibility which he says were gifted to him by a competent Court of jurisdiction in New Zealand. He prayed in aid the provisions of Article 16 of the 1996 Hague Convention<span style="color:#000000">. </span>After hearing legal submissions, I gave my decision at the end of the third day. First, I gave permission to withdraw the application. Second, I dismissed the application under Article 16. I reserved Judgment. This is my Judgment giving the reasons for my decisions. </p>

Similarly the preparation by all the solicitors has been exemplary. This is all the more impressive as the key Article 16 issue was not trailed in advance of R&#8217;s Skeleton Argument. As such it has had to be responded to on relatively short notice. (I make no criticism of R&#8217;s legal team for this &#8211; the case has been constantly evolving and the Article 16 application was the consequence of a late concession by R as to the need to withdraw his application). </p>

Michael Gration KC, Frankie Sharma, Mehvish Chaudhry, Mavis Amonoo-Acquah, Messrs Dawson Cornwell and Messrs Goodman Ray have all given their time freely and generously. The Court is grateful for both their assistance and their generosity. Indeed, although described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span>,&#8221; the reality is that this representation will have been provided at personal cost in time and money for those representatives. There may come a time where such helpful representation falls foul of the exigencies of those lawyers&#8217; personal economies. If or when it does, the Courts will need to look again at how the legal representation of these parties is to be funded. I merely note in passing that the ordinary consequence of a civil litigant withdrawing a claim is that the withdrawing partner (and potentially their financial backers; here the Legal Aid fund) usually bear the other parties&#8217; costs<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

But analogy can be found with CPR 38.6 (1), &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Unless the court orders otherwise, a claimant who discontinues is liable for the costs which a defendant against whom the claimant discontinues incurred on or before the date on which notice of discontinuance was served on the defendant.</span>&#8221; (Albeit the similar provision in FPR 29.4 is silent on the costs&#8217; consequences). The Family Procedure Rules does contemplate costs orders in children proceedings in the right case (e.g. the undertakings required to meet any such orders in FPR 16.9 (2)(c) and FPR 16.24 (5) (c)). The width of the Court&#8217;s discretion is found in FPR 28.1,&#160;&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">The court may at any time make such order as to costs as it thinks just.</span>&#8221;<span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:9.5pt;color:#000000">  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">There may come a time when the State may have to reconsider the availability of non-means tested legal aid (as it provides, for example, to the Central Authority in 1980 Hague Convention cases) rather than just relying on the generosity of individual lawyers. The provision of such public funding would be so much better than the Court having to consider applications for costs of the sort which regularly used to be made by the Official Solicitor in litigation involving a public authority. Other remedies and costs orders are available to the Court. It is a pressing matter of fairness, equality of arms and access to justice but happily not an issue for today. But the time may come when it is an issue. That is, unless legal aid is extended in cases such as these; thereby avoiding the unwelcome need for these Courts to consider costs&#8217; orders against public authorities.</p>

Indeed, whilst not ruling out such a course of action entirely, it is very difficult indeed to think of a circumstance where the court would compel an applicant in proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention to pursue an application they have indicated they wish to withdraw. Further, having regard to the overriding objective, there are positive merits in this case to permitting the mother to withdraw her application in this jurisdiction. As I observed during the course of the hearing, at present the existence of parallel proceedings in two jurisdictions, before two judges with two sets of lawyers is introducing unnecessary and unhelpful complexity and hindering attempts  at  settlement,  as  well  as  incurring  considerable  expense. Accordingly, I give permission for the mother to withdraw her proceedings under the 1980 Convention.&#8221;</span></p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"> &#8220;1 (2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For the purposes of this Convention, the term 'parental responsibility' includes parental authority, or any analogous relationship of authority determining the rights, powers and responsibilities of parents, guardians or other legal representatives in relation to the person or the property of the child.&#8221;</p>
	      </authorialNote> is similar but not identical to the English definition. Parental responsibility in the Hague Convention 1996 is meant to have an autonomous wide international meaning (see the&#160;Lagarde Report, para 14).

Therefore if I am wrong about him having parental responsibility I will consider whether I am required to recognise those rights as if he has been given Parental Responsibility for both D and K by the New Zealand court.

Mr Hames KC says on behalf of R that each sub-paragraph is a stand-alone provision allowing him to select sub-paragraph (3) without reference to the other paragraphs. The other parties maintain that Article 16 must be read holistically and progressively. They say that R&#8217;s case at its highest is that parental responsibility was acquired by the intervention of a judicial authority. (They do not accept that parental responsibility was awarded <span style="font-style:italic">at all</span> but at its highest it was by court order). Applying (1), they say that Court ordered parental responsibility is simply outside of Article 16. Therefore, we simply do not come to (3). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in">I am fortified in that view by the position being one regulated by the normal principles of private international law. If what Mr Hames KC says is correct then New Zealand will have acquired the right to declare the parental responsibility for D and K. By contrast, England (where the children are now habitually resident) would have the exclusive right to determine issues such as living with orders but not parental responsibility. It would result in some decisions being in the exclusive jurisdiction of England and another important welfare issue exclusively decided in New Zealand (which would probably not be able to exercise that power as the children would no longer be habitually resident there). This gives rise to a situation of&#160;d&#233;pe&#231;age. That is not unlawful in itself (indeed the Rome Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations Art 3(1) expressly permits this in a contractual setting). But it is supremely undesirable when it comes to welfare considerations of a child. </p>

	      </authorialNote>. It would easily undermine the intention of Chapter 3 of the 1996 Convention if recognition were afforded as of right under Article 16 (3) to a decision of the New Zealand court only for that to be extinguished the next day by a Children Act application. That is not the law.</p>

The matter is only raised in R&#8217;s skeleton argument and the Respondents have had to prepare for this on short notice. Second, the evidence of the position in New Zealand is wholly inadequate; it precludes me from finding that the New Zealand court has awarded R parental responsibility. I could not make a declaration to that effect as contemplated by FPR 12.</p>
