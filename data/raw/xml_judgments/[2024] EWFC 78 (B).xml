The husband&#8217;s father would have it that he was someone who was not really wealthy, but had enjoyed some modest success in property. The scale of wealth was unquantified and unsupported by any documentary evidence. Having acquired capital he would have the court believe that he has transferred it all to his son, such that he no longer had enough money to meet medical bills and living costs at a level to which he has become accustomed. The timing of the payments, as I will explain, sits uncomfortably with this story and I cannot accept, on the balance of probabilities, that the husband&#8217;s father has spent his last penny on his son.</p>

By her late production of the document, itself only introduced into argument very late on in the proceedings, the wife has deprived the husband of the opportunity to have this document forensically examined.

Second, the husband&#8217;s alleged misleading behaviour. Third, findings as to computation, resources available to the parties and/or unmatched contributions made by the parties which largely flow from the findings at the first and second stage. Fourth, more conventional points are raised about needs, income and earning capacity. Finally, and drawing the threads together, resolution of the competing figures on the ES2.</p>

Very sensibly, counsel resolved the more granular aspects of the ES2 with pragmatism, leaving me to deal with the material issues.</p>

There was a dispute about what had been ordered at the first appointment which was only eventually resolved with the obtaining of a transcript of the first appointment. It may be that the wife was not served well by her first firm of solicitors. I can see that there were technical issues which were taken by her solicitor in error as to what had been ordered at the first appointment. I have allowed for these problems, which may not reflect on the wife at all. But even making a generous allowance for problems with her representation from the outset, until she changed to her current firm of solicitors, her approach has been unsatisfactory. The refusal until the eleventh hour to hand over relevant documents in the correct format does not sit in the lap of her first solicitor and the wife only has herself to blame for this.</p>

A copy of the 2009 agreement was provided in Mandarin. The husband&#8217;s solicitors were quite rightly sceptical about this very late development and in an email dated the 8 December 2023, the husband&#8217;s solicitors stated, &#8220;Please confirm that the original agreement will be made available for inspection so my client may consider whether he seeks to instruct a SJE to forensically examine the document and report on its authenticity.

Obviously the primary carer needs whatever is available to make the main home for the children, but it is of importance, albeit of lesser importance that the other parent should have a home of his own where the children can enjoy contact time with him. Of course there are cases where there is not enough to provide a home for either. Of course there are cases where there is only enough to provide for one. But in any case where there is, by stretch and a degree of risk-taking, the possibility of a division to enable both to rehouse themselves, that is an exceptionally important consideration and one which will almost invariably have a decisive impact on outcome.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.59in">&#8220;The rationale of the presumption of advancement has changed over time, and some of the older cases applying the presumption may be out of line with the current understanding of its purpose. It used to apply most strongly among family members where B was legally dependant upon A so that A had a moral duty to support or advance B. This explains the formal categories where the presumption has applied. These are transactions from father to child and husband to wife. Nowadays, it is recognised that the rationale of the presumption is broader and the court may be prepared to draw inferences of A&#8217;s intentions to make a gift to B in situations outside the formal categories where the presumption applied. So the court may be prepared to draw an inference that a transaction between members of a household or family was intended as a gift when that accords with common social experience.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.59in">The evidential weight attached to the formal presumption of advancement is now less definite than it once was and it varies from case to case. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> abolished the presumption of advancement between husband and wife since it involved unlawful discrimination. But the relevant provision of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> has not yet been brought into effect so that in principle the formal presumption remains in force. It may be however that this will not make much substantive difference to the relative positions of husbands and wives. Aside from the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>, the approach in recent cases has been to strive to determine the real intentions of the parties. It may only resort to formal presumptions where the direct evidence of those intentions is absent and a default rule is needed. Where modern experience indicates that the presumption does not provide any firm rational basis for presuming an intention to make a gift between parties in the position of A and B, then it may only be of slight probative value.&#8221;</p>

The presumption can apply even where the child is no longer a minor, since the rationale of the presumption is no longer confined to cases where the parent has a duty to provide for the child.</p>

		    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.59in">Traditionally, it was held that the formal presumption of advancement did not apply to a transaction from mother to child since mothers were not under an obligation to provide for their children. This is unlikely to be followed nowadays. Even aside from the formal presumption, the inference would be readily drawn that a gift or a contribution to the child&#8217;s maintenance was intended, even when the child was an adult. It would be particularly strong where a widowed mother was providing for her child.&#8221;</p>

With that compensation, [Eastacre One] was purchased. The property was placed into four names, the wife says, by accident. Her evidence is that the Chinese equivalent of the Land Registry accidentally registered the property in four names on the basis that these were the names which were on some other official documentation, akin to a Chinese version of a Council Tax or polling record, at a previous property which was demolished and compensation paid. This was her mother, sister, niece and herself.</p>

The reference to loan/mortgage in the untranslated document tends to support that this came from the bank, even though the reciprocal account column says [a co-purchaser of Eastacre One].

The appearance of the name [a co-purchaser of Eastacre One] for the last entry rather than a bank is not enough to deflect me from this conclusion. Ms Townend suggested that perhaps [a co-purchaser of Eastacre One] might have been referenced as an agent on behalf of the mortgage advance which had been taken in his name. That might be an explanation for the presentation of the document. I simply do not know. I am conducting the case on the balance of probabilities, relying on documents translated from Chinese.

Prior to this point it was the wife&#8217;s case that she had been assisting her mother with small investments but that she was able to do this via having access to her mother&#8217;s account.

The husband had previously requested this in his questionnaire and three subsequent schedules of deficiencies. The register clearly shows the wife being recorded as a 50% owner.</p>

I never properly understood this as [DQD] was married to a very successful and wealthy businessman. She said they had lived in a mansion house in [China] with a chauffer, nannies, and housekeeping staff, but that when a relationship ends, she believed that it was wrong to &#8220;ask for money.&#8221; She said the assets she had given up included the [Chinese] mansion worth &#163;6m, a 10% equity stake in [a Chinese private hospital] and a property in [redacted] London. If [DQD] did give up assets to this value, it seems to me that this could only be because she retained valuable other assets. Given the way in which [DQD] has pursued her claims within these proceedings which involve limited assets, I find it very hard to believe she simply walked away from a wealthy husband, with whom she shared a child, with nothing.&#8221;</p>

The parties cannot agree whether that was &#163;58,000 (the husband) or &#163;160,000 (the wife). I do not need to resolve that. The fact remains the husband has a 34% share in [UK Company One].

The loan agreements do not particularly assist me, given everything else that is wrong with this case. </p>

Most importantly for me I can see an extract from the wife&#8217;s bank statement which shows her mother transferring CYN 180,000 on the 1 September 2021 but on the same day the wife transferring &#163;178,000 on to [Chinese Associate Three]. The husband asserts the CNY 180,000 forms part of the wife&#8217;s share of the third share in the sale proceeds of [Eastacre One] (above) but this transaction would rather suggest it related to something else. This undermines the husband&#8217;s attempts to &#8220;cherry pick&#8221; figures to fit his case. I have dealt with this above and will not cover the same ground again.</p>

I was told of no compelling reasons why the husband has an obligation to finance his adult son&#8217;s university costs. The husband may choose to, but his first obligation is to himself and the wife. The court does recognise, however, that the husband does have commercial personal loans (in the order of about &#163;78,000) at the moment which would need to be cleared before he is able to obtain a mortgage. I would assess that if he uses some of the capital from the court&#8217;s order to settle his commercial debts, he is likely to have a mortgage capacity in the order of, say, &#163;120,000 in the relatively near future. I have taken this as a multiple of &#163;30,000 per annum and so it may well be that the figure could be higher once the husband has fully deployed his earning capacity.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.59in">Taken individually, each party has indulged in behaviour which would in the ordinary course be likely to have the court reaching for FPR 28.3(6) and (7). But nothing about this case has been ordinary. I am not going to recite all of the criticisms I have already made of each of the parties.</p>

	    <p class="RTFormal" style="margin-left:0.59in">My closing observation is to note that from the 29 April 2024 there are a raft of amendments to the Family Procedure Rules coming into effect concerning Non-Court Dispute Resolution. They are to be found in The Family Procedure (Amendment No 2) Rules 2023 (No 1324). Their aim is to encourage a culture change in the manner in which disputes between family members are resolved. </p>
