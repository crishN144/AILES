During the 2016 assessment of D, both parents reported their own histories of, at times, poor mental health. M has suffered from depression for many years. These difficulties also continued following the move to New Zealand and, as we shall see, led to M taking overdoses of her prescribed medication on, it would seem, 2 occasions that came to the attention of New Zealand child protection services.  </p>

M is described as putting her own needs above those of the children whereas F is described in almost glowing terms. The sister describes M as being a poor housekeeping and allowing the home to become unclean. M is also described as failing to impose routines, failing to meet the children&#8217;s medical needs and failing to provide adequate healthy meals. The sister is critical of M introducing the children to a number of &#8216;boyfriends&#8217;. The sister provides one example when she says that M became so intoxicated by alcohol that she vomited but she reports that the children have reported to her that M has drank to excess on other occasions. The sister provides no examples of what M does well with the children or in any way describes the children&#8217;s relationship with their mother. There is, in my judgment, a complete lack of balance in the statement given the sister&#8217;s descriptions of F as &#8220;always going above and beyond for the children&#8221;. If conditions within the home were as bad as the sister describes, I would have expected this concerned retired school teacher to have reported her concerns to local safeguarding services. It appears, from the content of the sister&#8217;s statement, that all she did was, on one occasion, to clean the bathrooms. </p>

That this occurred was not disclosed by M in her statements to the Court but came to light in a report prepared by an officer of the Ministry for Children that details the contacts that child protection services have had with M and the children since their arrival in New Zealand. In April 2018, M took an overdose of her medication and is reported to have been &#8220;struggling after their return to New Zealand a few months previously, after having lived 12 years in England&#8230;Both boys have behavioural issues. The children were referred to &#8230;child and youth mental health services. Following this referral, a child and family assessment was undertaken and no further action was taken by the Ministry. </p>

In an email dated 6 March 2019, the head teacher of D&#8217;s school says &#8220;As a school we became concerned around July 2018 when [D&#8217;s] attendance dropped below 80%. We referred him to truancy services but unfortunately no action was taken at that time. Around this time it was also learned that D would refuse to leave home and would sometimes be left at home alone when M could not get him to school so that she could go to work. As soon as the school was aware of this we worked with M, so that she would contact us and we would escort him to school&#8221;. This email concludes by saying the following: </p>

F had sent an email to the Head teacher informing her that D had been left home alone by M. The teacher visited the home and, to use the words of her own email, &#8220;was unable to get D to answer the door&#8217; so the teacher called the police. It seems that the teacher&#8217;s concerns were not so great that she waited until the police arrived as she reports, in the same email, &#8220;I was called by the police with an update &#8211; when they got to the home the neighbour was there and I was told it was all a &#8216;misunderstanding&#8217;.&#8221; During the course of oral submissions, Ms Chokowry accepted that there were occasions when M would leave D in the home on his own, but with the neighbour watching out for him. It was clear from the description given, that came on instructions from M, that D was left in the property without adult supervision as the neighbour would not sit with D in M&#8217;s home but would move between the 2 properties. </p>

M has produced an email from the social worker from that agency that worked with M in November and December 2018. The worker describes that work undertaken with M and D as &#8220;M asked for some help from aDapt family solutions as D was showing some challenging behaviours that M wanted to learn some strategies to help out with these&#8221;. Following the work undertaken in November and December 2018, the worker reports &#8220;this improved D&#8217;s behaviour and he was respecting and listening to M more than before aDapt became involved. M was finding it increasingly difficult to get D to go to school. To address this matter M set up a reward system and by the end of the school year D was attending school 5 days per week with no fuss and was enjoying weekly rewards for attending school. Throughout the time I worked with M I saw a big improvement in D&#8217;s behaviour. He was having less meltdowns at home and was listening to M. I believe this to have come about through the strategies M learnt and used on D and less friction happening in the household. We had a few sessions left with D went to England and M and I decided to leave them until D returned to New Zealand&#8221;. </p>

She believes, as can many parents, that their child suffers from some as yet undiagnosed condition that explains why the child is difficult to parent. Services working with M and D have not accepted M&#8217;s view that D is likely to suffer from ADHD or ASD. There is now a suggestion in the papers that D may have some rare genetic condition that could explain his presentation. Whatever the cause of D&#8217;s at times defiant behaviour, the work undertaken with M and D prior to D travelling to England in December appeared to have made significant improvements in M&#8217;s ability to parent D and this produced a perhaps inevitable improvement in D&#8217;s presentation. </p>

To be enforceable they must be declared enforceable pursuant to Article 26. The 1996 Hague Convention Practical Operation handbook provides examples of measures which might be covered by Article 11. European Regulation 606/2013 on the Mutual Recognition of Protection Measures in Civil Matters sets up a mechanism allowing for direct recognition of protection orders issued as a civil law measure between member states, thus a civil law protection order such as a nonmolestation order or undertaking issued in one member state, can be invoked directly in another member state without the need for a declaration of enforceability but simply by producing a copy of the protection measure, an Article 5 certificate and where necessary a transliteration or translation.  </p>

Our domestic law provides this court can accept an undertaking where the court has the power to make a non-molestation order. Thus, it seems that a non-molestation undertaking given to this court could qualify as a protection measure within the European Regulation on protection measures. </p>

Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk.

In summary, the argument was that she should have adopted the "sensible and pragmatic solution" referred to in &#167;36 of Re E and asked herself whether, if the allegations were true, there would be a grave risk within Article 13b and then, whether appropriate protective measures could be put in place to obviate this risk.

That is what the judge did here. It was for the mother, who opposed the return, to substantiate the Article 13b exception (see Re E supra &#167;32) and for the court to evaluate the evidence within the confines of the summary process. Hogg J found the mother's evidence about what had happened to be inconsistent with her actions in that she had continued her relationship with the father and allowed him to have the care of E, see for example what she said in &#167;37 about the mother not having done anything to corroborate her evidence. She also put the allegations in context, bearing in mind what Mr Power had said about something good having happened in E's parenting, which she took as a demonstration that E would not be at risk if returned to Lithuania (&#167;36). The Article 13b argument had therefore not got off the ground in the judge's view. The judgment about the level of risk was a judgment which fell to be made by Hogg J and we should not overturn her judgment on it unless it was not open to her (see the important observations of the Supreme Court on this subject at &#167;35 of Re S, supra).  Nothing has been said in argument to demonstrate that the view Hogg J took was not open to her; in the light of it, it was unnecessary for her to look further at the question of protective measures. She would have taken the same view even if the child had been going back to the father's care, but the Article 13b case was weakened further by the fact that the mother had ultimately agreed to return with E. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">As was made clear in Re S, at [22], the approach "commended in Re E should form part of the court's general process of reasoning in its appraisal of a defence under the article". This appraisal is, itself, general in that it has to take into account all relevant matters which can include measures available in the home state which might ameliorate or obviate the matters relied on in support of the defence. As referred to in Re D, at [52], the English courts have sought to address the alleged risk by "extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there.  In many cases this will be sufficient" (my emphasis). </p>

The expression "protective measures" is a broad concept and is not confined to specific measures such as the father proposed in this case.  It can include, as I have said, any "measure" which might address the risk being advanced by the respondent, including "relying on the courts of the requesting state". Accordingly, the general right to seek the assistance of the court or other state authorities might in some cases be sufficient to persuade a court that there was not a grave risk within Article 13(b). </p>

Ms Huntington reports that this comment appeared to encourage D to be more vocal and D then &#8220;embellished&#8221; comments that K made, examples being that D said M had had 10 boyfriends when K said she had 7 and K said M and her boyfriend would get drunk together and D said this was pretty much all the time.

When expressing her professional judgment, Ms Huntington is of the opinion that D&#8217;s account of his reasons for not wanting to return to New Zealand lacked a clear sense of strength or feeling. She says &#8220;this ambivalence highlighted D&#8217;s difficulties in fully articulating his wishes and feelings, and could potentially signify his own internal conflict or experience of divided loyalties. It also reflected a lack of maturity inherent in his age. However, he was consistent in conveying a sense of disquiet about his mother&#8217;s behaviour relating to alcohol use and of relief to have been afforded some distance from it&#8221;. </p>

I also remind myself that I am in this application not making a long-term welfare decision for D but am simply deciding which jurisdiction will hear the dispute between the parents as to where and with who D will reside. In my judgment, I must consider the situation as it was at the time when D left New Zealand, as much of what has been raised against M is historic, in that F relies on issues that he says were experienced by the children when they resided in England prior to July 2017 and issues that are raised by K, who left New Zealand in September 2018 and prior to the interventions accepted by M following the October and November referrals to the Ministry for Children. Of course, where issues are longstanding, they are more likely to sustain and expose a child the risk of their reoccurrence. However, in my judgment I must assess F&#8217;s allegations within the context of the work undertaken by M with support services in November and December 2018, not just to consider whether those services can in the future provide sufficient safeguards to prevent a &#8216;grave risk&#8217; arising but also to assess whether on the evidence before me F has established that a grave risk currently exists. </p>

It is also the case that there is no evidence before me that, since support services became involved with M and D in October, November and December 2018, D had been left unsupervised at home. D&#8217;s weight gain is a matter of dispute between the parents. F very much lays the blame for this with M&#8217;s parenting. M refers me to F&#8217;s complaints about D&#8217;s weight in the past and prior to D&#8217;s relocation to New Zealand. In my judgment, tackling D&#8217;s obesity is a long-term issue that does not raise a grave risk of harm that satisfies Article 13(b). </p>

However, prior to D&#8217;s retention in England, M was engaged with support services and was making positive changes to her parenting of D. She was also engaged with mental health services for herself and those professionals working with her, who had an overarching safeguarding duty to D, have expressed no reservations about M&#8217;s emotional presentation or her ability to cope with the challenging work that was being undertaken, particularly in terms of the behavioural management intervention that was being implemented to ensure that D attended school. In my judgment, F has failed to discharge the burden on his of proving that, at the time of D&#8217;s retention or at the current time, the possibility of M&#8217;s mental health deteriorating places D at grave risk of harm. </p>

M does not accept that her relationship with her partner is generally conflictual. I have been provided with no evidence that referrals have been made to Children&#8217;s Services or the police due to conflict with M&#8217;s home with her partner but when considering this alleged area of harm, in my judgment I must take into account what has been said by D and by K. In his meeting with Ms Huntington, K said that M&#8217;s partner was aggressive and swore at D. D agreed with K&#8217;s description, saying that the partner used the &#8216;F&#8217; word but was unable to give Ms Huntington examples of when this would happen. K also told Ms Huntington that the partner would become aggressive when drinking but D said he was aggressive most of the time. </p>

I will return to this issue of enforcement later in this judgment but, given that M has no history of failing to respect the terms of court orders, I take the view that M&#8217;s assurance that D will have no contact with her partner is adequate protection and removes or reduces any risk of harm to a level that cannot be described as grave. Acceptance of M&#8217;s undertaking addresses the other risks said to be posed by M&#8217;s partner that I have set out in &#167;65(b), (c), (d) and (e). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.6in;margin-right:0.04in">F has for some time been concerned with M&#8217;s determination to have D diagnosed with any condition that might explain why she has difficulty in parenting him. As I have already described, it is F&#8217;s case that he does not have all the same problems that M says she encounters and, therefore, he rejects M&#8217;s claims that there must be something wrong with D. As I said during the course of the hearing, this is the type of dispute that I have encountered reasonably regularly in my work in the Family Courts, particularly when parents are in conflict and unable to communicate. I accept that M has been told, on a number of occasions by different professionals, that D does not have any medical condition that explains the behaviours that M reports. However, I also have to take into account the evidence produced by M that D might have some chromosomal anomaly that could be of some relevance. In my judgment, now it has been identified, the exploration (or not) of the relevance of this chromosomal condition must be a decision made jointly by the parents who share parental responsibility. In my judgment, it is not a matter that exposes D to a risk of harm of a nature that satisfies Article 13(b) but ongoing parental conflict is clearly not in D&#8217;s best interests. I fully recognize F&#8217;s concern about M&#8217;s pursuant of a diagnosis for D, something that he would then carry with him in his medical history for the rest of his life, in circumstances where F says M&#8217;s difficulties in parenting D are due to her inadequacies, but given that this genetic issue has now been identified, I hope F will be able to cooperate with M and follow whatever medical advice is given to investigate and, hopefully, exclude any condition that may cause D long-term difficulties. </p>

Both K and D describe M being drunk but, in my judgment, D&#8217;s own descriptions lack detail and the frequency with which he says this occurs is not at all clear. K gave more detail to his solicitor in a statement that I have at page B(i)11 of the bundle. K links M&#8217;s use of alcohol to the poor condition of the home but there is no support in the evidence produced from agencies working with M that they observed unsatisfactory home conditions to at all, let alone to a degree that would prompt child protection interventions.  </p>

I also note that that there is no evidence that M has been seen by professionals to be intoxicated and the school head teacher, who visited the home and had contact with M, has not reported observing M under the influence of alcohol. Had M misused alcohol to such an extent that K had to perform some kind of rescue first aid, I would have expected such an event to have triggered child protection investigations, particularly if this had occurred in an airport. I am unable to determine the truth of that allegation, as I have not heard oral evidence. </p>

I have no evidence before me that M misused alcohol during this period and it is not mentioned in the reports from those professionals who were working with the family. I accept that F presents this as a chronic problem with a risk that this will, if it is currently in remission, resurface and expose D to harm. However, when assessing whether a grave risk arises from the possibility of M misusing alcohol when D is in her care, I am entitled to take into account the monitoring and safeguarding services in New Zealand who can be alerted to the possibility that M&#8217;s alcohol misuse might cause harm to D should he be returned to New Zealand. That jurisdiction has sophisticated child protection services that Ms Ramsahoye accepts are comparable to this in this jurisdiction. F is able to bring his own application in the courts of New Zealand to press his case that D&#8217;s welfare is best served by a move back to England and, no doubt, alcohol testing could be undertaking in Family Court proceedings in New Zealand as it is in Family Court proceedings here. </p>

Should F issue proceedings in New Zealand he can, as I have already explained, seek an order that M submits to alcohol testing if he is of the view that she has broken that aspect of the undertakings that she has offered.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment, there is no evidence before me to suggest that M would breach the terms of her undertakings and for the reasons I have given, I consider the undertakings to be protective measures for D. However, I do not see them in isolation from the other services that were being provided to M and D prior to D&#8217;s wrongful retention that will re-engage upon D&#8217;s return. Further, those safeguards can, if F disagrees with my assessment and believes them to be inadequate, be supported by F issuing court proceedings in New Zealand upon D&#8217;s return to that jurisdiction. </p>
