		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In <span style="font-style:italic">Bournewood</span> a mentally incapacitated man (HL) was admitted to hospital and retained there against the wishes of his carers, without the health care professionals using the powers of compulsory detention in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>.  HL was 48 and was suffering from severe autism.  He lacked capacity to consent or dissent to being in hospital. For most of his adult life he had been an in-patient in a learning disability hospital, before being placed in the care of Mr and Mrs E under an adult fostering scheme. Whilst at the day centre which he attended on one day each week, he became disturbed and agitated, banging his head with his hands. According to Mr and Mrs E, he had one of these &#8216;tantrums&#8217; about every four days, but the Es could cope with them and had never had to call the police or have him admitted to hospital.  On this occasion the Es could not be contacted. A local doctor attended and sedated HL.  His care worker arranged for him to be taken to the accident and emergency ward of the local hospital. Although initially calm and relaxed, while at the Accident and Emergency Unit he became increasingly disturbed, was again given sedation and was admitted &#8216;informally&#8217; to the mental health behavioural unit at the hospital, under the care of the clinical director for learning disabilities, a consultant psychiatrist. Although incapable of consenting to admission, once in hospital he made no attempts to leave. He had no ability to express consent or dissent to treatment (although he could manifest unhappiness as to specific treatment). He was unable to express preference as to residing at one place rather than another.  He did not resist admission, nor did he seek to leave. If he had, the doctor would have detained him using the compulsory powers in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. Because he had not been detained (&#8216;sectioned&#8217;) under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1983 Act</ref>, HL had no right to review of his detention by a Mental Health Review Tribunal. Through his next friends (Mr and Mrs E) he sought legal redress, via judicial review of the decision to detain him, habeas corpus and an action for damages for false imprisonment. To obtain that redress it had to be established (1) that HL had been detained or subject to imprisonment, and (2) that the detention was unlawful.</p>

		  <intro>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">So there were two central questions: (a) in what circumstances was an incapacitated patient detained in law? and (b) when should a patient who lacks capacity be detained using the powers in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> and when was it permissible to use common law to admit incapacitated patients? The House of Lords held that there was a common law power under the doctrine of necessity to detain and restrain patients who lack capacity and where detention was necessary in their own best interests. Five of the nine judges who considered HL&#8217;s position at English law considered him to have been detained, and did so on the basis of the control assumed by the doctor over HL&#8217;s treatment, residence, movement and contact with the outside world, a key point being that HL would have been prevented from leaving had he tried to do so. Despite the existence of an extensive case law on detention under the European Convention on Human Rights, the speeches in the House of Lords do not refer to the Convention. Lord Steyn, however, identified the existence of a lacuna, which has come to be known as &#8216;the Bournewood Gap&#8217;:</p>

However, it follows from the ECHR&#8217;s ruling that because sections 5 and 6 of the MCA provide a defence to a battery action, rather than prescribe a procedure, they cannot satisfy the requirements of Article 5(1)(e) in relation to a detention on grounds of unsound mind. For that reason, the Government  decided to implement the judgment and bridge &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the Bournewood Gap</span>&#8217; by way of amendments introduced to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> to provide for Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards in relation to adults who lack capacity to decide where they should reside.&#8221;</p>

The Secretary of State for Health was invited to take part in, and did take part in, the proceedings.  Helpfully his Department provided notes of meetings I (and other judges) have had relating to the issues in this case with representatives of the Department and others.  I mention this for two reasons.  Firstly, because it identifies my part in such discussions and in the light of that no-one asked me to recuse myself.  I record, as mentioned in court, that I left the discussions where they lay because it seemed to me that if they went further I might have to recuse myself from hearing cases relating to the issues discussed.  Secondly, the notes from the Department refer to the intentions of the Department in proposing (and, it is asserted in the notes, of Parliament in enacting) the amendments.  I was not referred to any Parliamentary discussion of the amendments and, in my view, the references in the notes to such intentions are inadmissible and irrelevant to the issues of construction.  I have therefore disregarded them save to the limited extent that they identify argument based on material concerning the mischief to which the amendments were addressed (i.e. the <span style="font-style:italic">Bournewood Gap</span>) and thus their underlying purpose.</p>

This aspect of the test is phrased by posing a negative.  In my view it is helpful to remember that the overall question is whether the relevant person is eligible to be, and thus can be, deprived of liberty by the MCA.   This aspect of the test limits that jurisdiction.  To apply it in a positive sense involves the introduction of a double negative and the question is whether the relevant person is &#8220;not ineligible&#8221;.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel4" style="margin-left:1in">On 12 August 2009, a standard authorisation under DOLS was issued, expressed as lasting until 10 September 2009.  In the Mental Health Assessment, GJ&#8217;s mental disorder was stated as being &#8220;Korsakoff&#8217;s psychosis and vascular dementia&#8221; and mention is made of insulin diabetes mellitus.  The clinical picture refers to a history of heavy alcohol abuse, very poor short-term memory, an inability to manage his diabetes because of these symptoms and the concomitant risk of self neglect and a consequent worsening of his mental and physical health. This largely echoes the submissions made to, and accepted by, the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  GJ would say quite accurately, in the Eligibility Assessment by Dr N under E5 it is recorded that GJ objects to being in the hospital to be given medical treatment for his mental disorder, that there is no donee or deputy that has given valid consent and that he meets the criteria for being detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 2</ref> or 3 of the MHA. In the standard authorisation itself it is stated that:<span style="font-weight:bold"/>&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">GJ needs to receive nursing care in hospital for both his physical health (diabetes) and for his mental health (alcohol related mental disorder)</span>&#8221;. It is accepted by the Respondents that DOLS authorisation should not have been granted on 12 August 2009 on the basis of this document as, on its face, GJ did not meet eligibility criteria.</p>

So, Case E does not impact on placement in a care home (or the relevant person&#8217;s (P&#8217;s) home or other accommodation in the community with a relative and/or a carer), and does not preclude the Court of Protection making an order that authorises a deprivation of P&#8217;s liberty to take him to a hospital (or elsewhere).  But the Court will have to consider whether it is appropriate to make any such &#8220;transportation order&#8221; having particular regard to the likely position when P gets to a hospital.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">More generally, a part of the relevant background to the construction issues that arise are the points that (a) compliance with Art 5(4) ECHR requires that deprivation of liberty is only implemented in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, (b) before and after the amendments such procedures for the lawful authorisation of a deprivation of liberty are provided by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>, when it applies, and (c) after the amendments such procedures, in defined circumstances, are provided by the MCA. So the statutory provisions for suspension and review of standard authorisations are matters that the Court of Protection should take into account in determining whether (a) it should make an order authorising the deprivation of P&#8217;s liberty, and if so (b) the extent and period of such an authorisation and in particular whether, and/or for how long, it should continue after P is placed in a hospital or a care home having regard to, for example, the authorities relating to the need for review of a deprivation of liberty based on the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">The statutory power to make a welfare order that deprives P of his liberty is different to the statutory power to make declarations conferred by section 15 of the MCA.  It follows that, if and when the Court of Protection (or any other court) is invited to authorise a deprivation of liberty it will need to consider whether it has jurisdiction to do so based on the MCA (or on some other basis) and how it should do so in exercise of that jurisdiction.</p>
