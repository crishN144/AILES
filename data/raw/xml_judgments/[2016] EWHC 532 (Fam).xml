The Judge has given permission for this anonymised version of the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition always that the names and the addresses of the parties and the children must not be published.  For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and addresses of the parties and the children will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with.  Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</p>

Very important indeed is the account of the child, considered, of course, in an age appropriate way. An express denial is no less an account than is a positive account of abuse. It is also, in my opinion, very important to take fully into account the account and demeanour of the parents, and an assessment of the family circumstances and general quality of the parenting&#8230;Even 20 years after the Cleveland Inquiry, I wonder whether its lessons have fully been learned.&#8221;</p>

TH has filed and served replies to the Scott Schedule.  He denies each allegation levelled at him.  TH currently faces criminal charges in Scotland arising out of the allegations made.

Prior to his return to the United Kingdom the mother requested TH allow her contact between 9 August and his commencing school in Scotland on 11 August 2014.   By 7 August 2014 TH was growing concerned about the mother&#8217;s behaviour.  TH made contact with his Scottish lawyer for initial advice. However, on 7 August 2014 the mother assured TH she would return S to Scotland in time for the start of school and he agreed to contact taking place.  </p>

The mother&#8217;s account as to why she did so has varied significantly in the telling.  In her statement supporting an injunction application dated 5 September 2014 she states &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I was leaving for a new life</span>&#8221;.

These principles and parameters include the need for such assessments to be rooted in child development and informed by evidence, to involve children and families, to adopt an integrated approach, to be a continuing process and not an event and to be transparent and open to challenge.  The three domains of the assessment specified at [36] should be the child&#8217;s developmental needs, the parents&#8217; or carers&#8217; capacity to respond to those needs and the impact and influence of wider family, community and environmental circumstances.  At [37] the guidance makes clear that the interaction of these domains requires careful investigation during the assessment and that it is important that (a) information is gathered and recorded systematically, (b) information is checked and discussed with the child and their parents/carers where appropriate, (c) differences in views about information are recorded and (d) the impact of what is happening to the child is clearly identified.  </p>

In particular, I note that a report from N&#8217;s Out of School Care club, not disputed by the mother, recorded as follows in 2014:</p>

The nursery principal and deputy principal have provided unchallenged evidence that the nursery considered S to be residing with his father that S was clean and well presented, that he had very good relationships with all members of staff and was popular with his peers.  They make clear that they never had any concerns regarding S&#8217;s presentation and care.  DC Glendenning confirmed in her oral evidence that the nursery told her that there had been no concerns with respect to S, that they had not seen a great deal of the mother but that TH or the paternal grandmother would collect S.  The nursery further confirmed that S was happy when he was collected by his father or paternal grandmother and that the nursery had no concerns in respect of a child they considered to be thriving.</p>

NH, TH&#8217;s brother, likewise expressed no concerns regarding S during the times he had seen him nor any concerns with respect to the care given to S by his father.  After the conclusion of the evidence but prior to submissions those representing TH received a letter from NH stating his wish to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">withdraw his evidence</span>&#8221;.  It appeared that NH (who is employed in a profession which requires dispassionate and highly technical risk analysis) was worried he had not adopted a perspective sufficiently forensically detached from his loyalty to his family when giving evidence.  In his letter NH however reiterated that he had never seen TH harm S or any evidence that he had harmed him.  </p>

The mother contends that she was pressured by TH into sending S.  This is denied by TH.  In this context I have been shown a photograph of mother and S, both smiling and seemingly very relaxed, taken by TH at Heathrow airport immediately prior to S&#8217;s departure to Canada in 2014.  The photo appears incongruous with allegation that mother was on that day unhappily acquiescing to pressure from TH, although some caution must be exercised in attaching weight to a moment caught in a still photograph.  </p>

N&#8217;s paternal grandmother, LC was clear that she had no real concerns in respect of N save on one occasion prior to June 2014 when he had a red mark on his arm which he said resulted from his <span style="font-style:italic">mother</span> giving him a &#8220;Chinese&#8221; burn.

With respect to the latter issue, BC stated that, in his view, the mother had a difficult relationship with N from approximately the age of 3 or 4 and would, on occasion, taunt N by threatening to buy him pink shoes and would mock up photos of him as a ballerina.  Both BC and TH gave evidence that the mother would tend to wind N up and would often make matters worse rather than better in terms of his behaviour.

In her Police interview the mother suggested that N&#8217;s behaviour pre-dated her relationship with TH, she stating in respect of N &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he&#8217;s not the easiest of children but they seemed to get along pretty well at the time we moved in together</span>&#8221;.  </p>

However, other photos are clearly humiliating of N, including photographs taken by the mother of N on the toilet in February 2012 in which he looks plainly embarrassed and uncomfortable.  The mother also took photographs of the children naked in the bath in March 2012 (she now alleging that it was TH who took naked photos of the children).  There is also a photograph of N mocked up to place him in a pink dress. Through Ms Krish, the Mother sought to claim that some of these pictures were selfies taken by N but the position of N&#8217;s arms shows this not to be the case.  </p>

When N confirmed these behaviours it was always in the presence of his mother.  Dr Ramirez made clear that the concerning behaviour described by the mother was not seen by social workers, was not seen in school and was not seen by the CAMHs team.  She confirmed that the information provided by the mother and social services (which itself came from the mother) was the main consideration in the children&#8217;s diagnosis of PTSD.

She insisted that he asked for them and that she did not intend them to invite intimacy.  In the &#8216;Initial Account from Victim&#8217; form the mother is recorded as stating that TH pestered her for sex and then, between 2am and 3am came into the room and pulled the covers off her and lay on top of her.  The mother states she said she did not want to have sex but just gave in.  She states she was crying during the intercourse.  The &#8216;Initial Account from Victim&#8217; form account contains no account of further incidents nor any account of physical abuse or other domestic abuse.</p>

It is clear from the records of Police that the mother&#8217;s insistence on being interviewed on that night was tied to her learning that that day TH may have ascertained her whereabouts following the granting to him of a disclosure order by the Scottish court on 28 August 2014.  In evidence the mother conceded that she rang the Police to request an ABE interview on being served with the Scottish court papers but denied that this was an attempt to get fabricated allegations on the record as a means of avoiding compliance with the orders of the Scottish court.</p>

Save for the latter, the mother was not able to describe particular instances of domestic abuse over this period.

The mother further alleged to Police that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I had a horrible night, he didn&#8217;t even cut ma birthday cake or anything that ended up in the bin</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Hadn&#8217;t event cut the cake nothing it was just horrible</span>&#8221;.  However, once again, in the bundle of documents before me are photographs taken at 2115 on the evening of 4 October 2013 on the mother&#8217;s phone which show clearly TH and the children eating the birthday cake.  In addition, there are a number of &#8216;selfies&#8217; the mother took on the morning of 5 October 2013 between 1041 and 1121 which show the mother with meticulously applied make up and striking playful and coy poses.  Again, whilst caution must be exercised in attaching weight to a moment caught in a still photograph and when considering how a victim of sexual assault may react to an assault, these photos appear incongruous against an allegation that mother had only hours before been raped by TH.  In any event, the photos showing TH and the children eating the birthday cake demonstrate that the mother lied to the Police with respect to some of the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape.</p>

He had tried to touch her and stroke her, had taken her jeans off after asking her to unzip them and had sex with her.  This account differs substantially from the accounts given to the Police on 13 August 2014 when the mother stated she <span style="font-style:italic">awoke</span> at 2.00am to find TH pulling the cover off her and getting on top of her and, in a separate record on 13 August 2014 that she had <span style="font-style:italic">woken</span> to find TH having sex with her against her will.  The mother did not tell the Police on 4 September 2014 about the pictures she had sent to TH in March 2014 depicting the mother dressed in lingerie and adopting intimate poses.  </p>

In her statement in support, the mother alleged that TH pushed her to the floor when S &#8220;was a few weeks old&#8221;, alleged that there was &#8220;bickering and arguing&#8221; in March 2011, that TH was unkind about her appearance in January 2013 and that he had threatened to remove S to Canada.  The mother also alleged that TH pushed her when in the car, grabbed a packet of crisps from S and tipped them onto the floor and demanded money in May or June 2014.  The mother repeated her allegations of rape, stating that in October 2013 she did not want to have sex but TH was persistent and she eventually gave into him and that in April 2014 she again acquiesced to sex because TH said he would keep coming back every 10 to 15 minutes.  The mother&#8217;s statement is completely silent as to the existence of ongoing proceedings in Scotland.  She did not inform the English court that there was an order for S&#8217;s return to that jurisdiction.</p>

In that statement the mother makes no allegations of domestic abuse.  With respect to the alleged rape on 4 October 2013 the mother stated that she went to bed at 9 o&#8217;clock that it was TH who unzipped nightclothes but that, due to fear, she removed her nightclothes from her legs and that she did not object to sexual intercourse but was crying.  Again, this is substantially different from her previous accounts.  The same is true of the mother&#8217;s account of the second alleged rape in April 2014.  This time the mother states that she went to bed at <span style="font-style:italic">5.30pm </span>fully clothed, that TH asked for sex every 10 minutes or so, that she said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">go away, fuck off</span>&#8221; but he came in, pulled the covers back, climbed on top of her and removed her trousers and pants.  The mother states that she kept saying &#8220;no get off&#8221; but that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in the end I gave in</span>&#8221;.

When giving evidence about who unzipped her &#8216;onesie&#8217; on 4 October 2014 the mother introduced a further feature to her account, stating that there was an &#8220;altercation&#8221; between TH undoing the zip halfway and the mother completing that process.</p>

The documents associated with this period, which comprise the referral form to the refuge, a MARAC referral form and a CAADA-DASH risk assessment in respect of TH and BC, make clear that, within the context of her claiming that she was fearful she and the children would be found and harmed by TH, the mother made multiple allegations against TH and against Mr BC. </p>

Disclosure from Hackney suggests that the mother alleged that Mr BC punched and kicked her on other occasions not previously raised, namely 21 November 2011 and 1 December 2011.  There is no evidence to support these claims and the mother has not pursued them at this hearing.

The mother conceded in cross examination that there was no evidence to support any of the assertions set out in Paragraphs 101 and 102 above.  She further conceded that the TH had never threatened to &#8220;kidnap&#8221; S, had never threatened her with a gun.  As cross examination progressed the mother eventually sought refuge in a bare denial that she had ever said these things and contended that the recordings that demonstrated she had said them were a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">mistake</span>&#8221; on the part of the people recording what she had said.  I am satisfied that each of the allegations made by the mother as set out in Paragraphs 101 and 102 above was untrue. </p>

There was therefore a substantial level of dissonance between the mother&#8217;s stated fear of TH, grounded in the vivid but un-evidenced allegations she was making, and her actions. This dissonance appears to have been lost on professionals.</p>

Under the date 6 September 2014 the note records that N stated TH placed his hands around N&#8217;s neck when he dropped some chips and around S&#8217;s neck when he dropped some sausage, that S had said he wanted to live with mummy all of the time but &#8220;daddy would go mental and try to send mummy to jail and will kill you&#8221; (in her statement to the Scottish Police the mother alleges that at around this time S said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Daddy&#8217;s going to kill you if you don&#8217;t take me back</span>&#8221;), that TH had hit both children on the back of the head hard for dropping dinner, that N heard TH shout at S, that TH tried to watch N in the bath and TH tried to stick N&#8217;s head under water.

The mother and ER further conceded that the children had been present at a very unpleasant incident prior to September 2014 when they had witnessed ER&#8217;s previous partner clinging to the bonnet of ER&#8217;s car and screaming during a contact handover in respect of ER&#8217;s own children, to which incident a number of police cars and officers attended and as a result of which the boys were extremely upset.  The mother admitted that her response to receiving the Scottish papers on 3 September 2014 may have resulted in her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">fear</span>&#8221; affecting the children.  Indeed, in her evidence the mother admitted that she had told N that he was not seeing his father because of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">security</span>&#8221;, that she had told the children that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">[TH] had hurt me</span>&#8221; and that she had said that that she was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">scared of [TH] coming to find us</span>&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As with the allegations of physical abuse, in her interview of 4 September 2014 the mother also appeared to foreshadow allegations of sexual abuse by the children, saying of TH that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he&#8217;d want S to sleep next to him and he&#8217;d always want to have baths with S and things like that which I didn&#8217;t think was normal</span>&#8221; and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">he always wanted to come in when N was in the bath</span>&#8221;.   Within this context, it is of note that, once the allegations of sexual abuse were made by the mother to professionals, the mother appears never to have referred again to this seemingly significant forensic detail in her statements, even when observing that the sexual abuse had only become apparent after the children moved to England.  Indeed, in a statement filed in these proceedings the mother asserts firmly that, prior to their allegations, she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">was unaware of what was happening to the boys</span>&#8221;.</p>

During her evidence Ms Salamant conceded that, in complete disregard of the principles of good practice that I have set out above, she at no point contacted either father of the children or any member of the children&#8217;s extended maternal or paternal families and at no point contacted the children&#8217;s previous schools or the health services previously engaged with the children.

Ms Salamant accepted without question the allegations made by the mother that that TH and BC had &#8220;colluded&#8221; to find the mother&#8217;s address in England, that TH was linked to drug dealers, that &#8220;someone&#8221; may be sent to England to find the family, that TH was seeking to kidnap the children and that her own mother might accept money from TH to disclose the family&#8217;s whereabouts.   Ms Salamant made no efforts to investigate whether these matters that the mother claimed prevented a full assessment were, in fact, credible.  As I have already set out above, each of the assertions by the mother were, it transpires, entirely un-evidenced and, I am satisfied, untrue.  </p>

It would appear that at the outset of the appointment the mother gave Dr Haji an account of the family&#8217;s background and of the allegations of sexual abuse in the presence of both N and S.  The social work entry records that, in front of S, Dr Haji asked N to describe what he had seen TH doing to S and that (in another slightly different account) N is recorded stated that TH &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">touched S down below and entered him</span>.&#8221;   </p>

On another date that Ms Lot was unable to recall she stated that Ms Duggan again notified her that N has made allegations of a sexual nature.

These are in my judgment serious omissions on the part of a teacher fulfilling a child protection role.  As a result, the court is left with no accurate record of what N said and no clear idea of when he said it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the time the joint investigative interviews of N and S by Police Scotland took place on 5 March 2015 the children had been questioned about the allegations by DC Bishop and Ms Salamant on 12 September 2014, N had been questioned by DC Bishop in an ABE interview on 19 September 2014, both children had been seen by Dr Haji on 8 October 2014, both children had been questioned by DC Hackworthy on 29 October 2014, N had been spoken to by Ms Duggan and Ms Lot regarding his allegations in September and October 2014, both children had been questioned in a highly leading manner by Ms Ille on 8 December 2014 and by Ms Khanom on 15 December 2014.  In addition, prior to the interviews taking place on 5 March 2015 both children had had extensive input from CAMHS.   It is plain from the evidence the court heard that the professionals working with CAMHS would regularly discuss matters with the mother in front of the children, with the entire history on which the intervention of CAMHS was based coming from the mother.   </p>

Throughout the preceding period, both children had been living with their mother who had by this time been assessed by Dr Ramirez as highly anxious, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unconstrained</span>&#8221; in front of the boys and unremittingly negative in front of N (who Dr Ramirez considered &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">idolised</span>&#8221; his mother) and who the English Police had, on 13 October 2014, felt compelled to warn about the dangers of over-questioning / over-talking to the children.  Further, the children&#8217;s living arrangements had been highly disrupted since their removal from Scotland in August 2014.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">N&#8217;s interview conducted on 5 March 2015 was conducted by two Police officers he had not met and without a social worker present.  Prior to interviewing the children DC Glendenning had made no attempt to gain context by speaking to the children&#8217;s previous schools, health providers save for her contact with S&#8217;s nursery as recounted above. DC Glendenning confirmed that the mother had given her the erroneous impression that the relationship with N&#8217;s father had broken down and he was not involved with N.  DC Glendenning conceded that she was concerned that the boys had been spoken to by many, many professionals prior to their interviews.  However, DC Glendenning&#8217;s strategy for accounting for this during the interview seemed rather to miss the point, she saying that she approached the interview as if <span style="font-style:italic">she </span>knew nothing about the allegations.  DC Glendenning seemingly failed to appreciate that the problem was rather what the <span style="font-style:italic">boys</span> knew from speaking in front of each other on multiple occasions, from speaking with multiple professionals and from speaking with their mother ahead of the interview.</p>

She further stated that she was concerned that it was possible someone had helped him write those notes.  In evidence the mother claimed that N compiled these the night before the interview by himself upstairs. She denied that she talked to him about what he should say in the interview.  DC Glendenning was clear in her view that the mother had seen the notes prior to the interview and said as much.  DC Glendenning was also certain that the mother had known N was writing the notes and had read the notes prior to the start of the interview.  DC Glendenning said she was concerned that N had been prepared for the interview. </p>

DC Glendenning justified this course of action by reason of N being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">desperate</span>&#8221; to have access to the notes.  N&#8217;s desperation to have the notes is clear from the DVD of the interview which I have seen.  In particular, it is significant that when it became apparent to N that his notes may be removed, N became flustered and gave a confused answer which indicated that his recollection was not firm.  </p>

DC Glendenning was clear that, after he had read out his notes, she had the impression that N felt he had said all of the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">important stuff</span>&#8221;.

As DC Glendenning was forced to concede during cross examination by Ms McKenna, DC Glendenning proceeded to ask a number of highly leading questions during this part of the interview.  During this part of the interview N alleged that TH would lay on top of him and try to put his &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">willy</span>&#8221; up his &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">bum</span>&#8221; but that he would push TH off and swear at him and that this occurred three times.

As with N, S had children had been living with his mother, who had been assessed by Dr Ramirez as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unconstrained</span>&#8221; in front of the boys.  Within this context, it is of note that in his interview on 5 March 2015 S said, in response to being asked why he had nightmares about TH that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">&#8230;my mum said that my dad hurt someone else and that my dad hurt one of his friends&#8230;and he had the called the police as well</span>&#8221;.

[TH] is planning to make, to make a very bad thing</span>&#8221;.   As will be seen from one of the passages from the interview set out below, it is also clear that S had overheard his mother making allegations to someone he identified as a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">nurse</span>&#8221;, S telling DC Glendenning in this context that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Mum told that the bad bad, dirty man done it to me</span>&#8221;.</p>

S&#8217;s interview on 5 March 2015 took place in the context of him having little notice that it was going to take place, having been removed early from school for the interview, not having eaten and being given snacks prior to the interview, which he consumed during the interview.   It is clear from watching the interview that this creates a distraction for S.  The items he was given to snack on during the interview were given to him by his mother immediately before the interview commenced and were considered by S to be treats.  As with N, at the outset of S&#8217;s interview at the outset of the interview DC Glendenning told S that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">If you say something really, really interesting she is going to write it down</span>&#8221;.   DC Glendenning thus, once again, created a cue for S whereby he would know what the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">interesting</span>&#8221; answers were by watching the officer&#8217;s pen. </p>

S also alleged that his father gave him wine (a new allegation). Later S also alleged that TH punched him in the neck (also a new allegation).   Thereafter S repeatedly made clear to DC Glendenning that that is the sum of what had happened he has nothing more to say.  From watching the interview it is clear that S is <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> firm in this regard. Notwithstanding this, DC Glendenning continued to push S to reveal further matters.  At this point the interview departed even further from the precepts of the guidance. </p>

Indeed, the passage largely speaks for itself as an example of <span style="font-style:italic">extremely</span> poor interviewing practice.  DC Glendenning&#8217;s questions start from the premise that something &#8220;dirty&#8221; has happened to S, that TH is the perpetrator (pre-cast by the questioning into the role of the &#8220;bad person&#8221; and the &#8220;bad man&#8221;), place emotional pressure on S by telling him that N and his mother are &#8220;brave&#8221; and &#8220;good&#8221; for telling what happened and that a statement by him is needed to keep others safe and make promises to S that are unjustified (i.e. if he tells it once he will not have to tell it again).  In addition, certain of DC Glendenning&#8217;s questions were misleading in other respects.  In particular, N had not in his interview made his allegations in terms of &#8220;part 1&#8221; and &#8220;part 2&#8221;.

On 26 May 2015 Suzette Easterbrook recorded her view that the mother appeared to talk about her concerns and the children&#8217;s behaviours in front of the children in a way that was not age appropriate and which may be reinforcing the children&#8217;s negative behaviours.  Ms Easterbrook noted that N had a very strained relationship with his mother and expressed a lot of anger towards her.  On 27 July 2015 Ms Easterbrook again recorded her view that the mother engages the children in adult conversations and that her anxiety is shared with the children.  Ms Easterbrook expressed the view that the mother lacked boundaries of what she should and should not talk about in front of the children.  Within this context, Ms Easterbrook noted that professionals had not experienced first-hand N&#8217;s difficult behaviours as alleged by the mother.  I have had regard to the fact that Ms Easterbrook did not attend for cross-examination.</p>

N was unable to provide any further details.  N dated the alleged sexual abuse of him by TH first to when he was aged 2 or aged 5 and then to the day before S was born (S having been born on 14 August 2009 when N was 4) and at a hotel on the way back from the hospital where S was born.  N claimed he was not able to speak at the time and that he had not learnt to speak or write until he was about 7.   N also alleged that TH punched and slapped him and threatened to tie him to the train tracks.  With respect to S, N related the allegation that S had spilt crisps in the car as a result of which TH had pushed the mother.

At other times, when faced with incontrovertible evidence of an inappropriate action on her part, the mother sought to portray herself, unconvincingly, as an innocent victim swept along by well-meaning but misplaced professional advice.  More specifically, mother was not able during the course of her oral evidence to give a clear account of the allegations made by the children that only she is said to have heard.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Save in respect of two allegations of rape, the allegations lack specificity in terms of timing.  In relation to the allegations of domestic abuse those allegations are limited to the assertion that TH was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">at times</span>&#8221; physically violent towards the mother from 2007 and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">frequently</span>&#8221; spoke to her in a derogatory manner.  In relation to the alleged emotional, physical and sexual abuse of both children, the Scott Schedule specifies no dates or times, or even an overall timescale, in respect of these allegations, although the timescale is slightly narrowed in the indictment in the criminal proceedings in Scotland as set out above.   This lack of specificity as to timing has presented a challenge when seeking to place the allegations made by the mother and the children within the wider forensic context provided by the evidence before the court.  Further, the inability of the mother to specify any particular incident of domestic abuse undermines the credibility of her allegations in this regard.  </p>

Within this context, the children said nothing to any trusted relative, teacher or other person, including their mother.  Further, no relative, teacher, other professional, or on her own case, the mother saw any evidence whatsoever that the children&#8217;s emotional equilibrium was disturbed to the extent that it resulted in comment from or referral to educational or health agencies.    To the contrary, the children were seen by their respective schools and extended family to be happy and healthy and to have a good relationship with TH.  In my judgment, the evidence concerning the children&#8217;s family background, relationships, pattern of family life, social development and involvement with other agencies prior to the point at which the allegations began being made in August 2014 tends against the matters alleged by the mother and the children being true. In considering the allegations of sexual abuse I also bear in mind that it is inherently improbable that a father would abuse his son and his stepson in the manner alleged.</p>

The father has admitted that in a former relationship be acted in a manner that caused his partner to be fearful of him.  I further recognise that the children have on a significant number of occasions made statements to professionals to the effect that each was abused physically and sexually by TH as I have recounted above.

I am likewise satisfied that the mother lied to professionals when she told them TH would collude with S&#8217;s head teacher to locate her, that TH&#8217;s family is very rich and that he had access to firearms.  In the statement in support of her application for wardship dated 28 January 2015 the mother grossly and flagrantly exaggerated the true position when she claimed there was a risk that the father would <span style="font-style:italic">kill</span> the children to stop them disclosing more information.</p>

In this regard there is on the available evidence a strong correlation between the points at which the mother was informed of the key stages of the Scottish litigation and the points at which she made her allegations regarding TH.  The mother persistently represented TH&#8217;s legitimate attempt to enforce a lawful order of the Scottish court as an attempt by a highly dangerous father to find and kidnap or harm the children. &#160;The mother's attempts in this regard reached their nadir in these proceedings when she filed a sworn statement in which she asserted that there was a risk that TH would <span style="font-style:italic">kill</span> the children.</p>

On 2 October 2014 the mother told a social worker from Hackney that TH had been increasingly violent to her over the last year and a half, to which increase S had been exposed. This alleged increase features nowhere in her allegations to the Police.  On 4 November 2014 the mother is recorded as telling the social worker precisely the opposite, namely that the violence has been less severe over the course of the last year.  </p>

Whilst, latterly, the mother has remained consistent regarding the dates of two alleged rapes, the number of occasions of alleged rape evolved from &#8220;a few&#8221;, to four and finally back to two.  With respect to 4 October 2013 the time of the alleged rape moves from late on 4 October 2013 or early in the morning of 5 October 2014 back to 9pm on 4 October 2013.  The mother variously unzipped her nightclothes herself, or finished unzipping them after TH had got the zip halfway, or removed them from her legs after TH had completed undoing the zip. Only later did she introduce an alleged altercation to account for this event. With respect to 19 April 2014 the mother&#8217;s account moves from TH waking the mother by removing the covers at 2.00am in the morning or waking her by having sex with her between 2.00am or 3.00am in the morning, to TH raping her at 9.00pm in the evening after keeping her awake by pestering her, to the rape occurring at 5.30pm in the afternoon.</p>

However, certain of the photographs taken by the mother on 4 October 2013 of TH and the children consuming birthday cake do show that the mother lied to the Police regarding the circumstances of that evening.  Whilst, again, the court must be careful to avoid assumptions concerning how a person might act following an incident of rape, the content of the photos of the mother on the morning of 5 October 2013 appears incongruous against allegation that mother had only hours before been raped by TH.  The photographs the mother sent to TH in March 2014 depicting her in lingerie and adopting intimate poses do not, of course, imply consent in April 2014.  They are however incongruous in the context of the mother alleging that TH had raped her in October 2013.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The court has no accurate account of the initial allegations made by the children on 4 and 11 September 2014.  The mother was the only witness to the allegations she alleges the children made on these dates (it is of note that the statement of ER dated 23 September 2014 confirms that he had not heard children make allegations and that N had said only that he (ER) was much nicer than TH, who he never wanted to see again). The court must be very wary of placing reliance on the mother&#8217;s account of the children&#8217;s initial allegations where, for the reasons set out above, the mother&#8217;s credibility is so undermined.   The same is true in respect of the mother&#8217;s account of what N allegedly said on 3 October 2014.  This caution is further amplified by the fact that the I am satisfied that the mother sought to mislead professionals over what S had said to Ms Gorrel-Barnes on 2 December 2014 by claiming to the refuge that S had been made to watch a pornographic film in Canada. The notes produced by the mother of what the children are alleged to have said in September 2014 are in list form only.  I was left entirely unclear as to the circumstances in which they had been made.  Indeed, I have grave doubts over whether the children&#8217;s initial statements were in fact made or, if statements were made, they were anything like that which is alleged by the mother.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">There is clear evidence that from the earliest stages the mother influenced the children by exposing them to inappropriate conversations.  She admitted in cross examination that in September 2014 she had let the children know that N was not seeing his father because of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">security</span>&#8221;, that she had told the children that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">[TH] had hurt me</span>&#8221; and that she had said that that she was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">scared of [TH] coming to find us</span>&#8221;.   The CAMHS visit on 12 September 2014 provided evidence that N had internalised the mother&#8217;s fear, stating that he was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">scared</span>&#8221; at the moment and that he was scared that his mother will be put in prison and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">they will win</span>&#8221;, they being BC and TH.  S&#8217;s interview on 5 March 2015 suggests he too had internalised what the mother was saying, telling DC Glendenning in response to being asked why he had nightmares about TH that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">&#8230;my mum said that my dad hurt someone else and that my dad hurt one of his friends&#8230;and he had the called the police as well</span>&#8221;, stating that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Mum isn&#8217;t planning to go out for a nice day, [ER] wasn&#8217;t planning to go out for a nice day though mum is but she can&#8217;t, [ER] is but he can&#8217;t.

They had been introduced to a partner of the mother&#8217;s and a new family at short notice and with little or no preparation.  At some point during September they had been exposed what can only be described as a frightening incident involving an adult clinging to a car bonnet, screaming and the attendance of the Police.

In addition to the ABE interview of N on 19 September 2014, the children were seen and questioned by DC Bishop and Ms Salamant on 12 September 2014 (together and in the presence of their mother), by Dr Haji on 8 October 2014 (together and in the presence of their mother), by DC Hackworthy on 29 October 2014 (together), by Ms Duggan and Ms Lot during September and October 2014 (N only), by Ms Gorrel-Barnes on 2 December 2014 (S only), by Ms Ille on 8 December 2014 (together and in the presence of the mother) and by Ms Khanom on 15 December 2014 (together).

Within this context I note that N never talked to Dr Ramirez about the alleged abuse.

More broadly, the interviews, and in particular the interviews undertaken on 5 March 2015 and 11 March 2015 took place 6 months after the initial allegations were allegedly made and after the children had been repeatedly questioned in each other&#8217;s presence and the presence of the mother as set out above.

Whilst care has to be taken in this case when comparing different accounts due to the often parlous state of recordings made by professionals and the manifest deficiencies in the interviews, a comparison of the various accounts reveals significant inconsistencies in N&#8217;s statements regarding sexual abuse perpetrated against S and his statements regarding allegations of such abuse in respect of himself.  Those inconsistencies extend to both the nature and the timing of such alleged incidents.  S&#8217;s limited accounts of alleged sexual abuse likewise contain inconsistencies (in addition to the flat denials S gave in the presence of Dr Haji).  The children&#8217;s allegations of alleged physical abuse are somewhat more consistent, in particular in relation to the consequences of dropping food, but also vary over the time during which the children are repeatedly being spoken to by mother and professionals in each other&#8217;s presence and in interview.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in">I have of course considered carefully the provenance of N&#8217;s behaviour.  Reports that a child&#8217;s behaviour is problematic or deteriorating within the context of allegations having been made of physical and sexual abuse must always be carefully considered as possibly the <span style="font-style:italic">sequelae </span>of that abuse, or a combination of issues one of which is abuse.  N&#8217;s behaviour has clearly been problematic and has extended to aggression towards his mother, hearing voices and threats to throw himself onto the train tracks. However, there are a number of factors which lead me to conclude that it would be dangerous to rely on this behaviour as evidence that the children have been physically or sexually abused.  I am satisfied that N&#8217;s behaviour pre-dated the mother meeting TH.  I am further satisfied that BC and TH are telling the truth when they describe the mother antagonising N and exacerbating his behaviour.  The photographs from the mother&#8217;s phone show a tendency to antagonise or humiliate N.  I accept the evidence of the maternal grandmother that she was told by N that his mother gave him a &#8220;Chinese&#8221; burn.  Further, N&#8217;s behaviour must be considered within the context of the high level of disruption, instability and insecurity he experienced from 31 July 2014 when he was taken to England, which disruption, instability and insecurity would, I am satisfied, have been exacerbated by the mother&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">unconstrained</span>&#8221; discussions regarding the alleged threat posed by TH. </p>

There is no witness evidence corroborating the children&#8217;s accounts, the mother&#8217;s evidence being that she had never seen TH hit S and had only seen TH strike N once on the arm with an open palm after N had bit him.  There are no contemporaneous reports to statutory agencies and no medical evidence.  As set out above, the children&#8217;s presentation and behaviour during the period in question provides no corroborating evidence from agencies or educational establishments or in the form of difficulties arising in the wider social interactions of the mother and the children prior to August 2014.</p>

The most acute example of this was the assessment of Ms Salamant.  Ms Krish properly concedes that the social worker never really challenged the mother&#8217;s account and that the most basic independent professional enquiries were not undertaken.  Ms Salamant&#8217;s failure to challenge the mother&#8217;s account and accept it at face value meant that she permitted the mother to dictate completely the frame of reference for the actions of the local authority and other agencies and meant that mother succeeded in portraying herself and the children as victims of serious physical and sexual abuse when in fact they were not.  Ms Salamant&#8217;s failure to make enquiries of the fathers, the children&#8217;s extended families, the children&#8217;s schools, doctors and previous local authorities was particularly egregious in circumstances where such enquiries would have revealed a fundamentally different picture to that being painted by the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I stated at the outset of this judgment, this is a very concerning case. In August 2014 the mother manufactured alarm using a falsified version of past events in an attempt to avoid returning the children to Scotland.  Using a combination of emotional pressure, inappropriate exposure to adult discussions and, on occasion, coaching, the mother proceeded to recruit the children to her cause. With the aid of repeated and persistent poor practice by a range of professionals the mother further succeeded in enclosing the narrative she had created within a hermetically sealed bubble, thereby succeeding in preventing professionals carrying out the checks that would have revealed that the allegations that were being made first by the mother, and then by the children required, at the very least, a critical and questioning appraisal.  Indeed, by reason of their almost entirely unquestioning approach towards the mother, a number of professionals simply acquiesced to their confinement in that bubble.  Had professionals adhered to well established guidance and procedure they would have discovered that the allegations lacked credibility.  </p>

By reason of the failure of the relevant agencies to follow the clear and well established guidance and procedure the children were not only left in a situation where a parent was permitted to persist in conduct that was harmful to their emotional welfare but, by their omissions, those agencies actively contributed to that harm.  </p>

Professionals charged with safeguarding the welfare of children must be constantly vigilant. As Ms Lot rightly pointed out to me, professionals are trained to adopt an approach by which they recognise that such abuse can happen anywhere.   However, in circumstances where false allegations of abuse are also a reality in society, it is essential that this professional vigilance is allied firmly to the <span style="font-style:italic">rigorous</span> application of practice and procedure designed to ensure the proper investigation of allegations of abuse if injustices are to be avoided. </p>
