	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have before me a number of applications which arise in relation to an elderly lady, A, whose affairs have been administered for almost 60 years by the Court of Protection, by its predecessor the &#8216;old&#8217; Court of Protection, and, before that, pursuant to an inquisition held in 1959. Each of the applications is made by or against A&#8217;s nephew, Desmond Maurice Fitzgerald.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Fitzgerald has been unrelentingly pertinacious in pursuit of what he believes to be his aunt&#8217;s best interests. Unhappily, his pursuit of that laudable endeavour has become obsessive and his desire to litigate (most of the time as a litigant in person) and to correspond with all and sundry has become compulsive. This obsessive compulsion is marked by the very large number of applications which Mr Fitzgerald has sought to make to the Court of Protection (at least 23; see below) and by the enormous number of emails with which he has bombarded all and sundry since 2013: see, for example, the emails and letters contained in Exhibits FMTH1 and FMTH2 to the affidavit of Ms Frances Mary Theresa Hughes which I refer to in paragraph 18(iii) below. These are facts which need to be borne in mind when considering the quantum of costs asserted to have been incurred by others in relation to all this litigation. The hearing which took place before me on 15-16 and 22 March 2016 marks the culmination, though I fear only for the time being. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For present purposes, the story starts on 28 May 2013, when SJ Lush appointed her niece, C, to be A&#8217;s deputy for property and affairs. SJ Lush gave a written judgment. In it he recorded that between 7 March 2013 and 9 May 2013 Mr Fitzgerald had filed no fewer than nine applications with the Court of Protection. He recorded a number of allegations of very serious misconduct, including fraud and intentionally misleading the court, which Mr Fitzgerald had levelled against both C and the solicitors, MacFarlanes, then acting for her and against C&#8217;s predecessor as A&#8217;s deputy, A&#8217;s sister B. In relation to that, SJ Lush said this:</p>

		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>In his email dated 8 August 2016 (see paragraph 71 below) Mr Fitzgerald says this: &#8220;In your resume of proceedings prior to 2016 I would be grateful if you include reference to Order of Your Own Motion of 11 November 2013 in which you direct me to: a) Provide variations to SJ Lush&#8217;s Orders of 28 May 2013 in my aunt&#8217;s best interests; b) Grounds for proceedings against SJ Lush under the Human Rights Act 1999.  I would be grateful if you would refer to my Responses filed with your court on 6 December 2013;  to include: i) My proposal there should be an Interim Independent deputy for my aunt&#8217;s property and affairs while her capacity was properly assessed; b) [C]&#8217;s acceptance that my aunt possessed capacity to manage her property and affairs within limits (excluding trusts of extraordinary legal complexity) through the Report and findings to that effect of my aunt&#8217;s GP Dr Graham Gibson obtained by [C] on 10 December 2013 and filed with your court on 17 December 2013.&#8221; I saw, and see, no need to include reference to these matters in this judgment. In relation to the question of A&#8217;s capacity, I point out that, so far as I am aware, Mr Fitzgerald has never sought to challenge, whether in the Court of Appeal or elsewhere, either my order (see paragraph 12 below) or my findings (see paragraph 13 below).</p>
	      </authorialNote> At that hearing, Mr Fitzgerald was represented by Leading Counsel. I gave Mr Fitzgerald permission to appeal, limited to two grounds of appeal: (i) the issues of the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction and A&#8217;s capacity to manage her property and affairs; and (ii) the order for costs made by SJ Lush on 28 May 2013. I gave directions for the instruction of an expert &#8220;to assess and report on A&#8217;s capacity to manage her property and affairs as at the date of assessment and on and since 15 May 2013.&#8221; I directed that the &#8220;issue of A&#8217;s capacity to manage her property and affairs (a) at the date of assessment and (b) on and since 15 May 2013&#8221; was to be determined at a further hearing before me. The permission to appeal SJ Lush&#8217;s costs order was confined to the grounds (see below) set out in a schedule to my order &#8211; the relevant paragraphs in the schedule being B4-9. I directed (paragraph 8 of the order) that the detailed assessment of costs as between C and Mr Fitzgerald pursuant to the costs order made by SJ Lush on 28 May 2013 was to be stayed until determination of Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s appeal on costs. I directed that &#8220;Except with the prior written permission of The President [Mr Fitzgerald] is not to make any further application to the Court or to file any further documents with the Court.&#8221; I directed that all other applications to the court made by Mr Fitzgerald be stayed until further order. I reserved the matter to myself. Finally, so far as material for present purposes, I ordered (paragraph 11 of the order) that the costs of the hearing be reserved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 June 2014, at a hearing at which Mr Fitzgerald was again represented by Leading Counsel, I made an order directing that a named psychiatrist, Dr T, be instructed in accordance with the directions I had given on 19 December 2013. The letter of instructions, in a form which I had approved with only minor amendments to the draft prepared by C&#8217;s solicitors, Hughes Fowler Carruthers, was signed by Mr Fitzgerald in my presence. Mr Fitzgerald gave the court undertakings (i) not to correspond with C and (ii) not to personally attend the offices of Hughes Fowler Carruthers save with prior written permission. I directed (paragraph 5 of the order) that the costs of the hearing be reserved. </p>

On 13 November 2014, by which time Mr Fitzgerald was appearing in person, I made an order that Professor Robert Howard of the Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London, be instructed to prepare the assessment in accordance with the order I had made on 19 December 2013 and a letter of instructions in the same form as the one I had approved on 10 June 2014. I directed (paragraph 5 of the order) that the costs of the applications by C (one, dated 24 October 2014, seeking the instruction of Professor Howard in place of Dr T; the other, dated 5 November 2014 seeking an injunction against Mr Fitzgerald) be reserved.  </p>

He accepted in terms that she is extremely suggestible in relation to matters financially. He accepted that she did not really have the ability, for example, to manage the payment of care home fees. The real thrust of his case was &#8230; that, whatever her current lack of capacity, that was not something which, as in the view of both Dr Hirst [who did not give evidence] and Professor Howard, was irreversible; but, on the contrary, that, given time with appropriate help (including from members of the family) and in a much less restrictive setting, she would in fact with ongoing assistance be able to deal with and spend her money in such a way as no longer to lack capacity and to manage her property and affairs, </p>

The fact is, as I find in accordance with Professor Howard&#8217;s evidence, that the fundamental cause of the patient&#8217;s intellectual deficits are the schizophrenia present for many, many decades and the tragic consequences of the surgery to which she was subjected all those years ago. Her difficulties have not been assisted, to an extent they have been compounded, by what might be called the social realities of that short period of her life before she became institutionalised and more particularly by the institutionalisation to which she has been subjected for so many decades. But it is perfectly apparent, in my judgment, that, even if the adverse consequences of those social deprivations and institutionalisation were to be wholly removed and reversed, she would not thereby &#8211; even with the maximum of appropriate assistance &#8211; regain the capacity which manifestly she does not have at present. I repeat the incapacity is unhappily the consequence of schizophrenia which has been present for many decades and the irreversible consequences of the surgery.&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

Professor Robert Howard also confirmed that she definitely does not suffer dementia or any dementa-related condition despite her present restraint in dementia ward.

This was supplemented by a witness statement from Mr Matthew George Jenkins of Hughmans dated 26 February 2016. Apart from some passing references in his witness statement dated 6 January 2016 to which I have already referred, Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s only written response to this material, notwithstanding the directions I had given on 11 November 2015, was a witness statement dated 29 February 2016, none of it relevant to any issue I have to determine. Only after I had adjourned the hearing on 16 March 2016 to come back on 22 March 2016, did Mr Fitzgerald file a position statement dated 21 March 2016. (That, it should be noted, was <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>I had dismissed, on 16 March 2016, his committal and wasted costs applications against Ms Hughes and Hughes Fowler Carruthers as being totally without merit: see paragraphs 40 and 47 below.)

It contains wild and scurrilous allegations against various people, including C, of &#8220;income tax fraud&#8221; and &#8220;criminal tax evasion&#8221;, of which, Mr Fitzgerald asserts, Ms Hughes had &#8220;almost certain knowledge.&#8221; He accuses Ms Hughes of &#8220;deliberate falsification&#8221; in her evidence to the court and invites me to refer her to the Attorney General for committal (which I unhesitatingly decline to do). Despite the vast amount of material put before me by Mr Fitzgerald, it is perfectly obvious that there is no factual merit in any of these allegations, in particular, in any of his allegations against C and Ms Hughes, allegations which, in my judgment, are scurrilous and fatuous and which should never have been made.</p>

Mr Fitzgerald sought to parry this attack by seeking an adjournment to enable him to amend. I refused his applications to adjourn and to amend.

I refused him permission to bring a further application for the committal of Ms Hughes, pursuant to rule 14 of the Court of Protection Rules, as being totally without merit.

My order dated 11 November 2015 was very clear and very precise; yet Mr Fitzgerald has proceeded in wholesale breach of the very clear requirements of rules 186 and 188. He is an articulate and intelligent man. Why in these circumstances should he be relieved? Justice and fairness to him do not, in my judgment, justify giving him relief; justice and fairness to Ms Hughes, on the other hand, require, in my judgment, that he should not be given relief. I add one further point. Even if I had been prepared to waive the initial defects, and to treat the grounds of his application as having been adequately set out in his witness statement dated 27 November 2015 (on the ground that his &#8216;application&#8217; and contemporaneous witness statement would naturally be read together), I would not in any event have permitted him to rely upon the matters set out in his witness statement dated 6 January 2016. Absent proper particularisation in the committal application, the defect simply cannot, in my judgment, be cured by a witness statement served separately and more than a month later. </p>

Given the very grave nature of the allegations being made against her, this was, in my judgment, plainly a case where Ms Hughes was justified in briefing both Leading and Junior Counsel and in expecting Mr Fitzgerald to pay their fees. Although given the opportunity, Mr Fitzgerald had difficulty in articulating or making good any focused challenge to the detailed contents of the Schedule. There was no basis for disputing that the work had been done as alleged, or that the work actually done was reasonably required to be done, nor, as it seemed to me, any sensible basis for challenging the fees being charged by counsel. Mr Fitzgerald suggested that the various solicitors&#8217; charging rates were perhaps on the high side and that work done by partners could have been done, at lower hourly rates, by assistant solicitors. All in all, I was left in a situation where, having been appropriately invited by Mr Howard to perform a summary assessment, I had to do my best, inevitably adopting a somewhat impressionistic approach.

I should add that despite the vast amount of material Mr Fitzgerald has put before me, it is perfectly obvious that there is, as in other allegations he has made against her, no factual merit in these allegations against Ms Hughes, allegations which, like the others, are, in my judgment, scurrilous and fatuous and which should never have been made. I agree with Mr Howard&#8217;s characterisation of Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s evidence as &#8220;littered with allegations that are (i) unfounded, (ii) fanciful, (iii) scurrilous, (iv) lack any specificity of detail and (v) irrelevant.&#8221;  The simple reality is that Mr Fitzgerald has identified no legal or factual basis for any claim against Hughes Fowler Carruthers, whether for costs or otherwise.</p>

He is an articulate and intelligent man, who had had ample opportunity to formulate a valid claim if he had one. My order dated 11 November 2015 had spelt out exactly what he had to do. He had failed to comply with that order and come up with a farrago of nonsense, making allegations which, as I have said, were scurrilous and fatuous and should never have been made. There was not the slightest reason to believe &#8211; and Mr Fitzgerald said nothing to make me think &#8211; that, if given time, he would be able to formulate a proper case. There was no reason at all why Ms Hughes and Hughes Fowler Carruthers should be exposed to any prolongation of this nonsense. </p>

The total amount of &#163;45,914.40 (inclusive of VAT) was divided as between &#163;25,276.80 (inclusive of VAT) solicitors&#8217; costs and &#163;20,572.60 (inclusive of VAT) counsel&#8217;s fees. Given the very grave nature of the allegations being made against them, this was, in my judgment, plainly a case where Ms Hughes and Hughes Fowler Carruthers were justified in briefing both Leading and Junior Counsel and in expecting Mr Fitzgerald to pay their fees. Although given the opportunity, Mr Fitzgerald had difficulty in articulating or making good any focused challenge to the detailed contents of the Schedule. There was no basis for disputing that the work had been done as alleged, or that the work actually done was reasonably required to be done, nor, as it seemed to me, any sensible basis for challenging the fees being charged by counsel. Mr Fitzgerald suggested that the various solicitors&#8217; charging rates were perhaps on the high side and that work done by partners could have been done, at lower hourly rates, by assistant solicitors. All in all, I was left in a situation where, having been appropriately invited by Mr Howard to perform a summary assessment, I had to do my best, inevitably adopting a somewhat impressionistic approach. In the event I concluded that, all things considered, I should summarily assess the costs in the sum of &#163;37,000 (inclusive of VAT).</p>

Mr Clarke denies that this was so, but does not object to my considering the matter afresh.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ground B5</span>: It is said, correctly, that SJ Lush did not impugn Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s good faith. It is asserted that, because he acted in good faith and raised what were said to be a number of legitimate points in the interests of A, no order for costs should have been made against Mr Fitzgerald. I do not agree. Rule 159 does not require proof of bad faith, thought its absence is no doubt relevant. I agree with SJ Lush that most of the matters pursued with such vigour by Mr Fitzgerald (and I agree with SJ Lush&#8217;s characterisation of them, while noting, as Mr Clarke points out, that there is no appeal against the part of SJ Lush&#8217;s findings which I have quoted in paragraph 3 above) were irrelevant to the only issue to be determined. The &#8220;legitimate points&#8221; prayed in aid in paragraph B5 were, in large part, irrelevant. What SJ Lush described as the &#8220;sensible reasons&#8221; put forward by Mr Fitzgerald in his challenge to C&#8217;s appointment were convincingly answered by SJ Lush in a part of his judgment (paragraphs 45-55) with which I find myself in complete agreement. The simple fact, in my judgment, is that Mr Fitzgerald chose to oppose C&#8217;s appointment in a way which was, for the most part, utterly unreasonable and which had, as a direct consequence, the grotesque driving up of the costs. If ever there was a case for the application of rule 159, this was that case. I cannot improve upon the way in which SJ Lush explained why the order should be made. I agree with both his reasoning and his conclusions, including his reasons for determining the appropriateness of the figure of &#163;7,500 for which he made allowance.</p>

I do not agree. The giving of a costs warning is not a pre-requisite to the application of rule 159, and the fact that such a warning is given cannot immunise a litigant from the application of rule 159 to previously incurred costs. Moreover, it is not as if the giving of the costs warning induced Mr Fitzgerald to moderate his behaviour in the slightest. He simply carried on regardless.</p>

There is no requirement, whether in law or in practice, for someone in Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s position to be given such an indication. And the second point is met by the fact that the order (that is, both the order that SJ Lush made and the order I made) provides for a detailed assessment of the costs, so there is no risk of Mr Fitzgerald being required to pay anything unreasonable, let alone exorbitant.</p>

		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>In his email dated 8 August 2016 (see paragraph 71 below) Mr Fitzgerald says this: &#8220;You omit all mention of my written submissions to your court of 21 March. At hearing on 16 March you directed I file written submissions in Response to Ian Clarke Counsel for [C] by 21 March. My written submissions to your court of 21 March detail how the tax evasion practiced by [C] on our aunt's estate is proved on documents filed by [C] herself with your court. Please Report the contents of my written submissions to you of 21 March in Final Approved Judgement.&#8221; This is simply wrong: I referred to Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s position statement in some detail in paragraph 18(iii) above, and both there and in this paragraph I actually quote parts of it. However, as I explained in paragraph 18(iii) above, much of his position statement &#8220;is irrelevant to anything I have to determine&#8221;, being taken up with &#8220;wild and scurrilous allegations&#8221;, for example of tax fraud on the part of C and complaints of &#8220;falsification&#8221; and &#8220;wrongdoing&#8221; on the part of Ms Hughes. Included in Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s position statement are some specific complaints in relation to particular items in the Bill of Costs. These, however, are matters for consideration by the Taxing Judge on the detailed assessment I have directed, not by me.  </p>
	      </authorialNote> identifies the &#8220;three principle [sic] reasons&#8221; why C should not be awarded her costs as being (i) the &#8220;dangerous precedent&#8221; which he says will be set in awarding costs in the Court of Protection on what he calls a &#8216;success follows the event&#8217; principle, (ii) C&#8217;s &#8220;conduct on obtaining the deputyship and in exercising it&#8221;, and (iii) the impossibility of my conducting a just assessment of the Bill of Costs. There is nothing in any of these points. As to the first, the present case is simply an application of the jurisdiction conferred by rule 159 &#8211; no more and no less; the second, which for reasons that will be apparent is devoid of factual merit, is in any event simply irrelevant; the third I have already dealt with &#8211; there is to be a detailed assessment. I should point out, in this connection, that the sum I directed by way of interim payment &#8211; &#163;60,000 (inclusive of VAT) &#8211; was somewhat less, expressed as a percentage, than what is often conventionally directed by way of interim payment.</p>

Mr Clarke made no application in relation to the second. In relation to the first, he sought an order for costs against Mr Fitzgerald because he had unreasonably opposed the instruction of Professor Howard (on the basis that he did not have suitable expertise) and further unreasonably and unnecessarily increased the costs by bombarding Hughes Fowler Carruthers and Professor Howard with what, Mr Clarke said, was aggressive and threatening correspondence. I agree with Mr Clarke that Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s objection to Professor Howard, a manifestly suitable expert, was unreasonable. I am therefore entitled, if persuaded that this is the just outcome, to direct that rule 156 be dis-applied. In my judgment, justice to C demands that Mr Fitzgerald be ordered to pay these costs. Why, after all, should A&#8217;s estate be diminished in consequence of Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s unreasonable &#8211; in my judgment, wholly unreasonable &#8211; objection to the appointment of an expert of some eminence and manifest suitability? Accordingly, I ordered Mr Fitzgerald to pay C&#8217;s costs of the application dated 24 October 2014 (but not of the application dated 5 November 2014) to be assessed if not agreed on the standard basis. The total costs claimed amounted to &#163;14,032.60 (inclusive of VAT). Mr Clarke sought an interim payment. I directed an interim payment in the sum of &#163;7,000 (inclusive of VAT), taking into account in fixing this figure that the issue as to the extent to which the costs should reflect the volume and content of Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s correspondence made it inappropriate to take a higher percentage. Points raised by Mr Fitzgerald go if at all, in my judgment, to the detailed assessment of these costs, not to the question of principle as to whether he should be liable. </p>

I agree with Mr Clarke that Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s pursuit of the capacity issue was to an extent unreasonable (see what I said in my judgment quoted in paragraph 13 above), but not to the extent suggested by Mr Clarke. There was, in my judgment, no reason why Mr Fitzgerald should have to pay the costs of obtaining Professor Howard&#8217;s second report. And in my judgment, having regard to all the circumstances, and comparing how the hearing would have proceeded if Mr Fitzgerald had by then been acting reasonably with how it actually proceeded, it seemed to me that a figure of 50% better reflected the realities and the justice of the case than the figure of 75% proposed by Mr Clarke. Accordingly, I ordered Mr Fitzgerald to pay 50% of the costs in (ii), but not the costs in (i). The total costs claimed in respect of the items in (ii) amounted to &#163;54,582 (inclusive of VAT): see paragraph 12.4 of C&#8217;s skeleton argument dated 16 December 2015. One-half of that would be &#163;27,296. Mr Clarke sought an order for detailed assessment and an interim payment. I directed an interim payment in the sum of &#163;16,000 (inclusive of VAT).</p>

Please confirm that I have been given no opportunity to made the &#8220;further submissions&#8221; referred to by you in your previously undisclosed email of 24 March.&#8221; In his email dated 9 August 2016 (11:34) Mr Fitzgerald says this: &#8220;As presiding judge your responsibility is to ensure the parties are placed on an equal footing. This is the fundamental principle of all civil proceedings in all Divisions and jurisdictions in England and Wales. There can scarcely be an example of a judge paying less regard to this fundamental principle than for that judge to enter into &#8220;one-sided&#8221; deliberations with the legal representatives of one party to the utter exclusion of the other.  When these deliberations involve costs against the excluded party which are to met by deprivation of his equity in his home, I believe this to be a matter of public concern. When these deliberations are conducted by a judge who is aware of provable allegations of tax-evasion against the favoured party, I believe this to be a resignation issue.&#8221; In his email of 9 August 2016 (12:55) Mr Fitzgerald says: &#8220;I believe your &#8220;one-side&#8221; deliberations with [C]&#8217;s legal representatives conducted at a time when you were aware of provable allegations of tax-evasion against her and of immediate relevance to those deliberations to be a resignation issue.&#8221; The facts, as shown by the emails sent at the time, of which I have contemporaneous copies, are as follows: My email of 24 March 2016 was sent to Mr Clarke and Hughmans at 08:53, with a request that it be copied to Mr Fitzgerald. It was forwarded by Hughmans to Mr Fitzgerald the same day at 09:49. The submissions by Hughmans in relation to the costs were sent to me by an email the same day at 10:24, that email also being copied to Mr Fitzgerald. Since I drafted this footnote, there have been further emails. An email sent by Mr Jenkins of Hughmans to Mr Fitzgerald on 9 August 2016 (14:47) reads as follows: &#8220;The events of 22 and 24 March 2016 were as follows: 1. On 22 March 2016 the President made an Order (a copy of which is attached) (a) allowing your appeal and exercising his discretion afresh (b) reserving his judgment on the remaining issues in dispute and (c) ordering each party to file and serve short written submissions as to the costs of the March 2016 hearing by 4pm on 29 March 2016. 2. On 24 March 2016 at 08.53 Mr Clarke and I received an email from the President notifying us of his decision in relation to the remaining issues in dispute and of his provisional view as to the costs of the March 2016 hearing. He asked us to submit a revised draft order by email, with copy to you, and also to provide you with a copy of his 08.53 email. 3. At 09.49 I sent an email to the President attaching the draft order as requested and asking for a further charging order. I copied you into that email, which also appended a copy of the email Mr Clarke and I had received from the President at 08.53. A further copy of my email is attached. 4. At 10.24 I sent a further email to the President with our submissions as to the costs of the March 2016 hearing. Again, I copied you into that email.  A further copy of that email is also attached. You will note that there have been no &#8220;one sided deliberations&#8221; as you have alleged. You were provided with copies of the emails at the time.&#8221; Mr Fitzgerald replied to Mr Jenkins (9 August 2016, 15:27): &#8220;Both you and the President are aware that I was not copied in to your emails of 09.49 and 10.24 of 24 March.&#8221; He followed this with a further email to me (9 August 2016, 15:35): &#8220;I trust you will have the judicial integrity to confirm that Hughmans Solicitors&#8217; emails referred to below were not copied to me at the time and you will not seek to rely on the questionable evidence of a solicitor who in breach of his professions code of conduct has been assisting his clients in concealment of serious fraud and tax-evasion.&#8221; I make no observations in relation to Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s attacks on my integrity, beyond emphasising that the facts, as I believed them to be at time and when I prepared the draft of this judgment, and as I now believe them to be, are as I have set them out above. Despite Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s bluster in relation to Hughmans, there is, in my judgment, no substance in any of the allegations he makes against either the firm or Mr Jenkins.     </p>
	      </authorialNote> in which I announced that decision, I said that &#8220;In relation to the costs of the hearing I am provisionally minded, but subject to further submissions, to order Mr F[itzgerald] to pay 75% of the costs.&#8221; The response from C&#8217;s solicitors, in an email sent the same day, was that in a &#8216;without prejudice save as to costs&#8217; email sent to Mr Fitzgerald on 15 February 2016, C had made an offer as to costs which, in the aggregate, they said, was handsomely beaten by the various orders I had made. Thus, although they had sought C&#8217;s costs of the hearing on 10 June 2014 (which I refused), they had offered to accept 50% of the hearing before SJ Lush (as against the 100% I ordered) and to forego the costs of the hearing on 20 January 2015 (as to which I awarded 50%). There was no response from Mr Fitzgerald, who filed no written submissions either (as directed) by 29 March 2016 or at all.</p>

I will direct an interim payment of &#163;35,000 (inclusive of VAT) on account. I will also, as requested, make a further interim charging order in the sum of &#163;35,000 in respect of Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s interest in his former matrimonial home.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="13">

I would be grateful if you would give this confirmation this week.&#8221; This is self-evidently correct; as Hughmans&#8217; email of 8 August 2016 makes clear, it was sent in response to their receipt of the draft judgment.</p>

For the sake of completeness, I set out each of his observations, with my response, in a footnote to the relevant part of the judgment.
