The mother thought she was 25 weeks' pregnant at the time but the doctors thought that A was more likely to be of 27 to 28 weeks' gestation.  She was very small at birth and, being so small and vulnerable, she remained in the paediatric intensive care for some weeks.  She also developed serious abdominal difficulties in July from which she has recovered.  She has a number of medical issues but given her age, the prognosis is not certain.

They were selected for A as they had been assessed and approved as concurrent foster carers.  In other words, they would be foster carers who would be available to adopt her should the occasion arise.  They are committed to her and wish to provide her with a long term care possibly under an adoption order.  That is the long term care plan.</span></p>

The mother gave information about her and her baby's background.  She said that the father was Romanian Roma but she was herself Romanian.  She refused to provide the father's name.  She said that her family were not aware of her pregnancy.  She had not told them about it or her relationship with the father and she had concealed the pregnancy from them.

He met with the mother's own mother again who was shown a photograph of the mother.  Initially she denied recognising the mother but later produced a copy of the mother's ID card with a photograph of the mother.  Whilst there, a niece of the mother identified the photograph as the mother and a sister of the mother did so as well.  The grandmother then returned with a copy of the mother's ID card and was able to confirm that the photograph with the process server was that of the mother.  The process server then showed a photograph of the mother to a village policeman who identified it as that of the mother and said that she had been registered as missing but had returned to the address and was declared not missing.  It seems he thought that she was probably in the United Kingdom and said that she did not have a relationship with her family.

The Romanian legislation does not have policies and procedures for applying the provisions of this community regulation and means that the provisions of that regulation must be complemented by domestic Romanian law.  "We consider that the Romanian court assessing a claim based on Article 15 would need to make an application for procedural rules relating to contradictive terms so would be able to issue a ruling over a case only after summoning and hearing all parties.  During the first case hearing of the parties summoned the judge has, by default, an application to assess and confirm that the court has the general material and territorial competence to rule over that particular place, making notes of the case conclusions and recommendations.  Only in exceptional circumstances and/or further clarifications when evidence is needed the judge would raise this issue with the parties above and the court can adjourned accordingly.  The court of a Member State requesting an application under Article 15 of the regulations is to be sent to a court from another Member State may select the court of another Member State by consulting the European judicial atlas in civil matters with the Romanian central authority.

We would like to mention that repatriation procedure as well as the background checks are carried out by the Romanian authorities would be based on the government decision number 1443 of 2004 regarding procedures for the repatriation of unaccompanied children providing the child's best interests would be protected.  If, following the assessment made in relation to the child's extended family or natural parents, it would be decided that the family re-integration is not an option, then a Romanian competent authority would recommend the child be placed in a foster care based on a court order.  The child's placement would be done by the panel for child protection in the county of residence thought necessary by the court depending on the evidence presented if special protection measures are necessary.  Taking into consideration the child's age, the foster care placement would be the solution to be considered by the Romanian authority as under the current Romanian law, a child under the age of two cannot be placed in a residential institution (orphanage).  We would like to emphasise that for the moment the Romanian authorities have been unable to identify the child's extended family members due to the confidentiality of this case.

Under Article 8 and Article 13 I may have jurisdiction and the preliminary view of Mr Justice King was that I had jurisdiction under Article 8.  Mr Justice Wood thought I had jurisdiction under Article 13.  Counsel before me both agree that I do have jurisdiction under one or the other.  The bottom line is Article 13 in that the child is here but I should consider Article 8, specifically, Article 8 says that a court of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time that the court is seized.  The facts of the matter are clear, the court was seized initially on the issue of the care proceedings in August.  The child was here.  She had been born here.  She was then currently in foster care and has since moved to her current foster carers in September.  These are the very basic outline facts.  We know what the mother said to the social workers and the midwife, it was her wish for this child to be adopted here, she did not want to take her back to Romania, she did not want her family to care for the child or to know of her pregnancy and child;  that the father, while not knowing about the birth of the child, knew of the pregnancy and was not interested.  The mother indicated that she was going back to Romania but did not want the child to accompany her back to Romania.  Thus, the mother's clear wish and intention was to leave the child here for her to be adopted.  </span></p>

Those are the facts from the mother's position.  The family in Romania has indicated that it does not know about this child and while I call them the family, they are a presumed family.

It was the purpose of the 1986 Act and the Convention to adopt a concept which was the same as that adopted in The Hague and European Conventions.  The Regulations must also be interpreted consistently with those conventions.  The test adopted by the European court is "the place which reflects some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment in the country concerned".  This depends upon numerous factors including the reasons for the family's stay in the country in question.  "In my view, the tests adopted by the European court is preferable to that earlier adopted by the English courts.  They focused on the situation of the child.  </span></p>

I accept that it is likely that the mother and the little girl are both Romanian.  I cannot say that I am one hundred per cent certain but the evidence firmly indicates that likelihood. &#160;The mother seemed to speak Romanian as her first language.  She talked about Romania and said she was returning to Romania.  It seems that we have located her family.  I am not making a clear finding of that because all I can do is to look at the evidence before me and the mother is not here.  The little girl was born here and the mother wanted her to be adopted here.  There was no pressure on her to reach this conclusion.  It was her conclusion and she gave her reasons.  She said that she had no money to support the child; that her family did not approve of her relationship with the father, that they would disown her and they would not support her and that the father himself was not interested.  She herself had concealed the pregnancy from her family and from her friend, Z.  The mother has effectively abandoned A to her fate here.  She wanted her to be adopted in the United Kingdom, hoping that she would find a good home.  </span></p>

The child was born here and all the evidence relating to her care and what happened surrounding her birth is here.  There is social work evidence and the medical treatment and evidence here.  All the relevant evidence is here.  I fully recognise nowadays that with video links courts do hear matters across jurisdictions.  Of course, video links can be set up one way or the other, either to Romania or from Romania, so that is not my principal objection to a transfer.  My principal objection to a transfer is whether it would be in the child's best interests.  I am clearly of the view that it would not be in her best interests for the following reasons.  These proceedings are well in train.  There is a clear plan provided by the local authority and agreed to by the guardian that if a care order were to be made and if a placement order were to be made, this child would be effectively adopted in due course by her carers, with whom she is happy and settled and that has the advantage that there would not be a move to another set of carers. </span></p>

It would be difficult but still possible.  From the letters we have received from Romania there is no clarity as to where or when this little girl might be found a home.  There is no clarity as to what sort of home it would be either.  There is no time limit or timescale as to when proceedings would be instituted or the duration of those proceedings and what would occur to this little girl if she were relocated to Romania.  Where would she go?  The only situation we have been told is that if there was no family member capable of taking her in, because she is under the age of two she would be placed into foster care, and these are ominous words, that because of her age being under two, it would be foster care rather than an "orphanage".  She is in a home being loved by committed people.  To move her to Romania would be placing her into limbo.  As far as I can ascertain, she would not go immediately to a child centred sensitive family home.  She would be put into foster care and from there in due course moved somewhere.  That is not in her best interests.  </span></p>

The issue is how best we can do it either through the Romanian central authority or in any other way and it may be that counsel would wish to discuss the matter before I finally conclude today but I am very anxious about the timing of this case.  I envisage a short period when enquiries can be made.  This case can be brought back to me as soon as possible after that.  Hopefully we will have the information and final decisions can be made as to the future of this child.  I am very concerned about delay.  If counsel would like to consider the matter amongst themselves and then address me shortly, we will move forward.</span></p>
