Furthermore, the package of care necessarily deprives her of her liberty. No one has any doubts that she lacks capacity, and that her arrangements are in her best interests. However, actual evidence of her mental disorder appears not to be available. Certainly, no professional medical evidence was placed before me.</span></p>

Secondly, whether the Court, either in its guise as a judge considering a COPDOL11 application on the papers, or via an application under the COP1 procedure, has to be in possession of evidence from a medical doctor?</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In the context of applications to authorise a package of care, which inevitably results in P being deprived of his or her liberty, the Court must be satisfied that P suffers from unsoundness of mind. However, these words have no mystical powers; they are not an &#8220;open sesame&#8221; giving access to the Article 5 cave. They refer to a mental disorder. It is for the court to be satisfied that P is of unsound mind on the basis of the evidence before it. Provided that evidence satisfies the Court that P has a mental disorder, and subject of course to the other essential requirements also being satisfied, the Court may authorise detention.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) jurisprudence is clear that &#8220;unsoundness of mind&#8221; has to be proved by those seeking to assert it on sound medical evidence. Usually that evidence will come from a medical doctor, generally a psychiatrist or General Practitioner. Whether, in appropriate circumstances that evidence could come from a psychologist, mental health nurse, or other similar specialist clinical expert may be a moot point. It is one I do not have to decide in this case. I simply direct that the Applicant needs to commission and instruct a registered medical doctor, either a psychiatrist or a GP, to review KB&#8217;s case and provide a report dealing with her diagnosis as well as whether that condition causes her to lack capacity to make relevant decisions, as well as the likely duration of that condition.</span></p>

Having heard argument in October 2013 the judgment was eventually handed down in March 2014. It is debatable whether the final formulation to be applied when deciding whether an incapacitous person receiving social care is deprived of their liberty should have come as a surprise. However, three important points came out of the judgment.</span></p>

That meant that Schedule A1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (MCA), the &#8220;Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards&#8221; (or DOLS), an administrative process for the authorisation of deprivation of liberty, would not cover many of the cases identified as deprivations of liberty post-Cheshire West.

In other words, the proper comparator when considering the living arrangements and restrictions imposed on a person with a mental disorder and lacking capacity was an ordinary member of the public, not another person with those characteristics. That latter approach had been taken by the Court of Appeal, applying the test to be taken with children to incapacitated adults: see </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">Cheshire West &amp; Chester Council v P</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2011/1257" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCA Civ 1257" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCA Civ. 1257</ref>, per Munby, L.J.</span></p>

One of them was the anticipated and dramatic increase in the number of cases coming before the Court of Protection to authorise packages of care that fell outside the statutory regime. This prompted the then President of the Court of Protection and Family Division, Sir James Munby to list a number of these cases before him in order to fashion a fast-track procedure which would take uncontentious cases out of the COP1 application procedure and allow the Court to deal with these cases on the papers: see </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">Re X (Court of Protection; Deprivation of Liberty)(Nos 1 &amp; 2)</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 WLR 2454" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 WLR 2454</ref>).

Furthermore, many found it difficult to characterise such arrangements as a deprivation of liberty: see [9]. However, the Court of Protection had to follow the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Cheshire West. Furthermore, at [7], his Lordship said that if one took Articles 5&#167;1(e) and 4 together &#8220;it should always be remembered that the process that renders deprivation of liberty lawful also protects those who provide, or arrange the provision of, the care package&#8221;. In other words, clarity protected the detained person, but it also protected those detaining them.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I would add that the definition of mental disorder applicable in England is that contained in the MHA at s. 1(2), namely &#8220;&#8216;mental disorder&#8217; means any disorder or disability of the mind&#8221;. It seems clear to me that a person suffering from a learning disability has a mental disorder so defined. In the MHA there is a provision that excludes those with learning disability from being detained under certain sections of the MHA without more; namely, their disability must be &#8220;associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on [their] part&#8221;. However, learning disability is a mental disorder and, under the MCA, which has no such exemption, a person can be detained without the conduct mentioned above. </span></p>

Does that mean that the expert certifying P to have a mental disorder must also express the opinion that it is the disorder that causes P to lack capacity? In my view, it is not necessary for that to be the case provided the Court is able legitimately to decide on all the evidence that there is a causal nexus between the disorder and P&#8217;s incapacity. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It will be clear by now from the quotes from the cases that what is required is reliable medical evidence of mental disorder. The word &#8220;medical&#8221; connotes that the evidence is of and pertaining to the science of medicine. It is clear to me that means a registered medical practitioner. There is no need to elaborate on that in this case. Here it means either a psychiatrist or a GP. Whether a wider net can be cast for other clinicians, such as clinical psychologists, learning disability nurses, or occupational therapists, may be a moot point. However, in this case the evidence needed is from a medical doctor. </span></p>

The Applicant will ensure that the court is furnished with a report from a registered medical practitioner competent in giving his or her opinion on KB&#8217;s condition. It does not have to be a psychiatrist, although it may be. It could be a GP. I am not directing a Court of Protection visitor to be instructed. I am not directing a s. 49 report. Finally, I am not directing a jointly instructed expert.  None of those are appropriate in this case, at least not at this stage.</span></p>

They have not discharged that burden at the present time. They issued proceedings without a vital component for their case. Pragmatically and quite rightly, the Court made interim declarations on the evidence before it. The matter was then listed for a decision as to what evidence was needed. It would have been disproportionate and frankly absurd if the Court had dismissed the Applicant&#8217;s application for want of evidence. However, in future it is for the Applicant to ensure that there is evidence of unsoundness of mind as well as incapacity before commencing proceedings. I hope that in future in a case that is an archetypal Re X case that will be done, and the matter started by way of COPDOL11.</span></p>

From what I have read she is contented where she is and receiving entirely excellent care. She is able to maintain her relationship with her family who clearly love her and care about her very much. I can only imagine how difficult it is for parents of highly vulnerable adults as they become older and less able to care directly for their child, and increasingly fearing what will happen to their child once they are gone. At the first hearing over which I presided, KB&#8217;s father was on the remote link. Unfortunately, due to a breakdown in communication with him he had travelled into Manchester for an in person hearing, not knowing that it had been transferred to me, sitting remotely at Preston. He was a little flustered as well as somewhat bewildered at why four barristers, a team of solicitors and people from the various parties were appearing before a Judge because of his daughter&#8217;s living arrangements. He clearly is entirely happy with his daughter&#8217;s arrangements. I hope I dispelled any concerns he had that the Court was there to judge him or his family.</span></p>

It is there to ensure that the most vulnerable people are not treated in a way that is less favourable than they would be if they were not disabled. If KB&#8217;s is a straightforward and uncontroversial case, then no doubt some will wonder what all the fuss was about. But it is important that a fuss is made about KB to ensure she is in the right place with the right package of care.</span></p>
