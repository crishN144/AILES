It is an example of a flawed enquiry into false allegations of sexual abuse. It also surveys the evidence of a 'veracity expert' who contended, wrongly, that the allegations should be believed. </p>

The mother has a daughter called EB, who is aged 5 having been born on 4th December 2000. EB has a different father to TD. At all material times TD and EB have lived with the mother. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">During the currency of this hearing it was necessary for me to formulate the terminology that reflected the allegations that were being suggested against the paternal grandmother; I then invited submissions from the legal representatives upon that formulation. I adapted my original formulation following submissions from Ms Gargan about the case that she wished to present on behalf of the mother. Although there is no suggestion that the paternal grandmother experienced any surprise or injustice about the delayed formulation of the allegations that she faced, I do not consider that this task should have been left to me; it is not part of the Judge's role to formulate a party's allegations. It should have been done by those then acting for the mother at least 12 months ago &#8211; see the order dated 1st June 2005. If it was not done then it should have been done immediately after paragraph 6 of my order of 7th April 2006. Ms Gargan (who represented the mother with outstanding skill) does not bear the blame for the delay. </p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">The factual basis of the allegation against the paternal grandmother, is that she came across the father in the act of abusing EB and was unable to pull him off. Seeing that EB was bleeding as a result of the abuse, she later applied cream to EB and then concealed the abuse, giving perjured evidence on the issue. It is suggested that there is evidence that the paternal grandmother witnessed or ought to have known that the father was abusing TD.</p>

If, as is alleged, the grandmother saw the father on top of the child and saw bleeding caused by that act to the child's genital area, it seems obvious that the grandmother would have known that the child had been abused (particularly since it also alleged that the child told the grandmother what had occurred). </p>

No evidence was heard and there was no judicial determination of the allegations.

There was a brief hearing on evidence on 3rd May 2005 when Judge Cotterill concluded that the paternal grandmother was a 'suitable and appropriate person to supervise contact'; the allegations of involvement in sexual abuse were not put to the paternal grandmother at that hearing and the mother's statement on the issue of the suitability of the paternal grandmother as a supervisor made no mention of any such allegations. A further order for contact was made on 1st June 2005 without evidence being heard, backed with a penal notice.

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Thereafter, the therapist formed the view that the allegations that the father had abused EB were true and fed that belief into the social care system in Surrey. A social worker in Surrey was influenced by the therapist and accepted her view. Groups of professionals met in Surrey and debated wide issues about their beliefs about the allegations, some believing them, some not. There was discussion about a number of issues, which were simply floated without resolution (e.g. whether the mother suffered from "Munchhausen's syndrome by proxy", a label that has in any event been commented upon by Ryder J in paragraphs 175-177 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">A County Council v A Mother and A Father and X, Y and Z</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/31" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 31 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 31 (Fam)</ref> and whether she was "transposing her own experiences of childhood abuse upon the children"). Information was kept from the father lest it should interfere with EB's therapy - see an order made in August 2005 made without notice to the parties on the application of the Local Authority (who were not parties) seeking exemption from disclosure of the minutes of the 'professionals network meeting' that was held on 24th May 2005. That meeting, which I was told in evidence was 'swayed' by EB's therapist to support the suggestion that EB had been abused by the father, was held in Surrey. The extent of this difficulty can be seen in a document which was written by a very experienced social worker: 'The County court judge dealing with the matter in the beginning (who has since, incidentally retired,) however found 'mother's account of events truly extraordinary, well exceeding his comprehensive fifteen years experience'. The Judge hence directed further investigations and advises the father to upgrade his contact application to a fully-fledged residence application. It is also of some relevance that similar concerns have also been voiced by different professionals, although much of such controversial material never reached Court. The former social worker applied censorship and imposed non-disclosure of minutes of some professionals meeting by means of solicitor instructions. The reasoning given was that it 'could compromise working relationship with mother'.</p>

	      <p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">There then developed two systems running in opposition. The court in Taunton made orders requiring the mother to make TD available for contact. Orders were backed with penal notices directed at the mother. The NSPCC and the social worker in Surrey gave support to the mother on the basis that the allegations were true. The case was not returned to the court for a fact finding hearing. The opposing systems continued to run in counter-measure. It is for that reason that, as soon as I came to deal with directions in the case, I ordered a fact finding hearing. The effect of this opposing approach has been that the father has been overlooked in the professional dealings of those concerned in Surrey. The mother has faced penal orders from the court (and threats of residence transfers) in Taunton whilst hearing her fears of abuse reinforced by some of those professionally involved in Surrey. The children's words have been interpreted without any proper professional enquiry. The children have been nurtured in the belief that the father has sexually abused them and that the paternal grandmother has also abused them and failed to protect them. I think that the mother, father and children have been left in an impossible position by reason of the inadequacies of this system. The case should have been returned to the court for a proper fact finding hearing on evidence months ago. I have read (and re-read) the relevant passages from the Cleveland report (pages 204 to 214) and the Orkney reports (pages 272, para 15.21 to 275, para 15.32) during the currency of my involvement in these proceedings. I am very well acquainted with the document called 'Achieving Best Evidence', which is an everyday working tool for those who practice within the family justice system. I am conscious of the danger of sounding 'au-dessus de ma gare', adopting the deliberately mistaken French of the playwright, Rattigan. However, I find it very difficult to understand how the history that has emerged reflects that acquired learning;</p>

These included assessments of the personality of both parties and included assessments by an independent social worker as to whether the father had the profile of an abuser. That social worker reported that he did not have such a profile and she filed reports in which she was highly critical of the mother. Evidence was filed on the basis that the case was moving forward into the 'welfare stage', the fact finding exercise having been concluded by the mother's withdrawal. It has been necessary to proceed with great caution in relation to that evidence. Since I have had to return to the fact finding stage, I have not placed any reliance upon those assessments, save insofar as they provide some background and uncontroversial information about the parties. I referred to the case of <span style="font-style:italic">CB and JB (minors) (care proceedings: case conduct), Re</span> [1998] 2 FCR 313, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 2 FLR 211" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 2 FLR 211</ref> in adopting this approach (i.e. the passage that reads: '(v) Evidence of propensity or a psychiatric or psychological assessment of one of the parties is unlikely to be of any assistance in resolving a purely factual issue. There will in any event be before the court evidence from the local authority and the parents relating to the history of the case and the backgrounds of each of the parents. A psychologist or psychiatrist instructed to undertake an assessment of a parent for the first stage of a split hearing is unlikely to have a complete knowledge of the facts. (vi) Furthermore, such a witness may, as here, express opinions as to propensity or as to responsibility for a child's injuries which are both prejudicial and wrong. The assessment of adult credibility as to the responsibility for a child's injuries (often the critical factual issue) remains the function of the judge. In my judgment, therefore, a psychiatric or psychological assessment of the parties should not be permitted at the first stage of a split trial unless the particular facts of the case demonstrate that such evidence is or is likely to be directly relevant to the factual issue to be tried'). Furthermore, this assessment was by a social worker and not by someone with psychiatric or psychological qualification;</p>

The first such multi-disciplinary case conference was therefore held on 2nd May 2006. It was attended by 20 people, lasted 2 &#189; hours and was described by that social worker as being a very tense meeting.

That expert gave evidence in absolute terms, suggesting that there was no rational alternative suggestion but that the children were making true allegations against the father. Her evidence was manifestly directed to the unbending exposition of that ultimate thesis. She was similarly absolute in her evidence about the reliability of the children's allegations against the paternal grandmother. She based this largely upon her perusal of video recordings of the play-therapy sessions of EB with the NSPCC and some DVD recordings taken by the mother of TD at home. Before she left court and in her presence, I expressed my real concerns about some of the content of what she had said in evidence. The day after she had given evidence she wrote to me personally expressing regret about the quality of her evidence and enclosed a report in which she qualified very heavily much of what she had said.

I fully appreciate that the children's ages make such investigative enquiry extremely difficult. I am well aware of what is said at page 51 of 'Achieving Best Evidence' in relation to interviewing very young children.

Unsurprisingly, the staying contact was a disaster and, I have no doubt, the mother's anxieties lead to intense discussions with TD about whether the father had engaged in sexual abuse during the contact (the mother herself says that she checked TD after each contact visit to see whether he had been abused).

The most that the mother suggests that TD has alleged is that the paternal grandmother pushed the father's fingers off TD's face on one occasion and that TD was hurt in a tunnel when the paternal grandmother was present. The allegations against her concerning EB were delayed by at least two years from the date when she last had relevant access to EB. Those allegations are inherently and profoundly improbable. It is inherently improbable that, having come across her son in an act of abusing a two year child, her son would have continued with that act in the knowledge that his mother was present. It is therefore inherently improbable that she had to pull her son off EB during an act of abuse by her son. Having spent a considerable amount of time analysing this point, I am left of the clear opinion that the allegation against the paternal grandmother is absurd. Nothing in the paternal grandmother's conduct is suggestive of her having witnessed or having been told that EB had been abused by the father. The environment in which the allegation was made adds to its lack of cogency. The allegation emanates first as hearsay evidence from the mother, is reported to the mother's friend at the mother's encouragement and is repeated in the therapeutic environment that I analyse later;</p>

I accept Ms Gargan's submission that there needs to be an assessment of the mother and of the family as a whole and any findings about the mother's actions will have to be reviewed at that stage. My clear present opinion (and subject to anything produced by assessment) is that this mother's anxiety and past trauma have caused her to be unduly receptive to any possibility that her children may be sexually abused. Her hostility to the father by March 2004 made her even more receptive to (and keen to secure) adverse suggestions relating to him. As a result the children have lived in an environment where, without any proper basis, the assumption that they have been abused has been treated as a fact of life. The mother's anxieties and EB's beliefs that she has been abused have been confirmed to them both by some professionals who have worked with them without the basic facts ever being established and without the father and the paternal grandmother ever being properly involved. The mother is therefore not uniquely to blame for what has occurred.</p>

She loves them dearly and is their primary carer. The children obviously have strong attachments to each other. She fears the removal of the children from her if the court makes findings that are hostile to her. On the information that I currently have, I do not envisage such a removal could be in their interests. </p>

First on the list of those who have suffered this must be the children. Second on that list in equal rank must be the father and grandmother. The mother, herself, has also suffered injustice. Superficially it may seem strange to place the mother so firmly on this list. But as this terrible tale is told below I hope that I make it plain why I put her there. EB has received therapy on a false basis and will now believe that she has been abused by the father and, as described, by the paternal grandmother. TD will now believe that he has been abused by the father. It will take a complete shift of mind-set for the mother to accept that the father has not perpetrated abuse; I am not sanguine about whether she will ever do so. </p>

	      <p class="quo" style="margin-left:1in">'The balance of probability standard means that a court is satisfied an event occurred if the court considers that, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely than not. When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability. Fraud is usually less likely than negligence. Deliberate physical injury is usually less likely than accidental physical injury. A stepfather is usually less likely to have repeatedly raped and had non-consensual oral sex with his under age stepdaughter than on some occasion to have lost his temper and slapped her. Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation. Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher. It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established. Ungoed-TD J expressed this neatly in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Dellow's Will Trusts, Lloyds Bank Ltd v Institute of Cancer Research</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1964] 1 All ER 771" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1964">[1964] 1 All ER 771</ref> at 773, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1964] 1 WLR 451" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1964">[1964] 1 WLR 451</ref> at 455: 'The more serious the allegation, the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it.' This substantially accords with the approach adopted in authorities such as the well-known judgment of Morris LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1956] 3 All ER 970" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1956">[1956] 3 All ER 970</ref> at 978, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1957] 1 QB 247" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1957">[1957] 1 QB 247</ref> at 266.

I also have to determine the genuineness of the mother's beliefs that those allegations are true. Of course, in order to fulfil that function I have heard a wide spectrum of evidence. That wide spectrum of evidence has introduced a number of side-issues which have ranged over the whole history of the lives of the father and the mother.

In assisting the court's deliberations on children's testimony, my usual role is two-fold, i.e. in analysing the conduct of the interviewer under ABE guidelines to assess any influence on the child, and secondly, in assessing the child's responses, to present the court with any features associated with veracity and any associated with untruthfulness and or coaching. I should have been more explicit in explaining to the court that the lack of forensic interviews in this matter left me in some difficulty in terms of my usual role'.

It is an issue of basic parenting. I accept the Guardian ad litem's submission that it is ridiculous to suggest otherwise. If a young child hears a primary carer explaining for nine months that another person is bad or dangerous it will come as no surprise that a young child adopts that view.

I have placed it in that context and I regard it to be wholly unreliable. If it were treated as reliable then the grandmother would be implicated in the precise terms of the child's allegations.

Further, she placed it in the context of her suggestion that there was nothing unreliable in what EB had said. Of course the evidence has to be viewed as a whole and it is possible to be circular about which allegation or falsehood is probative of another. For the reasons that I have given I think that it is absolutely certain that I can approach TD's allegations upon the basis that EB's allegations against the grandmother are untrue, even without considering the position of the father. Mrs Robinson therefore did not question the extent to which this might affect the reliability of what TD said (i.e. one child has made serious and false allegations of abuse &#8211; how does that inform one about the likelihood of another child from the same household making another false allegation? Why did EB make this false allegation?)</p>

I have not limited my assessment of her evidence to this point and am not prepared to deal with matters on the basis that my findings might be slotted into her evidence out of convenience.</p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-indent:0.5in">In relation to EB the allegation against the grandmother (part of the 'core', according to the evidence that Mrs Robinson suggested), is plainly untrue. In relation to TD, he cannot have been abused in his mother's house or bed. His mother and EB could not have been present. The allegation concerning the use of a knife during a contact visit that took place in a public place is absurd. There is an inherent improbability in the allegation involving a knife and bleeding going unobserved (both as to its physical and emotional effect) by the child's primary carer.</p>

A significant part of the evidence in this case related to the therapeutic sessions that were carried out by the NSPCC. Much of Mrs Robinson's evidence was directed to this. That evidence has also to be sifted with care. I have referred to it insofar as I think that I need to when dealing with the history of the case. </p>

They may do. They may provide the best or indeed the only evidence on the issue. I regard the issue to be one of weight, on the individual facts of the specific case. I note what is said on this issue at paragraphs 12.36 to 12.39 of the Cleveland Report. In my opinion the recordings of the therapy sessions require extremely careful handling in this case since:</p>

The fact that allegations were made to the mother first (before being repeated to others) severely limits the reliability of what is said to third parties.
