		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Lord Justice Munby &#8230; asks me to point out that the document enclosed with your letter is not the draft Order. It is in fact the final text of the approved Order as it was sent to the parties by the Judge on 20 January 2010. It was sent the same day to the Associate for sealing and, the Judge assumes, has now been sealed. </p>
		  </content>
		</level>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">You refer to paragraphs 135-143 of the judgment, where the Judge explained why he was &#8216;disapplying&#8217; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref>. However, as he made clear in paragraph 137, and again in paragraph 140 (see, for example, the words &#8220;if they wish&#8221;), the decision as to whether the documents should be put into the public domain is one for Mr and Mrs Ward. It was for this reason that paragraph 1 of the Order was expressed as it was, specifically in terms of giving &#8220;the Respondents&#8221; liberty, etc.   </p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The Judge can see that (subject of course to any observations Mr and Mrs Ward may wish to make) there might be advantage in the Order spelling out explicitly that it will not be a contempt of court for anyone to publish documents supplied to them by Mr and Mrs Ward with a view to such publication. That approach, he is inclined to think, is not merely consistent with but would more accurately give effect to his judgment. An amendment along these lines would accordingly be permissible under the &#8216;slip rule&#8217; notwithstanding that the order has been sealed. </p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">However, the form of Order you are proposing goes significantly beyond this and would take the decision to publish entirely out of Mr and Mrs Ward&#8217;s hands. Such an approach is in fact, as the Judge sees it, inconsistent with the judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">None of the views subsequently expressed by anyone gives me any reason to depart from what was said in my letter of 3 February 2010. The problem is to identify the appropriate form of words. With all respect to him, none of Mr Attfield&#8217;s various drafts seems to me to be entirely appropriate, though in saying this I appreciate that he was probably not assisted by what I can now see was the rather unhelpful way in which the third paragraph of my letter had been expressed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to the various points made in the letter of 3 February 2010 there are two further points which, in my judgment, need to be borne in mind:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, paragraph 1 of the order was carefully, and so far as I was concerned deliberately, drafted not in terms of saying that something was or was not a contempt of court but more narrowly in terms of saying that Mr and Mrs Ward were to be at liberty to do various things &#8220;notwithstanding the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref>&#8221;.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Second, and this in fact links in with the first point, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the order contain, as I have pointed out, <span style="font-style:italic">in personam </span>orders imposing certain restrictions upon what Mr and Mrs Ward may publish in relation to the treating clinicians. A third party who, with knowledge of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the order, published documents or information in circumstances prohibited vis-&#224;-vis Mr and Mrs Ward by those paragraphs would, it might be thought, be guilty &#8211; and properly guilty &#8211; of that form of contempt described in <span style="font-style:italic">Z Ltd v A-Z and AA-LL </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1982] QB 558" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">[1982] QB 558</ref>. The wording proposed by Mr Attfield would seemingly exonerate such a third party from liability and, moreover, to take the extreme example, even in circumstances, however unlikely (and from everything I know of them I find it almost inconceivable), where the third party was being deliberately used by Mr and Mrs Ward to do something on their behalf which they could not do themselves. (That would not in fact enable them to escape liability, for <span style="font-style:italic">qui facit per alium facit per se</span>; but there is no reason why, in the kind of case I have postulated, the chosen instrument should be able to do so with impunity.)</p>

Further than that, however, it would not, I think, be proper to go under the &#8216;slip rule&#8217;. If any wider form of proviso or modification to the order of 20 January 2010 is sought, whether by the BBC or by anyone else, there must, as it seems to me, be a formal application to the court setting out some other proper basis for what is sought.</p>
