The retinal damage was first formally diagnosed, following examination, on 21 November 2023.   Following a failed attempt to work with TTN to achieve further assessment and possible treatment, an application for court authorised intervention was issued by the Applicants on 21 December 2023.  Directions were given by Theis J, Vice-President of the Court of Protection, on 9 January 2024 and it was listed before me on 15 January 2024 for further case management, and on 17 January for hearing.  This is an application which has been determined within the meaning of Serious Medical Treatment Guidance <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2020/2" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCOP 2" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCOP 2</ref>.

It is believed that he has no perception of light in that eye, which to the observer (I can confirm) appears cloudy.  Due to the severity and duration of the left retinal detachment, it is not treatable. Currently, the vision in his right eye is extremely limited indeed; he can see at best only light/dark and shadows.  It follows that complete and irreversible loss of vision in his right eye would have particularly serious consequences for him.  He has become effectively virtually blind already, and has become distressed by his loss of sight.</p>

He has further indicated that he wishes the operation to take place to repair the detached retina; he wishes to be able to regain some sight.   However, he opposes the plan for the procedure to take place at the First Applicant&#8217;s hospital King&#8217;s College Hospital, &#8220;for cultural reasons&#8221; and/or because he believes that the hospital has associations with MI5 or MI6.</p>

He has fixed delusional beliefs about the surgical team who has been assembled to perform the operation; he has suggested that they are not qualified to undertake the task, and/or they intend to blind him.  He has expressed a belief that he would be assassinated after the surgery, and that he would only agree to the proposed surgery if this were communicated to him via 'cyberkinetics'.  Dr B is of the view that the strength of TTN&#8217;s delusional beliefs are such that whilst he understands some elements of the relevant information, he dismisses them as being relevant to him.</p>

It is the expert view (essentially unchallenged) that TTN cannot use or weigh the relevant information because his strong delusional beliefs about the characteristics of the hospital, and the qualifications of the surgical team, and their malign intentions towards him, prevent him from doing so.</p>

The anaesthetist told me that TTN would be told that this was his usual intramuscular injection (the administration of this would therefore be covert) and he would be likely to co-operate; Dr B considers that TTN should in fact be told the truth if he specifically asks about the nature of the injection (but she believes that he will not ask).  If he is told about the Ketamine, he will be advised that this is to make him drowsy (again Dr B believes that TTN is unlikely to challenge this).  Ketamine is a rapid onset sedation, although while sedated he will maintain his own airway function. Sedation carries a small risk of allergy or anaphylactic reaction but this is not clinically significant.</p>

It is reasonable to assume that there would need to be post-operative checkups.  The crucial period is the first month post-operatively.  If the retina does not detach again in this period the overall prognosis is reasonable.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.49in">Significantly, there is limited if any risk to TTN&#8217;s existing vision <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>; frankly, there is a considerable risk that TTN will go completely blind without intervention.  TTN has extremely limited vision now, and it is only going to get worse.  It was pretty clear to me that this is a once-and-for-all final attempt to afford him some vision for the balance of his life.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr A was clear that the decision to proceed with surgery is &#8220;not &#8230; straightforward&#8221;.  Indeed, if it were the case that TTN had better or good vision in his left eye, Dr A explained that he would not in fact consider let alone recommend the retinal repair of the right eye.  But this is effectively the last chance to save some level of vision for TTN, and therefore in the view of Dr A it is a risk worth taking.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">TTN&#8217;s own views on the issues before me are complex, but consistently he has said that he wishes to have improved sight.  He knows that he needs an operation to restore his sight.  <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">He has sought to impose conditions in relation to treatment (in particular the location of the procedure) and choice of consultant (to be achieved through cyberkinetics), but these are the product of his delusional belief system.  I take as TTN&#8217;s constant position that he wishes to be more independent, and his poor vision is inhibiting this.  I further note that TTN&#8217;s brother is keen for TTN to have the operation and is believed to be supportive of the application.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Implicit in the plan for TTN is that he will, in different ways, need to be deprived of his liberty.  There is reason to believe that he will be resistant to being conveyed to hospital for the purposes of the procedure; he needs to be sedated.  It is not envisaged that he will need to be physically restrained.  I have reviewed the &#8216;Treatment and Transfer Plans&#8217;, and am satisfied that the ground is well covered in those documents.  I agree with Ms Scott in her submission that the physical and chemical restraint that will inevitably be required to get TTN to King&#8217;s College Hospital and keep him there, is required for the purpose of facilitating the safe performance of the ophthalmic surgery and is not &#8216;treatment for mental disorder in a hospital&#8217; as provided for in paragraph 4 of Schedule 1A.  Therefore specific provision needs to be made for this in this order and /or associated plan.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There is a marginal dispute about what TTN should be told and when.  There is some concern on the part of the Applicants that TTN should not be told until after the procedure about the outcome of this hearing.  The Official Solicitor is concerned about this and feels that TTN should (if he asks) be told the truth.  The Official Solicitor is somewhat less concerned that TTN is to be misled about the administration</span> of sedation medication given that with sedation he is less likely to need restraint and this becomes therefore the least restrictive option.  I am of the view that the Applicants should avoid as far as possible actively misleading TTN, but where it is necessary to do so in order to achieve this outcome in the least restrictive way, then this in my judgment can be permitted.  For the avoidance of doubt, I am of the view that TTN should be told after the event (at the latest) that the procedure has been authorised by the court.</p>
