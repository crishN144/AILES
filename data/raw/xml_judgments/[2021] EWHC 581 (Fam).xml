It is a decision of Theis J.

Albania was not a member state of BIIa but was a party to the 1996 Convention.   She held that the effect of Article 61 was to prevent the operation of Article 8 of the 1996 Convention as &#8220;the Regulation acts to provide for jurisdiction only to be exercised under the Regulation...&#8221;  I noted that Theis J was not referred to Article 62 of BIIa which sets out the scope of Article 61 nor did she hear full argument.

Although Article 61(a) suggests that as between BIIa and the 1996 Convention where the child has her habitual residence in a Member State then BIIa shall apply.

She said that the withdrawal agreement had not intended that Articles 61 and 62 BIIa should apply after the end of the transition period although she accepted that Article 8(1)(a) of the Jurisdiction and Judgments (Family) Amendment etc (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 meant that BIIa continues to apply in these proceedings.  Her argument in relation to this was dealt with very briefly by Mr Gration for the mother and Ms Perrins for the guardian.  Ms Chaudhry&#8217;s argument was not a reason why this court decided to give primacy to the 1996 Convention. </p>

The difficulty consists therefore in determining the temporal threshold from which jurisdiction would pass from the authorities of the State from which the child has been wrongfully removed, to those of the country to which he or she has been taken or in which he or she has been retained&#8221;. </p>

Article 7 requires that jurisdiction is retained by the country of habitual residence immediately before the child was wrongfully removed.  The lack of ability to transfer jurisdiction in wrongful removal cases is supported by a reading of the Article as well as the Explanatory Notes written by the Rapporteur M. Lagarde.  The Practical Handbook is not binding on this court.  It was written 20 years afterwards and although in one example it contradicts the narrow construction of Article 7 it generally supports the principle that jurisdiction is not transferred for reasons of policy. </p>

Her closest connections are there.  There will need to be assessments of the family and child before any final determination of welfare is made, that would be more appropriately done in Switzerland.  A Swiss social worker is allocated to her. A child psychologist sees her once a week.  Her doctors, dentists and teachers are in Switzerland.  The Swiss court is about to decide on competence and therefore is seized of proceedings in relation to A.  Orders in relation to contact have been made in the Swiss court.  Child protection services have been involved in her life in Switzerland and A has a court appointed guardian.  The parents both had lawyers in Switzerland and the mother will have a court appointed interpreter.  Jurisdiction in Switzerland would avoid conflicting orders and determinations in respect of the child. Earlier stays were correctly granted by the High Court whilst the 1980 proceedings were determined in Switzerland.   </p>

Ms Perrins and Mr Gration suggest that I should exercise my discretion and not transfer the case.  The question of &#8216;better placed&#8217; is about forum.  The guardian relies on the following: the background facts prior to removal all occurred in England.  The mother is British, and the family have lived with A in England.  The English court would be best place to weigh up the significance of the private law proceedings in relation to the half-siblings.  The guardian relies on the language barriers for the mother if the case were to be heard in Switzerland.  The father speaks fluent English and would not face such barriers in this jurisdiction.  There would be more delay in Switzerland, with the expert suggesting a delay of 9 to 12 months before the proceedings are finalized.   </p>

The factual background to the abduction is relevant to a consideration of A&#8217;s best interests, it would be concerning if the mother&#8217;s unilateral actions in abducting A were to be endorsed which they would be if jurisdiction were to be transferred to Switzerland.  The mother does not show insight into the harm the abduction will have caused A who was being breast fed by her primary carer at the time of the abduction.   </p>

In my judgment, the courts here are better placed to determine A&#8217;s best interests.  One of the most important aspects of the proceedings may well be the mother&#8217;s care of her older children particularly the youngest three.  The proceedings concerning the boys have been on-going for some time, there is a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> report prepared which would need to be considered in any proceedings in relation to A.  In Switzerland the report was considered out of context without the surrounding statements of the mother and the father of the half-siblings.  These may prove to be significant when disputed allegations are being made by the mother and the father of A against each other.   </p>

The expert on Swiss law says there could be delay of up to one year before the proceedings are concluded in Switzerland.  This is a very young child, who was abducted by her father nine months ago, her living arrangements should be determined much sooner than that.  These and the other factors relied on by Ms Perrins and Mr Gration would lead me not to exercise any discretion I might have under Article 8 to transfer these proceedings to Switzerland. </p>

He says that proceedings are not continuing in Switzerland so as to give this court a discretion to stay these proceedings.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgement Mr Gration is right.  There is no power to stay in this Article 7 case.  The only power under the 1996 Convention is that set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/5/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5(2)</ref>(d) which refers to Article 8.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/5/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 5(2)</ref>(d) excludes the operation of other parts of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/5/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5(2)</ref>.  Any other interpretation would mean that although the 1996 Convention restricts transfer after a wrongful removal under Article 7, the domestic legislation was drafted to get around this.  I accept that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/5/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5(2)</ref>(d) emphasis the separate nature of the proceedings when the 1996 Convention is involved.  This is reinforced by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref>(3AA).  The Family Law Act distinguishes between two separate jurisdictional schemes.  I find I have no power to transfer under the Family Law Act and if I did, I would exercise my discretion and not transfer these proceedings. </p>
