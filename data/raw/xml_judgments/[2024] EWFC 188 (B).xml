I heard this case over 4 days from 29 January to 1 February 2024 and reserved judgment. The husband was represented by Mr Richard Buswell as direct access counsel and the wife by Ms Tara Lyons of counsel. I had before me 2 bundles, a core bundle comprising 654 pages and a supplemental bundle comprising 722 pages. I described the case as bristling with issues and that a four-day time estimate was unlikely to be sufficient. Even with very limited reading time allowed, I was proved right and there was inadequate time to consider and give judgment, closing submissions ending in the afternoon of the 4</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> day.</span></p>

In addition to the valuation evidence, there was also expert evidence from a planning expert and from an accountant in relation to CGT. I was not required to hear oral evidence from those experts. I also heard lengthy oral evidence from the husband and less lengthy evidence from the wife.</span></p>

One of the issues I have to decide relates to the validity of that agreement, which the husband seeks to uphold and which the wife claims is unfair and should not be relied upon.

The husband&#8217;s case was that both he and the wife came from wealthy backgrounds. The wife was the only child and had an expectation of a significant inheritance from her parents. He too would receive an inheritance in due course. He claimed that the initiative for the PNA came from both of them, with the objective of each protecting their own inheritances. In his section 25 statement he stated, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;After proposing marriage, both KD and I were adamant that we wanted a prenuptial agreement to protect assets that we had and future inheritance&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The wife disputed this and stated that initiative came entirely from the husband who made it very clear that this was non-negotiable and was a prerequisite to them getting married. She says that the whole process was extremely rushed and that she was subject to undue pressure amounting to an Edgar vitiating factor.</span></p>

But unconscionable conduct such as undue pressure (falling short of duress) will also be likely to eliminate the weight to be attached to the agreement and other unworthy conduct, such as exploitation of a dominant position to secure an unfair advantage, would reduce or eliminate it. The court may take into account a party&#8217;s emotional state, and what pressures he or she was under to agree. But that again cannot be considered in isolation from what would have happened had he or she not been under those pressures. The circumstances of the parties at the time of the agreement will be relevant. Those will include such matters as their age and maturity, whether either or both had been married or been in long-term relationships before. For such couples their experience of previous relationships may explain the terms of the agreement and may also show what they foresaw when they entered into the agreement What may not be easily foreseeable for less mature couples may well be in contemplation of more mature couples. Another important factor may be whether the marriage would have gone ahead without an agreement or without the terms which had been agreed. This may cut either way.&#8217;</span></p>

The husband owned a flat at Flat 5, 75, EC, EC, where the parties were living at the time of the marriage. He also owned a property at 1, LM. Shortly after the marriage, the wife sold her property and provided capital of &#163;75,000 to the husband to invest in the redevelopment of 17 SR which was purchased in the name of his company SE (London)Ltd in February 2014 for &#163;961,000. There was a loan agreement dated 13 December 2013 to reflect this advance. The husband then proposed that instead of repayment of the loan, he would transfer Flat 5 into joint names and the wife would obtain an interest. By this time the parties had occupied Flat 5 as their home for a number of years. The husband drew up a property ownership agreement dated 9 April 2014 which gave the wife a 13% beneficial interest in the gross value of the property. There is a calculation which purports to explain how this percentage was reached which is not clear to me but which was not explored in evidence. Ms Lyons says the percentage was unfair even on resulting trust principles but I do not need to determine this. This was simply another example of the husband treating financial dealings between the parties as if they were parties to a commercial transaction. His approach could not be more removed from a sharing approach as parties to a marriage. Another document was entered into terminating the loan of &#163;75,000.</span></p>

I pointed out to the husband that he was not entitled to present a picture to the revenue authorities which was untrue and incorrect, in other words, he could not run two horses, on the one hand claiming that the wife had no beneficial interest but on the other hand claiming to the Revenue that she had a 50% interest. Further he could not unilaterally override the Declaration of Trust.

The husband produced a further Declaration of Trust for the first time with his witness statement dated 1 July 2021, by which he purported to assign 100% of the beneficial interest in 2b to EP. Ms Lyons makes the same point that he cannot unilaterally alter the beneficial interest. On this occasion, the husband did not concede that the wife had an equal share and relied upon calculations showing her to be entitled to a 6% beneficial interest only which had been carried through from her interest in EC.</span></p>

He alleges his father loaned him monies towards the purchase. The wife says she was never told by the husband about any loans, other than a much earlier loan in 2013. The husband has produced 4 identical loan agreements each headed &#8220;Unsecured Loan Agreement&#8221;, whereby his father is alleged to have loaned him monies to purchase or develop investment properties. The only difference is the trigger event for repayment, depending on which property was involved. At this stage the only previous loan made by the husband&#8217;s father was in October 2013 whereby he loaned him &#163;350,000 to purchase a property in CR. It is not disputed that this loan was repaid. The earlier loan document looks very different from the 4 subsequent loan agreements. The earlier loan was made by the father&#8217;s company M of Hong Kong and is on the company&#8217;s headed paper. It was for a period of 12 months at 4.55% interest per annum. The 4 later loans carry the same interest rate as the original 2013 loan. </span></p>

He has been dishonest in his dealings with the revenue, on his case, putting properties into joint names when he claims the wife to have no beneficial interest, in order to reduce his tax liabilities. He has been thoroughly cavalier in relation to the planning authorities resulting in enforcement notices and wasted expenditure.

The timing of the negotiations, the timing of the signing itself as well as the husband&#8217;s clear position that he would not marry her without it all point to that conclusion. I accept that the wife was a mature intelligent person at the time of the signing of the PNA but find that there was an imbalance of power in the relationship and that the husband, even then, was a controlling force within it. I find that the wife felt that she had no alternative, even in the face of the misgivings of her solicitor. I further find that the terms of the agreement itself were unfair and did not provide for the wife&#8217;s needs. There was no obligation in the agreement as drafted that any marital assets acquired by either party should be shared equally or at all and the husband exploited this clause to the hilt in his dealings with the wife. Further, as Ms Lyons argued, a property developer often builds up a portfolio from a core property or properties which might be pre-marital properties. The only clause related to income and capital provision for a child referred to mediation. There was a trigger event provided to review after the birth of the child but this was not acted upon. The agreement gave the husband full licence to conduct himself financially as he did and the upshot was that there would be wholly inadequate provision for the wife and child if the agreement were upheld. This is well evidenced by the husband&#8217;s offer based upon the PNA. Finally, there is the husband&#8217;s own concession in his narrative statement that the agreement did not provide for the wife&#8217;s and child&#8217;s reasonable needs.</span></p>

Further, it is not in dispute that the 2013 loan was in fact repaid with interest. The husband also described his father as a tough, self-made businessman, the inference being that he would apply strict standards to his children to make their own way and not expect to be able to rely on parental largesse. The oddities about the appearance and some of the contents of the loan agreements, such as the identical interest rates throughout from 2013, do not take the wife much further if her case is not that they are fabrications. A significant omission is the absence of any evidence from the husband&#8217;s father, which I would have expected. The court is entitled, in my view to draw inferences from that lack of evidence. There is also what is, in my view, a significant factor that during closing submissions Mr Buswell was very insistent that his client was given time to raise money to pay the wife&#8217;s lump sum before there was a sale of any of the assets. As he claims to have no reserves whatsoever, the clear inference must be that there is money coming from elsewhere. The fact that the wife states she was never told of any loans except the 2013 one is a relevant consideration. None of these factors, even taken cumulatively, however, necessarily prove the case that the loans were a gift. As HHJ Hess states, for an advance of money to be a gift there must be evidence of an intention to give &#8211; the animus donandi.</span></p>

This would be entirely in keeping with his actions throughout. Once the funds were in his sole account, the pressure was off to transfer them back to his father and it may be that other events did supervene to delay that transfer. But this does not prove that the money was a gift. I have come to the conclusion that the wife has not made out her case that the loan monies were a gift and the fact that the tough businessman father might distinguish between gifts and loans is not inherently implausible. However, the money was available for the redevelopment of 7, KM in 2021 and I find on the balance of probabilities there is no reason to think it will not be made available again once these proceedings are over. </span></p>

I accept that, firstly, the arrest may have knocked him for six, secondly, he has since been heavily involved in two acrimonious sets of proceedings and thirdly, he has been quite heavily involved in the management of the rental properties at SG, as well as a number of planning issues. Nevertheless 2.5 years have elapsed since these events and I would have expected him to have made a greater start on developing one or both of the property schemes.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I then have to determine whether the loans are soft or hard loans. I find that all the loans are soft loans. There is little doubt that the father did not need these monies paid back as the timescale for repayment on all of them is tied in to completion or sale of the developments and could extend to years. I understand it was many years before the 2013 loan was finally paid back. I also am influenced by the insistence on giving the husband time to raise any lump sum as this strongly suggests that there are resources behind the scene. The husband he did speak of potentially being able to find an equity partner (which could of course be his father). I do not find that the husband&#8217;s father, even if he is tough, would insist on repayment of these loans if it were to cause his son real hardship and undermine his property development business. Even if a loan is a soft loan I have a discretion whether to leave it out of the computation table. I consider, given the extent of the father&#8217;s wealth and all the other circumstances I have described, that these soft loans are of the softest variety and should be omitted from the computation table. The &#163;729,000 returned in July 2021 should be added in as I find on the balance of probabilities it would still be available for the proposed development of KM. </span></p>

I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence that her parents have concerns about their present and future health needs and that they do expect the loan to be repaid with interest. However, I consider that there is likely to be some flexibility about timing for repayment and that they would not want to cause their daughter hardship. I entirely take on board Ms Lyons&#8217; point that the wife should not be treated any less favourably because she has had to obtain a loan from family when the husband has had the means to obtain a commercial loan, which would be included in the computation table. I consider that this loan should be included in the computation table, albeit that it is a soft loan in terms of time for repayment. It is, in my view, a far less soft loan than the loans from the husband&#8217;s father.</span></p>

Ms Lyons submitted this represented a resource which would be available in the foreseeable future. She raised a further argument that the monies already spent on the development of some &#163;423,528.48 representing stamp duty, planning costs and litigation etc should be added back in as the court should be evaluating what the husband would actually receive in his hands in 2 years&#8217; time.

He is a &#8220;details&#8221; man as evidenced by his documentation in these proceedings. He clearly loves his chosen career. Currently he claims to be in very straitened circumstances as there is no development currently in play and he is living on the rental income less the mortgages and other expenses. He has been squeezed by the increase in interest rates. I have already referred to the delay in developing LM/KM as a device to minimise the husband&#8217;s assets before the court. Nevertheless we are where we are.</span></p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The husband has produced a schedule of rents and outgoings. It shows rental income as &#163;33,249 pm and mortgage payments of &#163;26,818.66pm, taking into account the new mortgages on 1 and 2 LM. Business expenses amount to &#163;3,726.10 pm, excluding cashflow to pay suppliers of &#163;2000 pm, as there are no active development projects on foot at the moment and the husband will be looking for development finance. This produces a balance of &#163;2,704.24 pm. The figures for repairs taken at &#163;1,500 pm and various office expenses at &#163;500 will be variable so this figure is the bare minimum. The wife makes two main points about these figures. Firstly, she says it is no coincidence that the husband has gone onto expensive variable rate mortgages after fixed terms have expired on the jointly owned properties. He responds that his and the companies&#8217; financial health was far better when he took out the mortgage on FG. In addition there was the wife&#8217;s income to assist. He cannot get another buy to let mortgage or a second mortgage on FG. Secondly, the wife says the husband&#8217;s lifestyle is inconsistent with someone in dire financial straits. He bought a Tesla car when they separated, goes on frequent holidays and spends on quality clothing and other non-necessities. The husband claims to live frugally and it is correct he has let out his office space at SR, has increased the rents there and has taken a lodger in 1 FG. He says he &#8220;piggy-backs&#8221; on family holidays albeit that he is still paying for flights himself. Whilst I understand the wife&#8217;s scepticism, I am not able to find the husband has deliberately gone onto more expensive mortgages. This would be cutting off his nose to spite his face, particularly where he has made other economies, and it may be the case that his financial health is poorer than when he took out the mortgages. Having said that some of his spending patterns particularly on holidays do not fit with someone who is in such straitened circumstances and it is likely that family help is permitting some non-essential expenditure. I find that the husband&#8217;s income will increase significantly once the developments at LM and KM are completed in the next 1-2 years. Although he produced no mortgage capacity evidence and simply declared he did not have one, that is probably the position in his current circumstances. I find that his net income from rentals, before tax, currently is far nearer his case than that of the wife who makes insufficient allowance for expenditure. It is probably in the region of &#163;3000-&#163;3,500 pm. I find his financial situation will be transformed when the developments are completed and mortgages discharged and he will have a mortgage capacity of greater than the wife&#8217;s mortgage capacity, although it is impossible to determine at this point.</span></p>

She has been living on her now depleted savings together with support from her parents. She has been actively looking for work and has made numerous job applications without success. I found the wife to be highly intelligent, articulate and very personable. She would, in my view, make a very positive impression on any potential employer. She is now 50, however, and there are gaps in her CV when she has not worked or worked only on a very part-time basis. It is also well-known that the charity sector has suffered as a result of first, Covid and now the cost of living crisis. She may have to spread her net wider and look for work allied to her skills, such as in marketing outside the charity sector. I accept that it is reasonable currently for her to work 80% of full-time hours. Although she has A with her for 8 days out of 14, she does 10 school runs per week. I accept her salary bracket with be about &#163;48,000 pa gross. However, I consider it would be reasonable for her to be working full-time by the time A is 11 and starting secondary school. I consider the time scale of 12 months she puts on securing a job and, therefore 18 months before she can apply for a mortgage could be abbreviated to some extent. I consider she should be able to find a job within 6 months of March this year when the job market revives after the &#8220;dead&#8221; months of January and February, which means she should have secured a job by September 2024 and she should be able to secure a mortgage by March 2025. I accept her mortgage capacity evidence that her mortgage capacity will then be &#163;216,000. </span></p>

Both will also need to rent for the next 1 to 2 years, the wife to secure a mortgage capacity and the husband, if FG is sold, pending the property developments coming to fruition. The husband initially produced particulars for very small 2-bedroomed flats for &#163;400,000 - &#163;430,000 for the wife which were patently unsuitable. The wife provided property particulars for 3-bedroomed house in the area of 1 FG in the region of &#163;1.8m for herself which I considered would probably exceed the housing figure the court would allow. I permitted both parties to produce further particulars. The husband produced 3 bed-roomed properties in the region of &#163;900,000 which the wife said had no outside space and were towards the Munster village part of Fulham where it was not particularly safe. She produced further particulars in the region of &#163;1.6m. I find that the parties have similar housing needs in the order of &#163;1,600,000 to purchase a 3 bedroomed property in the vicinity of 1 FG with some outside space.</span></p>

In my view the payments to the wife after that should be structured in such a way as to enable the developments to proceed and the wife receive her second lump sum from the proceeds of the 1 FG. I consider that 1, FG should be sold as soon as the works are done, which I estimate as 6 months&#8217; time. I consider that part of the soft loan which I have taken into account from the husband&#8217;s father, namely, the &#163;729,783 he returned could be deployed for this purpose. Because of the strong desirability of severing financial ties as soon as possible and reducing the risk of disputes about enforcement, I consider the wife should receive the bulk of the net proceeds.  Six months will also be the time period for raising funds to buy the wife out. In default, the property should be sold. If there is no sale, the net equity should allow for deduction of the latent CGT and the husband should then indemnify the wife against all liability. The balance of the lump sum should be paid when the development of either LM or KM is completed or within 24 months whichever first occurs. If the balance is not paid there will be an order for sale of the LM development or such part of it as is sufficient to discharge the balance. The transfer of the wife&#8217;s interest in SR and 2b LM should occur simultaneously with the payment of the second lump sum. The husband should indemnify her in relation to her CGT liability on SR as the net equity has been calculated net of CGT. </span></p>

There is a strong steer towards a clean break. The wife has the care of A for only just over half the time and I have found she will be able to work full-time by the time he is 11. I also take fully into account that of the assets going to the husband, some &#163;848,315 are comprised of soft debts rather than marital assets and I have also allowed for the repayment of the &#163;729,783 the husband returned to his father, another soft debt. I do not find he has the ability to pay spousal maintenance for the next two years in any event. Although his earning capacity when the developments are completed is difficult to assess, the wife will be moving into full-time work at that stage. It would be my expectation that he will also be paying some or all of the school fees again. He should certainly be paying a more realistic sum for A but that is outside my jurisdiction. There is therefore no case for capitalised maintenance. I find the &#163;100,000 or so the husband will receive from the sale of 1FG, together with his rental income will enable him to rent a property similar to that rented by the wife and to meet his outgoings for the next 2 years, after which he will be in a position to purchase a similar property from a combination of the balance of the equity in the investment properties, the development profit from the sale of LM/KM and the soft loans.</span></p>
