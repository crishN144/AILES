It must be borne in mind that multiple moves (such as have occurred for [K]) can only increase her sense of loss and reduce her hope that there is someone and somewhere she can feel safe and secure.

The records have many references to the extent the placement breakdowns have caused K emotional harm. In their referral for a psychological report in 2014, some three years after K has been in the LA&#8217;s care, the reason for a different picture at school emerged. As the record of the meeting notes </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;&#8230;[K] has learnt to cope by withdrawing emotionally and functioning independently whilst maintaining control over her environment. This works well at school and when she first enters into a new placement. However, this coping strategy breaks down at home as she starts to settle and get close to the foster carer&#8230;&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> To illustrate this Mr Hall relies on the report to the LA review in January 2014 concerning K&#8217;s third foster placement with Mr and Mrs T. The social work report for the review notes that K was happy and beginning to form an attachment to the foster carer, but as it was an agency placement the LA, as a matter of policy, were unable to sanction this placement as a long term placement. The report notes that this lack of certainty in the placement was impacting on K&#8217;s emotional well-being. This view was endorsed in a letter dated 15 May 2014 from CAMHS and it went further in stating </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;It must be borne in mind that multiple moves (such as have occurred for [K]) can only increase her sense of loss and reduce her hope that there is someone and somewhere she can feel safe and secure. It is not surprising she displays very challenging behaviours, she must feel enraged and despairing.&#8217;</span></p>

He submits on the LA&#8217;s own records K suffered from instability from spending so long in foster care, with only her mother having parental responsibility and no clear direction. K&#8217;s current social worker Ms A sets out in her statement in support of these proceedings </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;It is envisaged that a care order will also support [K] in terms of feelings of security and stability, as she has historically struggled to understand the decisions made by her mother, and therefore she will know that there will be a level of oversight to her care planning&#8217;.</span></p>

The repeated failures by the LA to follow through their own decisions would have been subject to effective scrutiny, by the guardian, her legal representative and the court. The issue was repeatedly flagged up by the LA from March 2012, but not followed through. Had K been represented in court proceedings, there would have been proper oversight, the plans would not have been allowed to drift and assessments would have been undertaken when required. Whilst K&#8217;s mother did not raise any complaints at the time about how K was cared for by the LA, she had not been able to provide consistent and predictable care for K before 2011, K&#8217;s mother had her own mental health difficulties, she was inconsistent in her attendance at LAC reviews and her contact was gradually reduced to the extent she was only seeing K once during each school holiday. Mr Hall submits it is difficult to see how she could be regarded as someone who was proactively exercising her parental responsibility in relation to K.</span></p>

On their own admission in the evidence the LA filed in 2015 in support of the care proceedings, a care order would provide the stability that K clearly required. The delay of over three years in doing so is not justified in any way. That delay meant K was denied access to an independent guardian and her own legal representation, in circumstances where the LA were not implementing their own decisions about her and the only person with PR was not exercising it in a proactive way. K&#8217;s article 6 and 8 rights were compromised by this significant delay.</span></p>

Alternatively, a legal planning meeting to consider starting care proceedings may be appropriate for another child. In any event, this decision should be taken pro-actively by the local authority in consultation with parents and the child, and should be the subject of rigorous review by the IRO with a robust care planning process, whatever the child&#8217;s age or situation. The importance of the IRO as a check and balance for the looked after child cannot be overstated, especially as the IRO role (set out in the IRO handbook) is &#8216;to consider the legal status of the child, for example where the child is looked after under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20</ref>&#8217;.

She submits the LA have not taken an unreasonable stance. In any event, the LA should not be responsible for the cost of the proceedings, merely as a device to avoid the full impact of the statutory charge. She submits there are discrete costs concerning the HRA application.</span></p>

Against that I have determined that the HRA claim succeeds, I rejected the submissions of the LA and made an award of damages. In the circumstances of this case, where the breaches continued for such a long period of time, I have reached the conclusion the LA should pay K&#8217;s costs of the HRA application only, but which will include the full costs of the hearing on 29 March 2016, as the only reason that hearing could not proceed was due to the late disclosure by the LA on that day of relevant documents. I will make no order for costs as between M and the LA.</span></p>
