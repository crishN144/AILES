Permission was refused. On 30th December, I heard a further application by the birth family for me to reverse my decision and I gave judgment the following day. I found that, contrary to the submissions of the birth family, that very sadly RS was more ill than he was when I had dealt with the case a fortnight earlier and was not recovering as the birth family sought to argue. The Court of Appeal once again refused permission to appeal. </p>

No application is made either by the birth family or by the Government of the Republic of Poland to the Court for me to make any order, and effectively, the Court process would appear to be at an end. There is no reason to suppose that RS is receiving anything other than optimal care and no reason to think that his interests are not being properly safeguarded in every way.  </p>

The right to visit is in respect of those in prison, custody and detention, which quite plainly does not extend to those in hospital. The idea that the Consul General is under a duty or has the right to check the treatment of every citizen of his country in a NHS hospital would clearly be unsustainable.  </p>

Dr S has had an involvement in this case. I do not think he could be described properly as an entirely independent participant; but the exercise that he wishes to carry out inevitably will suffer from the disadvantages, even if not to the same extent, that I was so critical of in respect of Dr Pullicino.  </p>

And, I look at that against the background of the evidence that I have received from those who have been treating RS now for over 2 months. I have no reason at all to doubt the evidence that I have received from them.  </p>

In reaching that decision, I do not accept that I am impeding the Republic of Poland or the Consul General in the execution of or complying with his Vienna Convention rights/obligations in any way.  </p>
