The first is by a grandmother under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(9)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> for permission to apply for either a Special Guardianship Order or a Child Arrangements Order with respect to a child (H) who is now seven months old.  The second is an application by the local authority under the inherent jurisdiction for permission not to carry out any assessment of her as a possible carer.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0in">The baby&#8217;s parents are not married, and only the mother has parental responsibility. They met at university and were in a relatively early stage of their relationship when the mother discovered that she was pregnant &#8211; not just that but she was 34 weeks pregnant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0in">This was a surprise and terrible shock to them. For many, if not most people, the impending arrival of a baby is one of life&#8217;s greatest gifts. For others, who have not planned it and are not at the right stage of life, it is extremely difficult if not frightening.  To be a parent is a great privilege but it is also a huge responsibility.   Some parents facing an unplanned baby adjust to, welcome and then love the child as much as any planned arrival.  Others, however, do not feel that they can offer the child the love and care that he or she deserves.   Many women in such circumstances (if they discover the pregnancy early enough) will seek terminations.   There were over 200,000 terminations in the UK in 2019. Others will look to have the baby adopted.  There may be a category of such parents who place the baby with a family member, although such a course of action will mean the retention of their ultimate legal status as a parent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0in">In this case both these parents decided that they were unable to take on the responsibility of being a parent at this stage of their lives, and that in those circumstances the best choice they could make was for H to be adopted.  They approached the local authority before the birth and had a number of meetings with the social worker.  The social worker also met the mother&#8217;s family (who were supportive of the decision). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0in">Upon hearing from the grandmother the social worker spoke to the parents again. They were adamant that the baby should not be placed with her.  The father said that his mother was a single parent with depression, unemployed and living in social housing.  The parents were very upset at the grandmother&#8217;s request and asked the local authority not to assess her as a potential carer &#8211; or indeed to share any further details of what was happening with her.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0in">The grandmother in turn was also distressed and there was an exchange of numerous messages between herself and the parents. The grandmother simply could not understand the decision that these parents were making. She wondered whether it could be that the baby was not her son&#8217;s. She also believed that the decision was one that was made in haste and in a situation of stress, and believed that her son would later bitterly regret the decision he had made.  She stated in the messages that she was more than willing to bring up the baby until they were ready.  The mother tried to explain in her messages in response that they had thought about a family placement but did not think that would be the best for the baby. As the messages demonstrated that the parents continued to be firm about the decision they had made, the paternal grandmother consulted a solicitor.   </p>

The application stated that the parents did not want any assessments of family members to be carried out, and the authority was in agreement with this because it did not consider it to be in the best interests of the baby given the strong opposition to it by the parents.  This application was followed by another under the inherent jurisdiction asking the court to make a declaration that it was lawful for the local authority not to assess the paternal grandmother.  </p>

In one of the cases there was a clash between the wishes of the parents on the one hand which were for the child to be adopted in England and the Hungarian authorities and of the child&#8217;s Guardian on the other, which were for the child to be sent to Hungary and placed for adoption there.  Baker J concluded that in a case where the parents were consenting to an adoption, the approval of the court did not depend on the local authority or the court concluding that &#8216;nothing else will do&#8217;, because the degree of interference with family life rights was less than when the parent child relationship was severed against their wishes. In paragraph 55 he stated; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Instead, they must approach the case by applying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. making sure that they give paramount consideration to the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his or her life, allocating such weight as they consider appropriate to the comprehensive list of factors within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref>. In such cases, the local authority and the court must consider the parents&#8217; wishes that their child be adopted in the context of all those factors, including the child&#8217;s background, the likely effect on the child of having ceased to be a member of the original family and the ability and willingness of any of the child&#8217;s relatives to meet the child&#8217;s needs.  As in the case of step-parent adoptions, the manner in which the statutory provisions are applied will depend upon the facts of each case and the assessment of proportionality&#8221;</span>.  In paragraph 56 he stated &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">It follows therefore that in all adoption cases &#8211; non consensual and consensual &#8211; the local authority is under an obligation to carry out a thorough analysis of the realistic options for the child as highlighted in Re B-S.

At paragraphs 89 onwards, he set out the principles which should apply when a parent wishes to relinquish a baby confidentially without notice to other family members.  One particular factor in the balancing exercise to be conducted is the likelihood of a family placement being a realistic alternative to adoption.  At paragraph 89(4) he stated &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">This is of particular importance to the child&#8217;s lifelong welfare as it may determine whether or not adoption is necessary. An objective view, going beyond the say-so of the person seeking confidentiality, should be taken about whether a family member may or may not be a potential carer.  Where a family placement is unlikely to be worth investigating or where notification may cause significant harm to those notified, this factor will speak in favour of maintaining confidentiality, anything less than that and it will point the other way&#8217;</span>.  </p>

They had a meeting to discuss their respective views but ultimately no agreement was achieved. The grandmother consulted a solicitor, and issued her application on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September.

Given the life-long consequences for H if adopted, the change of status and the interference with H&#8217;s Article 8 rights, it is imperative that the court obtains the information that an assessment would provide as to the grandmother&#8217;s proposals.

The nature of the proposed application is for either a Special Guardianship or Child Arrangements order so that H can live with and be brought up by the grandmother.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The question of possible disruption to H&#8217;s life caused by either of the proposed applications is one of the central issues in the case. Any litigation would inevitably be lengthy and time consuming.  It would also be bitterly contested by the mother (and the father, albeit through her), so that an already fraught situation would become worse.  Although there is no evidence that the current carers will feel unable to continue with the placement during the course of litigation, the general level of uncertainly that an application would cause to them and which could be transmitted to H, cannot be ignored.  The Guardian suggests that they may require additional support during such a time.  There is likely to be consideration as to whether or not there should be contact.  I note that in the mother&#8217;s first statement she says this &#8216;I know that if the court does order an assessment of [the grandmother] this may force my mother to make a different decision over baby. My mother is clear that she supports my decision, however if the paternal grandmother is to be assessed then she may feel she may have no choice but to ask for an assessment&#8217;.  If this happened, there is a risk of yet further disruption because there would be competing claims.  All of this is likely to cause H harm, because although H is very young the insecurity of those who are responsible for caring could well have an effect.  The fact that the prospective adopters have taken this on willingly does not mean they would not find the whole process very difficult or that the effect upon them should not be considered.  </p>

This point would have a better foundation if it was the local authority or the court which was making this assertion, but it is somewhat different when advanced by H&#8217;s parents. The local authority on consideration of the parents&#8217;views has given effect to them in their decision making by allowing H to be placed with &#8216;foster to adopt&#8217; carers with the effect of H becoming formally placed for adoption upon the mother giving her written consent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Taking a step back and looking at the factors in this case together, including Ms Henke&#8217;s powerful point that a refusal of any further assessment and the grandmother&#8217;s application together will lead to only one possible outcome,  I have nonetheless come to the conclusion that this is what I should do. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Granting the grandmother&#8217;s application would risk disruption to such an extent that H would be harmed.   Additionally, further assessment of the grandmother, no matter what the outcome, cannot take away the fundamental problem inherent in any decision to place H with her and the emotional harm that this is likely to cause, even with a high quality of care.  If I either adjourn the application now for an assessment or grant her application it will lead to delay in a permanent outcome for H, with, in my judgment, very little likelihood of the grandmother&#8217;s application being successful, even though it would be an alternative to adoption.  As Mr Storey stated in his submissions, the grandmother&#8217;s full application would not be determined for many months, and at that stage H will have been placed with the current carers for over a year.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The grandmother is entitled to have her case considered, just as H is entitled to have the court consider placement within the family of origin.  As Black LJ stated, however, this does not by itself mean that there will have to be a full enquiry or assessment.  It seems to me that there has been a consideration of the family views and the reasons behind the parents&#8217; decision. The parents and grandmother have been spoken to by the Guardian and social workers (albeit the grandmother was seen by a different social worker), and the Guardian has carried out a careful analysis of H&#8217;s situation.  I consider that I have sufficient information to determine the grandmother&#8217;s application and any assessment is not likely to achieve a different result.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I therefore grant the local authority application and dismiss that of the grandmother.  I know that this decision will be very distressing and disappointing for her, and particularly painful in the context of the rift with her son.  I hope that with the decision today, and without H&#8217;s continuing presence in the middle of it all, some steps can be taken towards reconciliation between them.   </p>
