In the first period of his life, he was cared for at the Homerton University Hospital (&#8220;HUH&#8221;). By 23 April 2021 he was considered sufficiently well to be transferred to the Neonatal Ward at the parent&#8217;s local hospital at Northwick Park (&#8220;NWP&#8221;). He remained at NWP until discharge on 16 June 2021. Y was discharged home to the three-bedroom property shared by his parents and older brother X. Following discharge, the family had support from nurse Faith Tyndale and health visitor Kim Edwards. Y was supported with an oxygen tank. He continued to be subject to review as to his development. During this process he saw Dr Nicholls and Physiotherapist Anna Patel.</span></p>

However, on 10 August 2021 the mother called the police and raised allegations against the father of domestic violence and a level of controlling behaviour. The nature of the reports can be found in the immediate call to emergency services and in the interview between the mother and PC Sarton undertaken at the family home on 10 November 2021 with the support of a translation line interpreter and captured on Body Worn Footage (&#8220;BWF&#8221;). Following interview, the police remained at the scene and arrested the father on his return from work. However, at a subsequent meeting at the Wembley police station on 13 August 2021 the mother withdrew her allegations. Initially the father remained on bail however as I understand the evidence this came to an end on about 20 August 2021 with the father returning to live with the mother.</span></p>

The applicant seeks a positive finding on all matters alleged. Their position has not changed in the light of the evidence heard. The applicant has identified the key evidence, but has not identified with clarity which of the parents they say is responsible for the fractures. As such they appear to either seek or very much leave open a pool finding. The parents take a common approach in denying any responsibility for inappropriate handling that may be found to have occasioned any of the injuries. In essence they question whether the applicant has established a prerequisite of inappropriate handling in order to occasion any of the injuries and as such, whilst they may accept &#8216;responsibility&#8217;, this would not amount to handling such as to justify criticism. To the extent inappropriate handling is required they deny any such handling or knowledge of the same. They challenge the suggestion that a non-present parent would be aware of the nature of the injuries and deny any failure to protect. They deny the presence of domestic violence in their household whilst agreeing lies have been told in this regard. They accept to a limited extent concealment of Z&#8217;s pregnancy, but deny this amounts to a matter which crosses the section 31 threshold. In short, they ask the Court to find the allegations not proven or if proven insufficient to meet the section 31 threshold. They ask for the proceedings to be brought to an end on that basis and the children returned to their care. The guardian does not formally argue for a finding, but highlights evidence which might assist the Court. She identifies aspects of the evidence which might be felt to cause concerns as to credibility and sets out factors which point in favour of or against the allegations. She engages with the factors that might assist with the pool determination if this is relevant.</span></p>

The social worker then reports raising the issue for a second time on 5 January 2022 when seeing the mother at Y&#8217;s audiology appointment. Again, the mother denied being pregnant. Although reasons are not given for holding this belief it seems plain the circumstances were such as to lead the social worker to have a concern and to have raised the issue on two separate occasions. The social worker then confirms being formally notified by the mother&#8217;s GP practice on 13 January 2022.

She did agree she was getting bigger visibly, but due to the stress of everything she was not focused on this. She agreed that this pregnancy related to a period in May/June 2021 when the parents were having both protected and unprotected sexual intercourse. She was asked about being questioned at the court hearing and whether this caused her to pause and reflect on the issue. She told me it hadn&#8217;t caused her to reflect. She understood that the delay meant there had not been any ante-natal care notwithstanding the real issues that had arisen with Y&#8217;s premature birth, but told me that if she had known she was pregnant then she would have certainly sought help. The mother told me the father had suggested she take a pregnancy test, but she had felt no need to do so as she continued to have her menstrual cycle.</span></p>

To the extent the other records extend beyond this they largely amount to a recasting or summary of that told to the officers or the views of others having read these accounts. I will naturally focus on the direct accounts given. Time was spent at the hearing working through the BWF interview with the assistance of the Court appointed interpreters to obtain a clear account of what was said. I listened with care and kept a detailed account of the translation. I also have an agreed note of the same.

They had developed a friendship although the mother had limited details as to M other than her first name. The relationship had developed in part out of the mother&#8217;s lack of friends. Over a period of time M had started to suggest things to the mother as to the father. These included him being unfaithful to the mother and being abusive to previous partners. The suggestion was that M knew people familiar with the father and they had passed this information to her. Secondly, and associated with this, M encouraged or persuaded the mother to consider separating from the father and discussed with her the potential to obtain benefits and support in her own right. The mother indicated there was a level of unhappiness or uncertainty linked to the father&#8217;s long working hours and there was room in her mind for the seeds of doubt to be sown. Encouraged or perhaps persuaded/pressured by M she made the reports to the police. M told her what to say and what she said derived from M. In fact, even when speaking to PC Sarton she was receiving messages from M detailing what she should say. Unfortunately, any record of this has been lost as the mobile phone was dropped by one of the children into water.</span></p>

The process of questioning of the mother was also considered and the officer agreed he had limited experience. It is suggested his direct questioning without any free flow may have contributed to the form of report. He was criticised for not independently investigating aspects of the account (for instance checking whether the bathroom was in fact on the first floor of the house).

I expressed a level of disquiet as to the weight that could be attached to these points. Those for the parents seemingly placed material weight on the same whereas the applicant urged me to proceed on the instructed expert evidence. In principle I prefer the second course. There are routes by which third party opinion might come to be introduced into proceedings. In the first instance a party can advocate for that expert to be instructed. If this does not occur then the party can raise questions of the instructed expert by reference to third party opinion; they can examine the instructed expert at final hearing and put to the expert contrary medical views. However, I do not accept it is appropriate to ask the Court to reach conclusions solely based on the views of experts who have neither been instructed in the proceedings nor subject to examination therein. I struggle to see how any such hearing could be adjudged fair. Were I to find in favour of the parents or contrary to their interests based on the views of an individual who was not a witness in the case then it would be relatively easy to forecast the objection to any conclusion based on the same. Of course, both judges and advocates build up a knowledge base from dealing with cases of this sort on a regular basis, but at no point do we become experts on the point in question. It is tempting to analogise from apparently similar cases, but the danger lurks in the detail of the case which may not be apparent to the outsider. For my part I intend to resolve this case on the evidence directly tested before me.</span></p>

However, where this is not the case the same can be raised later either by a party or by the expert seeking directions. Whilst there is no default position in a complex case such a meeting will often be considered routine. There should be no hesitation in experts making clear the need for the same and in such a case the expert should be entitled to a clear explanation as to why the same has not been granted, if this is the case. It will be important though for the Court to understand from whom the request derives. There may be circumstances in which the Court misunderstands the suggestion to be a legal rather than an expert suggestion. The Court should not be in doubt when the issue arises.</span></p>

This is particularly apt where they are in effect carrying out a clinical overview for the Court. Without this delay is likely to be occasioned as addendum reports are sought reflecting on further pieces of expert reporting. In this case Dr Michie was due to report last but modifications to the timetable led to Dr Olsen coming in last. This placed him in the invidious position of being asked to provide conclusions before all the evidence was in and then being criticised in an entirely professional manner for expressing conclusions before all the evidence was in. He ultimately accepted he should have been clear as to the applicable caveats to his report pending full evidence, but a better position would have been for him not to be placed in such a position at all. This was not of his making and was not his fault.</span></p>

Dr Olsen was appointed to express an opinion from a radiological perspective. His expertise permits him to comment on the presence or otherwise of fractures, the likely timing of the fractures and the expected forces and mechanisms which are felt to be associated with the same. His experience also permits him to highlight areas of further investigation. Dr Michie was asked to report from a paediatric viewpoint and does so in the light of the radiological evidence. He is able to comment on professional understanding as to likely forces required in respect of fractures and the expected pain response to the same. He is expected to consider a differential diagnosis and consider all realistic potential explanations. Dr Irving was instructed to provide a genetic perspective. Her role was more focused and was to assist the Court in understanding whether there was a possible or likely genetic explanation for the fractures. As part of her reporting, she was expected to inform the Court as to whether there were other reasonable lines of enquiry to follow in this regard. A distinction is drawn between the possible genetic explanations (which are for Dr Irving) and biochemical explanations (which would be for Dr Michie). In addition, I have the medical records and the investigations undertaken by the treating team and supporting professionals. These include treating paediatricians (Dr Wijemanne and Dr Hamoud) and reviewing radiologist (Dr Johnson).</span></p>

Identifying areas of concern in such a context might inform further investigations but did not need to meet a legal standard. It is important to make clear that both practitioners are viewing the same imaging evidence.

I should make clear the underlying proposition of the parents was that: (a) Y suffered fractures whilst out of the care of his parents prior to discharge from hospital; (b) it is assumed his care at such times would have been appropriate and within normal handling expectations; and (c) conditions (a) and (b) being the case it is therefore the case that Y likely suffered fractures arising out of normal handling. Further, in the absence of clarity as to potential fracturing post-removal from the parents it is possible, and cannot be ruled out, that Y suffered further unidentified fractures during this period again during a time of assumed normal handling.

Dr Olsen considered it was close to impossible for the acute (most recent) fractures to have arisen during the earlier period in hospital. With regard to the older fractures such a suggestion did not fit with what he was saying, but he could not rule out the older fractures being 2 months old (i.e., mid-June at the earliest). He explained the dating approach he had taken was as per practice and that he acted within a &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">likelihood space</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">&#8217;. When asked about the potential for low mineralisation to slow the speed of healing he was willing to accept this potential, but measured the delay as being a matter of days. It was very unlikely a genetic condition, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, would delay the process of healing. He considered a parental account of a resuscitation episode in April 2021 fell well outside of the likely window during which the fractures arose.</span></p>

The concept of spontaneous fractures was elsewhere described in the evidence as being fractures which occur without a history of handling outside normal bands. Further in children such as Y, who are pre-ambulatory, fractures will not be self-inflicted (e.g., by falls or self-occasioned accidents). I am advised the general view is that rib fractures require more than normal handling and instead require substantial force. In considering the sort of activity that might occasion a fracture my attention is drawn to the potential for &#8216;vigorous&#8217; resuscitation to lead to rib fractures and it is suggested that this is a good indicator of the minimum level of magnitude of force required to cause a rib fracture. Clinically this amounts to a compression of the chest by about 1/3. In general Dr Olsen considers that fractures do not arise on normal handling when children have normal bones, and that excessive force is required to occasion the same. When comparing metaphyseal and shaft fractures both likely require force outside of ordinary handling, but shaft fractures likely require higher forces than required for metaphyseal fractures.</span></p>

Ultimately and properly, he deferred to Dr Irving, but he was able to consider and reject the likelihood of various known conditions whilst accepting there were always &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">unknown unknowns</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">&#8217; when considering medical understanding. His rejection of specific conditions related to the physiological features typically associated with the same and the absence of this in Y&#8217;s case. He also made the point that were the fractures under consideration a consequence of genetic abnormality then one might reasonably be expecting to see further fractures arising outside of the period of consideration and particularly in more recent times as Y has become mobile, and his skeletal frame is required to absorb much higher natural forces associated with mobility. The absence of reported further fractures is a telling piece of evidence. In the case of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (&#8220;OI&#8221;) for instance one tends to normally detect this condition at the point when children start to walk, and fractures are experienced to the spine and lower limbs. Dr Michie recognised the role of family history in any consideration of genetic abnormality but noted this can be inherently problematic. The evidence he received as to some bone related issues for elder members of the family (osteopenia) did not cause him to view Y&#8217;s case as genetic in origin.

Rather, she had interpreted the findings of a number of other clinicians. Specifically, she had regard to: (i) family history; (ii) clinical history; and (iii) investigations including radiological assessment. Insofar as family history was concerned, there was nothing to suggest Y had a material genetic abnormality, but it was acknowledged that this may be the case for those with established genetic conditions and so this was viewed as only part of the assessment. Turning to the clinical assessment there was nothing to suggest a material genetic condition. Blood tests, bone profile testing and other observable clinical features did not suggest a genetic condition. Dr Irving considered both the documents deriving from Dr Olsen and Dr Johnson. Neither identified abnormal bone modelling or obvious reduced bone mineral density around the time of the fractures. There were no radiological features of a genetic predisposition to fractures, such as OI, either.</span></p>

Her evidence was that she formulated a view as to the benefit of testing based on a combination of the family history/clinical evidence and investigations undertaken as noted above. Where these raised a concern for a genetic condition then one might be warranted. However, here these aspects did not suggest a genetic condition and so to test would not have been based on a clinical assessment of the available evidence. In a summarised form tests are undertaken when necessary and appropriate. For her the gap in scans (May to August 2021) did not have material relevance. Further questioned she confirmed that testing cannot be done to exclude something and can only be confirmatory.

In reality every individual has a highly complex genetic make-up and as such variation is not surprising. However, in cases of genetic abnormality and multiple fractures one is considering cases of severe genetic abnormality and these cases present clinically with bone bowing and other features. These were not present in the case of Y. To form this view Dr Irving relies on radiological and other clinical evidence despite not being an expert in those fields. This is in the very nature of her own expertise. A similar point was made as to blue sclerae of the eye. This is often not present even when a genetic condition is present, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">but</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> it is more commonly present in severe cases.</span></p>

In reality the testing process itself is simple and is invasive to only a low level. However, the results of such testing can be problematic. One either finds nothing on testing which doesn&#8217;t change our understanding (and does not in fact rule out a genetic condition per se) or finds something which is clearly damaging. It will have been seen before and is known to be associated with identified harmful consequences. One will typically have a clinical picture which fits with this and the test is confirmatory. The third option is finding something and not knowing what it means. Testing often reveals variations which cannot be understood and the significance of which cannot be identified. This is much more common where there have been no clinical findings to support testing. The result would tell us there is something but not as to whether it is associated with the likelihood of developing symptoms.</span></p>

As such there is the potential for either incident to lead to fracturing in principle. The experts though expressed some doubt as to the description of the process which was witnessed, which did not fit with a conventional resuscitation approach. Dr Michie felt what was being described fell outside of any practice typically used in this jurisdiction. Furthermore, Dr Olsen indicated that the fractures in this case were not where one would expect them to be were they resuscitation associated and that the dating of an April incident could not be associated with the fractures under consideration in any event. Dr Michie drew attention to the close proximity of the reported resuscitation process and the transfer to the NWP hospital. He considered it was most unlikely the child would have been transferred in such circumstances having just experienced a significant deterioration in health necessitating an emergency procedure of this sort. Likewise, it would have been unusual for the child to be discharged from hospital in June shortly after an episode of resuscitation. Finally, Dr Michie told me there appears to be no record of a resuscitation process undertaken whilst in hospital at any point. He did distinguish between a classic emergency resuscitation and assisted breathing where the there is a perceived drop in respiration and medical staff may support the child. </span></p>

In considering this point the balance of probability remains applicable. I have not heard from Dr Johnson so cannot say what he would say were the point raised with him. However, Dr Olsen dealt with these points and told me the top diagnosis for the periosteal thickening would be MBDP, but in reality, it could signify anything and is very general and non-specific. He added that given no fractures were actually seen it would be a stretch to say this was a healing fracture. With regard to the suggested clavicle and rib fractures, Dr Olsen agreed that in the acute stage identification is much harder and particularly when considering the ribs. Here a combination of the density of the lungs and the level of bone demineralisation meant it was difficult to trace the ribs and thus identify any irregularities. It is in the healing process that evidence of fractures becomes clearer. Subsequent scans did not show healing fractures in this regard other than with respect to the fractures under direct consideration. </span></p>

Whilst this distinction was questioned, it was one I found to be sensible. Dr Johnson was plainly involved to guide the treating team in their investigations. This was his role. He was not subject to any Part 25 obligation and was in my evaluation expected to draw attention to anything of potential significance, but this is not the same as advising the Court as to the presence of fractures by reference to legal standards. If Dr Olsen had provided a report in which he opined as to fractures using the former approach, then he would have been duly and appropriately criticised. I accept his distinction. </span></p>

Plainly the absence of evidence may in some circumstances be probative of an event. There are occasions when a Court expects supporting evidence and can reach a contrary conclusion when the same is not forthcoming. However, here no scan was taken and so one must be left in a position of broad neutrality on the question. This is not a case in which the gap flows from a conscious decision on the part of one of the key actors to obtain information. The evidence simply does not and has never existed. In my assessment the absence of proof that something did not occur is not of itself probative that something did in fact happen.</span></p>

It rather raises a speculative possibility and that alone,  but there is countervailing evidence which points otherwise as follows. First, there is the absence of healing fractures on both later and contemporary scans. As Dr Olsen told me there is a timeline for healing and this can be up to 12 months. Yet no such older fractures were identified when the scans were obtained in August 2021. This was at a point only 6 months post birth and the evidence of Dr Olsen makes clear that whilst an earlier fracture may no longer have been apparent it would often be expected to be visible in some form. Further as one gets closer to the point of August 2021, so the likelihood increases. Here no additional fractures were noted which could clinically be placed within the pre-hospital discharge phase which ended on 16 June 2021. This is an important feature in considering this point.  Second, there are no reports of the child presenting with behaviour indicative of a fracture during the pre-discharge phase. Again, this is not conclusive, and patterns of behaviour may be unpredictable and to some extent might be missed, but this was a premature child under a high level of medical supervision of a highly specialist nature. Unusual patterns of behaviour representing fractures would on balance have  likely been noted and investigated.  Third,  with respect to post-removal fractures, I agree there would likely be a heightened level of oversight on the part of those caring for the child. Again, there are no reports. None of these features are determinative, but in conjunction these features point against the argument of undisclosed fractures whether pre-discharge or post-removal. I bear in mind the submission that Y&#8217;s bones may have been recovering (if the explanation is biochemical) and that therefore at some point post re-admission they would have reached a stage of sufficient strength to rule out further fracture. However, this point fits with, rather than opposes, my views set out above.</span></p>

Whilst I cannot be sure this was not the case the evidence persuades me this suggestion falls materially below the balance of probabilities having regard to the factors set out above.</span></p>

There is a potential for a variation in this regard of days (perhaps a couple) not weeks. I have identified the relevant fractures falling into each group earlier in this judgment.

It seems likely the parents witnessed some form of respiratory procedure. I do not entirely discount their evidence. However, I judge a combination of the likely emotion of the moment (this would have been a frightening experience for any parent) and the search for an answer to the fractures has caused a degree of inadvertent exaggeration on their behalf and modelling of the experience to the current facts. I accept the evidence of Drs. Michie and Olsen that the description of the process used is not consistent with training in this jurisdiction. Given the specialist team around Y at the time a non-conventional approach would appear most unlikely. I do though note that whatever took place it did not leave evidence of fractures (healing or substantially healed) four months later. Dr Olsen indicated that remnants of such fractures remain for at least 2-4 months. Further, consequent upon the same, Y did not demonstrate behaviour patterns causing recorded concern as to fractures.</span></p>

As noted there is no intersection. I note all fractures therefore occurred in the period between discharge in June 2021 and re-admission in August 2021. I consider it most unlikely the earlier fractures coincidentally occurred on the very day of discharge from hospital on 16 June 2021. It is at the very boundaries of the time period and is likely to be a day with a high level of professional/parent interaction. It is inherently implausible that something material happened on this day. Nothing of note is reported. Further this is at the very boundaries of the period suggested by Dr Olsen and I understood his principled position to be the narrower period going back no more than 1.5 months.</span></p>

This is not surprising and both Dr Olsen and Michie have reached a diagnosis that Y was suffering from MBDP at this point in time. I accept this shared opinion. </span></p>

It is likely he is now (so far as MBDP) is concerned back to normal. The level of actual fragility (if at all) cannot be calculated although on balance there is likely to have been diminished strength. It cannot be said as to whether any diminution left Y susceptible to fracturing on normal handling or alternatively handling below excessively forceful handling.

He was open to accepting many of the points raised, but this did not cause me to reject his evidence and I feel the suggestion that his report was not fit for purpose to be somewhat extreme. I have some sympathy with the situation Dr Michie was put in. He should have had Dr Olsen&#8217;s report, but instead had the report of Dr Johnson (an expert who was rightly held in very high esteem by all counsel in the case). He felt he was required to report and made an error in referencing Dr Olsen when he was meaning to reference Dr Johnson,  but in my assessment he was caught in a position where he was being asked to report before he had all the necessary material. Yes, he should have held back to an extent, but there is no question he has reappraised the evidence in a fair and professional fashion. My sense of his evidence was that he was left somewhat battered by the early criticism and was willing to accept points which were less merited. An example is the criticism made that he had failed to refer to the observations of Dr Johnson as to additional fractures. He was told he had received this and agreed he was in error not to reference the same. In a rather quiet way, it was later accepted that in fact he had not had this document at the relevant time and had therefore not made the error that he had both been chided for and accepted being made. Expert witnesses are human and harsh criticism can leave them uncertain. The danger is that meaningful evidence may be lost in the consequential fall-out. In the ultimate analysis I found Dr Michie a helpful and fair witness.</span></p>

Dr Irving was not commissioned to carry out genetic testing, but was asked to advise, amongst other things, as to the need for the same.

This conclusion was importantly a function of family history, clinical evidence and investigations including radiological surveys. This is the normal process under which she would apply her clinical expertise. It is not part of her clinical experience to seek answers from testing without justification. She explained and I accept that none of these factors were suggestive of a genetic foundation to the fractures.</span></p>

Dr Olsen&#8217;s evidence in this regard was available, relevant and helpful. The fact that elsewhere the radiological evidence had limitations does not mean it is limited for the purposes of this part of the assessment. In any event it is as explained only part of the genetic assessment. This can be seen in the evidence of Dr Irving as to family history. This did not point to a genetic condition, but invariably comes with uncertainties and so requires consideration of the other elements of the assessment.</span></p>

It is noteworthy that on testing two anomalies were discovered in relation to the child in that case. My experts were referenced to this case and questioned as to the failure to test Y. For my part I consider there are real issues in attempting to carry out a form of comparative analysis between cases where the relevant expert did not give evidence before me and I do not have access to all the evidence. However, this is perhaps unnecessary when I consider the evidence of Dr Olsen (who appeared in that case) that there were many differences between the two cases. Having read the judgment, I agree. It is particularly noteworthy that although Dr Saggar did find two anomalies in that case it does not appear this finding was particularly relevant to his concerns in the case. Rather it was the radiological evidence of there being something peculiarly unusual in the radiological results that caused him to pause and reflect. It was this that fed his position on &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">unknown unknown</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">&#8217; rather than the two identified anomalies. Elsewhere, and cross referencing, I am unsure there is in fact so much disagreement between the approaches of Dr Irving before me and Professor Saggar before HHJ Jack. These observations should not be understood to be a review of Dr Saggar as an expert or of the decision in Re P.

I consider it a particularly telling point that there have been no reports of further issues despite Y&#8217;s increasing mobility. It is intuitively and clinically logical that as mobility develops, and forces increase, that an enduringly fragile skeletal frame will show the signs of this fragility. On any assessment this has not been the case. Might there be genetic unknowns? In a sense, and on the evidence of Dr Irving, this is bound to be the case absent testing and to a material extent even after testing. However, the better question is as to whether there is a likelihood of genetic unknowns with probative relevance to the question of fractures in this case. I find on balance this is not the case. In submissions it is said Dr Michie did not exclude Menke&#8217;s Syndrome. However, this is a genetic condition and I do not recall the same being raised with Dr Irving.

In my assessment if the applicant fails then it is highly likely the answer will be found in the territory of MBDP.

However, added to this is the puzzling reality that she at no point appears to have discussed this developing friendship with the father. If she had of, then it is likely there would have been some level of scrutiny as to who the individual was, given the common name &#8216;M&#8217; used in both relationships. I find it inexplicable that the mother would form such a friendship and keep it from an otherwise loving partner. Keeping the relationship from him would suggest a pre-existing dynamic in the relationship contrary to the parents&#8217; evidence. This might change when &#8216;M&#8217; started to make problematic observations about the father, but not at the initial stages of the suggested friendship.</span></p>

Yet it is most unlikely &#8216;M&#8217; would plot a plan towards getting the father back by putting in place a plan that does not simply separate him from the mother, but in fact places him at risk of prosecution and incarceration. If it is revenge then where is the basis for the same on the evidence. On the father&#8217;s case he broke up with &#8216;M&#8217; because she cheated on him not him on her. Further, when they met on a single occasion she expressed continued feelings for him. This is not a particularly rich seam on which to base a case of premeditated revenge some two years later as suggested by the parents.</span></p>

The father was not as engaged with the family as he had been when X was younger. This may well be because Y&#8217;s prematurity did not allow a clean discharge from hospital, but instead led to a protracted period of unsettled family life prior to Y being discharged. Furthermore, the father was working long hours and for understandable reasons given the new addition to the family and other obligations. This left the mother increasingly isolated and with little, if any, support network. I accept the fundamental case of her becoming worried as to the father&#8217;s commitment to their relationship, although I do not find there was a foundation for the concerns. The situation was not helped by the father being controlling of the mother in general terms as alleged by her. In this context, I find there to have been disquiet in the relationship and some emotional turmoil in the relationship. I find the father did act as alleged by the mother and that her account was an essentially true account of recent events of concern</span></p>

This simply did not fit with a case of returning to shower, feed and go to bed. My overarching conclusion is that the father was away at work for much of the day, but that there were many occasions over the period when he would return home and the children would be awake. I am satisfied on the parents&#8217; own evidence that there were occasions when the father would be responsible for supervising the children, albeit I accept this was far from the norm. The father gave such evidence to the police in any event.</span></p>

I accept they call for different mechanisms and in the normal course of events different forces. This is not a case of a single form of fracture in a focused location which might be explained by a for instance a resuscitation process or something equivalent. Rather and even in the case of the ribs we have multiple sites with different compressive mechanisms and at different points. The L7 fractures stands out given the type of force and form of mechanism required. It is difficult to conceive of the normal handling leading to that form of fracture.  I then have the long shaft fracture and the requirement for a combined mechanism and force outwith normal handling. Taken in totality it simply is not plausible that all of these separate fractures requiring different mechanisms and at different times were occasioned by a pattern of normal handling.</span></p>

I keep in mind the important caveats raised by both Dr Olsen (scanning as a blunt instrument in this regard) and Michie (potential for normal blood results to co-exist with demineralisation). However, I have a wide canvas of evidence and I consider it would be inappropriate to simply discard what we have in seeking to properly resolve this case. In my assessment, whilst it cannot be calibrated with absolute confidence it is probable Y was experiencing gradual, but consistent improving mineralisation from May onwards. This seems to me an inevitable finding based on the medical guidance, but also based on the August scans which show normal bones in comparison to earlier in the period. It is also seen in a far more focused manner in the changes evident in the scans over the short period between April and May. Added to this one has the blood test results taken in the following month. These were normal and as advised by Dr Michie (and I accept) showed that the component elements of bone construction and the associated enzyme was present and normal. Further the marker of the brain&#8217;s evaluation of bony development was also normal. I accept that this might co-exist with demineralisation, but note this was relatively early in the timeline being in mid-June and many weeks before the last fractures. I consider this important. The brain at that point in time was receiving information that normality had been achieved. Whilst this might co-exist with a state of demineralisation it seems to me unlikely it would co-exist with a state of profound demineralisation. It seems to me that were this the case then Y would likely continue to maintain mineralisation at these same levels. In my assessment this suggests  it is highly likely that one is approaching a point of normality if the brain is no longer evaluating an issue with ongoing bony development. In my assessment this casts real doubt on the suggestion of continuing MBDP as of August 2021.</span></p>

However, if more than two occasions it need not have been very many more than two.

However, I accept there is a degree of variability in this regard and that such response may have been disguised by the effects of soothing. I am not confident either of these parents would have necessarily understood the exact nature of the harm caused to Y on each of the occasions. The consequential ability to soothe Y may have led to the impression that any harm was temporary in character.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The factors against the father being responsible recognise his rather limited role in Y&#8217;s life and my acceptance of him being out of the house for significant periods. He would simply be less involved with Y and less likely to have caused the injuries. Secondly, one has the obvious classic division of labour in the home which placed central responsibility on the mother for childcare. There was a ring of truth in the evidence as to the father being somewhat hands off with Y even when called upon to supervise. Thirdly, there is the evidence of him being worried about handling Y due to his size and vulnerability. Although I reject his argument of never handling Y this does not mean he was not particularly cautious due to worry when handling him. Fourthly, I accept the positive relationship with the children. Fifthly, there is a much greater likelihood of the mother witnessing or becoming aware of mishandling by the father than the other way around. The dynamic between them would likely place her relatively proximate to the child at all times, whereas when the mother was alone with the child the father was often far away. Consequent to my views as to joint culpability, this points against the father.</span></p>

Secondly, she was isolated, and this may well have left her stressed and led to unpredictable poor handling. Thirdly, she was receiving little support from the father. Fourthly, she likely felt overwhelmed by the combination of the domestic abuse, her caring responsibilities and her worries for her relationship.</span></p>

Equally, she will make findings of fact on all the evidence available to her, including her assessment of the parents' credibility; she is not limited to the expert evidence. I am also content to decide the question in this appeal on the basis that a judge &#8230; is not required slavishly to adhere to a schedule of proposed findings placed before her by a local authority. To take an obvious example: care proceedings are frequently dynamic and issues emerge in the oral evidence which had not hitherto been known to exist. It would be absurd if such matters had to be ignored.</span></p>

Where, as here, the local authority had prepared its Schedule of proposed findings with some care, and where the fact finding hearing had itself been the subject of a directions appointment at which the parents had agreed not to apply for various witnesses to attend for cross-examination, it requires very good reasons, in my judgment, for the judge to depart from the schedule of proposed findings. Furthermore, if the judge is, as it were, to go "off piste", and to make findings of fact which are not sought by the local authority or not contained in its Schedule, then he or she must be astute to ensure; (a) that any additional or different findings made are securely founded in the evidence; and (b) that the fairness of the fact finding process is not compromised.&#8221;</span></p>

It is also a tautology: the true distinction is between an accident which is unexpected and unintentional and an injury which involves an element of wrong. That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from, say, negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of s 31(2) of the CA 1989.</span></p>

The gloss imported by the use of unexplained legal, clinical or colloquial terms is not helpful to that exercise nor is it necessary for the purposes of section 31(2) to characterise the fact of what happened as negligence, recklessness or in any other way. Just as non-accidental injury is a tautology, 'accidental injury' is an oxymoron that is unhelpful as a description. If the term was used during the discussion after the judgment had been given as a description of one of the possibilities of how the harm had been caused, then it should not have been; it being a contradiction in terms. If, as is often the case when a clinical expert describes harm as being a 'non-accidental injury', there is a range of factual possibilities, those possibilities should be explored with the expert and the witnesses so that the court can understand which, if any, described mechanism is compatible with the presentation of harm.</span></p>

Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts.

Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent&#8217;s Park. If it is seen outside the zoo on a stretch of greensward regularly used for walking dogs, then of course it is more likely to be a dog than a lion. If it is seen in the zoo next to the lions&#8217; enclosure when the door is open, then it may well be more likely to be a lion than a dog.</span></p>

But generally speaking a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely upon the burden of proof.&#8221;</span></p>

The parties are agreed that it is and they are right. It is correct, as the Court of Appeal observed, that Re B was not directly concerned with the identification of perpetrators but with whether the child had been harmed. However, the observations of Lord Hoffmann and Lady Hale, quoted at paragraph 12 above, make it clear that the same approach is to be applied to the identification of perpetrators as to any other factual issue in the case. This issue shows quite clearly that there is no necessary connection between the seriousness of an allegation and the improbability that it has taken place. The test is the balance of probabilities, nothing more and nothing less. </span></p>

If the harm has been caused by someone outside the home or family, for example at school or in hospital or by a stranger, then it is not attributable to the parental care unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it. Sometimes it will desirable for the same reasons as those given above. It will help to identify the real risks to the child and the steps needed to protect him. It will help the professionals in working with the family. And it will be of value to the child in the long run. </span></p>

The cases are littered with references to a "finding of exculpation" or to "ruling out" a particular person as responsible for the harm suffered. This is, as the President indicated, to set the bar far too high. It suggests that parents and other carers are expected to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt. If the evidence is not such as to establish responsibility on the balance of probabilities it should nevertheless be such as to establish whether there is a real possibility that a particular person was involved. When looking at how best to protect the child and provide for his future, the judge will have to consider the strength of that possibility as part of the overall circumstances of the case.&#8221;</span></p>

It is a means of satisfying the attributable threshold condition that only arises where the court is satisfied that there has been significant harm arising from (in shorthand) ill-treatment and where the only &#8216;unknown&#8217; is which of a number of persons is responsible. So, to state the obvious, the concept of the pool does not arise at all in the normal run of cases where the relevant allegation can be proved to the civil standard against an individual or individuals in the normal way. Nor does it arise where only one person could possibly be responsible. In that event, the allegation is either proved or it is not. There is no room for a finding of fact on the basis of &#8216;real possibility&#8217;, still less on the basis of suspicion. There is no such thing as a pool of one.</span></p>

As is made clear in Lancashire at [19], O and N at [27-28] and S-B at [43], the person is not a proven perpetrator but a possible perpetrator. That conclusion is then carried forward to the welfare stage, when the court will, as was said in S-B, &#8220;consider the strength of the possibility&#8221; that the person was involved as part of the overall circumstances of the case. At the same time it will, as Lord Nicholls put it in Lancashire, &#8220;keep firmly in mind that the parents have not been shown to be responsible for the child&#8217;s injuries.&#8221; In saying this, he recognised that a conclusion of this kind presents the court with a particularly difficult problem. Experience bears this out, particularly where a child has suffered very grave harm from someone within a pool of perpetrators.</span></p>

Centrally, it does not alter the general rule on the burden of proof. Where there are a number of people who might have caused the harm, it is for the local authority to show that in relation to each of them there is a real possibility that they did. No one can be placed into the pool unless that has been shown. This is why it is always misleading to refer to &#8216;exclusion from the pool&#8217;: see Re S-B at [43]. Approaching matters in that way risks, as Baroness Hale said, reversing the burden of proof.</span></p>

The court should first consider whether there is a &#8216;list&#8217; of people who had the opportunity to cause the injury. It should then consider whether it can identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probability and should seek, but not strain, to do so: Re D (Children) [2009] EWCA Civ 472 at [12]. Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list: "Is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries?" Only if there is should A or B or C be placed into the &#8216;pool&#8217;.</span></p>

In Lancashire, the condition was interpreted to include non-parent carers. It was somewhat widened in North Yorkshire at [26] to include &#8216;people with access to the child&#8217; who might have caused injury. If that was an extension, it was a principled one. But at all events, the extension does not stretch to &#8220;anyone who had even a fleeting contact with the child in circumstances where there was the opportunity to cause injuries&#8221;: North Yorkshire at [25]. Nor does it extend to harm caused by someone outside the home or family unless it would have been reasonable to expect a parent to have prevented it: S-B at [40].</span></p>

The position of each individual was then investigated and compared. That is as it should be. To assess the likelihood of harm having been caused by A or B or C, one needs as much information as possible about each of them in order to make the decision about which if any of them should be placed in the pool. So, where there is an imbalance of information about some individuals in comparison to others, particular care may need to be taken to ensure that the imbalance does not distort the assessment of the possibilities. The same may be said where the list of individuals has been whittled down to a pool of one named individual alongside others who are not similarly identified. This may be unlikely, but the present case shows that it is not impossible. Here it must be shown that there genuinely is a pool of perpetrators and not just a pool of one by default.</span></p>

Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence. The roles of the court and the expert are distinct. It is the court that is in the position to weigh up expert evidence against the other evidence (see </span><a href="http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed150" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:9pt">A County Council &amp; K, D, &amp; L&#160; [2005] EWHC 144 (Fam)</a><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:9pt">; [2005] 1 FLR 851 per Charles J).

Clearly, in this and every case, the answer is not to be found in the inherent probabilities but in the evidence, and it is when analysing the evidence that the court takes account of the probabilities."</span></p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the 'lie' is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in&#160;Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration". In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of&#160;R v Middleton&#160;[2001] Crim.L.R. 251. In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt."</span></p>

It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</span></p>

As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, &#8220;nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another&#8221;. Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm.&#8221;</span></p>

The controversy to which such cases gives rise should come as no surprise. A young baby dies whilst under the sole care of a parent or child-minder.&#160; That child can give no clue to clinicians as to what has happened.&#160; Experts, prosecuting authorities and juries must reconstruct, as best they can, what has happened.&#160; There remains a temptation to believe that it is always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child.&#160; Where the prosecution is able, by advancing an array of experts, to identify a non-accidental injury and the defence can identify no alternative cause, it is tempting to conclude that the prosecution has proved its case.&#160; Such a temptation must be resisted.&#160; In this, as in so many fields of medicine, the evidence may be insufficient to exclude beyond reasonable doubt an unknown cause.&#160; As Cannings (177) teaches, even where, on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown". </span></p>

It is trite that there are all kinds of reasons why witnesses lie, but where the issues relate, as here, to failed marital relationships and the strong emotions and passions that the court process itself releases and brings into prominence in such a case, the reasons why someone in the mother's position may lie, even lie repeatedly, are more than usually difficult to decipher. Yet through all the lies, as experience teaches, one may nonetheless be left with a powerful conviction that on the essentials the witness is telling the truth, perhaps because of the way in which she gives her evidence, perhaps because of a number of small points which, although trivial in themselves, nonetheless suddenly illuminate the underlying realities.&#8221;</span></p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8216;lie&#8217; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt.  As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8216;capable of amounting to a corroboration.&#8217;  In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R. 251.  &#8216;In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court.  Judges should, therefore, take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8217;.&#8221;</span></p>

The correct approach to lies in relation to fact-finding is well known and the Judge appropriately gave himself a Lucas direction in that context. Here the more pertinent matter for our purpose concerns lies in the context of welfare. Lies, however disgraceful and dispiriting, must be strictly assessed for their likely effect on the child, and the same can be said for disobedience to authority. In some cases, the conclusion will simply be that the child unfortunately has dishonest or disobedient parents. In others, parental dishonesty and inability to co-operate with authority may decisively affect the welfare assessment. But in all cases the link between lies and welfare must be spelled out. That did not happen in Re Y (A Child) EWCA Civ 1337, where Macur LJ said this at [7(4)]:</span></p>

There was very little attention given to context in this case. No analysis appears to have been made by any of the professionals as to why the mother's particular lies created the likelihood of significant harm to these children and what weight should reasonably be afforded to the fact of her deceit in the overall balance.&#8221;</span></p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people&#8217;s memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are.  Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:9pt">Underlying both these errors is a faulty model of memory as a mental record which is fixed at the time of experience of an event and then fades (more or less slowly) over time.  In fact, psychological research has demonstrated that memories are fluid and malleable, being constantly rewritten whenever they are retrieved.  This is true even of so-called &#8216;flashbulb&#8217; memories, that is memories of experiencing or learning of a particularly shocking or traumatic event.  (The very description &#8216;flashbulb&#8217; memory is in fact misleading, reflecting as it does the misconception that memory operates like a camera or other device that makes a fixed record of an experience.)  External information can intrude into a witness&#8217;s memory, as can his or her own thoughts and beliefs, and both can cause dramatic changes in recollection. Events can come to be recalled as memories which did not happen at all or which happened to someone else (referred to in the literature as a failure of source memory).  </span></p>

Our memories of past beliefs are revised to make them more consistent with our present beliefs.

The nature of litigation is such that witnesses often have a stake in a particular version of events.  This is obvious where the witness is a party or has a tie of loyalty (such as an employment relationship) to a party to the proceedings.  Other, more subtle influences include allegiances created by the process of preparing a witness statement and of coming to court to give evidence for one side in the dispute.  A desire to assist, or at least not to prejudice, the party who has called the witness or that party&#8217;s lawyers, as well as a natural desire to give a good impression in a public forum, can be significant motivating forces.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:9pt">Considerable interference with memory is also introduced in civil litigation by the procedure of preparing for trial.  A witness is asked to make a statement, often (as in the present case) when a long time has already elapsed since the relevant events.  The statement is usually drafted for the witness by a lawyer who is inevitably conscious of the significance for the issues in the case of what the witness does nor does not say.  The statement is made after the witness&#8217;s memory has been &#8220;refreshed&#8221; by reading documents.  The documents considered often include statements of case and other argumentative material as well as documents which the witness did not see at the time or which came into existence after the events which he or she is being asked to recall.  The statement may go through several iterations before it is finalised.  Then, usually months later, the witness will be asked to re-read his or her statement and review documents again before giving evidence in court.  The effect of this process is to establish in the mind of the witness the matters recorded in his or her own statement and other written material, whether they be true or false, and to cause the witness&#8217;s memory of events to be based increasingly on this material and later interpretations of it rather than on the original experience of the events.</span></p>

Such questions are misguided in at least two ways. First, they erroneously presuppose that there is a clear distinction between recollection and reconstruction, when all remembering of distant events involves reconstructive processes.  Second, such questions disregard the fact that such processes are largely unconscious and that the strength, vividness and apparent authenticity of memories is not a reliable measure of their truth&#8221;</span></p>

But to attach any significant weight to such impressions in assessing credibility risks making judgments which at best have no rational basis and at worst reflect conscious or unconscious biases and prejudices. One of the most important qualities expected of a judge is that they will strive to avoid being influenced by personal biases and prejudices in their decisionmaking. That requires eschewing judgments based on the appearance of a witness or on their tone, manner or other aspects of their behaviour in answering questions. Rather than attempting to assess whether testimony is truthful from the manner in which it is given, the only objective and reliable approach is to focus on the content of the testimony and to consider whether it is consistent with other evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and with known or probable facts.&#8221;</span></p>

It is one of a line of distinguished judicial observations that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the need to assess witness evidence in its proper place alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can be placed . . . But a proper awareness of the fallibility of memory does not relieve judges of the task of making findings of fact based upon all of the evidence. Heuristics or mental short cuts are no substitute for this essential judicial function.

The relative significance of oral and contemporaneous evidence will vary from case to case. What is important, as was highlighted in Kogan, is that the court assesses all the evidence in a manner suited to the case before it and does not inappropriately elevate one kind of evidence over another.</span></p>

This tends towards a focus upon blaming staff and professionals closest in time to the incident. Outcome bias occurs when the outcome of the incident influences the way it is analysed. For example when an incident leads to a death it is considered very differently from an incident that leads to no harm, even when the type of incident is exactly the same. If people are judged one way when the outcome is poor and another way when the outcome is good, accountability becomes inconsistent and unfair.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
