The case concerns two children, Cala, a girl born in 2015 and now eight years old, and Daib, a boy born in 2017 and now six years old.  The father seeks a child arrangement order to decide with whom the children should live and how much contact each parent should have with the children.  In addition he seeks a specific issue determination as regards the religion of the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents were in a relationship which ended in 2017.  The mother had three children from a previous relationship.  They are significantly older than Cala and Daib and were still living at the mother&#8217;s home for most of the relevant time.  Those children are now adults.  The father issued proceedings under case number ZW17P00359 seeking a child arrangement order that Cala and Daib live with him.  This led to a fact-finding hearing to determine whether the father was guilty of serious domestic abuse against the mother.  By a judgment of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2017 District Judge Tempia found that the father was guilty of that behaviour, which included sexual, physical and emotional abuse.  The father did not attend the fact-finding hearing due, he claimed, to his mental health difficulties.  Notwithstanding his non-attendance, the father thereafter fully accepted the learned district judge&#8217;s findings of fact.  That remained his position before me.</p>

Instead he was given indirect contact.  The father was directed to undertake a Domestic Abuse Perpetrators Programme (&#8220;DAPP&#8221;) after which it was ordered that there should be direct contact between the father and the children.</p>

The mother stopped those arrangements on 23rd July 2021 after having the previous day filed a C2 application to suspend the child arrangements order.  The father on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August filed a cross-application to enforce the April Order.  By Order of 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2021, contact was reinstated with effect from 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2021 with the father having direct contact with the children on alternate weekends, Saturday from 9am to 6pm and Sunday from 1pm to 5pm.  A report was directed from Cafcass.  Pursuant to this order, the Family Court Advisor, Patrick Mamattah, in his report of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2021 advised that the then current arrangements should continue with contact being increased to overnight staying contact and shared holidays.  </p>

The main driver, he says, of his application is that the children appeared from October 2022 to be being alienated from him.  In particular, they told him that the mother had shown them a video of a Muslim man stabbing a baby.  The mother allegedly said that this is what Muslims did.  He was afraid he would lose his children as a result of their alienation from him and his Muslim extended family due to the horrific content of the anti-Islamic video.  The mother denies that the showing of such a video ever occurred.  This is an important factual issue in the case.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">&#8230;I am concerned that [the father] may be continuing to abuse [the mother] emotionally and verbally, and that he is using the children as a means to perpetrate this abuse, and thus harming them emotionally.  Coercive behaviour can be very difficult to evidence, but I consider that there is an emerging picture of behaviour which raises significant worries about the children&#8217;s safety in their father&#8217;s care.  For this reason, I recommend that they do not spend time directly with their father moving forward.  Instead, I recommend that they are supported to have indirect communication via cards and photographs to support their identity needs.  I recommend that the children&#8217;s mother has oversight of this correspondence so as to ensure that it is appropriate and child-centred, and that this is sent once a month, as well as on the children&#8217;s birthdays and at Eid. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I do not underestimate the significance of this recommendation on the children, especially on Cala who is expressing a desire to spend time with her father.  However, I have utilised Cafcass&#8217;s Spending Time Arrangements Safety Indicator to consider if this would be safe to continue and have concluded that overall it would not be safe for either Cala or Daib.  This is due to the lack of insight, reflection and remorse from [the father], the high level of fear expressed by [the mother], and the concerns that Spending Time arrangements are being used to undermine the children&#8217;s mother and continue abuse.  The cumulative impact on the children&#8217;s mother&#8217;s wellbeing will have a significant impact on the children moving forward, and there is a high risk of parental alienation.  Arrangements do appear to be consistent and contribute in some ways to a positive sense of identity for the children, but the wider negative impact is too great a concern to balance this. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">This recommendation will inevitably afford the children some significant losses in respect to their relationship with their father and it is for this reason that I recommend indirect communication continues.  I would also encourage Cala and Daib&#8217;s mother to consider how they might be supported to maintain some of their existing relationships with their wider paternal family if this were to be able to be facilitated safely.  I also recommend that if the Court were to agree to end the direct arrangements between Cala and Daib and their father, the children will benefit from their mother supporting them to attend Islamic classes so as to promote this important part of their identity.  Cala and Daib will need to be supported around the change in arrangements with their father which they are very likely to experience as confusing and unsettling.  I can make a referral to the Local Authority requesting support of this nature, if [the mother] consents to this. </p>

I am concerned that court applications may be being used to undermine the children&#8217;s mother and that Cala and Daib are being subjected to investigations which will further divide their loyalties and confuse them.  Any further concerns about the children&#8217;s welfare can be referred to the Local Authority to investigate as per their child protection procedures.  As a result, I would invite the Court to consider making a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 91(14)</ref> Order to prevent further applications being made to the Court. </p>

[The father] may also benefit from accessing therapeutic support via his GP to process his feelings around his experiences of social injustice, racism and cultural oppression.  If he is able to gain an insight into how his experiences have translated into beliefs and behaviours that impact on others in ways he may not recognise or intend, this could open up the possibility of engaging meaningfully in some work to address domestic abuse and coercive controlling behaviours. </p>

I am also concerned that this may escalate risk for Cala, Daib and their mother and so I will be sharing this report with the Local Authority.  In light of previous findings, the Court may also wish to consider making a further Non-Molestation Order and Prohibited Steps Order to protect Cala and Daib and their mother from any escalating risk as a result of the outcome of the hearing.&#8221;</p>

I was aware that the father had served an extensive witness statement which appeared to have been prepared with some professional or semi-professional help.  It made a large number of potentially significant points in respect of Ms Senior&#8217;s report.  It seemed to me that these should be put to Ms Senior so that she could answer them: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (A child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/1140" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 1140" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 1140</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] 1 WLR 2415" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] 1 WLR 2415</ref> and most recently <span style="font-style:italic">TUI UK Ltd v Griffiths </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2023/48" uk:canonical="[2023] UKSC 48" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] UKSC 48</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2023] 3 WLR 1204" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] 3 WLR 1204</ref>.  I discussed with the father whether it might be easier for me to put the points in his witness statement to Ms Senior, but he said he preferred to start his cross-examination in the way in which he had prepared for it.  This did not appear to be a problem.  We were making good time with the evidence.  I would be able to put to her on the second day any matters from his witness statement which the father did not cover in his cross-examination.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event, the father&#8217;s cross-examination showed some of features typical of litigants-in-person.  He started with a reasonable point on the way in which his emails to Ms Senior in the run-up to 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2023, when her report was initially due, had caused her to amend her report.  (He had obtained an earlier version of her report by means of a subject access request and was thus able to show the changes.)  However, he then became engaged on a discussion with Ms Senior about the difference between subconscious racism and internal bias.  I did not find this a useful topic and directed him to move to more productive areas of cross-examination.  He did then deal with various key topics, but not at the level of detail which he had set out in his witness statement.  Further, despite my attempts to dissuade him, he had a tendency to make speeches commenting on the answers given him rather than asking further questions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As four o&#8217;clock approached, I indicated that we would be looking to wind down and recommence the following day.  At this point, Ms Senior said that she would be unable to attend the following day.  She explained that she was due to commence her maternity leave.  She would not be returning to work for a year.  Both parents showed surprise at her saying this.  (Neither Ms Millin nor Dr Chiy had been at the DRA, so could not comment.)  Nor had Ms Senior communicated this to the Court at the start of the day, when it would have been a simple matter to have her give evidence as the first witness.  She said that she had told the Court this at the DRA on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, but there is no record of this in the Order made that day.  Quite the contrary.  The Order recites that &#8220;upon this matter being listed in person for Final Hearing on the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> December 2023 when the Applicant and the Respondent will attend in person and Ms Senior of Cafcass will attend remotely as at the time of the hearing she will be heavily pregnant and there being no objection to her remote attendance.&#8221;  This implies she would be present remotely on both days.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event we carried on sitting.  The father completed his cross-examination (although he might have benefited from further preparation overnight) and Ms Millin cross-examined.  Due to time constraints, it was not practical for me to take Ms Senior through the father&#8217;s witness statement, so she could answer points which had not been put to her fully by the father.  Thus although the father&#8217;s case was put to her, it was not put to her in as full a form as I would have ensured that it would have been if her evidence had not been curtailed.</p>

This is particularly problematic, because it is apparent that large areas of background which might potentially be relevant to the taking of a holistic view of the case have not been the subject of any inquiry by the Court.  By way of example, during Dr Chiy&#8217;s cross-examination of the mother she said that there had been public law proceedings taken with a view to putting the children into care, but there is no documentation at all relating to these proceedings in the bundle or what the concerns were which resulted in care proceedings being begun or when.  Likewise, an issue considered by Ms Senior was whether the children were at risk at the mother&#8217;s by reason of their having seen domestic violence inflicted by one of the mother&#8217;s older sons on his girlfriend whilst they were living at the mother&#8217;s.  Ms Senior was unable to ascertain sufficient information to form a view on this issue and it was not investigated at the hearing.</p>

		  <subparagraph>
		    <content>
		      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.56in"><span style="color:#000000">&#8216;4. In November 2017, M [the mother] applied for and was granted a non-molestation order against F [the father].  That order has been renewed and remains effective.  The nature of the allegations included in support of the application can succinctly and accurately be summarised as involving complaints of &#8220;coercive and controlling behaviour&#8221; on F&#8217;s part.  In the Family Court, that expression is given no legal definition.  In my judgement, it requires none.  The term is unambiguous and needs no embellishment.  Understanding the scope and ambit of the behaviour however, requires a recognition that &#8220;coercion&#8221; will usually involve a pattern of acts encompassing, for example, assault, intimidation, humiliation and threats.  &#8220;Controlling behaviour&#8221; really involves a range of acts designed to render an individual subordinate and to corrode their sense of personal autonomy.  Key to both behaviours is an appreciation of a &#8220;pattern&#8221; or &#8220;a series of acts&#8221;, the impact of which must be assessed cumulatively and rarely in isolation.  There has been very little reported case law in the Family Court considering coercive and controlling behaviour.  I have taken the opportunity below, to highlight the insidious reach of this facet of domestic abuse.  My strong impression, having heard the disturbing evidence in this case, is that it requires greater awareness and, I strongly suspect, more focused training for the relevant professionals.&#8217;</span></p>

The judgment of Hayden J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">F v M </span><span style="color:#000000">(which should be essential reading for the Family judiciary) is of value both because of the illustration that its facts provide of what is meant by coercive and controlling behaviour, but also because of the valuable exercise that the judge has undertaken in highlighting at paragraph 60 the statutory guidance published by the Home Office pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2015/9/section/77/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 77 (1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2015/9" uk:canonical="2015 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Serious Crime Act 2015</ref> which identified paradigm behaviours of controlling and coercive behaviour.

In short, a pattern of coercive and/or controlling behaviour can be as abusive as or more abusive than any particular factual incident that might be written down and included in a schedule in court proceedings...  It follows that the harm to a child in an abusive household is not limited to cases of actual violence to the child or to the parent.

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.5in">&#8216;The focus and purpose of a fact-finding investigation in the context of a case concerning the future welfare of children in the Family Court are wholly different to those applicable to the prosecution by the state of an individual before a criminal court.  The latter is concerned with the culpability and, if guilty, punishment for a specific criminal offence, whereas the former involves the determination facts, across a wide canvas, relating to past events in order to evaluate which of a range of options for the future care of a child best meets the requirements of his or her welfare.  Similarly, where facts fall to be determined in the course of ordinary civil litigation, the purpose of the exercise, which is to establish liability, operates in a wholly different context to a fact-finding process in family proceedings.  Reduced to simple basics, in both criminal and civil proceedings the ultimate outcome of the litigation will be binary, either &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;not guilty&#8221;, or &#8220;liable&#8221; or &#8220;not liable&#8221;.  In family proceedings, the outcome of a fact-finding hearing will normally be a narrative account of what the court has determined (on the balance of probabilities) has happened in the lives of a number of people and, often, over a significant period of time.  The primary purpose of the family process is to determine, as best that may be done, what has gone on in the past, so that that knowledge may inform the ultimate welfare evaluation where the court will choose which option is best for a child with the court&#8217;s eyes open to such risks as the factual determination may have established&#8230;</p>

As Hickinbottom LJ observed during submissions, &#8216;what matters in a fact-finding hearing are the findings of fact&#8217;.  Whilst it may not infrequently be the case that the Family Court may be called upon to re-hear evidence that has already been considered in the different context of a criminal prosecution, that evidence comes to the court simply as evidence and it falls to be evaluated, in accordance with the civil standard of proof, and set against whatever other evidence there may be (whether heard by the criminal court or not) for the sole purpose of determining the relevant facts.&#8221;</p>

Nonetheless, if the Court is satisfied on balance of probabilities that the father has behaved that way, the Court will necessarily consider that that behaviour is very serious.  Although a finding of 2015 behaviour will not inevitably result in a refusal of contact, it may well be that, unless remedied, 2015 behaviour will be such that the risk to the children is so serious that direct contract is contra-indicated.  A similar conclusion is likely in relation to 12J behaviour, unless the perpetrator can show significant improvement in his or her behaviour.</p>

A key issue is whether the father&#8217;s subsequent steps to remediate himself are sufficient.  This is particularly so, because Ms Senior in cross-examination by Ms Millin for the mother said that the current coercion and control which she considered existed was &#8220;covert&#8221;.  Later she referred to the &#8220;subtlety&#8221; of her concerns.  This is much more the language of 2021 behaviour than of 2015 or 12J behaviour.</p>

The description ascribed to the school does not match the incident report set out below.</p>

Cala said she had watched this with her mother and brother, when she was about five years of age.  When asked if this had definitely happened, Cala told me &#8216;I&#8217;m not sure, but I think it did.&#8217;  If Cala and Daib were shown such a video, it will have been hugely traumatic and frightening for them.  However, Cala&#8217;s account contained elements of doubt and when this was discussed with [the mother], her mother evidenced good insight into why this would be very inappropriate and what the impact would be on the children.  [The mother&#8217;s] insight into the children&#8217;s needs and emotions was a real strength during her interview and as a result, it is difficult to imagine that she would expose the children to something so harmful.  It is not uncommon for children who are being exposed to alienating behaviours by one parent to begin to make allegations about their experiences in the other parent&#8217;s care.  This is a symptom of their confusion, feelings of divided loyalties and ultimately emotional harm.  It is possible that this may be at play here though both possibilities should be held.&#8221;</p>

It was common ground between the parties and Ms Senior that as between Cala and Daib, she was the dominant sibling.  Daib is not just younger, he also has some slight delay in speech development.  This may be a symptom of glue ear, from which Daib regularly suffers and which causes intermittent deafness.  Further, whereas Cala specifically tries to be the &#8220;good&#8221; child, Daib tends to be naughtier.

[The mother] experiences this as aggressive and interrogating in manner and therefore does not respond as [the father] would like.  When discussing this dynamic, [the father] was very focused on the behaviour of [the mother], rather than reflecting upon what he might do differently to create more positive communication.  His responses appeared focused on telling [the mother] what she was doing wrong, and then seeking support from Children&#8217;s Services if, in his view, she did not listen, rather than hearing from [the mother] about why she had approached a situation in a particular way, reflecting upon this, and seeking to come together in a more aligned way.

Since then, [the father] has sent me a high level of emails, asking interrogative questions about my enquiries and whether I have completed tasks he believes are pertinent to my assessment.  He has made comments about what he hopes and expects to have been included in the report.  He has made a Subject Access Request as he wishes to compare the questions asked of him, to those asked of the children&#8217;s mother, as he suspects racial bias.

However, considering these messages and ones provided by [the father] there is a persistence to some of [the father&#8217;s] communication that could be perceived by [the mother] as attempts to control.  In making this comment I must consider the history of this case and the findings that have been made against [the father] via the Judgement of 2017.

Further the real issue is not whether the father can provide an academically sound analysis of domestic abuse, but rather whether he understands the impact of his behaviour and shows remorse.  Ms Senior does not discuss remorse at all.</p>

There is nothing in the notes to suggest that &#8220;he minimised [his abusive] behaviour as being a result of a period of stress and grief.&#8221;  Rather the father was explaining the background.  Indeed his account tends to show some reflectiveness on the part of the father as to the way in which and the reasons why the relationship with the mother developed as it did.</p>

The children are well provided for at the mother&#8217;s.  Any change is likely to be undesirable.  The current contact between the children on the one hand and the father and the father&#8217;s extended family on the other is working well and in my judgment is of benefit to the children.</span></p>

The question of religion is the subject of an application for the determination of a specific issue.  In fact, however, the issue between the parents is quite a narrow one relating essentially to practicalities.  Neither parent wants the Court to determine the faith in which the children should be brought up.  Both agree that that is a matter for the children themselves to determine as they grow up.  (At present, Cala says she wants to be both Christian and Muslim, but this may present theological difficulties.)</span></p>

The father and the mother live over thirty miles away from each other.  The father&#8217;s mosque is near his home, but does not provide classes for children at the weekend, only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  The children would thus need to be transported across London mid-week if they were to attend classes there.  The parties agree that transport is a matter for the father to arrange.  The mother, however, considers that the father should take the children to the mosque at the weekend rather than disrupting them during the week.</span></p>

An obvious possibility would be for that day to be changed, so that the children could go to the mosque before eating with the father.  It might also be possible to find a mosque nearer the mother&#8217;s home.  (The father has family members who live in that part of London, so this may not be too difficult to arrange.)

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second ground for making the order is said to be the risk of the father using any application as a form of coercion against the mother.  Care needs in my judgment to be taken with this way of putting the case for a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order.  It occasionally happens that parties to Court proceedings conduct &#8220;friendly litigation&#8221;.  This, however, is rare.  The usual purpose of litigation is to coerce the other side.  A creditor wants to use the power of the state to coerce the debtor into payment of his debt, if necessary by levying execution.  A father wants contact with his children, to be enforced if necessary by the state punishing the mother for not allowing contact.</p>

Rather <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91</ref>A(2) requires the Court to be satisfied that an application would put &#8220;the child concerned&#8230; at risk of harm.&#8221;  Now in some cases it will be obvious that the number of applications to the Court is having a harmful effect on the children.  This, however, will be fact-sensitive.  It cannot be assumed that litigation will always harm children.  In particular, where an application has resulted in contact arrangements being made which are to the benefit of the children, it will not in general be possible to say that the application has harmed the child.  To the contrary, the application will have benefited the children.</p>

The Court will often be able to say that the children need a break from litigation for at least a couple of years.  However, before making such an order, it does need evidence that the children have been or will be harmed.</p>

The previous applications resulted in the children having direct contact with their father, which was to their benefit.  The risk of harm occurring in the future seems to be posited on the father constituting an ongoing risk to the children, but I have refused to make such a finding.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, there is no sufficient evidence that a further application by the father will put the children or either of them at a risk of harm.  In these circumstances, I have no jurisdiction to make a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order.  This is not to encourage the father to make further applications.  On the contrary, he should make every effort to agree contract arrangements voluntarily with the mother.  If he makes unreasonable applications the Court can revisit the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> question.</p>

An important consideration in my judgment is that the father has had a reasonable degree of success in the applications he has brought.  The first application established that he needed successfully to complete a DAPP in order to have direct access to the children.  The second application gave effect to the earlier order once the father completed the DAPP.  In 2021 he obtained further contact.  His application for enforcement of the contact arrangements against the mother was not proceeded with, but this is usual and proper when contact arrangements have been restored.  His current application was prompted by the children&#8217;s reaction to him after they saw (as I have found they did see) the abhorrent anti-Islamic video.  Again he has in these current proceedings obtained the relief he has been seeking.</p>

Ms Senior had completed her report in draft for service on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2023, but the father had sent her emails raising various matters.

They were fearful as to how he might behave.  Ms Senior&#8217;s report is dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2023 (although it was completed earlier), but it was served only on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2023.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cafcass did not contact the Court to seek permission to adopt this strategy.  The deliberate late service of the report was in my judgment a direct interference with the course of justice.  Firstly, it meant that the parties could not provide position statements as ordered in February.  Secondly, it necessitated the mother&#8217;s legal representatives making an application dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2023 to adjourn the hearing on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2023, thus wasting costs and legal resources.  Thirdly, it meant that the father, a litigant-in-person, was hampered in obtaining advice prior to the hearing.  Fourthly, it may have contributed to the Order made on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2023 containing no recital of the issues of fact which were in dispute.</p>

In the event, that risk did not eventuate.  The order that contact continue, but with supervision by the paternal uncle, was appropriate and was not affected by Cafcass&#8217;s behaviour.  But it might very easily have been different.  For example, the father was lucky that he was able overnight to obtain the uncle&#8217;s agreement to supervise contact.</p>
