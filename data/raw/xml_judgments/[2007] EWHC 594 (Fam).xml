The wife applies for the decision to be affirmed on additional grounds, in connection with which she seeks the admission of further evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By subsequent order, the District Judge, upon certain undertakings of the parties, ordered that the husband should forthwith transfer to the wife all his legal and beneficial interests in the Wembley property, the former matrimonial home, which was subject to a mortgage in favour of the Bank of Scotland.  She further ordered that a number of other properties in London comprising the husband&#8217;s property portfolio in the United Kingdom be sold forthwith at the best price obtainable, the net proceeds to be held by the husband&#8217;s solicitors and applied (a) in paying the remainder of those solicitors legal fees permitted pursuant to an earlier order of the court; (b) in paying the outstanding balance of the husband&#8217;s UK tax liability of &#163;115,000.00 together with accrued interest; (c) such interim liabilities as the party&#8217;s solicitors might agree; (d) certain valuation costs; (e) the remainder to be paid to the wife, subject to a stay of any sum up to &#163;220,000 until 9 February 2007.  The order provided for nominal periodical payments in favour of each child of the marriage until the age of seventeen or completion of their full-time secondary education and otherwise dismissed all forms of financial provision, pension sharing and property adjustment orders as between the parties.  The order further provided, inter alia, that the husband pay the wife&#8217;s costs to a maximum of &#163;100,000 inclusive of VAT, to be assessed if not agreed, with provision also for a detailed assessment of the wife&#8217;s publicly funded costs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The bare facts are these.  The parties were married in 1990 and separated in early 2004.  They have three children: J, aged 12, R, aged 8, and S, aged 4, all in the care of the mother.  Each party has an adult child by a former relationship.  The mother does no formal work.  She ceased working when S was born and plaited the hair of family friends for &#163;25.00 a head as pin money until the husband stopped her from doing it.  She is currently in receipt of benefits.  The husband was described by the judge as &#8220;fully capable of earning without constraint&#8221;. Since 2003 he has been pursuing a career as a businessman and property investor in the US.  However his income and profits are obscure as a result of the judge&#8217;s total rejection of his frankness on this topic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the parties met, the husband was a builder.  From 1997 he started to purchase properties and build up a portfolio in that respect.  Initial deposits came from family loans and properties were purchased by means of mortgages.  With the rise in property values the husband would raise further money by re-mortgage and purchase additional properties.  Some were resold and others were rented out by way of investment, often in multiple occupation.  By 2003, there were difficulties in the marriage.  The husband decided he would move to the United States and start to build up a property portfolio there.  He began to do so, using UK funds for that purpose.  He is now resident in Florida running a property and child day-care business.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the course of her judgment, the District Judge made clear her strongly adverse views upon the credit of the husband, whose evidence as to the build up of his business, lack of frankness in relation to the detail of his dealings and liabilities, and determination to reduce the availability of his assets to his wife in respect of her admitted needs, were all roundly condemned by the judge.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Upon this appeal, Mr Sanders for the husband does not seek to disturb any of those findings.  However, he relies upon the fact that the District Judge stated in the course of her judgment that the many criticisms she had made of the husband did not lead her to infer that he had assets in the US or elsewhere which he had not disclosed.  Based on that finding, it is the essence of the appeal that, however adverse the view formed by the District Judge of the husband&#8217;s conduct and, whatever her view as to his lack of frankness in relation to his income, the District Judge was in error in disregarding and/or failing to deduct the husband&#8217;s liability to capital gains tax when assessing the value of the properties available for distribution. In his skeleton argument the husband seeks an order on this appeal that he pay the wife a lump sum of &#163;240,000 only i.e. in round terms he seeks to deduct from the sum awarded to the wife his potential liability to Capital Gains Tax.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to the detailed argument of the husband, I shall turn briefly to the structure of the judgment of the District Judge, pausing only to observe that no criticism is made of that structure, nor is any mistake or misapplication of principle identified save for the submission that, on the figures available, the award was manifestly excessive, it being submitted that the District Judge allowed her extensive criticisms of the husband (not in themselves challenged) to lead her to make an order which was manifestly unfair.</p>

The combined total of property unsold in the UK, property sold here and property in the US is just under &#163;700,000.  It appears that &#163;115,500.00 is still to be paid to the Inland Revenue in UK tax and that &#163;230,000.00 odd may be due under US CGT law.  That is a total of about &#163;345,000.00 which would reduce the net level available to &#163;355,000.00.  About &#163;134,000.00 of that is in US property, &#163;221,000.00 in the UK, of which &#163;132,000.00 is said to be the equity in the family home. </p>

Properties were sold, more properties were bought and they were let out as rooms or flats.  The husband used his business entity as a building firm whenever convenient.  His evidence to me was that he had a &#163;3 million credit line from the Bank of Scotland to build up the business so that mortgage applications forms for particular loans were merely a tiresome formality&#8221;</p>

That is the inference which she has drawn, based on the previous lifestyle and activities of the husband, and his ability to defer his debts, and to find or raise funds when required.  The inference which the judge drew was one, not of the existence of additional assets, but of an available line of credit and a business acumen which has plainly been used by the husband in the past to sustain a substantial lifestyle quite unsustainable on the means of support or former level of income disclosed to the court or revealed in evidence, but which must have been available to sustain it.</p>

Adding that figure to the &#163;80,500 deficit above referred to, the overall position is reached in which the husband has a total asset deficit of &#163;145,000, plus his liability for costs of &#163;100,000 ordered by the judge.

So far as fairness is concerned, the judge attached great importance, as she was entitled to do, to the fact that, since the break-up of the marriage the husband had transferred out of the jurisdiction &#163;300,000 which could have been used to pay the whole of the UK tax debt and a fair proportion of the United States liability to CGT (see para 42 of the judgment, quoted at paragraph 23 above).</p>

Nor does he suggest that there was any mistake made or material matter omitted in the course of her review of the position or in reaching her conclusion; he simply attacks the fairness of that conclusion to the extent that it failed to allow for the burden of the husband&#8217;s debt to be shared by the wife.  Nor does Mr Sanders suggest that the judge was not entitled to take into account the husband&#8217;s ability to borrow and survive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given the judge&#8217;s assessment of the husband, and of his propensity and abilities as a businessman and income-earner, I do not regard the judge&#8217;s order as manifestly unfair.  It is evident that she carefully weighed and considered every aspect of the parties&#8217; position so far as she was able to do so in the light of the husband&#8217;s history of evasion and the glaring insufficiencies in his evidence.  So far as fairness was concerned, she was faced with a history of studied indifference by the husband to his family obligations and a situation where he had transferred assets to the United States for his own benefit, leaving behind mounting arrears of mortgage debt and nothing but diminishing equity to secure the housing needs of his wife and family in this country.  To have permitted the husband to raid his diminishing UK assets further for his own benefit at a time when he appeared successfully to have established a home, business and lifestyle for himself in the United States, would in my view itself have been manifestly unfair.  Given the circumstances, it was legitimate for the judge to follow the line of reasoning adopted by Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic">Rye v Rye </span>and in my view the main appeal should fail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have felt able to reach that conclusion without the necessity to rule upon the admissibility of certain further evidence sought to be advanced by the wife and made the subject of her application to admit further evidence referred to at the beginning of this judgment.  It was agreed between the parties at the outset that I should consider such evidence <span style="font-style:italic">de bene esse</span> and rule upon the application when delivering judgment on the appeal.  Without going into detail, that evidence appeared to demonstrate the existence of a previously undisclosed Abbey bank account in the name of the husband into which rents of at least one of the husband&#8217;s properties are being paid. If that is correct, it is hardly a surprise, bearing in mind the judge&#8217;s findings and her approach to the new evidence of the husband.  However, not only is the application made very late, the evidence is insufficient to show the existence of any substantial undeclared assets; it would thus have been unlikely to have any material effect on the overall conclusion of the judge.  I therefore make no order upon the application to admit further evidence and I have taken no account of it in coming to my decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Sanders for the husband puts his point quite shortly.  He submits that there is nothing, or at any rate insufficient, in the nature or conduct of the proceedings to justify an order for costs against the husband, particularly in a case where the effect of such order was to add to the burden of the husband&#8217;s debts.  He submits that, since the level of the wife&#8217;s publicly funded costs as estimated below was some &#163;52,000.00 only, that was not an inordinate amount for the wife to sustain as the amount of his recovery subject to the charge in favour of the Legal Services Commission.  Alternatively, Mr Sanders submits that the judge should have capped the costs payable by the husband in a sum sufficient to cover the wife&#8217;s publicly funded costs but no more, rather than the substantially higher figure of &#163;100,000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Miscampbell for the wife, on the other hand, makes three broad points in resistance to those submissions.  First, she relies upon the discretionary nature of the judge&#8217;s decision in relation to costs and the consequent need for Mr Sanders to point to some plain error underlying, or manifest unfairness resulting from, the judge&#8217;s order for costs.  Second, she relies on to the terms of the judgment itself, in which the judge made clear her disapproval of the husband&#8217;s history of evasion and non-co-operation in the conduct of the proceedings, including his evidence at trial.  The fact that the judge was not prepared to infer that, by the time of trial, the husband was in possession of assets which he had not disclosed, did not amount to an exoneration of his earlier evasion and misconduct which had greatly added to the costs and complication of the proceedings.  Third, Ms Miscampbell  stresses the adverse effect of the LSC charge upon the proceeds of sale of those properties ordered to be transferred to the wife, the impact of which will in any event serve to reduce the award in her hands to a point where her ability to purchase a new home will be imperilled.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view this is a case in which the judge was fully entitled to make the order which she did.  She plainly regarded the husband&#8217;s conduct of the litigation as an extension of his determined campaign, which had started well before the litigation, to collar the family assets for his own benefit and evade his financial obligations towards his wife.  Indeed, the judge set out his lack of frankness and failure to co-operate in the proceedings in some detail at paragraphs 33-40 of her judgment.  While it is of course true that the costs order added to the husband&#8217;s burden of debt, there is no reason to think that the judge overlooked that effect, or that she intended otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the suggestion that the judge should have capped the husband&#8217;s costs liability in a sum equal to the wife&#8217;s publicly funded costs.  Whereas in family cases the overall effect of a costs order upon the means of the parties is an element which may be taken into account on a division of the assets, the effect of the costs order suggested is inevitably to defeat the right of the successful assisted party&#8217;s solicitors under Regulation 107B of the <span style="font-style:italic">Civil Legal Aid (General)Regulations 1989</span> to recover a sum in respects of costs from the paying party greater than that which he is entitled to receive on the basis only of an LSC assessment.  While the effect of Regulation 107B involves a notional dis-application of the indemnity principle in relation to <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes </span>costs orders (see <span style="font-style:italic">Rayden &amp; Jackson </span>(18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Ed) para 54.53) it nonetheless gives effect to the broad principle underlying the Legal Aid scheme that the rights conferred on a person receiving legal aid do not affect the rights or liabilities of other parties to the proceedings or the principles on which the discretion of the court is normally exercised:  see s.22 of the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/22" uk:canonical="1999 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Access to Justice Act 1999</ref></span>.  Thus the normal rules and principles governing the award of costs apply as between an assisted and an unassisted party.  I am not aware whether or not a submission was ever made to the judge that the yardstick for the cap upon the husband&#8217;s liability to pay the wife&#8217;s costs should be the estimated amount of her publicly funded costs; however, whether or not that was the case, I am satisfied that the judge made no error of principle in making the order which she did.</p>
