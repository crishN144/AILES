This requires me to consider a number of ethical issues, but perhaps most commonly whether patients have sufficient capacity to consent for various procedures. Based on my experience with the committee, I have absolutely no doubt that Ken has full capacity to not only determine broad decisions, but also to take into consideration even minor bits of information that might have a subtle influence on his decision. I am, of course, not a financial expert, but I think it would be impossible for Ken to have full capacity to make the sort of decisions he has made with regard to his health, and not be in a position to manage his own finances. I would therefore be prepared to support his application to regain control of his finances and, if required, would be more than happy to provide a report for the court, should it be necessary.</span></p>

There has been no breach of a previous order and the summary dismissal of the objections without any hearing is both procedurally wrong and unfair.

The appellants appreciate entirely that his decision to revoke the EPA may be capacitous and, if he also has the capacity to manage his property and affairs, that he is entitled to make gifts to anyone, including his wife and his new family, whatever their views on the prudence of his expenditure given his advancing years. However, the appellants consider that they have at all times acted in what they consider to be their father&#8217;s best interests and are extremely saddened that their attempts to be cautious have resulted in a breakdown in their relationship with him and their stepmother.

There is no question of bias, or a lack of independence, or a conflict of interests, or any other vitiating factor that would undermine his opinion on Ken&#8217;s capacity. </span></p>
