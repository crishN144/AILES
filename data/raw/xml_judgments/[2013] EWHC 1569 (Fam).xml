The father said that he was concerned about some swelling on the baby&#8217;s head. The GP was unable to notice much by way of swelling, but did notice a clicking sound in her chest and a bruise on her chest near to the location from where the sound appeared to emanate. As a result, M was referred to hospital. On initial examination, she appeared to be well, happy and alert, but further investigations revealed that she had sustained multiple skull fractures, and rib fractures of two different ages. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">These discoveries set in train care proceedings in respect of M and her older brother L. In May 2012, HHJ Marshall in the Swindon CC found that M&#8217;s injuries had been inflicted non-accidentally in the care of her parents. The judge&#8217;s findings were, however, the subject of a successful appeal to the Court of Appeal, who ordered a retrial before a judge of the Family Division. This judgment is delivered at the conclusion of that retrial. Having heard submissions, I give leave for it to be reported on an anonymised basis &#8211; that is to say on the strict understanding that no person other than the advocates and solicitors and any other person named in the judgment shall be identified and in particular the anonymity of the children and the adult members of the family must be strictly preserved.</span></p>

His mother came from Sri Lanka and he spent his early years in that country but at the age of 14 came to live with his father in the UK. He is a serving soldier in the army. The mother was born in 1983 and is therefore now aged 30. The parents met via the internet in 2002 and were married in December 2004. </span></p>

The father is, they say, an introvert, very laid back, whereas the mother, is something of an extrovert and is said to worry about things more. She describes herself as boisterous, lively, easy going and ready to try anything. In the past, she worked, has a love of animals and has always kept a large number of pets. The evidence suggests that they are a close couple. Although they have arguments on occasions, they both deny that either has a temper. </span></p>

On 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'"> November 2008, the mother gave birth to their first child, L. After L was born, the mother had difficulty forming a close bond with him and describes their relationship as &#8216;distant&#8217;.  The father later told the police that he was the &#8220;sole carer&#8221; of L for the first three or four months. The mother sought advice from a neighbour with whom she had formed a friendship. Unfortunately, this friendship soon turned very sour indeed. The neighbour made a number of complaints against the mother, contacting social services alleging that the mother was neglecting L. There was no evidence to back up these allegations. The professionals involved with the family, in particular the health visitor, expressed no such concerns. However, social services decided to start a section 47 investigation, and a social worker made an unannounced visit to the home accompanied by a police officer. This investigation proved very unsettling to the parents but resulted in a positive assessment. L was described as a well cared for and contented baby. The home was described as well maintained, clean and safe. The report noted that there appeared to be a positive attachment between mother and baby. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">Despite this positive outcome, the mother was very unsettled by the complaint and as a result the health visitor expressed concerns about her mental health and its impact upon her ability to care for the baby. The mother also felt that the escalating problems with the neighbour were impinging upon her health and her capacity to care for L. The parents described how the mother would hand the baby over to the father when she found it difficult to cope because of her low mood. Despite these difficulties, the mother refused the offer of anti-depressants. By April 2009, however, her mood had improved.</span></p>

L was referred for a medical examination on the following morning, by which time all the marks had disappeared. The doctor thought it therefore very unlikely that the marks had been true petechiae. There was no evidence that L had suffered any kind of trauma. </span></p>

After the complaint to social services, the neighbour complained to the RSPCA alleging that the couple were abusing animals in the house. When the RSPCA inspected however, they had no concerns. The neighbour made a further complaint that the couple were damaging their property, which belonged to the Ministry of Defence, but again an inspection revealed this allegation to be untrue. </span></p>

At about this time, the mother became pregnant again. During the pregnancy, the father decided to abandon his plans of qualifying as a specialist pilot and was transferred to other work. At this time, he became dissatisfied about the way he was being treated by the Army.</span></p>

She then had to go through the traumatic experience of giving birth with the knowledge that at the end of her labour there would be no live baby. Like Judge Marshall, I find it difficult to imagine the anguish and emotional impact of such experience. It is clear from their written statements, and their oral evidence before me, that the parents continue to feel the loss of the baby, whom they named C, very keenly. The father believes that C&#8217;s death was caused in some way by the stress placed upon the family by their various experiences. Neither parent sought any bereavement counselling, preferring to deal with their grief without professional assistance. </span></p>

On examination by the health visitor, a long lump of about 2.5 cm in length was noted along the line of the coronal suture. The GP who examined M later that day thought that there was nothing to indicate that this was a cause for concern. </span></p>

In particular, as stated above, the mother had to look after the children by herself for several weeks while the father was away. In addition, both children, and the mother herself, were unwell at times. The mother also had financial worries dating back to before she was married. On the other hand, the parents were relieved to be away from the troubles at their previous location and, having lived through the trauma of losing a baby, felt that they now had a new start in a new home and with a second child.</span></p>

While she was in the bath with M, and as she was in the process of getting out of the bath, she slipped and grabbed M tightly in order to avoid dropping her. Following this incident, M became distressed and was unsettled for the rest of the evening and during the night. I shall consider this incident in more detail below. Afterwards, the mother did not seek medical attention for M, nor did she mention it to the father. The mother also referred in evidence to an incident when she had been asleep in bed with M and the baby had suddenly cried out. The mother woke and found M against the headboard. The mother wondered later whether she had inadvertently hit out in her sleep and accidentally struck M. A similar thing had apparently happened on one occasion when the mother had accidentally struck the father in her sleep. </span></p>

There was little attachment between them. In contrast to their relationship with L at the corresponding stage, the roles of the parents were reversed. Whereas with L it had been the mother who had found it difficult to form a bond in the early months and the father had stepped in, with M there was a close relationship with the mother from the outset but the father found it difficult to establish a bond. In evidence, the father said that it felt as though he was a stranger to M, and that she &#8220;completely rejected&#8221; him. During this period, the father would work a shift pattern of 4 days followed by 4 nights followed by 4 days off. During his days off, however, he sometimes took on other jobs. This pattern limited the time he was available to spend with the children. Thus, although the father was back in the house, the greater part of the responsibility for caring for the children was taken on by the mother. M was, in the mother&#8217;s phrase, a nightowl who slept a lot during the day and awoke for a time at night.</span></p>

According to the mother, the father was present during this feed. The father said that he saw nothing of M in the mother&#8217;s care that morning. Although as the mother said in evidence, M was in a playful mood as usual at that time, neither parent noticed nothing wrong with the baby at this stage and M was put back to sleep. The mother subsequently got up L who was going out on an outing with her brother. After they had left, the mother started to prepare a bottle for M and asked father to go and get the baby. It is his case that, when he picked M up, he noticed for the first time a bump on the side of her head. He took the baby downstairs to show the bump to the mother. She describes how, when he came downstairs with the baby, the father was &#8216;looking pale and his hands were shaking&#8217;. The mother describes the bump as &#8216;huge&#8217; and &#8216;something you could not fail to notice&#8217;. The swelling appeared to extend from her right eye to the back of her head. There is a dispute as to whether or not the mother later said that L&#8217;s right eye was affected by the swelling. The mother emphatically denies that she said this. In addition, as she was holding M, the mother noticed what she describes as &#8216;a sort of clicking in her ribs&#8217;. Although she had previously heard M making a rattling or crackling sound when she was breathing, this was very different from the clicking noise she observed on this occasion. </span></p>

It seemed to me that, as a key part of the &#8220;conundrum&#8221; identified by Judge Marshall had been the apparent absence of any evidence of brain damage, it would be helpful to obtain a further opinion from an expert whose particular expertise was the interpretation of neuro-imaging of children. The material available to Dr. Stoodley included not only the x-rays and CT scans carried out in August 2011 but also fresh magnetic resonance images taken in September 2012, as a result of concerns about an aspect of her motor development. Dr. Stoodley duly prepared a report, and took part in a further telephone conference with the other experts. All the experts then contributed to a schedule of agreement and disagreement.</span></p>

In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of non-accidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so </p>

Dr. Halliday in oral evidence said that there is no description in the literature, or in anyone&#8217;s experience, of a healing reaction being seen less than 4 days after fracture. It is unusual to see healing as soon as four days after the injury. Both radiologists agreed that the healing process is usually observed later than this; Dr Halliday told the court that the healing process normally occurred at around 7 days, and Dr Chapman that the typical bracket is 7 to 10 days. Thus the expert opinion of the radiologists is that the earliest date on which the 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Verdana">th</span><span style="font-family:Verdana"> rib facture could have been sustained is 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Verdana">st</span><span style="font-family:Verdana"> August 2011.

The healing process begins immediately so the further away from the fracture the less likely there will be movement at the fracture site.  He thought it logical to conclude that it would be more obvious soon after the fracture, although he told the court in oral evidence that he had experience of one case in which crepitus had been observed 3 days after the fracture &#8211; in a 3-day-old baby who had sustained a fracture at birth. He regarded this as indicating that crepitus may not be an absolute indicator of timing. Professor Bishop observed that crepitus will be there from the moment the bone is broken until the moment it becomes solid. He added: &#8220;without doing specific experiments in human children it is very difficult to be certain. Animal studies suggest that the healing has usually stabilised the bone within about one week and up to 14 days after the fracture occurred.&#8221; </span></p>

The court has experience in other cases of the evidence of radiologists being contradicted by pathologists following a physical examination of a bone in a post mortem examination. I also accept that the court must consider all the evidence on this point, including the clinical presentation of the child. Nonetheless, I found the evidence of Dr. Chapman and Dr. Halliday as to the dating of the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> rib facture to be compelling. I reject the suggestion made by Frank Feehan QC and Alexa Storey-Rea in closing submissions that there was an element of dogmatism in their evidence on this point. Their combined experience of interpreting x-rays of rib fractures leads them to advise the court that, at the outside, the fracture of M&#8217;s 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> rib occurred at the latest on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August and more probably a few days earlier. I do not consider that the evidence as to crepitus undermined their opinion on this point, and in any event I found Prof Bishop&#8217;s more detailed explanation as to crepitus more persuasive than that given by Dr. Chapman. Before reaching a final conclusion as to timing of the rib fractures, however, I must of course consider the medical evidence in the light of the other evidence to which I shall turn later.</p>

He also observed what he described as two or three short lines extending from the sagittal suture into each parietal bone which could represent further fractures. Alternatively, he thought they might represent normal variants know as &#8220;fissures&#8221;, fibrous areas where the bone is not quite as well formed. Subsequently in oral evidence before me he described how the skull bones form in a radial or &#8220;star&#8221; pattern which sometimes results in areas between the &#8220;rays&#8221; of the star that are not fully formed in the baby&#8217;s skull, remnants of the incomplete ossification of the bone. It is quite common to see fissures going out from the main sutures into the skull in a young baby, although they become less common as the child grows and the bone becomes completely ossified.</p>

In addition to the radiological evidence available at the time of the first hearing before Judge Marshall, he had available the results of an MRI carried out on M in September 2012, some 13 months after her admission to hospital, following a referral because of some concerns about her development  These revealed some evidence of diffuse axonal injury in the left frontal region of her brain. Furthermore, taking up the suggestion made by Munby LJ, Dr. Stoodley helpfully cited a number of further research papers, of which the most recent and important was &#8220;Skull fracture vs accessory sutures: how can we tell the difference?&#8221; (Sanchez et al, Emergency Radiology 2010 17:413) to illustrate and support his interpretation of the imaging. </p>

The parietal bone ossifies from two centres while the occipital bone ossifies from six centers. An accessory intraparietal of subsagittal suture is rare but can be seen dividing the parietal bone. They can be explained on the basis of incomplete union of the two separate ossification centers. The occipital bone has a more complex development. The foramen magnum is surrounded by four ossification centers &#8230;.This pattern of development can therefore give rise to numerous accessory sutures that could be mistaken for fractures especially with plain film evaluation alone. CT scan with 3D reconstruction is vital in the further characterisation of a questionable fracture.&#8221; </p>

He thought that small lines emerging at right angles from several of the sutures represented fissures. More significant was his suggestion that several of the longer lines were accessory sutures. In particular, he put forward the proposition that the lines crossing the two parietal bones from the coronal suture to the lambdoid suture had the appearance of intraparietal accessory sutures, and the line emanating from the left bottom corner of the lambdoid suture and travelling up the occipital bone before meeting the lambdoid suture at a higher point was an accessory occipital suture. A 3D reconstruction of the images reinforced his interpretation of these lucencies, and in addition demonstrated a faint line, which he interpreted as a further accessory occipital suture, emanating from the right bottom corner of the lambdoid suture and travelling up the occipital bone to the apex of the lambdoid suture close to its junction with the sagittal suture. He noted that there was an element of symmetry in the appearance of the bilateral lucencies which he considered &#8220;noteworthy in terms of potentially random events leading to fractures&#8221;. </p>

He thought that some of the lines seen on the images had the appearance of fractures, in particular three lucencies extending from the top of the skull more or less at a right angle to the sagittal suture, two descending the right parietal bone and one the left parietal bone, in each case joining the line crossing the parietal bone which Dr. Stoodley interpreted as an accessory parietal suture. In addition, he considered that a line emanating from the left accessory intraparietal suture had the appearance of a fracture, because (a) it is generally held that sutures do not branch and (b) the images indicated that there was a degree of depression associated with the lucency. </p>

Indeed, if (contrary to his preferred view) the court concluded that all the lucencies were fractures, he thought it very unlikely that they could be reasonably explained on the basis of a single impact event. Most of the lucencies were not associated with soft tissue swelling and therefore if they were fractures it was possible that they had occurred earlier so that any swelling that might have been caused at the time of the fractures had disappeared by 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August when M was presented to the GP. If, on the other hand, the court accepted his view as to the presence of accessory intraparietal and occipital sutures, Dr. Stoodley thought it might be possible to explain the fractures emanating from the sagittal suture and any fractures extending from the intraparietal sutures on the basis of a single impact towards the top of the head. </p>

Following the experts&#8217; telephone conference, further X-rays of M&#8217;s skull were taken which revealed no evidence of further fractures. All the lucencies seen on the previous images had disappeared. Dr. Chapman thought that the fact that the lines which Dr. Stoodley proposed as accessory sutures had disappeared was some evidence that they were fractures, since there is some suggestion in the literature that such accessory sutures may continue into adulthood.</p>

At the end of his oral evidence in answer to a question from me, Dr. Chapman listed a number of features, based on further research, which supported his interpretation of the lucencies as fractures rather than accessory sutures, namely the rarety of accessory sutures, the absence of Wormian bones, the fact that the lucencies had disappeared on the latest x-rays, the fact that accessory sutures are 5 times more common in men than women, and the fact that unilateral accessory sutures are 5 times more common than bilateral.</p>

He accepted that intraparietal sutures are rare &#8211; during his career he has only seen one and prior to this case he had never seen them bilaterally &#8211; but that was what these lucencies looked like. In contrast, accessory sutures in the occipital bone are more common &#8211; he has seen a considerable number, although prior to this case he could not recall seeing two in one bone. He added &#8220;the fact that a condition is acknowledged as being rare is not perhaps the important issue &#8211; the most important issue is whether the patient has that rare condition or not&#8221;.

He agreed with the observations of Dr. Fairhurst, the radiologist who first reported on the imaging in hospital, that there were features commonly found in non-accidental head injury, including bilateral fractures, separation of the fracture margins, and complex branching of the fractures.</p>

It is accepted, however, that X-rays are not particularly accurate in detecting bone fragility. For that reason, Professor Bishop, an expert in paediatric bone disease, was instructed to carry out a further assessment. Having analysed the original X-rays, together with further images taken specifically for the purpose of his assessment, examined M, and taken a detailed family history, he concluded that she has a normal skeleton with no evidence of any known type of underlying bone fragility. The fact that the recent X-rays demonstrate that M has not sustained any further fractures, and is now a toddler and thus prone to more accidental falls, is further evidence against bone fragility. </p>

If anything, she thought the fibrous fissures, being less brittle than bone, might be more accommodating and less likely to fracture, although she added that this was all theory and speculation. Dr. Stoodley, however, whilst agreeing that there is no specific association between fissures and fractures, suspected &#8211; without any evidence, as he candidly accepted &#8211; that, if there is a fissure within a bone, then any trauma to that area may cause a fracture with a lesser degree of force than would be required if a fissure was not present. </p>

Later, however, when I asked whether the fact that the three fractures of the parietal bone emanated from the sagittal suture at right angles suggested that they were originally fissures, Dr. Stoodley replied that he could not exclude that as a possibility on the basis of the imaging appearances. This led him to suggest that the presence of fissures could lead to fractures extending from them as a result of a lesser degree of force than would be required to produce the same pattern of fracture in the absence of such fissures. Like Dr. Halliday, he acknowledged that this was speculation, the basis for which was the assumption that, if you have a complete plate of bone, it is probably stronger than areas of bone which have not fully developed and have areas of fibrous tissue within them. But he also cited his experience of cases in which there had been pathological evidence of a traumatised fissure with an associated fracture. He added, however, that the level of force required to cause a fracture was unlikely to be significantly reduced by the presence of fissures. If it were otherwise, in Dr. Stoodley&#8217;s words, &#8220;we should not be having this discussion because there would be an obvious association, and there patently isn&#8217;t&#8221;. </p>

The process of ossification from cartilage is different from the development from membrane. Thus whether or not there was any link between the immaturity of the skull bones and any propensity to skull fractures, there was no known link between immaturity of the skull bones and propensity to fracture elsewhere in the skeleton. </p>

He added, however, that it was possible that the diffuse axonal injury seen on the later MRI performed in September 2012 related back to the incident or incidents that caused the skull fractures in 2011. The fact that M did not have any abnormal neurology would not exclude the diffuse axonal injury being related to an acute event at or around that time because &#8220;frontal pathology &#8230; is often clinically silent&#8221;.  He added that it was very unusual to see diffuse axonal injury in a domestic setting. However, importantly, Dr. Stoodley did not accept the view that the absence of evidence of brain injury was of particular significance. In every day neuroradiological practice he regularly sees cases where skull fractures of various types have occurred as a result of impact head trauma in the absence of any associated brain injury. Even if the court concluded (contrary to his opinion) that all the lucencies seen on the imaging were fractures, it is not inevitable that there would have been associated brain injury. He suggested that the cases to which Mr. Richards alluded (for example, involving a helicopter accident) were only relevant if they were cases in which there was extensive skull fracture in the absence of brain injury. </p>

The diffuse axonal injury observed in the September 2012 MR imaging comprised a number of small areas in the left frontal lobe. Although Dr. Stoodley was unable to rule out the possibility of long-term consequences, he said that the injury is in the area of the brain where such damage will not necessarily have any significant effect on M&#8217;s long-term development.

In evidence in chief, Prof Bishop said that a child who has weaker or more fragile bones experiences the same amount of pain from a fracture as a child with normal bones, and similarly will experience the same amount of pain afterwards when the fracture site is handled until the healing process leads to stabilising of the bone. He added, however, that with children who are unable to comment or make themselves understood, it can sometimes be difficult to discern pain or the cause for pain &#8211; whether it is due to a fracture or to something else. He also said that, with rib fractures, it can be difficult to detect pain because the ribs tend to splint one another and reduce the amount of movement and therefore the level of pain, although there would be pain when pressure was applied to the area of the fracture. When Frank Feehan QC drew his attention to the note made by Dr Scott-Jupp of his examination of M in hospital on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August, in which she is described as happy and alert and not in pain when the area of the crepitus was examined, Prof Bishop thought that showed something about M&#8217;s perception of pain.</p>

In such a case, it was possible that the skull might absorb the impact and protect the brain so that the child had no neurological upset.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">As mentioned above, no MRI was carried out on M in August 2011. Dr. Stoodley reminded the court of the recommendation of the Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (&#8220;Standards for Radiological Investigations of Suspected Non-accidental Injury&#8221;, March 2008) that an MRI scan should be performed if an initial CT scan of a child is abnormal (para 15.3). He informed the court that there have been a number of recent cases in which such MRI has not been performed in these circumstances. Plainly from a forensic point of view, the absence of an MRI contemporaneous to the other imaging is a lacuna in the evidence. All the experts in this case agreed that an MRI should have been carried out at the time. I recognise, of course, that there may be clinical reasons why the treating physicians choose not to carry out imaging. I also note Mr. Richards&#8217; observation that resources for MR imaging are scarce. I share Dr. Stoodley&#8217;s view, however, that &#8220;whilst the lack of an MRI scan at the time of M&#8217;s acute admission will not have affected her clinical care, an opportunity was potentially lost to gain useful forensic information&#8221;. It may therefore be appropriate for the professional bodies to review this issue to establish the extent to which the Royal Colleges&#8217; recommendations are being followed</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">There is, in addition, a more fundamental point of general importance. This case demonstrates yet again the invaluable role played by medical experts in cases of alleged non-accidental injury. There is rightly a renewed scrutiny on the use of experts in family proceedings, and some potent arguments have been advanced against what is perceived as the misuse and overuse of experts. In response, the Family Procedure Rules have been amended so as to impose more stringent regulation of the instruction of experts. Henceforth, under the amended rule 25.1, &#8220;expert evidence will be restricted to that which in the opinion of the court is necessary to assist the court to resolve the proceedings&#8221;.</p>

The medical picture presented to Judge Marshall created what she thought, and Munby LJ in the CA agreed, was a conundrum. In directing a retrial, Munby LJ, whilst leaving the scope of the retrial to be decided by the judge conducting it, suggested that there should include a more exhaustive search of the literature. The instruction of Dr. Stoodley, a further search of the literature by the experts, and the process of the retrial in which the experts have each made an important contribution, have enabled this court to resolve the conundrum.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Court-appointed experts play a vital role in difficult cases of non-accidental injury. As this case demonstrates, it will ordinarily not be sufficient to rely on the opinion of the treating physicians in this type of case. In respect of M&#8217;s rib fractures, the court-appointed experts provided insights that would not otherwise have been available to the court. The radiologists who initially reported on the X-rays, but who were not called to give evidence in the hearing, identified evidence further possible ten rib fractures. Neither Dr. Chapman nor Dr. Halliday identified any fractures at these points, and the local authority has not pursued this issue. As Mr. Kirk pointed out in closing submissions, the consequence is that this case looks somewhat different from how it appeared initially to the treating physicians. Had the case been presented purely on the basis of their interpretations, the focus of the court would have been significantly different. In respect of the skull fractures, as both Dr. Stoodley and Mr. Richards recognised, it is possible that in the past lucencies that had been routinely but wrongly diagnosed as fractures in spite of the fact that it was recognised that fissures and other abnormalities existed. Both experts had been involved in a case in which they had diagnosed a fracture but a bone pathologist had identified a traumatised suture. As Mr. Richards said in evidence, &#8220;we are beginning to get pathological evidence coming out to make us re-think our thoughts about fissures and fractures in the same way [as] a few years ago we got more evidence about birth causing subdural haemorrhages.&#8221;  This is another example of how medical opinion about non-accidental head injury is continuing to evolve. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">This case provides further illustration of the important role of court-instructed experts in these difficult cases where the medical evidence is unusual and therefore outwith the experience of many hospital doctors. In the circumstances, it goes without saying that it is vital that experts of sufficient calibre and experience should continue to be available where the court considers their instruction necessary to resolve the proceedings. In the course of this trial, I have been informed that a number of doctors commonly instructed in these difficult cases are not at present accepting instructions. Any impediment to the instruction of experts in these difficult cases will make it much harder for the court to achieve a just and timely outcome for the child. </p>

I realised that I would not be able to reach down to the floor safely and so I held M up to my chest whilst I manoeuvred myself in the bath onto my knees. Once up on my knees, I held M with a hand under each of her armpits and stretched my arms out over the side of the bath to put her on the bath mat. As I started to lean down, I slipped to the left causing me to land against my hip with my knees going out from underneath me. My right armpit landed on the bath rail. It hurt so much that I think I momentarily lost my grip on M and instinctively I grabbed very tightly to stop her from falling onto the floor. M let out a high pitched scream and carried on screaming and crying for the next 15 minutes or so whilst I dried and dressed her. It took her a long time after that to settle in her bed and nearly an hour for me to give her a bottle. She would not settle that night and woke up within two hours of falling asleep which is not her usual routine although she had done this before when she has been suffering with colic and constipation. At the time, I put this down to her having been frightened by the sudden actions that I had made&#8221;.</span></p>

She had spilt some milk and I needed some wipes to clean it up. We have a solid wood coffee table in the living room which was further away from the sofa than it usually is on that occasion as L was playing with his toys. I stood up to get to the wet wipes and was pretty much stood up fully. M was cradled in my left elbow and I was reaching with my right hand for the wipes. She suddenly wriggled and I lost grip; she fell out of my arm. I heard a big thud on the coffee table and then another one as she fell onto the floor. M definitely hit the coffee table first; I didn&#8217;t see how she hit it/which part first but the noise also made it clear to me that she had hit it (the thud was clearly from an impact on wood). A hand towel was draped over her body whilst in my arms to prevent milk getting on her clothes and my eyes were focussing on the baby wipes I was reaching for. It all happened in a split second and the towel concealed my view&#8230;. On seeing M on the floor I panicked and couldn&#8217;t pick her up quickly enough. She was lying body faced down with her head turned to the side. I think I grabbed her under her armpits to pick her up. She was crying as I was picking her up, not a whinge type cry but a full blown cry; it was a very sudden and very loud cry. I tried to console her by talking to her and cuddling her. I checked her over for any signs of injury; I felt all of her limbs (she was wearing a body suit &#8211; short sleeved version I think). She had no marks on her. I also felt her neck and head. I was just instinctively checking for any obvious damage by smoothing my hand over her skin. She calmed down to a more normal cry whilst I was cuddling her. I think T [the mother] came back into the house after about 5-10 minutes after the fall. M was still crying. T asked me why she was crying when she came back; I replied I did not know. T took M and she then settled within about five minutes or maybe a little longer. Having not seen any obvious sign of injury, I hoped M was okay but I remained terrified as it was a significant incident. I was scared to tell T as I was worried about everything that had happened in Ipswich and I didn&#8217;t want to worry T or get social services involved. Although it was an accident, we had already been investigated on numerous occasions due to malicious referrals. I know that this was incredibly stupid of me and that I should have immediately told T what had happened. I haven&#8217;t forgiven myself for dropping M or from keeping it from T. M seemed to be fine during the evening. I think she was fed by T later that night. I remained scared, praying that she would be okay. When I held M later that night I subtly checked her again for any obvious sign of injury; I did not want T to know what I was doing though and so I was discreet.&#8221;</span></p>

She told the police (and confirmed in oral evidence to me that it was correct) that she had come in from the garden twice. On the first occasion, the crying stopped just as she entered, the father and M were on the sofa, she heard M burp, and thought that the feeding was over. She then went outside and the crying resumed. When the mother returned indoors, she found M looking very red faced and crying loudly. She was sitting in her chair and the father was on the sofa. The mother said that she asked the father what was wrong but he remained silent. She assumed that it was because M was upset at being with the father and so she picked her up. She gave her some calpol. It took at least half an hour to 40 minutes before M quietened down.  In oral evidence, the mother said that M had been &#8220;as miserable as sin&#8221;. According to the father, he did nothing else with M that day &#8211; he &#8220;completely shut down. I felt bad. An awful lot was going through my head. How to own up, how to tell T?

In particular, in giving his account to the police and to the social worker, he described the time for which M had cried as much shorter than in his statement in these proceedings cited above. At one point he told the police that she had cried for only a minute or so. According to the social worker&#8217;s note, the father said that he had &#8220;picked her up and she settled down and stopped crying. T came into the room and he did not tell her as he did not think that M had been seriously hurt.&#8221; This account is significantly different from that given in his statement, and from that given by the mother who describes in her statement how M was red and crying loudly when she came into the house, and that thereafter she took some 30 to 40 minutes to settle. According to Prof Bishop&#8217;s note taken during his examination of M on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012, the mother said that M had cried for about 20 minutes before she went into the house and 20 &#8211; 25 minutes afterwards. </p>

According to Prof Bishop&#8217;s note &#8211; which he said in evidence was made contemporaneously &#8211; the mother told him that she had not noticed the lump when she first fed M that day but at about 10.30 after being put down to sleep for one 1 to 1.5 hours; that the lump was big and that M&#8217;s right eye was closed. The mother emphatically denies that the eye was closed or that she had told Prof Bishop that it was. In his report, Prof Bishop does not refer to the eye being closed. He records the mother saying: &#8220;it was a large lump and the right side of her face was swollen.&#8221; In his oral evidence, however, he was clear that the mother had said that the eye was closed. I accept the professor&#8217;s evidence on this point. It follows that the mother has not told the truth. She has either given a false account to the professor or to the court or to both. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Fifth, if the lump was as large as the mother says it was on the morning of the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>, and she was in a state of high anxiety when she went next door to find out the details of the GP&#8217;s surgery from the neighbour, it is to my mind very surprising that she did not accompany the father and M to the surgery. If, as she says, she felt particularly protective about M, it is implausible that she would have chosen to stay to speak to an insurance representative.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Sixth, there is the evidence of one of the nurses that the mother said on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, after the father had given his account of dropping M and been arrested and taken to the police station, that <span style="font-family:'Baskerville Old Face'">she did not want the father to come back to the ward &#8220;in case he says something wrong&#8221;. The mother challenges this account, but having heard the nurse give evidence I am in no doubt that her verbatim note in the medical records is accurate and that she is telling the truth. Accordingly, I find that the mother has lied again on this point.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Seventh, I find M&#8217;s appearance when she was examined at the surgery and then at hospital was inconsistent with a child who had sustained multiple skull fractures less than 24 hours earlier. Mr. Richards said that, if M had been injured less than 24 hrs before she was seen by the medical professionals on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August 2001, he would have expected her to present as a child suffering a great deal of pain, and a massive swelling over the scalp. No such symptoms were seen in the surgery. The nurse noticed no swelling, only that the right side of the head looked larger than the left. The GP did not refer to seeing anything on the head at all. Neither mentioned any indication of pain, and the GP described M as &#8220;responding normally&#8221;. At the hospital, the SHO described M as &#8220;alert, happy, active&#8221; and by the consultant as &#8220;well, alert&#8221;. There was no evidence of the degree of swelling or pain that, according to Mr. Richards, would have been expected had she sustained the multiple fractures 24 hours earlier.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Finally, I take into account the way in which the parents&#8217; gave evidence about this issue. Making all allowances for the difficulties in giving evidence, in particular the passage of 21 months since M was admitted to hospital on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August, I found them to be hesitant and unreliable. In particular, I found the father&#8217;s account and demonstration of what he says happened on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August to be vague and unconvincing. I do not accept the submission that this should be attributed to grief and bewilderment.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">All these factors together point strongly towards a finding that the parents have not told the truth about this incident. There are, of course, a number of factors pointing the other way, and I turn to consider them now.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">First, it is pointed out that there is no other evidence that either M or L were mistreated in any way by their parents. On the contrary, there is a considerable body of evidence that they were well cared for. Because of the earlier, unwarranted, allegations made by the neighbour, the parents had been subjected to a degree of scrutiny not normally imposed on parents. The outcome of the s47 investigation, and of subsequent checks and assessments carried out by social workers and health visitors, was that L was provided with high quality care. There is less evidence from professionals about the care given to M, not least because the family moved and the mother did not register the children with a surgery prior to 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August. There is, however, no evidence that M was treated with any less care than her brother. Such evidence as there is &#8211; from neighbours and family members &#8211; suggests that both children were being well looked after in the weeks and days leading up to 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> August. Specifically, there is no evidence that M displayed signs of having incurred a head injury. Mr. Kirk and Miss Rogers submit with justification that the mother and father are in all respects respectable, hard-working, devoted and caring parents to their children.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Secondly, it is submitted that all the evidence shows that M was a much wanted baby, particularly after the tragic loss of C.  In one statement, the mother described M as &#8220;my precious, miracle baby that made our family complete. I could never want to hurt her.&#8221; The parents&#8217; counsel submit that it is improbable that such a wanted baby could be subjected to non-accidental injury. On behalf of the mother, Mr. Kirk and Miss Rogers ask whether this mother would have lost all self control and hurt &#8220;the little girl she had so much hoped for, born after a tragedy which broke the hearts of our entire family&#8221; in the manner suggested. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Thirdly, looking at the wider canvas, the parents&#8217; representatives submit that it is striking that these injuries all occurred at a time when the family was relatively free of stress. The local authority, in seeking to explore the context of the injuries, draw attention to a number of factors which had caused stress and pressure on the family in the preceding years &#8211; the bitter dispute with the neighbour leading to false accusations of neglect and the involvement of social services; the difficulties that the father faced in his Army career; the challenges faced by the mother acclimatising to life as a military wife; the tragic loss of C; longstanding financial worries; health problems for the children; and, for a period of several weeks earlier in 2011, the father&#8217;s absence from the home leading to the mother having to cope with two children by herself and then to difficulties in the attachment between M and the father when he returned from the exercise. In response, Mr Feehan and Mrs Storey-Rea submit, with justification, that on the face of it the weeks and days leading up to the discovery of the injuries were the most stress-free period for the family for several years. They had moved to Wiltshire and left all the troubles of the previous location behind. They had a new much-loved and much-wanted baby. The father was back from his exercise and living at home again. His career had settled down.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Fourthly, Mr Feehan and Mrs Storey-Rea submit that, if M had been subjected to a non-accidental head injury, even in a momentary loss of control, it is unlikely that she would have been taken to the doctor, especially as there was, according to the records of the examinations in the GP&#8217;s surgery and at hospital, no obvious sign that she had sustained a head injury. If they were going to cover up an assault, there was, submits counsel, no need to take her for an examination. Mr Feehan and Mrs Storey-Rea acknowledge that perpetrators do take their children to doctors, but in most cases that is because there is an acute episode that prompts even a perpetrating parent to protect the life of their child. In this case but for the &#8220;mild asymmetry&#8221; seen by the GP surgery there was no sign of anything wrong. Had these parents not been panic-stricken it is highly likely that these shocking findings would never have come to light. Mr. Kirk and Miss Rogers make the same point but put it slightly differently. Is it likely, they ask, that they would take M to the surgery on the morning of 3 August 2011 with scalp swelling if one or both of them had knowingly subjected her to episodes of violence on three or more occasions? Is it likely that they would conspire to conceal a succession of injuries until the symptoms and signs had all but resolved and the child was presenting as well, happy and without pain, and then seek medical attention?</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Fifthly, Mr. Kirk and Miss Rogers return to the complexities of the medical evidence which proved so troubling in the earlier stages of this litigation. They ask, rhetorically, is it reasonable to expect a conventional explanation from the parents that is consistent with the clinical picture, when the clinical picture is itself remarkable and inconsistent with what we assume ourselves to know?</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Sixth, all counsel for the parents submit that the inconsistencies in the father&#8217;s various accounts, and between the father and the mother, are relatively minor and not particularly probative, that there are invariably inconsistencies in the various accounts given by parents in these circumstances, that they have to be seen in the human context, and that it is perfectly possible for honest witnesses to remember events differently and imperfectly over time. On behalf of the mother, Mr. Kirk and Miss Rogers contend that there is an internal consistency in the mother&#8217;s account as well as in her evidence to this court, and they also assert that the mother&#8217;s response and distress when the injuries became apparent, and the father put forward his account, was entirely appropriate.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">I take all of those points into account. In addition, I remind myself of the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas</span> principle &#8211; that there are many reasons why a witness lies and the court must not assume, simply because someone has lied about some matters that he or she has lied about everything. This is always an important point and perhaps particularly so in this case. I accept that these parents had endured a difficult time at the previous base, including the ordeal of a s47 investigation based on apparently untrue allegations, and it is therefore entirely possible that those experiences might lead them to conceal information. I note the way in which the mother described how she felt invaded and violated as a result of the intrusion into her family life as a result of the s.47 investigation and the subsequent involvement of social services, and that these feelings were reinforced following the tragic death of C which led to further rumours and, in the mother&#8217;s words, left her angry and fearful of people with any form of profession that allowed them access to her life and to private information about her&#8221;. I accept that a father who had dropped a baby might conceal the truth about what had happened out of shame or embarrassment. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">Balancing all these elements together, however, I have come to the clear but regrettable conclusion that the parents have not told the truth about the circumstances in which M sustained her skull fractures or the fracture to her posterior 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> rib. I do not accept that those injuries were sustained as a result of the fall as described by the father as having occurred on the afternoon of 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2011. I find that each parent is concealing information and has given a false and misleading account. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">I therefore find that the local authority has proved on a balance of probabilities that M sustained four fractures to her skull and a posterior fracture of her 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> rib non-accidentally whilst in the care of one or both of her parents. Because in my judgment neither parent has told the court the whole truth about what happened, I cannot say whether these injuries were sustained as a result of one or more incidents, nor can I identify which parent was responsible for inflicting those injuries. It is possible that each of the parents is culpable for part of the injuries. On balance, however, I consider that to be unlikely. It is probable in my view that one of the parents is responsible for the injuries and the other is knowingly withholding information so as to protect the perpetrator. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.25in">I return to the issue of the earlier rib fractures, those of the lateral 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> left ribs. As stated above, the opinion of the medical experts was that the mother&#8217;s account of the incident when she squeezed M as she slipped in the bath could explain these fractures. On the other hand, as mentioned above, the local authority point to the fact that it is surprising that this mother, who is so protective of M, did not seek medical attention for M after this incident, and that she failed to mention it at the time to the father, or to the police in the first interview. In addition, having regard as I must to the totality of the evidence, I must now take into consideration my finding that the mother has lied about the later injuries. On a balance of probabilities, I therefore find that the fractures of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ribs were sustained non-accidentally whilst M was in the care of one or both of her parents. Again, in view of the parents&#8217; deception, I am unable to find exactly when or how she sustained the fractures, nor I am able to identify which of her parents was responsible.</p>

I do not regard these findings as the end of the story. All the professionals in the case &#8211; the social workers, the guardian and the court &#8211; must do what we can to see if L and M can be safely returned to their parents. But the primary responsibility now lies with the parents themselves. I urge them, even at this late stage, to be more frank with the court so that we can all understand what happened to M and work together to ensure that she and her brother are safe in the future. </p>
