W filed detailed evidence in reply producing evidence as to her current London address; her registration with a London GP; and denying that she was registered to or had voted in Scotland.  She asserted that she had neglected to notify a change of address to some potential correspondents, and that she was unaware of likely communication from H&#8217;s creditors.  H asserts that they are W&#8217;s  creditors as well and that W should have been aware that they might wish to make contact with her.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">It is important to understand that the Scottish courts do not have the kind of residual discretion that we perceive the English courts to have when it comes to seeking to &#8220;do justice as between the parties&#8221;. There is no obligation on the court when granting divorce to enquire into whether the extinction of financial claims would be fair and/or whether that would result in a failure to meet either one of the parties&#8217; needs. It is for the party seeking financial provision to request it, and make out the relevant case.  Scotland does not have a bifurcated process when it comes to divorce, that is to say, there is no equivalent to decree nisi and decree absolute. Financial claims must be dealt with at the same time as the divorce- the parties can make an application for financial provision &#8220;in an action for divorce&#8221; and the ability to make financial claims falls once decree of divorce has been granted2.</p>

Her query was about how finances since separation are viewed. The response that I gave, from a Scottish perspective, can be found at 26.20 of the recording. Given the limit on the time available in respect of this live broadcast my response extended to 22 seconds (26.20 &#8211; 26.42). In my response I indicated that Scots law was very different from English law; that we do not have the concept of decree nisi and decree absolute; that all financial matters must be dealt with at the same time as the divorce is finalised and that at the point that the decree of divorce is granted that one loses the ability to make financial claims. I have dealt with this above in greater detail than I had the ability to do on MBL.  My response did not imply that the granting of decree of divorce would ensure that maintenance obligations would be dealt with and fully addressed within the progress of the report. My response was restricted to highlighting that financial claims would need to be made prior to divorce being granted.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence is clear that divorce in Scotland is a single process, and also that unless a financial claim is made prior to the grant of the divorce the opportunity to make such a claim is lost.  That is a quite different issue from whether the divorce writ itself impliedly or inherently includes a financial claim. It is quite plain that it does not.  The service documents appended to the writ with their invitation to W to make a claim do not create a claim by either H or W.  A financial claim needs to be made in the Scottish writ or in a separate claim governed by the writ to engage the financial jurisdiction.  If such a claim is made then the decree cannot be granted until it is resolved. That does not mean that that the divorce cannot be granted where there is no application.  The article from Morton Fraser states that, and supports Ms Kelsey&#8217;s opinion.  The decree may be granted where there are financial issues without an application: the Morton Fraser article says so.</p>

The lack of clarity in H&#8217;s disclosure so far amply justifies this measure even though H has now filed his Form E1. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H must pay W&#8217;s costs of this application. I am asked to direct summary assessment.in the sum of &#163;19, 636.10.   This has been a complex case which has required the assistance of specialist counsel and W is entitled to her costs including the costs of the hearing before DDJ Bassett &#8211;Cross.  I assess costs at  the claimed amount, which does not seem unreasonable from what I know of this litigation. Mr Scott tells me and I accept that W is instructing the Oxford branch of Penningtons Manches, inevitably less costly than the office in London.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In order to make an order for a legal services (funding) order I require to be satisfied that W cannot reasonably procure legal advice and representation by any other means. (see Lord Wilson of Culworth in Vince v Wyatt <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/14" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 14" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 14</ref> at  paragraph 37 onwards). She is not able to claim capital so there is nothing to charge. I see no realistic basis upon which she can borrow from a commercial lender.  The only question is whether her brother will continue to lend to her.  This matter requires to be adjudicated on at the next hearing. In the meantime this case will continue, I am sure, to be hard fought. W shall be paid &#163;3,000 per month for legal funding until the next hearing. If at that hearing the court finds that she can obtain funding  then it will also be in  position to adjust the payments to take account of any overpayment. </p>
