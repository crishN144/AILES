This is a welcome drive, to which the judges are committed, to increase access to the Family courts, and if not to the actual hearings themselves, to the judgments and the reasons given for important decisions involving children and families.  Of course the essential privacy of families and children should be preserved.  Publicity and transparency does not extend to disclosing the identities of the children involved. That may in some circumstances also mean keeping private &#8211; not secret; private &#8211; the identities of the parents because their identification can lead to identification of the children.  The Family court judges are conscious of the risk of "jigsaw identification" whereby information can be pieced together without identifying by name so that identity becomes obvious.  The father is quite right that I am entitled to and should name local authorities and in most cases to name social workers as well. I shall consider at the end of this judgment whether the name of the excellent local authority social worker, who I have heard give evidence, should be made public.  There have been some real problems in this case as I shall recount. I would not want to expose any member of the profession to any risk outside this courtroom.  However distressing these proceedings are none of this must lead to any outburst or to any reaction which causes any member of the public or any person who is engaged in these proceedings to feel fear or distress.  In spite of what has happened, I know I can rely on all, including the parents, whatever I say, to make this, if not a calm hearing, certainly an orderly one.</span></p>

That account, which is materially misleading, has elicited a degree of supportive comment.  One of the reasons why I am giving judgment in open court with the Press present is so that my findings and the findings of District Judge (Magistrates Court) Mellanby who heard earlier proceedings can be out in the open in order to address the misleading accounts which the father has given.</span></p>

Both of them love each of their sons from the bottom of their hearts, and with great and deep commitment.  Those two boys are J, who is now just over two and one month, and a baby who is known only as Baby, born on 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> December last year.  J has been in local authority care under an interim care order since February 2013 and was made the subject of a full care order and placement order at the end of last year.  Those orders were appealed to a judge at this court.  The appeal was dismissed.  I am told that a potential appeal is before the Court of Appeal in London which is some weeks at least out of time.  It is not known whether the Court of Appeal will grant an extension of time or permission to appeal, and if it does, what the outcome likely to be..  This is the final hearing of the care and placement application in respect of Baby.</span></p>

He went into foster care when he was under two years of age because of the mother's inability to cope.  The mother is a very likeable, very warm individual.  She is said &#8211; although she disputes this &#8211; to suffer from a learning disability.  She presents in the witness box as a very articulate lady.  That is not necessarily inconsistent with a learning disability.  She was first reported on by Linda Jeffs, a psychologist, in 2006, in relation to the boy who is now 10.  Linda Jeffs conducted a formal assessment of the mother.  She concluded that the mother could not care for T and that she had a significant degree of intellectual impairment.  The mother's relationship with T's father was stormy and difficult and she was the subject of some domestic violence.  That relationship was extremely unsupportive to her, and that of course was relevant to her ability to care for T.  But things looked very different when in May 2011 the mother met the father.  The father has always been in stable employment; he has a strong family network; and he loves the mother and he wants to care for her.  She loves him and she wants to be his domestic support, and to support him in his worthy and successful endeavour to be a working man who has the capacity to look after his partner and children.</span></p>

The father was very concerned about the intervention of the local authority.  A  meeting took place before J was born in which the father complained about racism and was very oppositional towards the involvement of the local authority, because he does not think that the mother either wants or needs their support.  He thinks he can provide her with support himself.  It is not clear to me how far the father has always thought, as he told me in court in this hearing, that the mother has been incorrectly assessed and is perfectly capable of looking after a child without outside support.  </span></p>

I have said before, and I say again, that many clever people make absolutely rotten parents and many people who are intellectually impaired, in the sense that they are not good at book-learning and so on, are warm and understanding and caring and provide children with wonderful upbringings.  I also accept &#8211; and I discussed this with the mother when she gave her evidence &#8211; that no one is a perfect parent.  In fact the more perfect people think they are probably the more imperfect they really are.  We all have our faults.  We all have times when we think 'I wish I had not done that' or 'I wish I had done something different or something better.'  That is part of human nature.  So what I have to decide is whether this case, as J's case was found to do, goes over the line into the territory mapped out by Section 31 Children Act so that there is established actual past significant harm or a risk of significant harm in the future.</span></p>

When Linda Jeffs had assessed the mother she had found not only that she has a learning disability in the sense that she has an IQ between 63 and 68 (which is not the end of the matter at all as I say) but her own functioning was impaired, and although she can parent she needs outside support on a daily basis.  The parents went to the Hertfordshire Family Assistance Unit (HFAU), a residential unit.  The parents left the HFAU after five weeks by agreement.  They had done excellently well.  They came back to their own property.   I have seen testimonials from the father's employer and from others indicating how much the father &#8211; and of course the mother does too &#8211; loves these children.  They have made efforts to provide a lovely family home.  All of that is of course not only to be commended but is extremely important when assessing their strengths.  However, by 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> October the local authority was concerned about the father's inability to cooperate with the support and monitoring from the Children's Centre, the health visitor and social workers, which was part of the package, on the basis of which this family had left the HFAU.

It is correct&#8211; and I must express this in the strongest possible terms &#8211; that everything was fine in the flat and about the care of J.  But the difficulty is not what actually was; the difficulty is what the local authority feared might be the case in the light of the mother's problems in coping, and because of what had happened in respect of T in the past, when the mother did not find herself able to offer good enough care at all through no fault of her own.  Throughout these proceedings it has been that the father's view that he can cope; he can be trusted; in deciding to make sure the support is there.  He is opposed to the role of the local authority; and he says that their anxiety to check that all is well with the children is misplaced because it is totally unnecessary.  But the local authority has statutory duties in respect of all children in need and particularly children who are the subject of proceedings.  They have to think about what might be, what might reasonably be feared, as well as what actually has happened.  </span></p>

It was contested.  The mother and the father were represented.  The decision was not made by the local authority.  It was made by the magistrates who are judges in the Family Justice system.  I have seen their reasons.  They granted an interim care order because of the father's aggressive behaviour and the risk of further violent outbursts.  Unfortunately, that finding made things worse rather than better because the father, in the court room, then assaulted the social worker &#8211; a male social worker &#8211; by punching him in the face a number of times.  The father says that he was provoked into this because the social worker barged him with his shoulder.  The father thought this was done deliberately.  But he did not pause to tackle the social worker about this or to ask for an apology.  He just immediately reacted and struck the social worker about the face.  The Social Services became even more concerned about the father because J was in the courtroom when this all took place.  He was in his pushchair.  The mother and the father were asked about this in the witness box when they gave evidence.   Neither of them could see that there was any likely harm possible to J in that situation at all.  Each of them said that J was about the same distance as the length of this courtroom (15 to 20 feet) from the area where this fracas was going on.  Mother says that J was crying before the incident took place and that was because he was hungry, but of course he was only 10 months old and so he was not able to express his views about what was going on.  The father says that there was no shouting out or calling out or noise: I do not know whether there was or not, but there might well have been.  It must have been apparent to anybody who was able to stand back rather than emotionally reacting in the heat of the moment, that this could have been a very distressing experience indeed for a baby.  The mother says the baby was facing away and I do not know whether that is a true memory or not.  Even if it was, the baby was quite capable of hearing noise.  I simply do not accept that a really quite serious assault like this can take place without others in the room being aware of it.  </span></p>

Much though both of these parents adore these children I have been worried during the course of this hearing about aspects of their evidence when it has been difficult for them to stand back and look at things from the point of view of a small child and how a small child is likely to feel.  Babies and small children have feelings even if they are not able to express them and are entitled to have those feelings taken notice of and regarded, rather than simply being seen as objects to whom their experiences do not matter.</span></p>

Rather than remonstrating with him and telling him that what he had done was wrong, she sat by him after his arrest by the police, together with J.  I am sure that J was aware of his father's distress and agitation.  Little children rely on their parents for emotional support and are acutely aware if those parents have strong feelings, which are bound to be communicated to them.</span></p>

I entirely accept that in this country it is not a criminal offence not to have your children immunised and it is not compulsory so to do.  But there are a lot of still very dangerous childhood diseases which can afflict children in this country.  Medical advice is that unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary children ought to be immunised.  Father was not prepared to allow immunisation, not because he is opposed to immunisation in principle, but because he thought that it was important that he should be there to comfort the child.  That was not permitted because of his feared behaviour and as a result J did not get his jabs.  </span></p>

The circumstances were these. The father was entitled to legal aid but he refused it and was in person. The mother was represented.   She was seeking care as a sole carer.  She admitted on the second day of the hearing that she had been living with the father, since August.  Ms Jeffs had given evidence and she said how much the mother had matured and that she had shown willingness and preparedness to take and follow advice and to find appropriate support.  Ms Jeffs advised that the mother's IQ level would not preclude her from being a good enough parent providing that she had strong support.  Judge Mellanby accepted that all the indications were that prior to removal of J on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> February the mother and father were compliant with and accepting and benefiting from the advice and support from the workers at the Abbots Langley Children's Centre, the health visitor and the HFAU.  She records however that the father had some issues with the staff at the HFAU.  I have already during the course of this judgment pointed to occasions when the father's complaints about the local authority and his obstructiveness had caused anxiety and indeed had led to that first interim supervision order.  However, the mother had continued to engage and cooperate; J was thriving, and there was no evidence that he was suffering any harm whatsoever.  The judge said that at that stage the only missing piece in the jigsaw was the psychological assessment of the mother and the father.  She remarked that they had both agreed to cooperate but that father appeared to become increasingly frustrated and intolerant of what he thought was the local authority's invasive and controlling approach and that he had become more and more entrenched in his opposition to and criticism of social workers.  There had been a meeting fairly shortly before the events of February 2013 when the HFAU  support was deemed no longer necessary  which he had interpreted as being a green light for there being no order and that there was no need for any further social services involvement.</span></p>

The social worker (the one who was later assaulted by the father) explained to the judge the number of different approaches he had tried to convince the father that this was not the case, but that the father would not listen.  Changes of personnel visiting the house, offers of meetings and conciliation, had fallen on deaf ears, and the father had begun to adopt an almost siege mentality.  Although the mother voiced her independence and continued to accept the offer of support provided, the local authority was becoming increasingly concerned that she was under the father's control.  It did not help that assessments were not complied with or appointments were not attended.  Judge Mellanby used the word 'paranoid' several times about the father. She is not a doctor just as I am not a doctor and this is a word to be used, I think, with circumspection by a non-qualified person; but I certainly have found the father in his evidence before me to show a degree of suspicion of all kinds of people, and a degree of conviction about malign associations between professionals, which is highly unusual.  It does not seem to be based on any objective evidence at all.  That mindset seriously inhibits the father's ability to see the interests of his children in an objective way and it certainly inhibits necessary working with professionals.  </span></p>

The judge said that J was likely to be confused if not frightened by his father's apparently uncontrollable behaviour.  I share that view.  Judge Mellanby commented that the mother, whilst ostensibly critical of the father's behaviour, is unable to control the father.  She said that J is in danger of becoming emotionally damaged when his parents apparently have such different styles of expressing their disagreement or frustration.  Judge Mellanby said that the father had clearly frightened and intimidated social workers; had struck the male social worker; and had been racially abusive and insulting to him and some members of the HFAU.  She found that this behaviour </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">'has often occurred in front of J; uncontrollable anger is terrifying for a child let alone the adults.'</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">  She described how the then guardian in her evidence criticised the mother for not appreciating </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">'why people were paralysed by fear.'</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">  The guardian told Judge Mellanby that she was prevented from carrying out her proper inquiries with both parents for fear of putting herself at risk; and she had no doubt that J's emotional wellbeing was significantly put at risk and that this is that should not be ignored.  Judge Mellanby commented that both the parents said that J was too young for any such behaviour to impact on his wellbeing.  She commented that the father was unable to form any objective viewpoint or empathy as to how his behaviour might impact on others especially J.  It was no excuse to say that he was provoked when he struck the social worker.  Although he apologised to him in court prior to cross-examining him he then sought to justify much of what he had said or done.  He said that he could not see that his outright refusal to see his son, if contact were supervised by Social Services or the guardian, was damaging to his son and demonstrates an inability to put his son's needs before his own.  She said that that showed a lack of empathy and an inability to compromise which any good parent requires.  She then described his "irrational mistrust" which interfered with his son's needs.  She said that she had no doubt that J was emotionally traumatised by going into foster care in circumstances when his father had assaulted someone. It was unreasonable and irrational to place the entire blame on the local authority and then fail to do anything to mitigate that damage.  She said that the father had a duty and responsibility to reduce that damage as far as possible by seeing his son and reassuring him that he was not giving up on him and still loved him.  She said that the father had completely failed his son in that regard and was completely unable to put his son's needs over and above his own fury and rage and sense of injustice.  She too had read the references describing him as a respectable and successful businessman with pride and affection for his son, but </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">'To harbour such consummate mistrust and overt anger and unacceptable behaviour towards the very persons who are in the business of protecting his son exposes his son to the likelihood of emotional harm.'</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">  She said that the mother </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">'with her level of intellectual functioning has demonstrated that she is unable to protect J from such tirades.

The local authority carried out a risk assessment of contact between the father and Baby.   A contact agreement was proposed between the father and the local authority as to the terms upon which contact should take place.  A number of drafts went back and forward.  I can understand that the father wanted it to be made absolutely plain in the document that he did not accept that there were objective reasons for the local authority to be concerned about unsupervised contact; in other words, the complaints about aggressive and intimidating behaviour (although that father did accept his behaviour when he gave evidence but said that it was justified or at least explicable because the local authority had behaved outrageously in removing his children). </span></p>

I have seen the final version.  For some reason it was taken away from the hearing in April by father's counsel without having been copied by father's then solicitor.  Goodman Ray, the father's previous solicitors, were approached yesterday., and a document was faxed or scanned by them and sent  almost by return.  I am very grateful to them.  The father then would not accept that this was  a copy of the document that had been taken away by his counsel, Mr Ker-Reid, even though it was countersigned by Mr Ker-Reid.  I had to require the social worker who had actually been there when the negotiations had taken place to give evidence.  I know Goodman Ray to be a highly experienced, competent and reliable firm.  The document must have been in their possession for them to have sent it. I am satisfied that the document bears the signature of Mr Ker-Reid of counsel.  I am satisfied from that evidence and that of the local authority social worker that I now have the final version of the agreement which was approved by Judge Wright.  It records the father's stipulation that he does not accept the local authority's contentions. The father first told me that the agreement had been unacceptable to him because it did not record his challenge to the assertions. When it was pointed out that the document did record that he did not accept what was said about him (as did earlier versions) , he then said that he would not have contact because he wanted it to be supervised by the social worker from Ward Andrews rather than by the local authority.  As in respect of so many aspects of this case the father's view is always a matter of principle rather than a question of a practical evaluation as to what is in the best interests of his son.  </span></p>

He has made a number of accusations essentially of conspiracy.  At the outset of the hearing the father's counsel asked me to adjourn this case.  In April he had asked Judge Wright, who had continued the interim care order, to transfer the case to a High Court Judge.  As I was to be sitting here Judge Wright proposed that I should hear the case and brought it forward from a date in June to this particular slot.  There was no objection until the beginning of this hearing to my hearing the case but his counsel Mr Reid then asked me to recuse myself.  He told me that the father had carried out some research on BAILII, the Law Reports online facility.  He had found out that I had been the judge in three cases in which Mr O'Brien had appeared and on each occasion I had found for Mr O'Brien.  Two of those cases I can recall.   The first was a Court of Protection case where the mother agreed that her children should remain in foster care. The issue was a very technical one as to what constituted a deprivation of liberty.  I did find in favour of Mr O'Brien (I was overturned by the Supreme Court but that was a question of law).  On the second case Mr O'Brien on behalf of Hertfordshire asked for permission to withdraw care proceedings on the basis that there was no reasonable prospect that I could make any finding under Section 31, a view with which I agreed.  I gave a judgment about that which is available.  The one hesitant person in that case was the guardian and I found that I should nonetheless allow the proceedings to be withdrawn.  Of the other I have no recollection at all, but Mr O'Brien's recollection does not support the view that I was biased.</span></p>

At the outset of the case I acceded very largely to Mr Reid's submissions that I should exclude certain evidence and indeed I did so.  That has not only shortened the hearing and made the case more manageable but has also, I believe, done substantial justice to the father.  As is my usual practice I was not prepared to proceed where  there was insufficient opportunity to challenge relevant evidence, or to permit reliance on hearsay evidence where a witness as to fact is available, or without the kind of analysis as to weight and admissibility required in the civil and criminal jurisdictions. </span></p>

However the focus of the father's antipathy has a tendency to shift as his focus changes.  Mr Crowder, the new guardian, agrees.  There have been occasions when the father has been vituperatively critical of him and others when he has been able to sit with Mr Crowder and have quite reasonable discussions with him about the options notwithstanding the very sad context of this case.  There is other evidence to support a fluctuating attitude in the father.  I detect in the father beneath the bluster and the threats and the criticism a deep sadness which I acknowledge and with which I sympathise.  I wonder whether the father's more extreme statements and actions are born out of some sort of internal conflict.   But that is a matter for him to evaluate and if he could, as the guardian says, find someone to talk to about this it might be of help to him.  However notwithstanding Mr Reid's submissions, if he does wish to access any such support it cannot be effective within the timescales of this baby.</span></p>

The first is an expressed disapproval of the father's actions, and an expressed understanding of how very unacceptable his behaviour  is; but also almost in the same breath she makes excuses for the father on the basis that he has lost his children, it is all the local authority's fault, and therefore he cannot be blamed for his actions.  </span></p>

He said that Dr Dale would be asked to assess this support network.  He showed me a draft Letter of Instruction to Dr Dale which did not in fact mention outside support or any assessment of any other individuals.  Even without that component a number of hours would be required which might very well take this case out of the four weeks which Mr Chippeck had suggested would be appropriate.

As a result of those contacts the father has access to all kinds of documentation from other cases.  He says that he has seen reports on other individuals from Ms Jeffs and that they all say the same thing as her; that the mothers have an IQ of between 63 and 68 and are unable to cope.  I was not clear whether he was suggesting that there had been a mistake and she had written the report about someone else and attributed it to the mother, or whether she had just been lazy and had transposed one opinion from one report to another without actually having regard to the individual who was in front of her.  The mother was represented by counsel at the hearing before Judge Mellanby.  It is quite apparent from my reading of the judgment, from which I have quoted many insightful observations, that this hearing was conducted with particular care and sensitivity, and that the judge was acutely aware of all the issues in the case.  I am told that there was some challenge to Ms Jeffs not on the basis that her assessment on the Wechsler Scale was incorrect but with regard to the mother's functioning, but Judge Mellanby entirely accepted that the mother required support.

But the mother's position is that she wants to be seen by Dr Dale in order to be vindicated so far as her intellectual functioning is concerned.  That is her prime focus and only secondarily in her view would it be helpful generally in assisting the court to know whether she can care for Baby.

I am used to courtrooms and the emotions they can engender and I am probably a fairly hardy plant when it comes to coping with volatility, threats, and physical intimidation.  But I found the father's simmering anger quite difficult to cope with, partly because I also felt within it &#8211; as I have already described &#8211; a latent distress which is painful to experience.

Although the father has been convicted twice in respect of assaults I do not think anyone has ever done anything serious to address his behaviour.  It may be that his experience so far is that there is never any comeback.  His agitation has been expressed to others rather than me and his interaction with me has been courteous, communicative and open, and I am grateful for that.

I am particularly troubled that having had pointed out so clearly by Judge Mellanby the dangers or the harm to which the father was subjecting J by not having contact with him, the father has gone further in standing on his 'rights' in respect of the contact agreement to the deprivation of his younger son.  Also, it is emotionally harmful not to give a child a name, and father's expressed reason for so doing is that he is not going to give his child a name, i.e. a first name, until the child comes home to him.  That focuses on him and not on the child.</span></p>

Judge Mellanby, who is a skilled and highly compassionate local judge, has come to conclusions which bind me.  We are all now judges of the Family Court together and the fact that she may in the past have been regarded as at a different tier makes not the slightest difference to the fact that her findings and her approach are now set in stone, and always would have been.   I would not be entitled to go behind any of her evaluations unless there were the most compelling recent material which could legitimately allow me to take a different view.  In fact, my assessment concurs with hers.  Ms Jeffs' evidence was accepted and it stands.  Therefore I have no reason now to direct a further psychological assessment of the mother.  The only real objective of an independent social worker's report would be to see whether there is there is any change.  The application for Dr Dale comes at the last possible moment when there has been every opportunity in the run-up to this hearing to make an application for him to report.  Just as litigants have to be aware that if they want to put forward alternative family carers they must do so at the earliest possible opportunity, the same is true in respect of experts.  </span></p>

There is absolutely no evidence, I accept, that either of these children has ever been physically harmed within the father's care.  However, there have been displays of uncontrollable physical aggression by father which are likely to occur in front of Baby placing him at risk of physical harm ( as well as emotional harm) if  there is physical conflict.  Counsel for the parents have sought to persuade me that the fact that there has as yet been no physical harm means it is not likely to occur in the future.  I cannot accept that analysis.  As the guardian said in evidence, it is very easy to envisage a child being in the vicinity of the parent, perhaps in the father's or mother's arms, perhaps in a pushchair, perhaps on a sofa, when there is a fight between the father and a social worker or a fight between the father and someone else and the child gets caught up in that dispute.  I make that evaluation fully conscious of the fact that there is absolutely no evidence that the father has ever come into situations of conflict in other aspects of his life as the quite excellent testimonials from his employers make clear.</span></p>

One of the troubling aspects of the father's evidence yesterday was a series of emails which he has sent, threats to broadcast names of professionals involved in these proceedings on the internet, including in some cases the names of their extended family.  The father perceives himself as having suffered racial abuse and bullying and harassment at the hands of the local authority.  I reject that assertion.  The father uses those allegations as the platform for these threats.  They must frighten those against whom they are made, and he must know that.</span></p>

I accept that the father's self-righteous indignation supersedes his children's needs.  I also accept &#8211; although this is not directly relevant to harm &#8211; that the mother's failure to take up proper antenatal care for her pregnancy with Baby is extremely significant when looking at the general risks of neglect or of the parents putting themselves before the baby in the future.  The mother cannot control the father and J was found to be in danger of becoming emotionally damaged. Baby is at risk of emotional harm from the father; he has no insight into how his approach and irrational and unreasonable beliefs impact on his ability to safeguard and develop his child's emotional wellbeing.  I have already referred to Dr McLintock's views, and I entirely accept that the father's irrational and volatile attitudes and behaviour, his suspicion of the world and his shifting perception of the conspiracies against him, are likely to give rise to damage to the development of Baby.  His irrational refusal to cooperate with the local authority will mean that those professionals who are charged with the duty of safeguarding children will not be able to intervene.  I reject the submission made on behalf of the father that the only reason why the father has this attitude to Social Services is because of the removal of J in February 2013, because the history as I have recited it shows that this is a longstanding if escalating problem.</span></p>

I am in no doubt that there is a high risk of significant harm to Baby due to a combination of the vulnerabilities of the mother and the father's attitudes and behaviours as I have described.  Is there any prospect that that will change within Baby's timescales?  There is none.  I do not see what Dr Dale can bring to the evaluation.  I know what the parents said to me in the witness box. Dr Dale would not be able to provide a risk assessment which undermines the very firm views reached by Judge Mellanby and by myself.  Also this child is pushed right up against the barrier of a time limit which is not there for arbitrary reasons but to safeguard children.  I will come when I deal with the placement order application to consider what the Court of Appeal said about the duty of the local authority to maximise support for parents in order to give the opportunity for that child to be cared for.  I entirely recognise, as did Judge Mellanby, how very drastic, serious and invasive of human relationships is a care order whether designed to lead to adoption or not.  I acknowledge that Section 8 rights of all these individuals and in particular the child are fully engaged.  I accept that the test is nothing else will do.  I accept the test is one which requires me to have regard to safety and to harm and to whether there is any alternative &#8211; any realistic alternative, that is.  I accept that removal must be proportional to that risk.</span></p>

The mother asks me to adjourn for a short period for Dr Dale to assess her and then to bring the case back.  I have found that the issue with the mother is principally her relationship with the father.  Nothing has changed.  I see no utility in that opportunity.  She wants Baby home as soon as possible.  She would ideally want him home tonight.  The father's position was only clarified at the end of submissions.  I am not being critical in any way.  He has many different matters to think about and he has two children to think about, not just one.  He agrees to the continuation of an interim care order but simply on the basis that he thinks that these children, who are placed together, with a plan that they be adopted together by the same family, will suffer if Baby is returned home and J is not.  He thinks that J would be jealous and would be bereft. I do not necessarily agree about jealousy.  I think he is probably right that J would be bereft.  I cannot accept the submission made on behalf of the father that all will be well between him and the local authority if Baby returns home.  Not only is his opposition to the local authority longstanding and predates J's removal.  And has given rise to resentments which will not easily be forgotten, but whilst J remains in care those resentments will continue in any event.  It is wholly unrealistic to suggest that an independent social worker or Ward Andrews or anyone of that kind should be appointed under a Family Assistance Order.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 16</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> does not cover those individuals. They have no statutory duties and no right to intervene.  As agents of the local authority instructed and paid by them they would also be regarded by the father as tainted by their association with the local authority.</span></p>

There is a whole host of uncertainties implicit in that proposal.  The first is, that this being a second appeal, the hurdles in the parents' way are very high.  The second is that who knows how long it is going to take?  And damage is going to be caused to the children the longer this uncertainty goes on.  The third problem is, what happens if I make a decision now in anticipation that Baby will eventually go home and then something else occurs in the meantime, and how can I in any event foresee the future and say that there will come a time when the interim care order will lapse and the child will return?  I have to make a decision, not in respect of J's independent position here, but on behalf of Baby. I have to assess this case on the evidence now.</span></p>

I see no prospect of change until the father in particular actively does something to change himself.

It is always a deprivation to lose a natural family.  There will always be questions; and there will always be anxieties.  I entirely recognise that.  There will be a sense of dislocation but it will be replaced by belonging to a new family, and family relationships will be created which will go a long way to addressing the losses which Baby will suffer.  Baby has no relationship with relatives other than his mother: he has unfortunately no relationship with his father at all.  His relationship with his mother is good.  The mother &#8211; and there are many strengths and positives which have been outlined by Mr Chippeck to which I pay due regard &#8211; has attended five times a week for long periods of contact; she has behaved entirely appropriately; she has behaved with extreme dignity when Baby was removed from her; and she has made absolutely the best of a very difficult position.  So there will be a loss to Baby by losing his mother.  Contact will be stepped down.   That is not meant to be a glib or a superficial remedy for what is an extremely important change in Baby's life.  Unfortunately, if his mother cannot care for him and his stability, emotional needs and all his other needs can only be met elsewhere, he will lose his relationship with his mother.  I cannot contemplate a continuation of direct contact for all the well-known reasons about disruption to the placement both from the point of view of the child and the point of view of the new family.  So there is no likelihood of the relationship with the mother continuing and the child's relatives do not play any part in Baby's life as actual figures to whom he is known.  They are unable or unwilling to put themselves forward.  I take into account the wishes and feelings of each of his parents, who could not oppose this solution more strongly.  The adoption agency has given due consideration to the child's religious persuasion, racial origin, cultural and linguistic background.</span></p>

They do need to go into one side of the balance sheet, which otherwise I accept, but they do not shift the balance.  One of the reasons why this is such a painful and difficult decision is because of those strengths.  But a lot has happened since then which I am afraid outweighs those positives.  I am quite satisfied, as the guardian has said, that there is nothing that can be done to assist these parents to change.   Change can only come from within.  There is no support which the local authority can give.  The father will not tolerate the professionals' support which the mother requires unless it comes from a source which is acceptable to him, and it is difficult to know when indeed he might fall out with anyone for instance the children's teachers or doctors with whom he may well disagree about the care of his children.  The father accepts that he will not cooperate with a supervision order so that is not an available option to the court.  I accept that against the findings, and notwithstanding the potential benefit which an upbringing by his parents could give this child, the findings in respect of harm very strongly outweigh any such benefit and that therefore the only option is adoption.  This will give permanence, a strong sense of belonging, and what the guardian has described as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">'a more enduring psychosocial basis'</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> than any other non-parental option.  So the balance sheet comes down very strongly in favour of adoption and indeed once parental care is ruled out that is the only realistic alternative.  I am terribly sorry it has come to this but there really is no other option. Interference with the right to family life of parents and child is proportional to the risk of harm, and to the needs of the child.</span></p>
