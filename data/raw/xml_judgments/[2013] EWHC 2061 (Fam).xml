	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This long-running litigation has involved divorce and ancillary relief proceedings (the Divorce Proceedings) and proceedings under Schedule 1 of the Children Act (the Children&#8217;s Proceedings).  This judgment relates to the Divorce Proceedings. I indicated that I would not deliver it until issues relating to security for payments for the children in the Children&#8217;s Proceedings had been concluded or appropriately advanced.  They have now been concluded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Divorce Proceedings came back before me at the end of 2012 to address a number of issues.  In broad terms the Petitioner commenced proceedings in this jurisdiction by a petition dated 19 February 2003 (the 2003 Petition) against the Respondent asserting that she and the Respondent were married at a ceremony of marriage that took place in Nigeria on 22 December 1993 pursuant to native law and custom (the Disputed 1993 Marriage).  The Respondent disputed the jurisdiction of this court and denied the existence of the Disputed 1993 Marriage.  His position was that the ceremony of marriage asserted by the Petitioner simply did not take place.  He also asserted that in 1974 he had entered into a statutory marriage in Nigeria with another woman (GT) and that as that marriage had not been dissolved he did not have the capacity to enter into subsequent polygamous marriages.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, at the heart of the disputes between the parties arising on the 2003 Petition was the assertion by the Petitioner that the parties had entered into a ceremony of marriage according to native law and custom on 22 December 1993 and the Respondent&#8217;s assertion that no ceremony had taken place on that day.  As between them this was a "black and white" issue of fact.  Both of them could not be right and it is very difficult to see how the difference between them could be explained by some misunderstanding.  Indeed, no such explanation has been advanced and the reality has always been that one of the parties was knowingly advancing a false assertion about the existence of the Disputed 1993 Marriage.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the proceedings there have been a number of allegations and findings of dishonesty and culpable behaviour but, regularly and without demur prior to its resolution, the stark difference of fact relating to the Disputed 1993 Marriage (namely was there or was there not a ceremony on that day) has been referred to by both parties and the court as the &#8220;big lie&#8221; because of its fundamental importance and its obvious impact on the other issues relating to the conduct of the parties and their rival contentions. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 29th of June 2004, the Petitioner amended the 1993 Petition (the Amended 2003 Petition).  As a result of the amendment she added in the alternative that by the same ceremony on 22 December 1993 the parties purported to celebrate a marriage or underwent a ceremony of marriage by virtue of native law and custom.  She also added a claim that the parties were married by cohabitation and repute and an alternative claim for a decree of nullity if the Respondent should prove that he entered into a statutory marriage with GT which was still subsisting in 1993.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Also on 29 June 2004, the Petitioner issued a further petition (the 2004 Petition) based on an assertion that on 16 March 2002 she and the Respondent were lawfully married in Nigeria by virtue of native law and custom (the Disputed 2002 Marriage).  In addition, she sought an order dissolving that marriage but did not seek in the alternative a decree of nullity.  As the Disputed 2002 Marriage was within a year of the 2003 Petition it was not open to her to add an alternative based on it to the 2003 Petition.</p>

The finding of fact is expressed in terms that the Petitioner had failed to discharge the onus of proof on her to show that there was a customary law marriage that was celebrated between her and the Respondent on the 22 December 1993.  Applying the binary approach to findings in civil litigation, such a finding means that the court proceeds on the basis that there was no such marriage.  So, although the burden of proof means that the finding of the High Court of Lagos is not a certainty, for the purposes of these proceedings this court has to proceed on the basis that the 1993 Petition as originally drafted, and as amended, was based on a false assertion that the parties entered into a customary marriage in 1993 and that, as the Respondent has throughout asserted, there was no such ceremony and no such marriage.</p>

I reject the Respondent&#8217;s arguments that read as whole the Court of Appeal in Nigeria did acknowledge or find that she did know of that subsisting statutory marriage.  In my judgment, unfortunately this issue has not been decided by the Nigerian courts although it was expressly raised before them.</p>

At the heart of this part of the appeal, and the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Nigeria on it, is the point that the Petitioner did not plead the existence of such a marriage and intention and therefore these issues were not properly before the court.  It follows that the Court of Appeal in Nigeria was of the view that the judge had been wrong to state as she did in the second citation in paragraph 41 above that before the High Court in Lagos the Petitioner canvassed that the ceremony on 16 March 2002 was a traditional marriage or to treat that as an issue before the court that she could properly and fairly decide on the evidence.</p>

Also, in my judgment, the Petitioner failed to point to passages in the papers that when read alone, or with other relevant passages, make it clear that her position, when she launched her proceedings in England and Wales in February 2003, was that she did not know that the Respondent had entered into a subsisting statutory marriage with GT at the time of the customary marriage she was asserting. It is however clear that, if she had known, this she would also have known that the customary marriage she was asserting was null and void and of no effect whatsoever (as declared by the Nigerian courts).</p>

In support of this conclusion I return to my 2005 judgment and the findings therein on the credibility of both parties.  Those findings form the basis for the view, which I hold, that it is certainly possible that, to achieve her ends against YT and publishers in Nigeria, the Petitioner would present what she believed to be a false description of the nature of the Respondent&#8217;s marriage to GT in those Nigerian proceedings.</p>

To my mind, these references to the ceremony in March 2002 do not make it clear whether the Petitioner is saying that it is another marriage or a civil recognition of an existing marriage or what its alleged effect is.  In any event, it is apparent that in this statement the Petitioner is relying on the 1993 Disputed Marriage.</p>

That section provides that the relevant marriage &#8220;has been dissolved or annulled by means of judicial proceedings in an overseas country&#8221;.  A declaration that the customary marriage was null and void would not do this as a matter of language.  The counter argument is that financial relief can be claimed under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> in a petition for nullity and that, if what is obtained abroad, equated to a decree of nullity to achieve symmetry between the two Acts it should be treated as an order that annulled the marriage (see, for example <span style="font-style:italic">Dukali v Lamrani</span> [2012] EWHC 1748 Fam at paragraph 46). If that is right, the issue would arise whether the impact of a continuing statutory marriage at the date of a customary marriage renders the customary marriage a non-marriage or a marriage or marriage ceremony in respect of which a decree of nullity could be granted.  </p>

Further, on the binary approach to such findings this court has to proceed on the basis that no such marriage ceremony took place and so by asserting that it did the Petitioner was advancing a false case and so it was Petitioner who was advancing &#8220;the big lie&#8221; (see paragraphs 4 and 85 above).</p>

(And in that context she did not raise the point in Nigeria whether such a celebration and intention could constitute an effective customary marriage).  In my view she took this approach to the event in 2002 as part of her campaign to obtain ancillary relief in England based on a 10 year marriage.</p>

But these powers effectively relieve a payor and are generally directed to a situation in which he or she has not paid the sums ordered or all of them.  They are silent about the repayment of any payments made under an order whose discharge is back-dated.  No application was made under s. 31 on the basis that the orders for maintenance pending suit in the 1993 Petition were obtained by fraud or misrepresentation or should otherwise be discharged.</p>

Also, this possibility was not advanced by the Respondent and so its existence, extent and the factors that should be taken into account in exercising it were not argued before me.  In my judgment, it is at least arguable that the point that the non costs element of the maintenance pending suit equated to the orders later made under Schedule 1 for the benefit of the children and was directed to meeting the outgoings of the Petitioner which included those relating to her care of the children, would be a factor to be taken into account in the exercise of this discretion.  </p>

But as this argument was not advanced by the Respondent and the Petitioner was not thereby given the opportunity to respond to it, I shall not base any order on the existence of such a power.
