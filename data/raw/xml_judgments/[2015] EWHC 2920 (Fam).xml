After an uncomplicated pregnancy, her mother went into labour at home on 28 January.  Her parents set out to drive to hospital.  It was an icy road and there was a hailstorm.  Chloe was born in the car on the journey.  When she arrived at hospital, she was in a critical condition with no spontaneous breathing or cardiac activity.  She was resuscitated and her heart began to beat.  </span></p>

For some considerable time, the doctors treating her have been concerned that this treatment is not in her best interests.  After many discussions with the parents, who wish for treatment to continue and for Chloe to be moved to another hospital, the Trust began these proceedings on 18 August.  A Children's Guardian, Mr John Mellor, was appointed to represent Chloe.</span></p>

She has for the most part been on either a conventional ventilator or, as at present, on the higher level of support provided by High Frequency Oscillation Ventilation.  Many efforts have been made to wean her to less intensive modalities that do not amount to mechanical ventilation: Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP), Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and/or Optiflow.  None of these efforts have succeeded for more than a few days before her breathing has deteriorated and she has been reintubated for ventilation.  The intubation process, involving the passing of an endotracheal tube through her vocal cords into her trachea, is distressing for her, particularly if it is done in an emergency, when it may not be possible to administer the drugs that would make the process more tolerable.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Chloe cannot swallow or protect her own airway and therefore has to be fed by tube.  Until March, she had a nasogastric tube, but she could not retain milk in her stomach and on occasions milk was aspirated into her lungs.  A decision was made to feed her by continuous pump feed through a nasojejunal tube, which delivers food directly to the small intestine.  When the tube becomes blocked or dislodged (as has happened at least five times) an operation has to be performed to replace it.  Consideration has been given to alternative feeding methods (gastrostomy or fundoplication) but these would require major procedures to which Chloe's parents have not consented, and the coexisting issues in relation to breathing would remain.  </span></p>

In the light of the parents&#8217; views,   second opinions have been obtained from specialists who are independent of the Trust.  A consultant neonatologist, Dr E, has advised that if Chloe survives she will suffer from profound developmental delay and cerebral palsy and that there is no additional treatment that could be offered elsewhere.  A consultant neurologist, Dr T, has advised that Chloe has severe neurological damage and that long-term ventilation is not in her best interests.</span></p>

I particularly affirm that the ultimate determination of the best interests is made by the Court, and not by the parents or the doctors, though their views are to be carefully considered.  Further, although the views of doctors on medical issues will be a prominent feature in a case where a child is so medically dependent, the best interests evaluation considers all matters and not only medical ones.  Lastly, I emphasise that in considering quality of life, the Court looks from the child's perspective and not from the perspective of others more fortunate.</span></p>
