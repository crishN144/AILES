This is likely to refer to the need to consider whether, when undertakings are being relied upon, they can be made enforceable in the requesting state and, if not, that they should be used with caution when being relied on as measures to protect against an Article 13(b) risk. It will also draw attention to the difference between protective measures and practical arrangements. The latter are put in place to ensure an orderly return so are directed towards facilitating and implementing the child's return by, for example, providing who will pay for flights. They might be described as arrangements which are more light touch.</p>

If the court is considering such measures in the context of determining whether the risk has been established or whether, as in the present case, such measures will sufficiently ameliorate an identified grave risk, the efficacy of the measures will need to be addressed with care. Clearly, the more weight placed by the court on the protective nature of the measures when determining the application, the greater the scrutiny required in respect of their efficacy.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">I am not persuaded that there is any grave risk of the children being abducted by the father to Morocco. I am satisfied that any risk, whatever, it might be, is met by the father&#8217;s undertaking, and the fact that Morocco and Spain have signed and ratified the 1980 Hague Convention and the 1996 Hague Convention. His undertakings are enforceable in both jurisdictions. </p>
