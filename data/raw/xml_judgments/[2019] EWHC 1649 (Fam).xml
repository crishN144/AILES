Apparently, they met when H, who was supporting himself by doing modelling work, accompanied her as a male escort as his first and last client.  H says that if they had not met he would have gone back to his studies in Bournemouth but I can have no confidence in that as his health difficulties were such that it later became clear to his tutors that he was having difficulty in coping.   </p>

H says that this was for a period of 9 months and W and her mother for no more than a couple of days.  What is clear though is that following her release, which I am inclined to think was sooner rather than later, her passport was confiscated and she was unable to leave the country.   </p>

In August 2005 H went to visit W in Monaco and told her that Georgina was pregnant and he wanted a divorce.  Her account of the conversation, which has not been challenged, is that H had been staying in the flat in Monaco for a couple of days and it was only just as he was leaving to go to the airport that he broke the news to her and presented her with a document, presumably connected with the proposed divorce proceedings, which he asked her to sign.  She declined to sign it.  H returned to London and resumed his affair. </p>

It may be that there were attempts to continue the relationship during H&#8217;s convalescence but I find that it did not continue after 2004.  I come to that conclusion based on H&#8217;s own case that he returned to England whilst she was still in prison and that by the summer of 2005 the marriage was plainly in great difficulties when H was seeking divorce and the wife was, as I accept, horrified at the news of his infidelity.   </p>

Both had difficulty in answering questions, instead preferring to give long accounts unrelated to the question.

However, if this is the case my solicitor has said you would then have to disclose all of your assets to the British court and this would then need to be sworn under affidavit.  If you fail to do that you will be heavily penalised by the court with the risk of imprisonment.  Obviously this would mean that my claim as your spouse for a divorce settlement, considering the amount of time we have actually been married and the fact that I also curtailed my careers by your demands, could end up with you paying a considerable amount and possibly half of your assets, which is a lot more than what I am asking for, basically needing and at the very least am entitled to.  In my case it would mean a heavy divorce settlement from you and you still not getting your British citizenship for a lot longer and with further costs.  Plus the DSS would demand a recuperating payment for the time I&#8217;ve been on income support whilst we have been married and you have not been supporting me as my wife. </p>

Of course in very many cases, possibly most cases, this will be very obviously marked by the parties&#8217; cohabitating, possibly in conjunction with the purchase of a property.  However, in other cases, and this may be one of them, it is not easy to identify.  The mere fact that parties begin to spend time in each other&#8217;s homes does not of itself, it seems to me, equate to marriage.  In situations such as this the court must look to an accumulation of markers of marriage which eventually will take the relationship over the threshold into a quasi-marital relationship which may then either be added to the marriage to establish a longer marriage or becomes a weightier factor as one of the circumstances of the case.   </span></p>

H always had his own home from 2005 onwards and from 2011 it was a property that he himself had selected and purchased.  Neither was able to enter the property where the other lived without permission. He received no financial support from W for the bulk of the year.

The third and fifth of the six safeguards proposed in the consultation document (see para 5 above) were designed to ensure this. Baron J applied these safeguards, found that they were not satisfied, and accorded the agreement reduced weight for this reason. The Court of Appeal did not consider that the circumstances in which the agreement was reached diminished the weight to be attached to it.

It is necessary to have black and white rules of this kind if agreements are otherwise to be binding. There is no need for them, however, in the current state of the law. The safeguards in the consultation document are likely to be highly relevant, but we consider that the Court of Appeal was correct in principle to ask whether there was any material lack of disclosure, information or advice. Sound legal advice is obviously desirable, for this will ensure that a party understands the implications of the agreement, and full disclosure of any assets owned by the other party may be necessary to ensure this. But if it is clear that a party is fully aware of the implications of an antenuptial agreement and indifferent to detailed particulars of the other party's assets, there is no need to accord the agreement reduced weight because he or she is unaware of those particulars. What is important is that each party should have all the information that is material to his or her decision, and that each party should intend that the agreement should govern the financial consequences of the marriage coming to an end. </span></p>

In the past it may not have been right to infer from the fact of the conclusion of the agreement that the parties intended it to take effect, for they may have been advised that such agreements were void under English law and likely to carry little or no weight. That will no longer be the case. As we have shown the courts have recently been according weight, sometimes even decisive weight, to ante-nuptial agreements and this judgment will confirm that they are right to do so. Thus in future it will be natural to infer that parties who enter into an ante-nuptial agreement to which English law is likely to be applied intend that effect should be given to it. </span></p>

Those will include such matters as their age and maturity, whether either or both had been married or been in long-term relationships before. For such couples their experience of previous relationships may explain the terms of the agreement, and may also show what they foresaw when they entered into the agreement. What may not be easily foreseeable for less mature couples may well be in contemplation of more mature couples. Another important factor may be whether the marriage would have gone ahead without an agreement, or without the terms which had been agreed. This may cut either way. </span></p>

If an ante-nuptial agreement deals with those matters in a way that the court might adopt absent such an agreement, there is no problem about giving effect to the agreement. The problem arises where the agreement makes provisions that conflict with what the court would otherwise consider to be the requirements of fairness. The fact of the agreement is capable of altering what is fair. It is an important factor to be weighed in the balance. We would advance the following proposition, to be applied in the case of both ante- and post-nuptial agreements, in preference to that suggested by the Board in MacLeod: </span></p>

The parties are unlikely to have intended that their ante-nuptial agreement should result, in the event of the marriage breaking up, in one partner being left in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more, and such a result is likely to render it unfair to hold the parties to their agreement. Equally if the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned. </span></p>

This, again, is a matter of social policy. But I would suggest that in such a case spousal maintenance payment should only be awarded to alleviate significant hardship. </span></p>

That was achieved by the making of the provision in 2011 in the terms that he sought and would have been achieved even more so if W&#8217;s open offer had been accepted.   </p>

Whether this is or is not a fair outcome is not a matter I can adjudicate upon today.  I simply do not have sufficient information before me and nor have I received detailed submissions on the issue. </p>
