A significant proportion of these communications, particularly between the period July 2017 and October 2017, have been the subject of close scrutiny during this hearing.  Many are abusive.  Others are said to be reflective of DO&#8217;s desire to try to resolve their problems and persuade SO to reconcile.

Counsel for both parents submitted that this is one such case where it was necessary and appropriate for the parents to give oral evidence on a narrow discrete issue concerning some of the communications that had been taking place between the parents, insofar as these were relevant to the issue of acquiescence.  I permitted oral evidence to be given on the strict basis that the evidence was to be confined to the issue of acquiescence and did not stray into other areas; in particular, into allegations raised by SO in support of her defence under Article 13(b).  I made it clear that the giving of oral evidence was not to be used as an opportunity for either parent to express their case on the generalities of their claims against each other.   </p>

Both parents took every opportunity, despite my interjections and attempts from their Counsel, to score points against the other and to refer to the poor behaviour of the other parent.  Any questions not confined to acquiescence were disallowed.  In the event, there was very little of value or relevance gained from oral evidence: I have disregarded it almost in its entirety.  Insofar as the oral evidence strayed into allegations raised by SO against DO, in support of her defence under Article 13(b), I have ignored it completely.

Although it is customary to permit oral evidence at summary return hearings where consent and acquiescence are in issue, the reality is that the extant written material permits a far more reliable assessment than the oral accounts particularly where, as here, the parties have such a strong investment in winning the arguments as to what the past comprised.&#8221; </p>

As Ms Ramsahoye, on behalf of DO, submitted, whilst, at first blush, it may appear that DO was going to move on the United Kingdom, that he had made enquiries in respect of a home, a bank account, shipping items over to this country, it is also clear that he was attempting to negotiate with SO with the aim of ultimately achieving a return of T and SO to America. </p>

However, in order for me to carry out a proper analysis and reach a conclusion about DO&#8217;s subjective state of mind, these communications must be read and analysed in the context of the complexities and dynamics of the relationship that existed between these parents; particularly the way in which they fenced with each other and sought to advance their own position through written communications over many, many months.  The disharmony in the parental relationship was on both sides, as evidenced by the texts sent by SO to DO as early as February 2017.  Over many months DO repeatedly changed his position, back-tracking or advancing a position SO knew was not intended or genuine as, in fact, she confirmed she thought was the case in her evidence.  He would apologise and then return to further abusive communications; a trait well-known to SO. </p>

For a substantial period SO vacillated and skirted around the issue as to whether or not she would be returning, leaving DO unsure about her plans.  She did not tell him in clear terms that she would not be returning and the list she sent to DO by email on 17 August 2017 suggests that she would have returned to California, or at least contemplated doing so, so long as DO complied with her conditions.  Following DO&#8217;s visits to England on 11 September 2017 and twice in October 2017, she refused to discuss the situation with DO, save for the email that took place on 11 October 2017 that led to DO making his request in America to the Central Authority. </p>

She was put on a performance plan by her company and his behaviour forced her to lose her temper.  She contends that T has suffered from DO&#8217;s ongoing financial, emotional, verbal and physical abuse and that he, T, has lost his ability to socialise, attend day care and that they cannot live by the standards that they used to have. </p>

At paragraph 53 of his unsigned and undated statement DO confirms what he would be willing to do.  The further protective measures that he agreed could and would be put in place were confirmed during his sworn evidence and by his Counsel at the end of the hearing prior to final submissions.  SO accepted, through her Counsel, Mr Hosford-Tanner, that <span style="font-weight:bold">if</span> DO does what he says he will do and <span style="font-weight:bold">if</span> protective orders are obtained in America, these steps would provide sufficient protection for her if a return order was made.  SO&#8217;s concern is that because of DO&#8217;s past financial conduct and his lack of disclosure of any documentation to evidence his financial position, the assurances he gives to the court are hollow.  DO confirmed he transferred jointly held capital of $110,000 out of a joint account. He submits that because DO has singularly failed to disclose any evidence in relation to his own finances, his assurances cannot be relied upon.
