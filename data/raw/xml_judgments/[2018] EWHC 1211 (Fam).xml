	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">This hearing has been an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of A on 15 August 2017, who, together with her surviving twin brother, B, was born on 6 June 2017.  No natural cause for her death has been identified and post mortem examinations identified several injuries which are without explanation.  Both parents were arrested.  Ultimately the father has been released without charge and is a prosecution witness.  The mother now stands indicted for murder and child cruelty.  The Police took immediate protective measures in relation to B, and the local authority issued proceedings, the first interim care order being made on 2 August 2017. </p>

Such investigations always produce a vast amount of paperwork, and this case is no different.  The full bundles exceed 15,000 pages.  I have of course received a considerable number of additional documents, position statements and final submissions from each party, as well as supplementary materials.  Mr Larizadeh QC also produced and relies on a number of Research papers that are contained in a separate bundle.  The hearing has spanned 12 days. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>In determining the issues at this fact finding hearing I apply the following well established legal principles.  These are helpfully summarised by Baker J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A Local</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Authority</span> v <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">M and F, and L and M</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/1569" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam)</ref>. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0in">The burden of proof lies with the Local Authority.  It is the Local Authority which brings the proceedings, and identifies the findings that they invite the Court to make.  The burden of proving the assertions rests with them.  (Whilst much recent legal debate has centred on the expression &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221;; see for example <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re BS</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/1625" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 1625" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 1625</ref>), in this case it is not suggested that the relationship between B and his father should be severed.  I nonetheless bear in mind that the burden is on the Local Authority and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> on either parent.  Those cases reinforce the importance of reaching proper findings based on proper facts; the principles are the same whatever the proposed outcome.  Here, there is, as in many cases, a risk of a shift in the burden to the parents to explain occasions when injuries might have occurred.  Whilst that can be an important component for the medical experts, it is not for the parents to explain but for the authority to establish.  There is no pseudo burden as Mostyn J put it in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lancashire VR</span> 2013 EWHC 3064 (Fam).  As HHJ Bellamy put it in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re FM</span><span/><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">(A Clinical Fractures: Bone Density)</span>: [2015] EWFC B26. </p>

If the Local Authority proves on the balance of probabilities that baby A was killed by the mother or sustained inflicted  injuries at her hands the Court treats that fact as established and all future decisions concerning the future welfare of B, based on that finding.  Equally if the Local Authority fails to prove those facts the Court disregards the allegations completely.   </p>

The Court bears in mind that individuals may lie for many reasons such as shame, panic, fear and distress, potential criminal proceedings, or some other less than creditable conduct (all of which arise in a particularly highly charged case such as this) and the fact that a witness has lied about anything does not mean that he has lied about everything.

In other words there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown.  That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof.  It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities &#8230; a conclusion of unknown aetiology in respect of an infant represents neither a provision of professional or forensic failure. &#8221; </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Professor Al-Sarraj reported evidence of traumatic brain injury.  Some of the features are consistent with an old traumatic brain injury of several days to weeks&#8217; duration.  This could be due to one or several episodes of traumatic brain injury in this period.  There was also evidence of recent injury which was of one to a few hours duration.  He found at least two subdural haemorrhages and two subarachnoid haemorrhages, suggesting two or even more incidents, both individually suggesting traumatic origin, but together powerful indicators of traumatic brain injury.  A would have become immediately unwell after the trauma.  A&#8217;s brain showed no evidence of disease (which if present could explain some of the neurological findings, though not all of them); he considered that the delay (between death and post mortem examination of 9 days) would have had no effect on the identification of the subdural injuries.  He did not consider that cranial rebleeding played any part here (or in many cases where he considered that it frequently, was completely misinterpreted and misunderstood in many Court cases).  The degree of force might not necessarily be hard, but the skull fractures and bruises might suggest otherwise.   </p>

Essentially, the brain injury would have led to cardio respiratory arrest (which was why CPR was so essential); she would not have expected survival for longer than 12 hours.  She commented authoritatively upon research in America, in particular a pattern of minor shakes (which can apparently quieten a child), but becoming more serious.  She was also asked about an occasion (on 22/7/17) when A had become floppy.  She was clear that whatever the cause, whether it be spasm of the larynx, </p>

Dr Randall confirmed the fracture but could not comment on causation.

All the evidence she considered pointed to trauma in early July 2017.  Anyone unaware of the cause would have noticed that A was in pain and exhibited reduced movement.  The father noticed both and caused A to be medically examined.  Dr Featherstone, who examined her as a result, did not identify the injury.

Something bad is going to happen today.  And to be honest I really wanted my husband back because I don&#8217;t know why I was sitting before going to bed also I was going everywhere and running everywhere inside our house.  Checking that the cooker is switched off or the fridge is properly closed or the heater.  That the door is properly closed.  I really don&#8217;t know why I was doing that.&#8221; </p>

This is in part derived from the experience of this Court and of other Judges of the Division, frequently but not necessarily in relation to twins, that a previously unidentified rare genetic condition was or might be responsible for the constellation of injuries exhibited by this child.  I have some natural sympathy with this approach in endeavouring not just to produce the gold standard of opinion, but also especially since in rare cases medical science is on the cusp of what is understood and explained, and whilst a diagnosis of inflicted injury may still remain one of a number of differential diagnoses, it may not necessarily be the primary one.   </p>

The site of the older fracture was unusual, she agreed with Dr Halliday and others, that it was not caused by earlier medical intervention (any more than the skull fractures had, which could not have been caused accidentally either by holding the head for feeding or medical procedures).   Dr Ward, a powerful, persuasive and considered witness in evidence, did not consider that there was any &#8220;missing&#8221; evidence justifying further enquiry.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Larizadeh QC argues that it is necessary to have a Report from a Paediatric Neuro Radiologist.  As long ago as December 2017 Dr Halliday stated if there is any question of brain injury or abnormality you will need a neuro radiologist.  Professor Al-Sarraj is of course a neuro pathologist.  Dr Halliday did not consider such a report from such a discipline was necessary (since no neuro imaging was taken at or around the time of A&#8217;s death).  The mother&#8217;s legal team approached Professor Stivaros, an expert well known to the Court.  He was not able to offer assistance in relation to any pre-existing conditions at birth, but could review the imaging for possible birth related abnormality.  The usefulness of that enquiry in the context of this case on analysis is however rather limited.  Dr Halliday thought such an enquiry would be of little use.  Professor Al-Sarraj considered it would be &#8220;necessary - every aspect should be explored&#8221;, but I noted in particular the manner in which he gave that reply and in any event it sat in rather stark contradistinction to what he had to say in relation to genetic testing and EDS.  Having reviewed his other evidence, in particular the unwavering conclusive diagnoses to the Court and in particular his underlying thesis that medical diagnosis is about connecting factors, and focusing on all the evidence together, whilst alternative causation might individually explain some, it could not explain all the injuries, either individually or collectively. </p>

The ultimate enquiry is post mortem.  Professor Al-Sarraj and Professor Mangham concluded that there was no evidence of genetic or metabolic disease that would require further explanation.

The mother subjected A on several occasions to emotionally and physically abusive behaviour, giving rise to pain, injury and tragically, ultimately death.  I doubt that the mother intended to kill A, it being much more likely that she vented her frustration upon her.  I remain troubled about an aspect which I have wrestled with, even though the evidence is clear: the mother&#8217;s failure to properly intervene at all, under the patient instruction of the telephone operator.  Only the mother knows what happened to A, but she knew that she was responsible; she knew that she had injured her.  The mother told me that she did not think that A would die, suggesting a) a responsibility and b) that it had happened before (e.g. 21 July), but importantly she had recovered.  The mother maintained that she had continued the CPR as instructed, but in evidence admitted that she had not.

Knowing that the mother was responsible for the death of A, the father is hardly likely to put B&#8217;s welfare, let alone, life, at risk. </p>
