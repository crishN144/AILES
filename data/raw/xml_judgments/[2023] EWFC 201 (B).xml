X is a country in East Asia and Y is an East European country. Unfortunately day 1 of the hearing was required to update the parties on the guardian&#8217;s final analysis.

I have had care of the case since a further case management hearing on 20 April 2023. Within the proceedings there has been parenting assessments undertaken with respect to both parents and wider family in X. The case has been extended outside of 26-weeks largely as a result of the need for the father to travel to this jurisdiction as part of the assessment process but also to enable a three-day final hearing. Judgment will be handed down in week 38. The full procedural history can be found in the hearing bundle.</span></p>

At outset both sought the making of a child arrangements order in favour of the father on the basis that the child would be placed into a boarding school environment living with the father either in this country, X or Y (or a combination of all) during school holiday breaks. This was to be supported by a supervision order. However, by the end of the case both the applicant and father had reached the view that the best outcome for the child was a care order on the understanding that the child&#8217;s contact with his father would be generous. It is an unusual feature of this case that, by agreement, the child has spent time overseas with his father in the course of the proceedings - including in country X which is a Non-Hague Convention Country.</span></p>

I met with the child prior to Court on 23 October 2023 and a note of my meeting was provided to the parties. I refer to these views later.</span></p>

There was little if any residual dispute as to the contact plans that would be in effect were a care order made. It was agreed contact would be generous and liberal when compared to many cases in which a care order is made.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">My paramount consideration is the welfare interests of the child. In considering this I have regard to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and to all the circumstances of the case. I presume it will be in the child&#8217;s welfare interests to have a relationship with both parents so long as such is safe for him. The making of a care order requires the Court to find a legal threshold crossed under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. This is a test which requires the Court to find the child has (for the purposes of this case) suffered significant harm at a given date (typically the commencement date of the proceedings) or would be likely to suffer significant harm if an order were not made and that such harm is attributable to the care being given to the child not being that which a carer would be expected to provide to the child. Plainly the above requires a factual matrix to be agreed or found by the Court. In this case the threshold is not in dispute. However, I bear in mind that any factual disputes are resolved on the balance of probabilities with the burden of proving the allegation placed on the party making the allegation and with no burden of disproof. The legal finding that the threshold is crossed does not resolve the case. It simply opens up the potential for the Court to make public law orders either placing the child into the care of the applicant (care orders) or under the supervision of the applicant (supervision order). Whether to make any such order brings into focus the welfare of the child. It also requires the Court to have regard to the article 8 rights</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

Within the year the mother was pregnant with the child. The statement evidence suggests the relationship was poor from an early stage. In general terms the mother describes a situation of isolation and loneliness with the father spending time at work. She also details allegations of domestic violence. Early in the proceedings I considered whether these allegations should form any part of this process. It was agreed they did not need to be resolved given their historic nature and given the lack of contact and likely future contact between the parents. The allegations are denied. It seems the parents emotional relationship ended when the child was about 1-year of age. The mother highlights financial difficulties in the relationship. In 2012/13 the father moved to live and work in Y. In 2014 the mother and child temporarily moved to Y to share a home with the father but this broke down quickly with further allegations of domestic violence and the mother returned to this country alone. During this period the child was placed with paternal family in X. This lasted for about 5 &#189; months during which time there was dispute between the parents as to whether the child should remain there or return to this country with his mother. Ultimately the mother appears to have surreptitiously removed the child using his UK passport. On return to this country the mother was assisted by a leader within her church whilst she made housing applications and obtained accommodation for her and the child.</span></p>

His support is said to have ended in 2018 when he filed for divorce. The accommodation she obtained was far from ideal but she remained there with the child for 8 years until her eviction in early 2023. Over time the mother noted concerning behaviour on the part of the child. He was said to be challenging towards her and low in mood and angered quickly. In the period between 2015-2018 the father maintained contact with the child but this stopped in 2018 after the filing of the divorce. Between 2018-22 the father is said to have been absent from the child&#8217;s life. In 2021 the child was taken to A&amp;E as a result of his presentation. He was referred to mental health practitioners and reported suicidal thoughts. In 2022 the mother received an eviction notice and they were evicted in early 2023. This was incredibly stressful for the mother as she struggled to find replacement property. On eviction they were placed in a  one-bedroom room in a hostel with shared facilities. At the time of the final hearing the mother remains within this placement but is due to be evicted from this as she has been deemed to be intentionally homeless having turned down an alternative housing offer. In February 2023 there was an incident which the mother puts down to a disagreement over internet usage by the child. In the course of the incident the child is said to have been verbally abusive to the mother and she admits &#8216;slapping him in the mouth with the back of her hand&#8217;. It seems the child then made a call to the church leader, the police attended and the child was placed in police protection. On removal the child made clear he did not want to return and initially the mother agreed for him to be accommodated with the church leader.</span></p>

Prior to this he had been on a child in need plan with similar concerns since December 2021. In February the child messaged the church leader about being hit and then was video messaging her when he could be seen to be hit with an object and with the mother&#8217;s hands. The church leader attempted to pacify the mother but when this failed the police were called. Initially, the applicant planned to place the child into his father&#8217;s  care and he traveled to this country to collect the child. The plan was to take him to X. However, there was a dispute as to the child&#8217;s passport and this was not possible. The initial statement details a history of physical and verbal abuse from the mother with the child explaining his low mood and suicidal thoughts as being linked to this abuse (not the home conditions as suggested by the mother). This is said to have continued despite earlier police involvement and the signing of a written agreement. Prior to the issue of proceedings the applicant had sought to work with the mother and offered various avenues of support, however the same were declined and it was felt the mother was unwilling to engage with the applicant. The mother offered a time limited <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s20</ref> agreement. As a result an interim care order was sought and this was granted by the Lay Magistrates on 24 February 2023. For most of the proceedings the child was opposed to having any contact with this mother. Efforts were taken to re-establish the relationship and this appears to have had some success in the weeks prior to the final hearing. As noted above the child has re-established a relationship with his father and there has been both indirect and direct contact including periods of overnight care overseas in X.</span></p>

He has denied the allegations made against him but not provided a full history of the parents relationship. He has however made it clear that he supports the reconciliation of the mother-child relationship and would support the applicant in its efforts in such regard. He expressed no fundamental issue with the child spending time with the mother if this was consistent with the child&#8217;s wishes. He raised no concerns as to the improving situation in the relationship with mother as noted above. As noted above the key focus of the father has been on outcomes. He has initially suggested options of placement in either X or Y but readily accepted this would not be possible given the child&#8217;s opposition to being placed overseas. His alternative was a privately funded boarding school option for the child which he felt would be better than foster care. He held onto this option up to final hearing but ultimately did not pursue the same in the light of the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings. Finally he raised whether the foster-care placement should be under a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> agreement rather than an order.

He has said he has forgiven her for her behaviour. She agreed housing has been a material issue but that many families face this struggle. It is the response to this which is problematic in this case and the ability to respond to support offered. The mother does need the work offered otherwise there is a risk of repetition. She doubted the efficacy of the work undertaken voluntarily by the mother online.

He showed maturity as to the issues confronting the Court with respect to his future care. I do not agree with the mother that his expressions were clearly wishing to return to her care. He was very clear that he did not want to attend boarding school as proposed by his father. However, he also made clear a broad wish to remain where he is and to continue within his current schooling. When considering living with his mother he did reference returning to her care but this was expressly represented as being part of a scheme to enable her to achieve housing. It was clear to me the child found himself in a dilemma between his own wishes and his genuine wish to assist his mother. Having heard the evidence it is clear to me that within their unregulated contact the mother will have likely made clear (consciously or otherwise) her deep and current anxiety as to what her future housing will be. It is not at all surprising that this sensitive teenager will have shaped his views to partly meet his mother&#8217;s own needs. Notwithstanding this the child expressed a concern/belief that were he in fact to return to his mother then the cycle of chastisement would recommence. I shortly return to whether this is a fair assessment. This is a child with age and understanding and whose views demand consideration without necessarily being determinative. I accept the evidence from the guardian, which has been gathered directly from the child, of his wish to remain where he is in foster care. This does not mean I simply follow this wish. Absent good reason this would be a disproportionate interference but it is an important ingredient in the decision I have to make.</span></p>

Particular to him is a need now for consistent and predictable care on a safe basis. He requires carers who are themselves emotionally settled and able to regulate their own emotions. The child cannot afford a return to the period of unsettled care which proceeded his placement into care. I agree the housing issue will have been a very important factor in what went wrong in this case. It is clear the housing provided to the mother and child was barely adequate. It is a very sad indictment of housing provision within this country that such is the state of the available housing stock for desperate families such as the child&#8217;s. The short sighted failure to provide a basis level of good housing for families in need leads to greater and far more costly social problems that then require intervention and resolution. But this is not for with the Court or Children&#8217;s Services to resolve. This family are far from alone in the situation they face and I have neither the power of the entitlement to promote their housing needs over others who share their plight and whose cases are not known to me. But I do not accept the housing issue was the sole cause of the issues in the case. As with many cases one finds a matrix of factors interacting and leading to the problem confronting the Court. Here the housing is likely overlaid by the issues concerning the mother&#8217;s mental health and her related inability to manage her emotions in times of stress. A further factor has likely been her social isolation and financial struggles. In short the mother is vulnerable by reason of her poor mental health and financial difficulties and the housing problem has placed a further weight on her shoulders. I accept she does not analyse the case in this manner and sees the housing as being the only real issue which once resolved will resolve all concerns. I consider that this is a wish rather than a reality. In any event it is far from clear as to the future trajectory of her housing and there is no obvious basis on which to predict a positive resolution within the foreseeable future. My concern would be that the child would simply return to a placement in which the previous cycle recommenced. I consider the child has correctly identified this worry in his own evaluation of the circumstances. This would be profoundly damaging for him as it would lead to further instability and would endanger those aspects of stability he has achieved and which appear to have enabled him to make good progress. I would be concerned such instability would be associated with a marked downturn in his own mood and mental health and this would (at this stage in his development) have likely long term / life long implications.</span></p>

As I have noted above this might lead to highly damaging consequences were it to fail. I am troubled by the following features which surround this option. First, it is not clear to me the mother has developed a good understanding of why it was that things developed as badly as they did prior to the child&#8217;s placement in care. I consider she has sought an easy explanation around the housing issue rather than carrying out a more introspective assessment which would likely be more challenging for her but would be more valuable for the mother/child relationship. Finding easy answers does not always lead to stable outcomes and  an easy answer would be prone to instability when stressors (outside of housing) reappeared. Second, the mother has frankly made it clear that she is unwilling to work with the applicant post proceedings. She looks to resolve her issues independently. Whilst I give her credit for the efforts she has made I am concerned that such self-help runs the risk of failing to entrench new and positive behaviour patterns. Online learning has a value and purpose but change is more likely to be found in a package of intense and direct work.</span></p>

The father has equally shown a commitment to the child during these proceedings and I am in now way critical of the proposals he has put forward. I do not agree the suggestion of boarding school indicates a lack of insight or understanding on his part. In my assessment this was a considered attempt on his part to find a child focused solution to the problems facing his family. In any event he has come to modify his position. It is a sad feature of this case that the parents readily accept there is little prospects of their adult relationship being repaired for the benefit of the child. I am confident they are sufficiently mature and intelligent to establish a co-operative and workable relationship around their child. He would benefit from he same as it would given him the sense of his parents working for the same purpose in his interest. Given the allegations this need not be a direct relationship but a simple structure based around indirect communication such as a family app would help immensely.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">In general the court has a range of options spanning the spectrum from no order up to the most draconian option of absolute separation via adoption. In this case a variety of different options have been trailed before me but ultimately I am left with a binary decision between a care order and a return to the mother. I reject the suggestion (which is not formally argued) of placement under an enduring <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref>. I consider the father was absolutely right to reflect on this as an option and reject the same. Listening to the evidence it was clear to see the impossible position this would place the applicant in were the same to be approved by the Court. It would be providing accommodation without any real control in circumstances in which the parents were in active disagreement, incapable of communicating and with the father out of the country. Added to this is the very real difficulty of the mother&#8217;s opposition to social care and an unwillingness to work co-operatively with the applicant. The options remain those above and an order delineating the terms of placement is required.</span></p>

I endorse the arguments put forward as to the very real benefit of maintaining the current placement. It is working for the child and permits him to remain in schooling in an environment that has been shown to work for him. It is also a placement that permits a relatively open dialogue with both parents. I would struggle to see the circumstances in which this should be unsettled in pursuit of an ethnic match given the child&#8217;s strong support for the placement and given his ongoing contact with his parents which fortifies his identity.</span></p>

The risk is far too high of a repeat of the previous pattern of behaviour. Although I cannot predict the future I consider the mother would benefit from a package of direct work which helps her address her challenges. I accept an important aspect for her will be settled accommodation and recognise this remains unclear for the time being. My hope would be that she obtain housing within the short term and then uses the next year to re-set her emotional position whilst maintaining contact with the child. It may be that this permits a re-evaluation of her place as primary carer for the child. But only time will tell. At this time a combination of a lack of change and poor co-operation and openness leave me to conclude she cannot safely meet the child&#8217;s day-to-day care needs.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">In contrast placement in care offers the child security and stability. He is currently thriving in his placement and the challenges relating to his mental heath appear to have largely abated. He has been able to establish a safe and positive relationship with both his parents from this position and it appears clear this is of value to him. Judged holistically it is the better option for the child and the one that fits with his welfare needs.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">I am not required to rule on contact as it is agreed the child will maintain an open indirect dialogue with his father and the applicant is committed, as holders of parental responsibility, to an open attitude to extended periods with the father including overseas. In the case of the mother contact has developed in an organic manner. This is not ideal in that it leaves the child in a position of some pressure. It is clear the mother has shared with him more than is helpful about her housing plight (she admitted as much) but I sense the danger / impossibility of stricter control of contact has to be recognised and the child given some latitude to see his mother on his own terms. I suspect this will enable him to manage his own emotions in a more sustainable manner than were he to face limited time with her. He has shown a willingness to disengage entirely when the situation is intolerable and this should indicate to the mother the need to be child focused in her contact. Given his age, modern media and his travelling for school I consider it unrealistic to place strict boundaries on contact. I consider the far better course is a clear working agreement /&#160;plan in which the child and foster carer are the key parties. This child is  able to understand why a plan may be helpful and it should be possible to construct an agreement which he can both understand and appreciate as to its purpose.</span></p>
