	    <p class="p18" style="margin-left:0.49in">This is an application made in care proceedings instituted by a local authority in relation to a number of children, the eldest of whom is 16. The first Respondent (in the care proceedings) is the children&#8217;s mother. Two of the four fathers involved are parties to the proceedings but were not, I understood, playing an active part in them. The youngest child&#8217;s father, who is not a party, is currently serving a substantial prison sentence. The other parties to the proceedings are, of course, the children themselves, by their CAFCASS guardian.</p>

	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">The case is of a type which presents particular difficulties to a local authority. The children&#8217;s mother has a history of drug addiction, and a criminal record. She has plainly been involved in a number of unsatisfactory sexual relationships, and the children have been placed at risk On the other side of the coin, however, is the fact that the children all have a strong attachment to her, and a removal from her care would involve the fragmentation of the family into a series of long term foster placements.</p>

	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">The local authority has not yet formulated its final care plan, and there is a hearing of the care proceedings fixed for 5<span style="font-style:italic"/>days in the County Court starting on 13 October 2003. However, a particular issue has arisen which the Circuit Judge has transferred to this court for determination. The issue is this: the local authority seeks directions from the court about the extent to which it<span style="font-weight:bold"/>may disclose to the other parties to the proceedings (and in particular to the mother) a sensitive piece of confidential information which it has received from the police, and which the police do not want disclosed any further. The information in question has been shared with the children&#8217;s guardian, but with nobody else. In particular, the mother has not been served with the application, and does not know of its existence.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">In the period leading up to 11 April 2003, the 5<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>eldest children had been placed, under interim care orders, with their maternal grandparents. However, it had became apparent that the maternal grandparents could no longer cope, and the local authority resolved to place the children with their mother, keeping the interim care orders in place. The mother had been homeless, but had found accommodation which was suitable for her occupation and the occupation of the children. The move was due to take place on Friday 11 April 2003.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">Also in April 2003, the social workers in the case received information from the Child Protection and Sexual Crime Unit (CPSCU) of the local police that the police had information suggesting that a black man believed to be a supplier of heroin and crack cocaine was living at the mother&#8217;s address. The social workers were also provided with certain additional details relating to that information.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">The social workers were told by the police that they were not at liberty to disclose this information to any family member, or the legal representatives of any party, since to do so would prejudice a large police operation, and could also put an informer&#8217;s life at risk.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">Two of the local authority&#8217;s social workers visited the mother&#8217;s home in the early evening of 8 April. The door was opened by the mother&#8217;s niece. However, before the door was opened, the social workers say they saw the shadow of a tall figure move quickly past a window. They then entered the property and saw what they described as &#8220;a tall thin black man with spiky hair, standing, apparently trying to hide&#8221;. He then disappeared into one of the other rooms. The mother then came in from another room. Somewhat surprisingly, the social workers do not appear to have asked the mother who the man was. They told her they were there to look at the property so that they could give information to what they described as &#8220;Conference&#8221;. They asked the mother to show them round the house.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">The social workers comment that the mother had clearly been preparing for the children to join her, and the house seemed cosy and clean. They had no concerns about the state of the property. However, in the first bedroom they noticed a sleeping bag, and in the third bedroom they saw folded clothes, which they both suspected were a man&#8217;s clothes. They were too big for the mother. They concluded, accordingly, that they had seen the man referred to in the information given by the police. They do not, however, appear to have challenged the mother about a man living in the house.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">On the following day, 9 April 2003, the police reaffirmed their instruction that the information was not to be shared with any family member or their legal representatives. On 10 April 2003 one of the social workers made a statement setting out the facts I have already outlined, and on the same day<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>an application was made to the district judge in the county court seeking permission not to disclose the social worker&#8217;s statement to the other parties. This, I was told, was done to provide time for the local authority to liaise with the CPSCU and decide how to proceed.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">The upshot of a series of applications to the county court, (none of which was served on the mother or her advisers) was an order by the Circuit Judge, having heard counsel for the local authority and the guardian (with whom the information had been shared with the agreement of the police) and a solicitor for the police, that the application be transferred to the High Court; that the various previous interlocutory orders on the point be not served on or disclosed to the other parties; that various statements, including the statement of the social worker to which I have referred, two reports by the guardian and a statement from a detective sergeant from the local police authority likewise should not be served on or disclosed to the other parties.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">The local authority accordingly seeks my directions on the dilemma in which it finds itself. In my judgment, this is an entirely appropriate course for the local authority to adopt. It is naturally anxious to promote inter-agency co-operation. It does not want the police to be inhibited from passing on important information relevant to child protection because it has felt obliged to alert the mother and her advisers to the allegation against her. At the same time, it owes child protection duties to the children in the case - it has parental responsibility for them under the interim care order. If it is the case that the mother is living with, or accommodating, a drug dealer, that is plainly a highly material factor in protecting the children and planning for their future.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">The local authority told me that it felt it had no alternative but to allow the children to return to their mother&#8217;s care on 11 April 2003. If it had sought to remove them to alternative foster placements it<span style="font-weight:bold"/>would have had to explain why it<span style="font-weight:bold"/>was doing so, and the disruption to the children&#8217;s lives in attempting to arrange a series of foster placements at short notice outweighed, in its judgment, the possible risk of the presence of a drug dealer in the mother&#8217;s home. I was also told that the children appear currently to be doing well in their mother&#8217;s care The local authority does not, however, appear to have investigated any further whether or not there is a man (or <span style="font-style:italic">the</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>man) living in the house. Equally, the guardian&#8217;s visit to the house on 22 April 2003 was inconclusive.</p>

	    <p class="p19" style="margin-left:0.49in">However, an important feature of the case, in my judgment, is that as a condition of the children returning to live with her, the mother signed an agreement with the local authority which contained amongst other provisions, the following:-</p>

It detailed extensive and on-going criminal activity on the part of the father. This statement identified the danger of harm to her and the risk of the father abducting the child of the family. Charles J identified the stages of any issue relating to disclosure as (1) was the relevant threshold test satisfied? And (2) if it is, are there, nonetheless, grounds for refusing disclosure? He also emphasised the need for a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). He directed disclosure of a redacted version of the social worker&#8217;s statement and he put over the issue of disclosure of a further statement by the mother to another day.</p>

These are care proceedings. The local authority has to establish the threshold criteria under section 31. That is achieved by proving facts on the balance of probabilities which establish significant harm or the likelihood of significant harm. The burden of proving those facts lies on the local authority. All these propositions derive from the decision of the majority of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] AC 563" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] AC 563</ref>, and are well known.</p>

Plainly, the presence of a drug dealer in the house is a highly material factor when considering both the threshold criteria and the children&#8217;s welfare.</p>

Since it<span style="font-weight:bold"/>seems to me inevitable that the information should be disclosed to the mother, I do not think such an additional hearing necessary. However, it<span style="font-weight:bold"/>does seem to me important to consider not just what information should be given to the mother, but the extent to which additional information should be given to her solicitors (and possible the solicitors to the other parties) on the basis that it is not passed on to the lay clients.</p>

In my judgment, however, the mother&#8217;s advisers are entitled to know the wider picture, and to be satisfied that the process has been fair. This means that they are entitled to see the evidence which has been placed before the court, provided that they do not, without the court&#8217;s permission, pass to their client any information beyond that which I propose to direct she should be given. This restriction applies in particular, of course, to information which the police fear will either compromise their investigation or harm their informant.

The mother had signed - or was being asked to sign - a contract under which she promised not to allow anybody to stay in her house overnight without the local authority&#8217;s consent. The social workers were, therefore, fully entitled to visit and ask her questions designed to ensure that nobody had been staying overnight. They could have asked her about the man they saw, and about the man&#8217;s clothing they saw without compromising the information they had received.
