	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">  D was born on [a date in] 2012 at a hospital in England. She was born with multiple ailments and diseases. As a result she has spent her entire life in hospital. A very full report by a consultant paediatrician, indicates that D suffers, or is suspected to suffer, from, inter alia, sublugotic stenosis, chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, visual impairment, epilepsy, sickle cell disease inherited from her parents, aspiration pneumonia, and gastroesophageal reflux. As a result she has suffered multiple cardio-respiratory arrests, is fed naso-gastrically and has undergone both insertion of a central line and a tracheostomy through which she is continuously administered oxygen &#8211; she is oxygen dependant. She will require 24 hour intensive care even upon discharge from hospital.</p>

The police have completed their investigation and do not intend to charge the mother. They based their decision on the mother&#8217;s denials that she had touched the oxygen tap; the absence of her DNA on the relevant tap; and their belief that the only DNA which could be identified on the tap belonged to the father. In fact, the police were mistaken about the last point. It has been confirmed that the major contributor to the DNA profile found on the relevant tap belongs to D herself, obviously transferred to the tap by another person. The mistake however will clearly not alter the police decision.</p>

The father was born on 24 September 1972, also in X, and is thus aged 41. They commenced a relationship in 1999 and have two older children now aged 13&#189; and now aged 9. In 2005 the father came to this country. At some point after he came here the mother married the father&#8217;s brother and lived with him and the two children in her country of origin.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">The father has a very chequered immigration history. He entered the country under a six-month visitor's visa. He overstayed that visa. Subsequently he has made false statements to the Home Office. In May 2007 he applied for leave to remain on the basis that he had entered this country in 1989. In November 2007 he made representations to the Home Office through his MP and stated that he had entered the country in 1992. In 2009 the father formed a relationship with a French national, L, who was exercising treaty rights here and on the basis of a claimed marriage to her applied on 18 February 2009 for an EEA family member residency card under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006. In fact the father did not marry L until 2010. At all events the father was duly issued with the residency card on 21 September 2010 and this is valid until 21 September 2015. Therefore the father is lawfully present in this country, even if the story is punctuated by acts of dishonesty by him. That dishonesty is most prominently exemplified by his conviction in the Crown Court on 25 June 2009 for using a false document (a forged French passport) and making false representations for gain, for which he received a sentence of 6 months&#8217; imprisonment.</p>

He returned to their country of origin after about 2 weeks. The mother then resumed her sexual relationship with the father and fell pregnant. If the mother was 25 weeks pregnant when D was born on 13 September 2012 then that would suggest that she became pregnant on 22 March 2012, before her arrival here. However a DNA test has shown that the father is overwhelming likely to be D's true father. The mother did not leave this country on 27 August 2012, as she should have done. She is therefore an over-stayer and is subject to a weekly reporting requirement by the Home Office.</p>

The hospital had drawn up an agreement with the parents with the aim of one or both of them staying overnight with D on alternate nights. The mother was expected to stay on Saturday 29 June 2013 but failed to attend the ward. On Sunday 30 June 2013, the mother visited D with a female whom she described at the time as her &#8220;sister&#8221;. The mother was reluctant to stay but eventually agreed to do so. At all events the mother stayed in D's room on the nights of Sunday 30 June 2013 and Monday 1 July 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in"><marker name="tab"/>During the night of 1 July and in the morning of 2 July 2013 D's oxygen supply came through a device which was plugged into the oxygen supply at the wall. I shall describe that device although there are pictures of it in the bundle and I have been given an identical one to examine. The device is made by Oxylitre Ltd. It is, when looked at from the top, Y-shaped having a single connection point to the wall oxygen supply leading to two egress arms. When looked at from the front each arm has a glass flow-meter on top, the oxygen outlet below, and a white tap to the side, pointing out. The white tap controls the rate of the oxygen supply. The supply is turned on by rotating the tap anti-clockwise. When in the closed position the tap is held by a slight grip.  When turning the tap on from the closed position the user would distinctly feel a slight release of that grip before the tap turned freely.  If the supply is already on but the user wanted to increase it, he or she would not feel that grip &#8211; the tap just turns freely. It is therefore likely that by feel alone a user would immediately know if a tap was closed or open.</p>

This would have been on all the time, unless the left hand arm was in use. The left hand egress arm was connected to the nebulizer, which is device that prepares medicines as a mist or spray which then is mixed with the incoming oxygen. Certain medicines are given to D this way.      </p>

The level is signified by a red ball in the flow-meter. The device can supply up to 15 LPM. To give 3 LPM the tap needs to be turned about 180 degrees, or half a revolution. If things are bad for D then the supply will be increased perhaps to 6 LPM, which requires a number of complete revolutions. </p>

The left hand reading is the oxygen saturation in the blood; the right hand reading is the heart-rate. A normal oxygen saturation reading is around 97 (the datum is the percentage level). If it falls below 92 then the alarm sounds. This happens often because the probe falls off. The alarm can be silenced by a red button on the top right hand face of the monitor.</p>

Nurse G checked D's oxygen saturation level; it was at 92 and therefore just normal. She placed on the mother&#8217;s bed a meal menu. She then left the room taking the emergency tracheostomy box in order to check that it was in good order at the nurse&#8217;s station, which was directly outside D's room. At the station Nurse G met the student nurse J, who asked her if she could check the oxygen supply device and the suction equipment. Nurse G agreed. </p>

The mother was in bed. She checked the nebulizer by turning the tap on the left hand egress arm of the oxygen supply device on and off i.e. a short turn anti-clockwise followed by an equivalent turn clockwise. She checked the suction device. She says she did not touch the right hand arm of the oxygen supply device. Nurse G then re-entered the room; she recalls that J summoned her, but J has no such memory. J states that she remembers commenting to Nurse G that D seemed to be working harder to breathe. Nurse G states that in addition to the alarm sounding (which was not unusual) D had gone very pale and was emitting much saliva and other secretions from her mouth and nose. She glanced at the flow-meter and concluded from the position of the red ball that the oxygen supply was very low. While looking at D she reached for the right hand tap with her left hand and on feeling the grip to which I have referred concluded that it was turned off. She immediately turned the tap through a number of revolutions to take the supply to 6 LPM. She stated to J that the oxygen tap was off J responded that she had not touched the right hand tap; she had only touched the left hand one.</p>

If the judging exercise is done in parallel, rather than in series, as I believe it must, then it can be seen that the least unlikely explanation is in fact that the oxygen supply was not turned off. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">I have already indicated that on the barest balance of probabilities Nurse G was right to deduce that the oxygen supply was turned off. The grip on the tap in the off position is distinct if slight. She has been consistent in her contemporaneous statements. She is an experienced and meticulous nurse. On the other hand, she accepted that this may well have been an event where the oxygen saturation level fell even though the oxygen was on, and that she may have jumped to a conclusion. There was a great drama happening and attention to detail may have been wanting. Having considered the matter very carefully I am satisfied, just, that the supply was turned off, but I do record that my doubts are very real.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">If the mother turned off the supply then she must have done so just before J entered the room who, let us recall, intended to check the &#8220;functioning of the wall mounted oxygen supply&#8221; (per Nurse G's statement). For two people to have touched the device within such a short span of time for different reasons would have been an extraordinary coincidence. Further, it seems improbable that if the mother had a filicidal intention that she would act on it at this nursing change-over time when there was much coming and going and a general air of busy-ness. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">It was suggested that the mother would have been exhausted by a second night of broken sleep and did this act out of love to relieve D of her suffering. As against that the mother&#8217;s belief system as a Muslim (as explained by each of the parents, and of which I can take judicial notice) would strongly militate against such conduct. Although the mother&#8217;s evidence was given in a foreign language and translated I watched her very carefully and formed the view that it was unlikely that there would be any circumstances where she would try to kill one of her children. I am entitled to take into account the inherent unlikelihood of a mother intending to murder her own child. I do not place any weight on H's subjective feeling that her rapport with the mother had changed. This is far too nebulous and intangible on which to base any conclusions.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">I have considered Nurse G's statement that she saw the mother standing by D's bed in the 4-5 minute window before J entered the room. I consider that it is likely that Nurse G  is mistaken about this. In her oral testimony she stated that when she first entered the room the mother was in bed, asleep. J saw the mother in bed when she entered. I think it more likely than not that the mother was in bed throughout that period. But it is in that period, and only in that period, when she must have done the deed, if she did do it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">It must be recalled that J entered the room specifically to check the functioning of the wall mounted oxygen supply. She says that she turned the left hand tap on and off but did not touch the right hand tap. That would not have amounted to a check of the supply. I consider that it is distinctly possible that she checked both but neglected to turn back on the right hand tap.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.6in">Having weighed all the evidence very clearly I conclude on the balance of probabilities that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">if the supply was turned off</span> the mother did not do it. In the light of Lady Hale&#8217;s strictures I do not ascribe a percentage probability to this finding but I am confident in it. But it does not follow from this finding that I am concluding that J did turn the supply off by accident. Far from it. A correct application of the laws of probability leads me to conclude that in relation to her also I am not satisfied on the balance of probability that she accidentally turned off the supply.</p>
