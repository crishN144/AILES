Contact took place on occasions, but it does not seem to have acquired any degree of regularity or permanence; in particular F did not see or hear from the children for the whole of the summer of 2016, although M says that is explained at least in part by a bereavement in her wider family which caused her and the children to be absent for a while.  </p>

She says in her statement that she was in fear of her life from Mr A.  On her case, he had said that he would kill her rather than accept a separation; she was terrified for her life.  Whilst that may have played a part in her actions, I consider it likely that she was also motivated by the knowledge that (i) the psychologist&#8217;s report would be read by the German court which was due to hold a hearing the following month, and (ii) its recommendations might be accepted by the court and (iii) accordingly, direct contact might be re-introduced against her firm wishes. </p>

M did not attend the hearing, nor was she represented.  I am not aware of any orders having been made in Germany since that date. I enquired of counsel whether any application had been made for recognition of that order under Article 21 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003.  I was told that no such application had been made.  Accordingly, I cannot determine whether the German order should be so recognised and, in particular, whether any of the exceptions to recognition listed at Article 23 apply.  It seems to me that I must proceed on the basis of the Hague Convention alone. </p>

The clear impression I have formed on reading the papers is that the children&#8217;s lives were somewhat chaotic, peripatetic and far from happy in those early months, unsurprisingly so given the considerable upheavals. The oldest child, for example, is recorded by the Cafcass Officer as describing the accommodation in the United Kingdom as &#8220;bad&#8221; and his school was rated by him as only &#8220;5 out of 10&#8221;. </p>

Her remit was to consider the children&#8217;s ages, maturity and objections rather than make an overall return analysis. She was clear, measured and sensitive in her evidence. She confirmed and enlarged upon her report. The oldest child, she told me, has unhappy memories of Germany, particularly schooling there, and has a clear objection to returning.  The girls, by contrast, see things more in terms of their relationship with their mother.  The Cafcass Officer felt that clear explanations and preparation before any return would be reassuring.  She felt that there is an element of M influencing the children but was not prepared to be drawn any further than that. She confirmed that the children oppose contact with F although, as I have already remarked, the 2 girls did see F later. </p>

I found her to be strong willed and determined in her presentation to me, a trait which was also noted by the German psychologist report.  Her views were expressed in forthright and robust manner.  She reiterated that she would not return to Germany, said that the children should not see F and that she is utterly terrified of Mr A, from whom she believes she cannot be protected. </p>

The Convention does not require the court in this country to consider the welfare of the child as paramount, but only to be satisfied as to the grave risk of harm. I am not satisfied that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation, if the mother refused to go back. In weighing up the various factors, I must place in the balance and as of the greatest importance the effect of the court refusing the application under the Convention because of the refusal of the mother to return for her own reasons, not for the sake of the child. Is a parent to create the psychological situation, and then rely upon it? If the grave risk of psychological harm to a child is to be inflicted by the conduct of the parent who abducted him, then it would be relied upon by every mother of a young child who removed him out of the jurisdiction and refused to return. It would drive a coach and four through the Convention, at least in respect of applications relating to young children. I, for my part, cannot believe that this is in the interests of international relations. Nor should the mother, by her own actions, succeed in preventing the return of a child who should be living in his own country and deny him contact with his other parent."</span></p>

In testing the validity of an Art. 13(b) defence, trial judges should usefully ask themselves what were the intolerable features of the child's family life immediately prior to the wrongful abduction? If the answer be scant or non-existent, then the circumstances in which an Art. 13(b) defence would be upheld are difficult to hypothesise. In my opinion Art. 13 (b) is given its proper construction if ordinarily confined to meet the case where the mother's motivation for flight is to remove the child from a family situation that is damaging to the child's development.

The report of the psychologist referring to the intense bond developed between the children, in particular the eldest child, with F and the paternal grandmother is telling.  It is objectively improbable that such a bond would have developed if the children felt in danger from him.  The separation of the eldest child from F is described by the German psychologist as an extreme burden on the child. </p>

The children, like the parents, are German.  They lived all their lives in Germany until March 2018.  Their extended families are in Germany.  Their first language is German. They had no connection with the United Kingdom before their arrival here. Their lives here have been unsettled with a number of moves and no consistency of accommodation or schooling. The courts in Germany were seised of the case for well over a year before M and the family came to the United Kingdom. They are far better placed to deal with the welfare issues than the courts of this jurisdiction; those welfare issues may include where the children live, contact and perhaps also whether M should be permitted to relocate with the children from Germany to the United Kingdom. The German social services were engaged with the family for a period measured in years and a family psychologist report was prepared in Germany.  The authorities (legal and non-legal) in Germany are likely to have a much better understanding of this case than their counterparts in this jurisdiction, and undoubtedly are better positioned to resolve factual and welfare issues.  </p>

It is hard to see how F, and the paternal grandmother, could achieve a successful reintroduction of contact from the distance of Germany in circumstances where M is resolutely opposed to contact. Difficulty in pursuing legal proceedings from afar, together with difficulty in implementing and enforcing welfare decisions, may prove too much for F.   </p>

Her conclusion, which I accept, is that all 3 children are of an age and maturity where it is appropriate to take account of their views.  All the children express opposition to returning to Germany.  In the case of the oldest child, he has unhappy memories of Germany both in respect of home and school life; he feels far happier in his current location where there is a supportive Muslim community.  He scores life in England as &#8220;7-8&#8221; out of 10 as opposed to life in Germany which he rates as &#8220;2&#8221;. It also appears that the oldest child was aware of the reason for leaving Germany, namely the behaviour of Mr A, whereas the younger children have no knowledge or recollection of the reasons behind the move. The middle child similarly described accommodation and schooling in their previous location in negative terms and life in England as &#8220;10 out of 10&#8221;. She became sad at the prospect of returning to Germany and said that she would wish her mother to be with them. The youngest child struggled to remember much about Germany, did not want to return to Germany and rated living in England at 100 out of 100. </p>
