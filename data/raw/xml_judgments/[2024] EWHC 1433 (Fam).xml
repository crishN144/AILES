It gives a name for C which is different from the name for her used by F. The certificate is blank as to the identity of C&#8217;s father. Despite these oddities/gaps, for these purposes I intend to take F&#8217;s case at its highest and therefore assume that (i) he is C&#8217;s father, and (ii) he had a relationship with C after her birth. Given (i) that M has not filed any evidence, and has not engaged in the proceedings other than some brief exchanges with Cafcass officers, and (ii) F, as I have indicated, has produced prima facie evidence of his case on these matters, it seems to me to be reasonable to proceed in this way. </p>

Some habitual residences may be harder to lose than others and others may be harder to gain. If a person leaves his home country with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and acquire a new one very quickly. If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then or even later. Of course there are many permutations in between, where a person may lose one habitual residence without gaining another.&#8221;</span></p>

It would, again, be difficult to see how this would be consistent with the need to "approach the use of the jurisdiction with great caution or circumspection", at [59]. It is not just a matter of procedural caution; the need to use great caution must have some substantive content. In this context, I have already explained why I consider that the three reasons set out in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">In re B</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">&#160;would not provide a substantive test and, in practice, would not result in great circumspection being exercised.</span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.74in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">The final factor, which in my view supports the existence of a substantive threshold, is that the 1986 Act prohibits the inherent jurisdiction being used to give care of a child to any person or provide for contact. It is also relevant that it limits the circumstances in which the court can make a s.8 order. Given the wide range of orders covered by these provisions, a low threshold to the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction would increase the prospect of the court making orders which would, in effect, "cut across the statutory scheme" as suggested by Lord Sumption in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">In re B</span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">, at [85]. This can, of course, apply whenever the jurisdiction is exercised but, in my view, it provides an additional reason for limiting the exercise of the jurisdiction to compelling circumstances. As Henderson LJ observed during the hearing, the statutory limitations support the conclusion that the inherent jurisdiction, while not being wholly excluded, has been confined to a supporting, residual role.</span></p>

Otherwise, and I am now further repeating myself, I do not see, in practice, how the need for great circumspection would operate.</span></p>
