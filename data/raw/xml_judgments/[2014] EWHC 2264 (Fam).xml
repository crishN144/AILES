	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the latest application in a bitterly contested private law (Hague Convention) dispute. It is the fourth judgment I have given. Many judgments have previously been given by other judges, both in this country and in Spain. One to which I need to refer is a judgment given by Theis J on 25 January 2013: <span style="font-style:italic">Cambra Jones</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/88" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 88 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 88 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 FLR 5" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 FLR 5</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first two judgments I gave were each delivered on 21 August 2013: <span style="font-style:italic">The Solicitor General v J M J (Contempt)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/2579" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 2579 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2579 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 FLR 852" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 FLR 852</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re Jones (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/2730" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 2730 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2730 (Fam)</ref>. In the first of these judgments I explained why I had dismissed an application by Her Majesty&#8217;s Solicitor General for the committal to prison of the first respondent (the mother) for breach of an order made by Hedley J on 9 October 2012. That order had required the mother, amongst other things, to return the second respondent (Jessica) and her younger brother Tomas (Tomas) to Spain. In the second judgment I explained why I was making a further order requiring the mother to return Jessica and Tomas to Spain.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The time for compliance with that order has expired. Neither Jessica nor Tomas has returned to Spain. The father, by application dated 29 January 2014, sought the committal of the mother for breach of my order. The hearing of the father&#8217;s application had been listed for hearing on 6 March 2014. Very shortly before, notice was given by solicitors for Jessica that she wished to take part and be represented at the hearing of the committal application. Mr David Williams QC appeared on her behalf to make that application. His application was supported by Mr Christopher Hames on behalf of the mother but resisted by Mr James Turner QC and Mr Edward Devereux on behalf of the father. After hearing argument I decided that Jessica should participate as a party to the committal proceedings: <span style="font-style:italic">Cambra v Jones</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/913" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 913 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 913 (Fam)</ref>. That necessitated an adjournment of the hearing, which was re-fixed for 30 April 2014. At the same time I gave the father permission to amend his application to seek in addition the mother&#8217;s committal to prison for breach of an order I had made on 20 August 2013 requiring her to bring the children to London next day. Neither child was brought to London.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Jessica was born in January 1998, and was therefore 15 years old in the autumn of 2013; Tomas was born in January 2000, and was therefore 13 years old. Jessica and Tomas had been joined as parties to the Hague proceedings in January 2013. Both were interviewed by the immensely experienced Mr John Mellor. There is a transcript of the evidence that Mr Mellor gave to Theis J on 30 November 2012. His evidence focused upon the wishes and feelings of Jessica and Tomas as expressed to him in interviews the day before. The whole of that transcript requires careful reading. I illustrate the high points by reference to a small number of particularly striking passages.</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In my judgment the harsh reality is that both Jessica and Tomas have been fundamentally let down by their mother by her refusal to comply with the court order requiring them to return to Spain. She has put them in an impossible situation which has resulted in them being physically separated from their siblings, with whom they have always lived and clearly have a close relationship with. Her actions have, in my judgment, fractured those significant relationships to the long term detriment of all the children. Despite the orders in place in the Spanish courts and the attempts by this court and the Court of Appeal, together with undertakings offered by the father to ensure the return would take place with no risk to the mother of further proceedings on her return to Spain she has, wholly unreasonably in my view, refused to exercise her parental responsibility in relation to Jessica and Tomas in such a way that would assist and support them to return to Spain and be re-united with their father and siblings.&#8221;</p>

I do not see her position now in isolation, it has been part of a concerted campaign by her over a number of years to thwart and undermine the legitimate orders made regarding the welfare of these children in Spain.&#8221;</p>

That is a question of construction and, thus, a question of law. (2) The next task for the judge is to determine whether the defendant has done what he was required to do and, if he has not, whether it was within his power to do it. To adopt Hughes LJ&#8217;s language [in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>], Could he do it? Was he able to do it? These are questions of fact. (3) The burden of proof lies throughout on the applicant: it is for the applicant to establish that it was within the power of the defendant to do what the order required, not for the defendant to establish that it was not within his power to do it. (4) The standard of proof is the criminal standard, so that before finding the defendant guilty of contempt the judge must be sure (a) that the defendant has not done what he was required to do and (b) that it was within the power of the defendant to do it.&#8221;</p>

He subjected the evidence to careful scrutiny with a view to demonstrating &#8211; successfully &#8211; that although long on generalities it was strikingly thin on the detail of any specific things allegedly said or done by the mother. He drew attention to the fact that there was no evidence of any attempt by the mother either to threaten or actually impose sanctions or to hold out inducements with a view to getting the children to comply. Why, for example, had she not threatened &#8216;grounding&#8217; or the confiscation of mobile phones, computers or other electronic equipment? He commented that the mother appears able easily to exercise parental responsibility in relation to Jessica and Tomas in relation to <span style="font-style:italic">all </span>other aspects of their upbringing. Yet she claims to be unable to ensure their compliance with the court&#8217;s orders. Why? Because, he says, she has declined to exercise her parental responsibility, having no wish that the children return to Spain.

The question is whether the father has proved to the criminal standard, so that I am sure, that the mother had it in her power, in the one case on 20-21 August 2013 and in the other case in September 2013, to do what the orders required. Could she do it? Was she able to do it? Mr Hames and Mr Williams make common cause in submitting that she did not and could not. Mr Williams submits that Jessica and Tomas remain in the same intransigent frame of mind described by Mr Mellor. Mr Hames points out that there was no modification of the children&#8217;s position even when confronted with the possibility of their mother&#8217;s incarceration. </p>

The question ultimately, therefore, comes down to this. Has the father managed to prove, so that I am sure on the totality of the evidence I have read and heard, that the mother could, whether by argument, persuasion, cajolement, blandishments, inducements, sanctions or threats falling short of brute force, or by a combination of them, have ensured compliance with the orders? In my judgment he has not. Has the father managed to prove, so that I am sure on the totality of the evidence I have read and heard, that the mother could, as Mr Turner asserted, have ensured compliance with the order for the children&#8217;s return to Spain by herself returning to that country? Again, in my judgment, he has not. In relation to the order providing for the children&#8217;s return to Spain, the father, in my judgment, falls well short. In relation to the order providing for the children to be brought to London, the father&#8217;s case is much stronger, though not, I have concluded, strong enough to meet the criminal standard of proof.</p>

He said that in such circumstances it was not fair or just to expect the father to be able to satisfy a persuasive burden as to the possibility of implementation. Therefore, he submitted, fairness and, indeed, the requirement of the Convention jurisprudence that States take all reasonable steps to implement judicial orders, justifies the imposition of strict liability, or at least a persuasive (or reverse) burden, on the mother. So, he said, where, as here, the mother has not made any serious attempt to implement the orders, proof by the father of the bare fact of non-compliance should be sufficient, unless the mother can satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that compliance was impossible.  </p>

Indeed, it does. He suggested that the burden of proof referred to in those authorities is to be construed as being the burden of proving simply the fact of non-compliance. That, in my judgment, is an impossible contention. Finally, he submitted that the authorities were decided <span style="font-style:italic">per incuriam</span> inasmuch as they did not address the analogy of the position under criminal law, and the approval of that position by the Strasbourg court, to the effect that even in criminal law a reverse burden may be justified if it is proportionate and does not impose a burden on a defendant unfairly. One matter to be borne in mind, he says, is the ease or difficulty that the respective parties would have in discharging the relevant burden.

But the simple fact, in my judgment, is that in this particular context &#8211; the law of contempt &#8211; such an approach has not been adopted. The law on this point is clear. Moreover, and despite Mr Turner&#8217;s suggestion to the contrary, the law on this point, in my judgment, is Convention compliant.

It is deeply saddening and deeply troubling that parents can be quite so unspeakably selfish as to conduct this kind of battle over years and years and stand by and watch their children pay the price of it.

His written submissions dated 4 July 2014 identify four grounds of appeal in relation to matters on which, he submits, I have fallen into error. The first is his contention that questions of possibility or impossibility of compliance are simply irrelevant. The &#8216;offence&#8217; is one of strict liability, so that if there has been non-compliance contempt is established irrespective of any question of possibility of compliance. The second, in the alternative, relates to the &#8216;reverse burden&#8217; issue dealt with in paragraphs 27-29 above. The third is his contention that a &#8220;purposive construction&#8221; of the relevant orders is required (see paragraphs 17-18 above). The fourth is a challenge to the finding (see the fifth and sixth sentences of paragraph 25 above) that the father has failed to prove that the mother could have ensured compliance with the order for the children&#8217;s return to Spain by herself returning to that country.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I refuse permission to appeal. In relation to the first ground I regard the point, which was scarcely argued before me, as unarguable. In relation to the second and third grounds I draw attention to what I said in, respectively, paragraphs 29 and 18 above. The law is clear. I am not persuaded that Mr Turner&#8217;s contentions to the contrary have any real prospect of success. In relation to the fourth ground this is an attempt to challenge a finding of fact &#8211; or, rather, a finding that the father had failed to persuade me of something to the criminal standard of proof &#8211; in circumstances where that finding was arrived at having regard to the totality of all the evidence, including the oral evidence, referred to in the judgment. Insofar as this ground is framed as a &#8216;reasons&#8217; challenge, the reasons sufficiently appear from, in particular, paragraphs 5-6, 19 and 23-25 above.</p>

These are matters on which the decision as to whether to give permission to appeal is best left to the Court of Appeal. For my own part I would not grant permission on this basis. As Mr Williams submits, the children have suffered years of litigation and it is not right to subject them to yet further litigation in pursuit not of their own welfare but rather of some general public interest. </p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Turner submits that since my decision was a decision to <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> exercise the jurisdiction to punish for contempt of court, the power to issue a certificate under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> is not inhibited by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58/section/15/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15(4)</ref>. I do not agree. As Mr Williams put it, a decision whereby contempt is not found proved is as much a decision made &#8220;in the exercise of jurisdiction to punish for contempt&#8221; as a decision finding contempt. Precisely so.</p>
