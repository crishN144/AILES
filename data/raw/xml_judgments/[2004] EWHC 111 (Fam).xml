	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Claire F is a young woman, not yet quite 25 years old, who is serving a long sentence of imprisonment. On 20 September 2002 at Doncaster Crown Court she was convicted of a drug-related offence of aggravated burglary of a dwelling-house. On 17 December 2002 she was sentenced to 6 years&#8217; imprisonment. However, on 5 September 2003 her sentence was reduced by the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, to 5 years. This is not her first experience of prison for she has several previous convictions and in August 2000 received a sentence of 12 month&#8217;s imprisonment. She was pregnant when sentenced and on 11 January 2003 gave birth to a daughter, Lia-Jade. Her earliest parole release date is 13 March 2005, when Lia-Jade will be 2 years and 2 months old; her non-parole release date (the earliest date when she is certain to be released) is 12 January 2006, when Lia-Jade will be 3 years old. She is currently serving her sentence, and has Lia-Jade with her, in the mother and baby unit (&#8220;MBU&#8221;) at HMP New Hall, near Wakefield. This is one of the four prisons within the Prison Service which have MBUs, the others being HMP Askham Grange, near York, HMP Holloway, London, and HMP Styal in Cheshire. New Hall and Holloway take babies up to 9 months old; Askham Grange and Styal take babies up to 18 months old.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is, of course, inherent in the very fact that the mother is a prisoner a tension between three potentially conflicting interests: those of the mother, those of her child, and those of the Secretary of State. Everyone has the best interests of the child at heart, but the mother&#8217;s view of where her child&#8217;s best interests truly lie may not accord with the view of the Secretary of State. The mother&#8217;s views may be coloured by a perception on her part (whether justified or not) that conditions in prison will be more congenial for her if she is in an MBU with her child rather than elsewhere in the prison system. The mother&#8217;s interest in keeping her child with her in prison may in fact conflict with the child&#8217;s interest in being brought up &#8211; albeit by someone else &#8211; in a more &#8220;normal&#8221; environment. There may be reasons of good order and discipline why a child should not be allowed to remain in an MBU with his or her mother even though it would otherwise be in the child&#8217;s best interests to do so. As Maurice Kay J (as he then was) said in <span style="font-style:italic">R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2003/155" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 155 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 155 (Admin)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 979" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 979</ref>, at para [31]:</p>

The Secretary of State does not. Nor does any other public authority, unless the child happens to be in care, in which case the local authority will have parental responsibility under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, or happens to be a ward of court, in which case custody of the child is vested in the court: see Lowe &amp; White, Wards of Court (ed 2), para 1-8. But the exercise by the mother of her parental responsibility, like the exercise by a local authority of its parental responsibility and even the custodial powers of the wardship judge, necessarily take effect and operate subject to the necessary requirements of the mother&#8217;s imprisonment: see <span style="font-style:italic">A v A Health Authority, In re J, R (S) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2002] EWHC 18 (Fam/Admin), <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] Fam 213" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] Fam 213</ref>, at paras [47]-[56], and more particularly <span style="font-style:italic">R (Howard League for Penal Reform) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2002/2497" uk:canonical="[2002] EWHC 2497 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWHC 2497 (Admin)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 484" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 484</ref>, at paras [136], [142]-[148]. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus in the final analysis it is for the Secretary of State to decide whether or not a baby should remain in prison with his or her mother. Likewise, insofar as that decision requires consideration of the baby&#8217;s best interests, in the final analysis it is for the Secretary of State to decide where the baby&#8217;s best interests lie. Parliament has conferred that power and responsibility on the Secretary of State. Rule 12(2) of the Prison Rules makes it quite clear that the decision is one for the Secretary of State: not the mother; not the local authority; not the court.</p>

That is what the Secretary of State has done. His policy is enshrined in Prison Service Order (&#8220;PSO&#8221;) 4801, the second edition of which was published on 10 May 2000. Putting the matter very shortly &#8211; the position is, of course, more complex than this: I will go into the details in due course &#8211; the policy in PSO 4801 is that in most cases the upper age limit for children to live with their mothers in prison is 18 months.

On 9 September 2003 a Separation Care Plan Meeting decided that Lia-Jade should be separated from Claire on 10 October 2003, that is, when she was 9 months old. The plan was for her to go to live with her maternal grandparents, Claire&#8217;s mother and father. That meeting was chaired by an Independent Chair, Ian Milner, a former Deputy Director of Social Services who has worked for over a decade as an Inspector in the Social Services Inspectorate. One of those attending was Mahala Hodgson, the Governor in charge of the MBU at New Hall. She wrote on 11 September 2003 to Hazel Banks, the acting Head of the Prison Service Women&#8217;s Estate, reporting the outcome of the meeting, sending her all the relevant papers and saying that she believed there were three options available: Option 1: Lia-Jade separates from Claire on the date originally agreed (18 September 2003); Option 2: Lia-Jade separates from Claire on 10 October 2003, when 9 months old; Option 3: Lia-Jade remains with Claire until she is 18 months old, which would mean moving to Styal (like New Hall a closed prison) and then to Askham Grange (an open prison) if Claire became eligible. The papers were reviewed by Nicholas Montgomery-Pott, the Head of the Women&#8217;s Estate Policy Unit in the Security Directorate of the Prison Service, who the same day (11 September 2003) minuted the file with a note to the effect that Option 2 was &#8220;reasonable&#8221; and that &#8220;the paperwork backs up the reasons for the decision to separate&#8221;. The formal decision was taken later the same day by Ms Banks. Having read all the papers and discussed the case with Mr Montgomery-Pott she came to a decision. She agreed with Mr Montgomery-Pott. So the decision of the Separation Care Plan Meeting stood.</p>

Her application was supported by a witness statement Claire made on 29 September 2003. The Secretary of State filed an acknowledgment of service indicating his intention to contest the claim and asserting that the mandatory order sought by Claire can be made only within judicial review proceedings. On 23 October 2003 Johnson J gave directions, including directions that Lia-Jade be added as a defendant and that the Official Solicitor be appointed to act as her litigation friend. Against the Secretary of State&#8217;s opposition he also directed that there be leave for the papers to be disclosed to an expert child psychologist or psychiatrist to be jointly instructed by Claire and the Official Solicitor. On 3 November 2003 the Official Solicitor filed an acknowledgement of service stating that he would investigate the claim and notify the parties whether he was supporting or opposing it. In the event he has supported it.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Foster adopts an intermediate but more complex position. She accepts that the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision is that of a public authority acting within a statutory framework. But, she says, it is important to distinguish between two different elements that may often be present informing the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision in cases such as this:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in">First, there may be operational reasons, for example, reasons of good order and discipline within the prison, which come into play, as they did, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic">R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2003/155" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 155 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 155 (Admin)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 979" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 979</ref>.

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, and this will be an essential feature of every case, there is the question of the child&#8217;s best interests. This, she says, is an underlying fact forming part of the essential factual matrix informing the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision. It is not an operational question, nor, she says, is it a discretionary decision where a range of responses may be lawful in public law terms. It is a question of a kind which the court is very familiar with and which it will readily determine when required.</p>

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case, as Miss Foster points out, the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision was made solely on grounds of Lia-Jade&#8217;s best interests. There were no stated operational reasons for the decision. This is not a case where reasons of good order and discipline within the prison came into play. The case turns on a single issue &#8211; Lia-Jade&#8217;s best interests. Moreover, as Miss Foster also points out, there are no reservations whatsoever with Claire&#8217;s parenting skills. Dr Black, who has watched the BBC tape though she has never met either Claire or Lia-Jade, describes Claire as &#8220;a young mother making an excellent job of mothering.&#8221; There are no worries either about Claire&#8217;s behaviour or about her handling of Lia-Jade.</p>

Moreover, and she is very clear about this, although judicial review is, as she rightly says, a challenge retrospectively to a decision fixed at a single point in time, a best interests decision is, she says, a decision to be taken by the judge upon the evidence as it emerges at the hearing which, as she rightly says, may, particularly in the case of a young child, reflect a different set of facts as time has passed. So my evaluation of Lia-Jade&#8217;s best interests is to be made in the light of all the evidence available to me at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>

This is not a case like <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>where I was not being asked to impose on a public authority any burden which it was unwilling to assume and where, accordingly, the matter lay entirely within the field of private law and fell to be determined by the court by reference to the usual Family Division criterion of best interests. This is a case, like <span style="font-style:italic">A v A Health Authority</span>, like <span style="font-style:italic">R (A, B, X and Y) v East Sussex CC (No 2) </span>and like <span style="font-style:italic">R (IR) v Shetty</span>, where in the final analysis what the claimant is seeking is the assistance of the court in thrusting upon the Secretary of State &#8211; a public authority &#8211; a burden and an obligation which he is unwilling to assume: in the present case the obligation to keep mother and child together in an MBU. Such a case raises issues of public law to be determined, whether in the Family Division or in the Administrative Court, by reference to the appropriate principles of public law. It follows from this that the primary decision maker is the Secretary of State and not the court. The court&#8217;s function in this type of dispute is essentially one of review &#8211; review of the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision &#8211; rather than one of primary judicial decision making. It is not the function of the court itself to come to a decision on the merits. </p>

The decision-maker is the Secretary of State and it is he who must decide within his discretionary area of judgment whether the interference with family life &#8230; is necessary in a democratic society, that is to say justified by a pressing social need, and in particular proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In that decision making process, he has in accordance with the Convention and the Human Rights Act, a discretionary area of judgment in achieving the necessary balance. &#8230; The task of the Court, in accordance with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, is therefore supervisory of that discretionary area of judgment. The court must decide whether the Secretary of State has, within the discretionary area of judgment accorded to him, struck a fair balance, between the relevant interests &#8230; It will do so by subjecting his decision to intense and anxious scrutiny on an objective basis to see whether he could reasonably have concluded that the interference was necessary to achieve one of the legitimate aims set out in Article 8.2 and was proportionate.</p>

Both differed from the present case in one vital respect: in each there was, quite apart from any challenge to the public authority&#8217;s decision-making, a quite separate and distinct reason for the court to be involved. In <span style="font-style:italic">In re D </span>there were wardship proceedings on foot in relation to the children embracing issues extending beyond the one issue which involved the public authority whose decision was under attack. In <span style="font-style:italic">A v A Health Authority</span>, as I explained at paras [111]-[114], there were five issues before the court, four of which required a judicial determination of the claimant&#8217;s best interests and only one of which involved a judicial review of public authority decision-making. It was in that context that, as Woolf LJ put it in the passage in <span style="font-style:italic">In re D </span>at p 1417 which I quoted in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A Health Authority </span>at para [58] and picked up again at para [115], the proceedings &#8220;supplemented any powers which the local authority wanted to exercise but did not purport to oust such powers or their exercise.&#8221; Here the position is quite different.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There are conflicting views about whether babies should be in prison. Some argue that facilities should be expanded to cater for older children. They emphasise the key role of a mother in a child&#8217;s emotional development and argue that separation causes long term emotional damage to the child. Others argue that prisons are unsuitable places for children and suggest that the child&#8217;s bond does not necessarily have to be with the mother but can be to any adult to who the child becomes attached.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">To date, prisons in England have taken a compromise position. They accept that the prison environment is not really suitable for children but that for very young babies it may be in the child&#8217;s best interests to remain with his or her mother rather than be separated. However, older children need freedom of movement and contact with older children, which my not be available in the prison setting. Reflecting this policy, Holloway and New Hall take babies up to the age of nine months, while Askham Grange and Styal take babies up to the age of 18 months.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">There has been little research on the progress of babies in prison nurseries apart from Catan&#8217;s (1989) study. She compared the development of unit babies with babies separated from their imprisoned mothers and cared for in the community. Both groups of babies showed normal, healthy physical growth and their overall development fell within accepted norms. However, the babies who stayed in the units for four month or more, showed a slight and gradual decline in locomotor and cognitive scores. Once they started to sit up, crawl and walk there was less opportunity for the unit babies to explore and make use of these skills. Instead, they spent relatively more time confined to baby walkers, bouncers and pushchairs and had few places to go other than the nurseries and their mothers&#8217; rooms. When babies left the units, there was a significant increase in their general development scores, whereas the development of babies left outside remained stable over the follow-up period. These findings gave support to the 18 months upper age limit for unit babies.&#8221;</p>

The primary issue in that case (see para [54]) was the lawfulness of a policy which contained a rigid cut-off date of 18 months for the age of a child in a MBU, although as I have already mentioned the claimants also sought to challenge the application of this policy in their particular cases.

A typical example would be where a mother is due to be released from prison soon after her child&#8217;s cut-off age, and it is considered better for mother and child to leave prison together. This ad hoc discretion, which is nowhere articulated in writing, does not extend to permit the much longer stays requested by the present applicants.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[101]<marker name="tab"/>In our view the policy must admit of greater flexibility than that. We say so for two inter-related reasons. The first is that the policy&#8217;s own declared aim, both in general and in individual cases is to promote the welfare of the child &#8230; We accept that this aim has to be set in the context of what prison and the Prison Service is all about. It cannot therefore, despite all Mr Gordon&#8217;s eloquence, be the only aim. But if the effect of the policy upon an individual child&#8217;s welfare will be catastrophic, the policy is not fulfilling its own objectives. The policy documents themselves contemplate the need for individual consideration. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[102]<marker name="tab"/>The second reason is that the interference with the child&#8217;s family life which the Prison Service has allowed and encouraged to develop must be justified under Article 8(2). In considering whether the interference is proportionate to its legitimate aims, the service will have to strike a fair balance between those aims. These fall into three basic categories. </p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[103]<marker name="tab"/>First, there are the necessary limitations on the mother&#8217;s rights and freedoms brought about by her imprisonment. She cannot expect to be provided with a child care facility for the whole of her sentence. The service is entitled to expect that she will accept their offer of a place at a MBU knowing what those limitations are. She must accept that her primary parental responsibility is to make the best possible arrangements for the care of her child throughout her sentence. This means that if her sentence will last longer than the age for which the facilities are suitable, she should be expected to make sensible plans for their separation or to co-operate with the plans made by others. Indeed it is sensible to offer places at the outset for a target length of time, to expect the mother to have some exit strategy (even if it is local authority accommodation), and to review this strategy regularly during the placement. </p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[104]<marker name="tab"/>The second is the extent to which any relaxation in the policy would cause problems within the prison or the Prison Service generally. In particular, how would it affect good order and discipline within the prison itself? How would this be perceived as favouritism, not only by other mothers but also by other prisoners? This will depend to some extent upon the particular arrangements within the particular prison. But there may be wider implications, if the demand for places continues to rise and has to be denied because some children are staying longer. The length of the mother&#8217;s sentence must be an important consideration here. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[105]<marker name="tab"/>The third is the welfare of the individual child. Here there are three main factors to be considered. The first is the extent of the harm likely to be caused by separation from the mother. This will depend upon the quality of the relationship between them, the arrangements made for the transition, and the arrangements made for contact after the separation. The second is the extent of the harm likely to be caused by remaining in the prison environment. This will depend upon the nature of that environment, the facilities there, and the facilities which could be provided by local social services to make good the deficiencies in the prison environment. The third is the quality of the alternative arrangements. A good local foster placement is quite different from a placement of dubious quality a long way away. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[106]<marker name="tab"/>We understand that the Prison Service must usually operate along clearly defined and clearly understood lines which leave little room for individual discretion, but the policy itself emphasises the need for individual consideration, so there can be no insuperable objection to a discretionary element in these decisions. In the great majority of cases, almost all of these considerations would point to separating mother and child at or before the age of 18 months. After that age the harm to the mother&#8217;s family life could not normally outweigh the harm to the welfare of the child or to the good order of the prison. But there may be very rare exceptions where the interests of mother and child coincide and outweigh any other considerations. The mother must be given a fair opportunity to argue that that is so.&#8221;</p>

Kathryn identified several practical issues such as needing high chairs and also needing a bed for a child instead of a cot. The child does not mix with children of her own age and is demanding attention from other prisoners. She has become the &#8216;novelty&#8217; child to the other women because she can speak. It is predicted that the child will find it had to adapt to a situation where she is not the centre of attention and where there are children of her age. Concerns have been raised that the child will pick up Prison Service jargon and hears much swearing. Askham Grange have had to agree to give the mother extended time on her days out of the prison in order to stimulate the child. This has caused resentment on the part of the other mothers.</p>

The accommodation at Styal consists of 18 Victorian houses set in gardens within the prison perimeter fence, and mothers are allowed to take their children into these gardens to allow for a larger space for play. Mr Seed says that the effect of this is that the children in the unit come into contact with other prisoners, who include 22 lifers serving sentences for offences including murder and offences against children, and he considers this contact to be undesirable.</p>

He mentions, too, the jealousies created among other inmates who believe the prisoners in the MBU are allowed special treatment, and fears that if there was an expansion of the unit, or if mothers were likely to spend an increased amount of their time resident there, difficulties concerned with the need to preserve good discipline throughout the prison might increase.</p>

It is not a normal home environment for a child. There have been numerous incidents of children learning and using prison jargon which they overhear. Their surrounding environment is still institutionalised and despite best efforts cannot be entirely flexible. There are occasional disagreements between mothers caused by the stress of having to live with their children in such an environment. If a perception develops that one prisoner is getting special attention because of the needs of their child, this can cause disagreement within the unit.&#8221;</p>

Dr Black and Dr Lansdown agreed to prepare a paper setting out briefly the learning on the implications of separating children of various ages from their mother.  Thereafter the Steering Group was transformed, with a membership expanded in due course to include Mr Milner, Ms Walton and Ms Hodgson, into the Mother and Baby Policy Group.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;A sudden unplanned separation of young children from their mother (or primary caregiver) is traumatic and can lead to lasting psychological damage both to the child and the mother. Our understanding of the effects of separation has grown steadily since the pioneering work of John Bowlby and the Robertsons which began just after the second world war and in the last seven or eight years there has been a series of studies by Peter Fonagy and colleagues at University College London looking at the long term effects, examining also the intergenerational influences of attachment patterns.</p>

The key factor is whether the children have sufficient language to be able to prepare them adequately for the change.&#8221;</p>

Glaser (2000) pointed out that environmental influences can affect the actual structure of the brain in a long lasting fashion. She writes of the way in which &#8220;early experiences shape neural connections in the developing brain &#8230; Changes in the family&#8217;s social context and in the child&#8217;s immediate caregiving relationships, as well as the child&#8217;s own adjustment, all influence the later outcome for the child&#8217;s development.&#8221; A key point is that the rich and extensive neuronal links which Glaser is discussing can be formed only in the first eighteen months of life.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;A commonplace of child psychology is that children vary hugely in their needs and their characteristics, as do families. In this context one major difference is that the problems presented by mothers with short sentences (ie up to two or three years) are different from those whose sentences are longer. Other differences are seen within the child: the characteristics and needs of children under six months old are not the same as those of eighteen months; those of a two year old with learning difficulties are not the same as those of a child of the same age whose intelligence is normal. This is particularly pertinent when separation is concerned since it is very much harder to prepare a child for a break with the mother if the child has no language.</p>

Although their physical and intellectual development was unimpaired, the transition from mothers to the alternate carers was, in Catan&#8217;s words, &#8220;rarely smooth.&#8221; If the child stayed within the family, the majority of carers were late middle aged and even elderly women, aunts or grandparents. Many of the babies followed by Catan experienced several changes of substitute care, three babies changed four times in less than a year, and over 70% of the babies were cared for by more than one person. Contact between the children and their mothers was often sporadic.</p>

The composition of the assessment/planning team will vary to some extent depending on the needs of the case, but the core should include, as well as the mother and the appropriate prison staff, the community paediatrician and a representative of social services.</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is common ground that the decision-maker was obliged to have regard to the best interests of AD when considering whether or not to separate mother and child. One source of that obligation is the policy of the Prison Service itself. &#8230; In addition, a decision-maker within the Prison Service is bound to give effect to Article 8 of the European Convention &#8230; It is obvious that a decision to separate mother and child engages Article 8. It is an &#8216;interference&#8217; with the right to family life. Moreover, it is common ground, in the present case, that the best interests of AD are in his being with his mother. The evidence to that effect is unequivocal. The final item of common ground in this context is that, notwithstanding the &#8216;primary consideration&#8217; status of the child&#8217;s best interests and the engagement of Article 8, these matters are not by themselves determinative of the issue whether a decision to separate is lawful, even though it could be contrary to the best interests of the child and would amount to an interference with the Article 8 rights of the child and its mother. The substantive dispute in the present case centres upon two issues, namely (1) did the decision-maker in fact accord primary consideration to the best interests of the child? and (2) was the decision to separate a permissible one in the sense of being justifiable and proportionate?&#8221;</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Perhaps the most startling thing about this case is that there are no prescribed procedures governing a decision to exclude and separate in these circumstances, notwithstanding the magnitude of such a decision. There is a rigorous procedure for admission to an MBU and it is made clear in [PSO 4801] that temporary or permanent separation may occur in a number of circumstances including when there is an imminent risk to the child as defined by the Local Area Protection Child Care Procedures, when a woman has failed to comply with the compact into which she enters upon admission, and when as a consequence of a disciplinary offence, or blatant and/or persistent misdemeanours which are likely to affect children on the unit, it is no longer possible for the mother to remain on the unit with her child. In other words, there is provision for the substantive pre-conditions to exclusion and separation. However it does not address the procedural aspect. PSO 4801 refers to plans being made at the earliest opportunity to ensure suitable arrangements for separation when the baby reaches the maximum age limit which, at Styal is eighteen months. There is a reference to separation in circumstances &#8216;agreed by the multi disciplinary team&#8217;.

However, these new procedures were not confined to cases of the type he had had to consider, for they are described as applying to &#8220;separations which are contentious and are usually without the mother&#8217;s consent&#8221;. That description is apt to cover the present case, even though it does not fall into any of the situations given by way of example (&#8220;for example, where the mother&#8217;s behaviour is such that it proves disruptive to the rest of Unit residents, or the mother is deemed to present some form of risk to her own child, other children, or other mothers&#8221;). The separations to which the new procedures apply are contrasted with &#8220;separations which are planned and carried out with the full consent of the mother&#8221; &#8211; which is plainly not this case. I need not, however, go into these procedures in detail, for there is no complaint that they have not been complied with in the present case.

On 25 June 2003 Dr Black and Dr Lansdown, with others, produced a paper <span style="font-style:italic">Mother and Baby Units in Prison &#8211; What should be the Age-limit? An International Perspective</span>. This summarised the practice in a number of countries, demonstrating that &#8220;the variation in the way babies and young children are accommodated is enormous&#8221; and pointing out that &#8220;a number of countries allow children to remain to a later age than in the UK but usually in open conditions.&#8221; Two such countries are Australia, where some of the States allow children to remain with their mothers up to the age of 5, and the Netherlands, where children can stay until the age of 4.

One possibility which DB and RL have put forward is that children over the age of 18 months might, in some circumstances, be looked after during the day by child minders in the community, returning to their mothers at night. This would replicate the pattern that is found in many families where both parents are working, and would give the mothers in prison the chance to be with their children at the all-important times of getting up and going to bed. The challenge now is for the Prison Service to look to see what modifications might be made in the light of all this information.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In other words, says Ms Richards, ever since PSO 4801 was published the policy has been not that separation at 18 months is the norm but that separation should take place at the age which best meets the child&#8217;s interests &#8211; and that will normally be no later than 18 months. Eighteen months is the upper limit, not the norm. The only major change in the policy, she says, is a softening in the rigidity of the 18 months upper limit to meet the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P&amp;Q</span>. There has been a change of emphasis in the practical functioning of the policy, reflecting in particular the expert advice from Dr Black and Dr Lansdown, which has had the effect &#8211; foreshadowed, she says, both in paragraph 27 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Response and Action Plan</span> and in PSO 4801 &#8211; of producing separation at earlier ages than was previously the case. What one sees in the subsequent work of the Steering Group and the Policy Group, she says, is not a change in the policy but rather an ongoing and active debate as to how the policy might be implemented. The paper by Dr Black and Dr Lansdown is not a statement of policy; it is, says Ms Richards, merely advice to the Secretary of State, albeit advice that has subsequently informed his application of the policy.</p>

For example it reminded readers that a baby needs a constant care to bond with and develop normally but that that person does not have to be his/her mother. That in turn leads naturally to the conclusion that where separation is inevitable, earlier separation may be in the child&#8217;s best interests as it is least damaging because that allows for bonding with a long term carer.&#8221;</p>

The current policy follows that set out in the Review and has not changed fundamentally since it was promulgated in the PSO: the best interests of the child continue to be the central criterion. What has changed is the quality and depth of the consideration that is given to the assessment of the child&#8217;s best interests. The possibility that separations would take place early in a mother&#8217;s sentence was always envisaged as one of the consequences of proper assessment of the child&#8217;s best interests. The Review commented that &#8220;members of the working group were disturbed by the perceived assumption amongst staff and prisoners that all children allocated to a place will stay to 18 months if the mother&#8217;s time in custody warrants it. For some children separation at an earlier age may be in their best interests.&#8221; The criteria and procedures in separations are further considered at paragraphs 10.67 and 10.68 and clearly envisage earlier separation as being in the child&#8217;s best interests in some circumstances.&#8221;</p>

The policy, she says, should not &#8211; indeed, cannot lawfully &#8211; be changed without this background. She accepts that the Secretary of State&#8217;s new policy <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> be well-founded, but says that, because there is no research and nothing approaching a proper scientific evidence based investigation, we simply cannot tell. There has never been, she says, a clean, first principled analysis and argument as to where a child&#8217;s best interests might lie at various stages of its development. It is impossible, she says, properly to carry out the Article 8 exercise without first determining the principles and assumptions against which the best interests of the child fall to be considered. In this case, she says, Dr Black and Dr Lansdown, who happen to hold the same particular point of view, started from what she calls unresearched and untested propositions. This, she accepts, may be a starting point for discussion, but it never got further than that, and that, she says, is not enough. The research which the Steering Group and Policy Group (and indeed the paper by Dr Black and Dr Lansdown) envisaged as necessary has for whatever reason never been carried out.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept the premise which underlies this argument for, as I have already said, the policy in my judgment remains fundamentally unchanged. But in any event I would not accept the argument that a policy such as is here in issue cannot pass muster under Article 8 unless supported by refereed or peer-reviewed academic research. Such a limitation would simply be a recipe for paralysis. The reality is that, if he is to meet his Convention obligations, the Secretary of State must have a policy. What is he supposed to do if there is no refereed or peer-reviewed academic research? Inactivity is not an option. It may be that he can commission research of the kind called for by Miss Foster, but research meeting her rigorous requirements is unlikely to produce speedy results. Lia-Jade and all the other babies in the MBUs cannot wait whilst the Academy ponders. Nor can the Secretary of State. The common sense of it is that when crafting a policy such as this the Secretary of State must do what he has in fact done: he must summon the assistance of expert and practical opinion and be guided by what those who have relevant expertise or experience have to tell him. The Secretary of State is not to be criticised but is rather to be complimented for what he has done in enlisting the multi-disciplinary assistance first of the working group, then of the Steering Group and latterly of the Policy Group, in heeding their advice, and in deciding to give effect to it. The policy, as it seems to me, is securely founded in the advice the Secretary of State has received from a multi-disciplinary group of highly-qualified individuals. Between them they have brought their very considerable expertise and experience to bear first in crafting, and then in assisting the Secretary of State in implementing, a policy which, even if it is not based on peer-reviewed academic research, quite plainly in my judgment has a more than adequate, acceptable and secure intellectual underpinning. To suggest the contrary is simply to belittle all the impressive work done by those who have been advising and assisting the Secretary of State.   </p>

Indeed, says Miss Foster, nowhere in all the voluminous documentation I have been taken through is it stated in terms that where mothers have long sentences it is <span style="font-style:italic">generally </span>considered best for the child to leave early. That policy, she says, is to be found &#8211; indeed it has emerged &#8211; only in the statements of the various witnesses made during the course of the present proceedings. Thus, she says, it is impossible at present for a prisoner to know that her baby will generally be separated from her at 9 months if she has a long sentence: it is not possible for her to know how the Secretary of State&#8217;s discretion will be exercised.</p>

As the Court itself recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Olsson</span>, it is fundamental to the very concept of the rule of law. But, as the Court also acknowledged, the law needs to keep pace with changing circumstances. How then does one accommodate these two somewhat conflicting requirements? The fundamental principle, surely, is that &#8220;the law&#8221; must be formulated with sufficient precision to give the individual adequate protection against what the Court called &#8220;arbitrary interferences by public authorities&#8221;. </p>

The rule of law demands adequate statement of the &#8216;concept&#8217; but recognises and, within appropriate limits, can accommodate the fact that &#8216;conceptions of the concept&#8217; may change over time. That is why we do not pursue the chimerical search for what Judge Bork would call the &#8220;original understanding&#8221; of the founding fathers but rather recognise that our statute-law is &#8220;always speaking&#8221; in the sense used by Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Ireland </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] AC 147" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] AC 147</ref> at p 158.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Mahala Hodgson pointed out that if the decision of the board was that an 18 month unit was in the best interest of Lia-Jade then Styal would be the only option, at least in the short term. It was explained that Styal only offered closed conditions, which would deny Lia-Jade a normal environment more so than Askham Grange. The potential effect of this being that the environment would not meet the needs of a developing child and also the child would experience institutionalisation &#8230;</p>

Mahala stated that they agreed this at the previous separation board on the 5th June 2003. Mahala went on to explain that research showed that it was best to separate a baby sooner rather than later and that 6 months was deemed to be the most appropriate time to separate. At the previous separation board the date agreed gave sufficient time for the Grandparents and Claire to come to terms with the separation through increasing home visits. Carole Walton stated that this concern had not been raised at the time of the previous board and had not been raised since. Claire said that she had raised this issue and Mahala recognised this to be the case and that it had been addressed recently during two admission boards with Claire.</p>

[Ms B] stated that a home environment is required for a baby to develop fully and explained that [C] and [G] could provide this environment, which Claire was unable to do within a prison environment. Claire asked [Ms B] what would happen if her Mother and Father were not there to offer Lia-Jade a suitable home. Claire wanted to know whether she would be granted a place on an 18 month unit in these circumstances. [Ms B] said that an interim court order would be sought if [C] and [G] could not offer a home for Lia-Jade, because a home environment would remain to be in Lia-Jade&#8217;s best interests. </p>

Mahala said that the decision on whether Claire would get a place on an 18 month unit would be made on the best interests of Lia-Jade and not Claire. She explained the difficulties in separating Lia-Jade&#8217;s interests from Claire&#8217;s but said that this is what had to be done and was the reason for social service presence.</p>

[She] also explained that as Lia-Jade gets older more trauma would be experienced by each period of home leave. [She] stated that children need routines, which a home environment with weekly visits to Claire would provide. This would not undermine Claire&#8217;s position as Mother. [Ms B] went on to explain that further time in prison would not provide a home environment and the use of home leave which would compensate for this would undermine the child&#8217;s need for routine &#8230;</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 November 2003 Claire applied for a transfer to one of the MBUs that caters for babies over 9 months old. That request has not been granted. Mr Wise took me through Claire&#8217;s prison record sheets. They show her to have been, and to be, a well-behaved, polite and cooperative prisoner who with only rare exceptions has given prison staff absolutely no problems. Nonetheless the fact remains that she has not yet qualified for transfer to an open prison. Following the hearing of her appeal on 5 September 2003 a sentence planning report was prepared by Ms Norris on 8 September 2003. Claire was assessed as not yet ready for open conditions, though suitable for semi-open conditions at New Hall. There she remains. I was told that her next sentence plan review and a review of whether she could be reallocated to an open prison were both fixed for 4 February 2004. In fact in the very last day or two Claire has, I am informed, been assessed as suitable for open conditions. Her parole eligibility date, as I have said is 13 March 2005, though it is, of course, as Ms Norris points out by no mean certain that she will be released then. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;&#8230; if Lia Jade is separated from Claire now she would be &#8216;without&#8217; her mother for a far greater period than if she were to separate at eighteen months old eg eight months as opposed to seventeen months. The trauma of separation may be further reduced if contact and day visits were facilitated for the latter part of Claire&#8217;s term in prison. The contact she would have with Claire would be very limited if she separated now and this may induce &#8216;a detachment&#8217; whereby Lia Jade will no longer share a close bond with Claire, but instead transfer this to her caregivers. This would ultimately present its problems upon Claire&#8217;s release when she tries to re-establish the attachments, by Claire feeling inadequate or undermined when she observes the interaction of Lia Jade with grandparents. If Lia Jade separated from Claire at a later stage, there would still remain some separation anxiety but this could be minimised by Lia Jade having a little better understanding and greater communication skills. The level and quality of contact between Claire and Lia Jade is also a significant factor in this.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">There is no evidence to suggest that Lia Jade is at risk of significant harm whilst in the care of her mother.

Yet her view as recorded in the minutes appears to be in stark conflict with her view as set out, scarcely a month later, in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 47</ref> assessment. That prompted the Official Solicitor to write to Ms B. Her response is to be found in her witness statement dated 10 December 2003. The crucial paragraphs read as follows:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;At the meeting in discussing the separation of Lia-Jade from her mother I was led to believe that at the time Miss Frost was not eligible for transfer to another prison, which would enable her to keep Lia-Jade until she was eighteen months old. It was also stated that Miss Frost&#8217;s sentence was considerably longer than eighteen months and she was therefore not eligible for transfer to any open conditions. It therefore appeared in my opinion to have been more suitable for an earlier separation.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">With regards to my initial assessment &#8230; stating otherwise, it materialised that Miss Frost would be eligible for transfer and would therefore be entitled to home leave etc. This would in effect reduce the trauma of separation for Lia-Jade. I have since been informed that Miss Frost and Lia-Jade are eligible for home leave from the 13th December 2003 as this is Miss Frost&#8217;s new fled date. I have been informed that the fled date was March 2004 which had further excluded Miss Frost from transfer. I would also like to point out to the Court that much of what was discussed in the meeting of the 9th September is not minuted. For example, the minute taker did not record the scenarios given to me, ie what would the position be for the Local Authority if the grandparents refused to take Lia-Jade and separation was imminent. My response to this was that permission for accommodation would be sought from Miss Frost and failing that it may be necessary to institute care proceedings.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I am wholly confused by it. I am extremely surprised that she criticised the minutes of the meeting. I took the minutes and they are an accurate account of what occurred. I faxed a copy of the minutes to Ms B as soon as they were written on either 10 or 11 September 2003 and she did not criticise them in any way.

Further, Ms B states that she was led to believe that the Claimant&#8217;s sentence was considerably longer than 18 months; it is. She was sentenced to 6 years, which was reduced on appeal to 5 years. Her earliest parole date is 13 March 2005 and her next possible release date is 12 January 2006.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;For an older child, an MBU constitutes a deprived environment, however much money and effort the prison service expends. Brain growth is most rapid in the first 18 months of life. It is at this time that most neural connections are developed. For optimum development of the child&#8217;s brain, a process which promotes language development and lays the foundation of intelligence, he/she requires rich and varied stimulation of the senses and body. This would involve interaction with a variety of people, male and female, (family, friends, neighbours etc), older children, opportunities to explore the world outside home/prison, including streets, shops, parks as well as the opportunities for play which the prison can afford.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I consider that the original separation plan was well formulated and was in the child&#8217;s best interests. It enabled her to live with caring grandparents, who were suitable in every way to care for a young baby, in a normal environment which provided good stimulation and would enable optimum development, while her mother served her sentence for aggravated burglary and addressed her offending behaviour. Further, had separation occurred as originally agreed it would have enabled [Lia-Jade] to maintain contact with her mother pending the latter&#8217;s release from prison. Separation at this earlier stage would have minimised distress to the child.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The separation plan provided for a gradual increase in staying contact with the grandparents so that [Lia-Jade] could become familiar with her new caretakers before she was separated. Furthermore, if [Claire], on release relapsed in her drug-taking and criminal activity, or was recalled to prison for other reasons during her parole, it provided with familiar carers to ensure continuity of care and minimise attachment disruption which can lead to a risk of psychiatric disorder.</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is very difficult to comment on this case because it is not yet clear what it is. It is said that research states that it is better to separate at 6 months than 18 months, but none is cited. Without a study directly comparing the two, which as far as I am aware has not been done, and would be difficult to conduct ethically, direct evidence is unlikely to be available. Terms are used without definition or in a way that is misleading. For example it is stated that the child would experience &#8216;institutionalisation&#8217;. However most of the research on institutions, for example children&#8217;s homes, refer to conditions in which children experience multiple caretakers. Indeed considerable evidence suggests that the lack of a consistent caregiver with whom the child can form an enduring attachment has long-term consequences (Tizard and Hodges 1989, Rutter 2000). This is quite unlike this case where a stable attachment figure is in the institution with the child. The term &#8216;trauma&#8217; is used, without definition, and without explanation as to the sense in which the separation would be traumatic. Generally trauma refers to extreme experiences such as war, disasters, physical or sexual abuse, and these are clearly not relevant in this case. Furthermore it is clear that &#8216;separation&#8217; is not unitary. There is certainly evidence that repeated separations through hospitalisation can affect a child&#8217;s adjustment, but also that this effect depends on whether the child comes from a home with conflict, and on the quality of the relationship with the parents (Quinton and Rutter 1976).  In other words, not only can one not readily refer to a separation as a trauma, it is also essential to consider the child&#8217;s personal resources in coping with it, and the context of the separation. Reference is also made to the abnormal environment of the prison, without either clarifying the key features of that environment, nor the changing needs of a developing child in relation to the environment.&#8221;</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;a prolonged experience being cared for by a caregiver with whom one has a secure attachment is likely to increase coping strategies. There is considerable evidence from the accounts of [Claire] with Lia-Jade that she is a sensitive mother, and in particular she engages in the balanced, attentive, well-timed interactions with her daughter, that are associated with subsequent secure attachment. Lia-Jade clearly used her mother as a source of protection when meeting me, but also warmed up with smiles and gurgling, suggesting a secure base. Her concern on her mother leaving the room, and her evident pleasure when she came back in, are typical of a secure attachment. Thus all considerations would suggest that prolonging this experience of secure attachment is likely to confer resilience.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Equally there is substantial evidence that children can form attachment relationships with several adults, provided they have enough close contact with them.

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">What then of the concerns? As I have indicated these are not spelled out in detail. However they seem to hinge on the abnormal &#8216;environment&#8217; of the prison. I have no doubt that up to now Lia-Jade has not suffered at all from being with her mother in prison. The mother and baby unit is very child centred, with skilled staff who fully respect the needs of the babies to be cared for by their mothers. The babies are better protected than many out of prison. The considerations are however different in the child&#8217;s second year, mainly because, especially in the second half of the year, peer interactions become more important. The one-year-old child does not interact much with other children, the two year old is quite skilled at peer interactions. There is therefore a need to create a setting for play with peers over the second year, and this is more pressing in the second than the first half. However there is no reason why that should not be done within a prison setting.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Other possible abnormalities of the environment include lack of experience of a wider range of people, streets, houses, shops, and so on. Here the key is Lia-Jade&#8217;s relationship with her grandparents. She already regularly stays with them overnight, and apparently manages this well. It seems then that she has already the capacity to enjoy being in the wider world, and has not as far as I am aware shown signs of difficulty in coping with being outside. Thus if separation at 18 months were to take place, continuation of the same arrangement up to that point would ensure that she experiences the outside world.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Then there is the issue of the effects of separation at 18 months. Three factors will reduce the impact as compared with earlier separation. Firstly, as I have indicated, the fact of the secure attachment to her mother, means it is likely that Lia-Jade will have more personal resources to cope at 18 months, than if separation took place earlier. Secondly there will be an opportunity over the months leading up to the separation for Lia-Jade to &#8216;practice&#8217; being away from her mother, by spending nights with her grandparents, while still benefiting from the support of her mother. Lastly, by l8 months she will be more cognitively mature and language will have started to develop, and these will advance rapidly through the second half of the year. This means that her grandparents will be able to talk to her about her mother, she will be able to take part in simple phone calls, and may be able to use photographs or other momentoes.&#8221;</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;If the child were to go to live with her grandparents at the conclusion of these proceedings, she would become attached to them. My impression is that they are caring and competent, so this would probably be a secure attachment. The relationship with her mother is much less easy to predict. Lia-Jade would have a period of at least 14 months over which her mother would not be available to act as an attachment figure, so it is possible that Lia-Jade will start to relate to her as a friendly adult without attachment significance. The key then is the question of how Lia-Jade would cope with being returned to her mother on her release. If [Claire] went to live with her parents, it is possible that gradually Lia-Jade would come to see her mother again as an attachment figure, but could continue to favour her grandparents. Under those circumstances the grandparents might feel obliged to reduce their contribution, in order to promote the attachment between mother and daughter, a process that could be stressful and uncertain for all of the family. Ms B in her report dated 3rd October has also highlighted the possible difficulties for Lia-Jade and her mother on [Claire&#8217;s] release if she is no longer seen by her daughter as an attachment figure, and I agree completely with those comments.&#8221;</p>

Re-establishing the relationship with her mother would be probably very difficult. Even with separation at 18 months the same risks would be present, and this would make the case even stronger for maintaining mother and daughter together in prison at least until Lia-Jade was two years old, again combined with regular stays with grandparents. If this eventuality arose, the issue of whether she should be in the prison during her third year would need to be reviewed.&#8221;</p>

He acknowledges that re-establishing the relationship with her mother will be difficult, but emphasises that the fact is that the grandparents are figures who will be constantly present and available to the child. In the long run, that is what is important because during the vital development period a child needs a constant and readily available adult figure on whom to rely. Dr Lansdown considers that the logical response to the uncertainty over the date of release would be to arrange a separation as soon as possible to allow the strengthening of the attachment which seems to have begun between the child and her grandparents.&#8221;</p>

In his addendum report he dealt first of all with what he called &#8216;the general case&#8217;:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The general case seems to be that prison is not a normal environment and that there is a risk of impaired brain development over the first 18 months in this setting. In favouring early separation Dr Black comments that an MBU constitutes a deprived environment, and that depriving children of rich and varied experiences is the psychological equivalent of depriving them of food. These varied experiences include, &#8216;interaction with a variety of people, male and female, (family, friends, neighbours etc), older children, opportunities to explore the world outside home/prison, including streets, shops, parks, as well as the opportunities for play which the prison can afford&#8217;. She also states that the optimum development of the brain over the first 18 months requires these experiences, and implies that spending the first 18 months of life in a MBU could affect brain development. In the paper by Dr Black and Dr Lansdown, but not in Dr Black&#8217;s report, there is a reference to an article by Glaser (2000) on this matter. The paper is entitled &#8216;Child abuse and neglect and the brain&#8217; and as the title suggests it is concerned mainly with the impact of abuse and neglect on development. There has been no suggestion in any of the documentation available to me that the timing of separation hinges on issues of abuse or neglect. However this article does also consider the animal evidence that high quality social experiences appear to be important for brain development. My view is that extreme caution should be exercised in extrapolating from animal work to humans. There is substantial species specificity, for example contrasting rodents and non-human primates (Sanchez et al 2001), and the differences between any one animal model and humans are also likely to be substantial. Crucially humans can make use of language and symbolic objects (such as toys and photographs) to modify the effects of separation. Equally, if the animal work is to be taken as an <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">indicator</span> of the likely key factors in early brain development, they point consistently to the quality of mothering experiences. Glaser refers to factors that may be important to the optimal development of synaptic connections (junctions where signals are sent from one nerve to another) in brain maturation. These include &#8216;handling of young infants, responsive gaze, and talking to the infant.&#8217; Quoting the work of Hofer (1994) on rats Glaser comments that sensitive interactions with a caregiver leads to physiological as well as behavioural regulation, &#8216;In the brain of the infant who sees the responsive mother&#8217;s face, brain stem dopaminergic fibres are activated, which trigger high levels of endogenous opiates. These endorphins are biochemically responsible for the pleasurable aspects of social interactions and social affect, and are related to attachment.&#8217; Thus, inasmuch as the animal evidence can be used cautiously, it underlines the importance of early mother infant experiences, and not the wider experiences detailed by Dr Black.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Equally there is no doubting the importance of rich and varied experiences as the child goes into her second year. We do not however know how to weigh up the relative importance of each, nor how often they have to be repeated for them to be beneficial. There are not, as far as I am aware, strong reasons to think that they all need to be available all of the time in the young child&#8217;s life, nor that if they are not, the child will be at increased risk for impaired brain development.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The various reports on mothers and babies in prison are extremely valuable, and clearly reflect substantial care and thoughtfulness by the authors. The implications of the findings can be read in more than one way, however my overall impression was that they do not support the degree of certainty regarding available research on separation reported from meetings regarding the planned separation of Lia-Jade from her mother. I would highlight four points. Firstly there is almost no research directly addressing the issues of early versus late separation. The most relevant study appears to be that of Catan who is quoted as finding that ill effects either of staying in prison or being separated could not be clearly identified. The reports consistently underscore the need for research in the area. The paucity of good research directly addressing the issues of separation is evident in Annex C of &#8216;The Report of Principles, Policies and Procedures on Mothers and Babies/Children in Prison&#8217;. None of the studies summarised was published in a peer review journal, and only the opinions of the authors are given. Secondly the reports repeatedly emphasise the need to make decisions based on the individual needs of the child, and not using a fixed policy. Thirdly there is substantial international variability in separation practices, with some countries separating all babies in the first year of life and others maintaining them with their mothers in prison, well after their second birthday. Strikingly there does not appear to be any research comparing the progress of children brought up in countries with contrasting policies. Fourth there is considerable favourable comment by the authors regarding the possibility of flexible arrangements. For example Black and Lansdown discuss the possibility of having a child minder by day, and returning to the prison by night, allowing mother-child contact, &#8216;at the emotionally vital times of getting up and going to bed, and (this) would also give the child an opportunity to experience a normal life during most of the waking hours&#8217;. They also comment, &#8216;Perhaps one should look to building up a package of care opportunities, varying with the needs of the child and the availability of help.&#8217; In my view a care plan that takes account of these considerations would be most appropriate.&#8221;</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;There were five stays with grandparents, totalling 18 days, illustrating the considerable experience Lia-Jade is already having of the outside world. I will consider the objections to this as they appear in the various documents. Firstly it is reported by Ms Walton that Lia-Jade looks &#8216;really well&#8217; and is &#8216;very active&#8217; on return from grandparents. This is viewed as evidence of the potential advantage of early separation to be with grandparents. This seems to me to be a rather narrow interpretation. The key attachment concept is that of the &#8216;secure base&#8217;. The securely attached infant is generally confident in exploring and engaging with the world. As I have indicated in my report, my assessment and the comments of numerous professionals working with [Claire], suggest there is a secure attachment between Lia-Jade and her mother. Therefore the most likely explanation of the effect of periods with grandparents is that the secure attachment provides the basis of Lia-Jade&#8217;s ability to deal with the separation from her mother and to benefit from an experience of the outside world; the warmth and familiarity of the grandparents further supports that process; and Lia-Jade shows pleasure on being reunited with her mother. Secondly Dr Black suggests that earlier separation would be feasible because Lia-Jade could be with caring grandparents, and &#8216;had separation occurred as originally agreed it would have enabled the second Defendant to maintain contact with her mother pending the latter&#8217;s release from prison&#8217;. There is no doubt that Lia-Jade would be well cared for by her grandparents, however this does not address the likely consequence of early separation for the attachment to her mother. As I outlined in my report contact visits do not maintain the link in terms of the mother remaining a caretaker, or as Black and Lansdown put it, of being available &#8216;at the emotionally vital times of getting up and going to bed&#8217;. Separation at the conclusion of the proceedings, would lead to at least 14 months without this kind of contact between mother and daughter, leaving each with a major task of re-establishing the relationship on the mother&#8217;s release. Thirdly there are repeated references to minimising the trauma of separation. I have already referred in my report for the need for care in using the term &#8216;trauma&#8217;, particularly where there is considerable scope to modify the experience. It is already apparent that Lia-Jade is well able to deal with separations from her mother of up to 5 days and there would be opportunities for more prolonged periods in the lead up to a separation at 18 months or later. As I indicated in my report, the consolidation of her relationship with her mother, and her increasing cognitive and linguistic abilities will support this process. Fourth Dr Black suggests that early separation would ensure that the grandparents become attachment figures who could provide longer term care if [Claire] were to return to drugs and crime. Maintenance of regular stays with grandparents up to the separation, as well as a period with grandparents after the separation, would also provide this back up facility. Finally in my opinion the reports do not adequately deal with the issue of maximising the long-term development of Lia-Jade. The key here is the period after [Claire&#8217;s] release from prison. Clearly there are risks, including the possibility that she will re-establish relationships that put her at risk for further drug taking, and I agree completely that this eventuality should be anticipated. Equally consideration needs to be given to maximally supporting the attachment relationship between mother and daughter which clearly has the potential to promote Lia-Jade&#8217;s long-term welfare. As I indicated in my report, in my opinion this is best served by providing a prolonged opportunity for the relationship to develop prior to any separation.&#8221;</p>

Despite the postponement of separation which has occurred as a result of these proceedings, she is of the opinion that separation sooner rather than later remains in the child&#8217;s best interests. There is evidence that the child is bonding with her grandparents. In this regard, Dr Black noted that Professor Hill had not seen the child with her grandparents and has thus not been in a position to assess the strength of the child&#8217;s attachment to them. He did, however, comment that his impression from talking to Mrs Frost was that &#8220;the grandparents are also child-centred and are sensitive alternative parent figures for&#8221; the [Lia-Jade].

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Dr Black commented that such an attachment is a benefit in this case, as is the child&#8217;s attachment to her mother. It shows that the child has the ability to form attachments and will be able to develop the attachment that already exists between her and her grandparents, should separation occur. Assuming that separation at some stage is overwhelmingly likely (as the Prison Service contends), Dr Black considers that it will be beneficial for the child if she is afforded the opportunity now to establish a strong and secure attachment with her grandparents. If she remains with her mother until she is 2 years and 2 months (as Professor Hill appears to suggest) she would not have had the same opportunity to establish a strong and secure attachment to her grandparents. Dr Black accepts that the question of reattachment with her mother is a difficult one but states that the issue will not be helped by later separation. Contrary to Professor Hill&#8217;s view, she states that there will be no significant difference in reattachment if the child were separated at 12 or 18 months or later. Moreover, given that there is already a secure attachment with the mother, and if a secure attachment is formed with the grandparents, Dr Black considers that the prospects for re-attachment between mother and daughter upon the former&#8217;s eventual release are very good.&#8221;</p>

It would be traumatic for the child to switch constantly between two carers and to keep taking her from her mother and handing her to her grandparents <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and vice versa</span>. Such a solution, is in Dr Blacks view, justifiable, indeed essential, in the run up to a separation but cannot be an acceptable long-term solution. The child will not be able to appreciate that she is not losing her carer (be it her mother or grandparents) forever. Professor Hill&#8217;s solution would be to subject the child to continued and repeated trauma and cannot be the right outcome for the child, in Dr Black&#8217;s opinion. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In Dr Black&#8217;s view there are advantages to an earlier separation. The child will be able to live in a normal environment, as has been explored elsewhere. More critically, however, it will permit separation before her attachment to her mother becomes too intense and will provide the opportunity for the child to develop the secure attachment with her grandparents which is in her best interests, given the likelihood that they will be her carers for at least some period during [Claire&#8217;s] prison sentence. As Dr Black has pointed out in her own statement, an MBU is not a normal environment and, deprived of competitors for her mother&#8217;s attention, a child&#8217;s attachment to her mother will become stronger than usual. If separation is to occur, it is important that it does so at an early stage when the child is still able to bond with another carer. The earlier the separation, the more likely this is to be possible. In this case, there is already a secure attachment between mother and child although the bond between them has probably already been loosened by the regular visits of her grandparents, in Dr Black&#8217;s view. For the reasons stated above, however, Dr Black is firmly opposed to the idea of such a &#8220;shared case&#8221; arrangement as a long term solution.&#8221;</p>

Then the case for separation was clear. Having considered the case again, however, in addition to the reports of Professor Hill and the Official Solicitor, she is of the view that separation in the near future is preferable to later separation at 18 months or beyond.</p>

Dr Black noted the problems many prisoners experience on release. It is often difficult for released prisoners to adjust from the controlled and organised prison environment to the more chaotic world outside. Given that [Claire] had a chaotic lifestyle before her imprisonment, this experience may be even more traumatic for her.&#8221;</p>

She has worked in prisons since 1976 and has spent 14 years working with women prisoners in a variety of prisons. Her operational experience of MBUs goes back to 1989. She has had operational and policy responsibility since January 2002 for all mothers and their children held in MBUs, a role which has involved intensive casework relating to contentious issues on MBUs. She has been closely involved with the work of both the Steering Group and the Policy Group and has for some time been responsible for and been working on the preparation of the new PSO. Quite plainly, in my judgment, her opinions are entitled to great respect. In her witness statement she says:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;A prison environment is not an ideal place to bring up any child. The accommodation at Styal &#8230; consists of 18 Victorian houses set in gardens within the perimeter fence of the prison. Although women without children cannot enter the MBU or the adjacent play area, it is possible for prisoners to have free association with one another within the gardens and the medical centre. The effect of this is that babies in the MBU may, when in the care of their mothers, come into contact with other prisoners in the prison. One of the concerns of staff is that mothers, despite repeated warnings to them, occasionally hand their babies to other prisoners whose offences are unknown to them. This is a concern at all MBUs. Contact with other prisoners, who may have committed a wide range of offending behaviour, can create additional risks. Such contact can have a more pronounced effect on an older child.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The prison population within an MBU is constantly changing as mothers arrive to start their sentences or to commence care for their child. In addition, other mothers may leave because their child has left the MBU or their sentence has come to an end. The disruption caused by this constant change is not an ideal environment for children who would benefit from stable surroundings.</p>

This prevents them from becoming familiar with every day objects they might be faced with in the community, for example, cars, animals, shopping areas. This reduces the amount of stimulation and learning experiences available to these children.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It has been the practical experience on MBUs that children as they get older start to become much more aware of events particularly to a prison environment. There have been occasions, for example, of babies referring to officers as &#8220;Miss&#8221; in the same way as prisoners and getting upset when they saw men, especially with a beard, as they have little experience of men. It is most undesirable that they absorb and react to matters which are specific to a prison environment.&#8221;</p>

I disagree. In my judgment, no fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that Mr Milner was biased. He was and is an independent person of high professional standing. His independence is not compromised by the fact that he was, and remains, a member of the Policy Group.</p>

The views of the child&#8217;s representative are important, and it may usually be unwise to depart from them, but they cannot be determinative. If views differ, it may well be appropriate for the decision to reflect that of the majority, though it must of course be borne in mind that the ultimate decision is that of the Secretary of State and that, in the final analysis, the outcome of a meeting such as that which was held on 9 September 2003 can only inform, not determine, his decision. In any event the point does not really arise here for, as I have already pointed out, everyone at the meeting, with the sole exception of Claire and her parents, was of the same view.</p>

It is said that this bald statement was lacking in particularity, detail and attribution, and that there was in fact no such research, or at least no research supporting Ms Hodgson&#8217;s assertion. So, it is said, the crucial information given to Claire &#8211; and to Ms B &#8211; was inadequate and erroneous. The entire discussion proceeded, and the ultimate decision was taken, so it is said, on the erroneous premise that there was research to back up Ms Hodgson&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;it was best to separate a baby sooner rather than later&#8221; when in fact, so it is said, there was not.

That might have been more accurate, but this minor misdescription (for that in my judgment is all that it was) cannot possibly invalidate either the discussion or the decision. There is nothing, in my judgment, to show that any proper questions that Claire raised were not answered appropriately. No doubt, if she had wanted further information about the so-called research she could have asked; and there is nothing whatever to show that, if she had, she would have received anything other than entirely appropriate answers. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to Claire the complaint relates to her involvement, or rather, as Mr Wise would have it, her inadequate involvement, in the meeting on 9 September 2003. The manner of the decision-making, it is said, failed to accord Claire adequate support and representation; she had no opportunity to participate on a fully informed basis and there was no-one there to represent her. According to Miss Foster, Claire should at all times have had available to her an informed individual who was &#8220;on her side&#8221; and could tell her story, for her interests are separate from those of her child and her situation is one of some vulnerability as a prisoner. Miss Foster accepted that Claire&#8217;s personal officer, PO Rhodes, would have sufficed for this purpose: there is, she accepts, no need for a legally qualified or social work qualified person. But she submits that it is &#8220;wholly unacceptable&#8221; that Ms Rhodes was not present. Moreover, says Miss Foster, Claire should have been given adequate (say 7 days) warning of an impending decision meeting, the intended participants and the agenda, purpose and structure of the meeting and should have been given an opportunity to seek to be represented by a friend or legally qualified or other independent person if so desired. Related to this is the complaint that there was no opportunity to make representations to the ultimate decision-maker, Ms Banks. (I note in passing that neither of these complaints was made in the pleadings; as Ms Richards says, they were raised with little warning at a comparatively late stage.)</p>

Since Ms B&#8217;s role was to represent Lia-Jade&#8217;s interests this demonstrates, says Miss Foster, a fundamental flaw in the fairness of the decision-making process.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Responding to Ms Hodgson&#8217;s evidence, Miss Foster says that all that can be deduced from the totality of the material before the court is that Ms B was under a real confusion at the time when she was purportedly acting for Lia-Jade. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 47</ref> assessment she signed only a month later cannot simply be brushed aside. Miss Foster accepts that, on one view, the logic of Ms B&#8217;s explanation is not easy to follow, but this, she says, cannot help the Secretary of State; rather it compounds his difficulties. What is clear at the end of the day, she says, is that the most important interests at the meeting &#8211; the interests of the child &#8211; were not adequately represented and that in consequence Lia-Jade&#8217;s Article 8 rights were infringed. It cannot be said in any meaningful way that Ms B represented the interests of the baby effectively or properly.</p>

As I have already observed, no operational arguments were ever deployed by the prison. This is not a case where reasons of good order and discipline within the prison came into play. The prison very properly recognised that Lia-Jade needed an independent voice to represent her interests and, entirely appropriately, turned to Wakefield for that purpose. Ms B was the person charged with that vital function. The importance of her role, and the significance of the views she expressed during the course of the meeting on 9 September 2003, were plainly recognised by the prison and would have been apparent to all those present at the meeting. After all, as I have pointed out, the minutes show that on no fewer than three occasions it was stated that the purpose of the meeting was to decide what was in Lia-Jade&#8217;s best interests and that Ms B was present in order to represent Lia-Jade and to ensure that a decision was made in her best interests. Sadly, and fatally, that representation proved to be wholly inadequate.</p>

	      <p class="Heading2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the first place, Ms B seems to have been woefully unprepared for the task in hand. On her own admission she first became involved with Lia-Jade on the very day of the meeting. There is nothing to suggest that she had seen any relevant papers prior to arriving at New Hall. Her knowledge of the case &#8211; her knowledge of Lia-Jade &#8211; was confined to what she was able to glean immediately before and during the course of the meeting. I do not accept Mr Wise&#8217;s submission that there should necessarily have been a framework assessment. Indeed the absence of any formal or written assessment by Ms B would not, of itself, have been fatal, highly desirable though it no doubt is that some kind of written assessment should be prepared in such cases before crucial decisions are taken. (The point is elementary: the very discipline of having to reduce one&#8217;s thinking, one&#8217;s analysis, one&#8217;s opinion, and the reasons for one&#8217;s opinion, to paper immeasurably improves the quality of what emerges.) But it was nonetheless incumbent on Ms B to familiarise herself with the detail of the case and to study the relevant papers <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>she arrived at the meeting. For whatever reason that never happened. (The fault appears not to have lain with Ms B, for she was not allocated to the case until the day before the meeting. She should not be made to carry the blame for what appear to be the systemic or managerial failings of others, and that is why I have not named her in this judgment.) In consequence Ms B was severely crippled, &#8211; in truth almost wholly disabled &#8211; in performing her appointed task.</p>

I accept that there is validity in some of the points that were made by Ms Hodgson in response to Ms B&#8217;s evidence. But making every allowance for what Ms Hodgson says it remains the fact, in my judgment, that the views attributed to Ms B in the minutes cannot safely be relied on, given her own evidence and, not least, the fact that within a month she had committed herself in writing, though without any indication that she was changing her views, to what was in truth a fundamentally different opinion.   </p>

As Ms Hodgson correctly remarked, the effect of my decision in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Howard League for Penal Reform) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2002/2497" uk:canonical="[2002] EWHC 2497 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWHC 2497 (Admin)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 484" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 484</ref>, is that the local authority within whose area a prison is located has a responsibility for all the children within the walls of the prison. These children fall into two categories: those children who are themselves serving sentences, usually in Young Offender Institutions (&#8220;YOIs&#8221;), the subject of my judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">Howard League </span>case; and those children, like Lia-Jade in the present case, who are in prison MBUs because their mothers are serving sentences. The local authority with primary responsibility for such children is the authority local to the prison: in the present case Wakefield. That is not to say, however, that where the prisoner&#8217;s home local authority has something useful to contribute &#8211; as Doncaster did here &#8211; it should not become, and be invited by the prison to become, involved. It should. But primary responsibility rests with the authority local to the prison. </p>

I am left with an uncomfortable impression that the system is not working as well as it might and that, in consequence, there are children both in YOIs and perhaps also in MBUs who are not receiving the support from the local authority to which it might be thought they are entitled. I am aware that active steps are being taken to remedy the institutional and organisational difficulties that were highlighted by the <span style="font-style:italic">Howard League </span>case. That endeavour is to be applauded. In this, as in so many other areas involving children, the key to their welfare is to be found in effective inter-agency and cross-disciplinary co-operation and co-ordination. The Prison Service and the relevant local authorities must &#8216;work together&#8217; to secure the welfare of the children for whom the Secretary of State is responsible &#8211; whether they are in YOIs or in MBUs. </p>

In saying this I do not want to be critical of those local authorities, many of whom are in any event short of resources, who, because they have a YOI or MBU within their area, are faced with the no doubt unwelcome additional burden of meeting what they might be forgiven for thinking is really a national and not a local problem. After all, how many of the boys in Feltham YOI actually come from Hounslow? How many of the mothers in the MBU at New Hall actually come from Wakefield? Nor do I want to be critical of local authorities who may not have had cause to appreciate until recently the full extent of their responsibilities in relation to YOIs and MBUs. But the position is now clear. Appreciating the undue burden that falls on the comparatively small number of local authorities involved &#8211; there are, after all, only 18 YOIs and four MBUs &#8211; I do nonetheless hope that in future all the good work being done by the Prison Service will be reciprocated by the local authorities. </p>

There was, he says, insufficiently compelling evidence to show that the proposed separation was in Lia-Jade&#8217;s best interests and, whatever the position may have been in September 2003, it would not, he says, be in her best interests to separate her now, given Professor Hill&#8217;s evidence. The evidence relied upon to support the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision was, he says, at best equivocal. Moreover, he submits, this was <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>a case where separation was inevitable. On the contrary, he says, there was &#8220;a very real prospect&#8221; that Claire would fall into that exceptional category of prisoners referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P&amp;Q </span>who can keep their babies beyond the normal 18 month time limit.

The argument might suffice to meet classic public law tests but it is not defensible in Article 8 terms because it is not proportionate. Moreover, she says, Dr Black&#8217;s analysis of the case is partly founded on the risk that Claire may re-offend after she is released and thus again find herself separated from Lia-Jade, a suggestion, according to Miss Foster, that fails to take account of the facts &#8211; seemingly ignored by Dr Black &#8211; that Claire is a model prisoner who has given up drugs, who is seen not merely by her parents but also by the judges in the Court of Appeal as being a different person than had appeared at trial, in short who gives every impression of having turned her life around.</p>

Of neither could it be said that the balance had been struck unfairly. In such circumstances, the mere fact that an alternative but favourable decision could reasonably have been reached will not lead to the conclusion that the decision maker has acted in breach of the claimant's human rights. Such a breach will only occur where the decision is outwith the range of reasonable responses to the question as to where a fair balance lies between the conflicting interests. Once it is accepted that the balance could be struck fairly either way, the Secretary of State cannot be regarded as having infringed the claimant's Article 8 rights by concluding that he should be removed.&#8221;</p>

That was, it appears, a view clearly expressed not merely by Ms B (for what that was worth) but also by Ms Hodgson and Ms Vollans. Moreover, as we have seen, it was also the view, albeit subsequently expressed, of Dr Black. It had also been the view expressed on earlier occasions by both Claire and her parents.

Applications brought under CPR Part 54 require permission and are subject to a shorter time limit than claims under CPR Part 8. In practice there is less scope for oral evidence and cross-examination in applications under CPR Part 54 than in claims under CPR Part 8.

I remind all concerned that the standard mandated by the Court is &#8220;exceptional diligence&#8221;: see <span style="font-style:italic">Johansen v Norway </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1996) 23 EHRR 33" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">(1996) 23 EHRR 33</ref> at para [88] and <span style="font-style:italic">Hoppe v Germany </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 FLR 384" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 FLR 384</ref> at para [54].</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One advantage of procedure under CPR Part 54 is that the claim is required to be properly particularised, identifying the decision or action under challenge, the grounds upon which the challenge is made and the relief sought, and that every defendant has to file an Acknowledgement of Service and, more important, detailed grounds for contesting the claim, before the papers are ever considered by a judge. This procedure means that the issues in the case are clearly identified well before any substantive hearing. If they are not, the judge who has to consider whether or not to grant permission to apply can give appropriate directions. Procedure under CPR Part 8 is less regulated and this can mean &#8211; as it did in the present case &#8211; that the matter comes to a substantive hearing with the issues being identified for the first time in the parties&#8217; skeleton arguments or even later. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not suggesting that there should necessarily be elaborate pleadings &#8211; the days of Parke B are long behind us &#8211; but as an absolute minimum, and whether or not it formally applies to such proceedings, there should surely be at the very least the documents referred to in paragraph 3.1 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Direction (Family Proceedings: Court Bundles) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 FLR 536" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 FLR 536</ref>, that is: a summary of the background to the hearing; a statement of the issue or issues to be determined; a summary of the order or directions sought by each party; a chronology; and skeleton arguments (with copies of all authorities relied upon). Moreover, if the case is proceeding in the Family Division under CPR Part 8 it may well be sensible to list it for directions at a very early stage, either before the trial judge or, if that is not possible, before a judge who is both a judge of the Family Division and a nominated judge of the Administrative Court.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Most unfortunately the trial bundles in the present case had been arranged in such a way as made systematic and sensible pre-reading of some of the most important materials almost impossible. Moreover, the bundles contained much duplication and a substantial mass of material that was simply not referred to at all. Responsibility for this unfortunate state of affairs must be shared between the Treasury Solicitor, whose selection and arrangement of the exhibits to the various witness statements would have benefited from more thought and planning, and the claimant&#8217;s solicitor, who simply copied the Treasury Solicitor&#8217;s witness statements and exhibits as they stood and inserted them in the bundle with an index so rudimentary and deficient in information as to be useless. The result was that reading the bundle from cover to cover meant that one was constantly hopping from one thing to another, and then back to the first, whilst the absence of a usable index made it impossible to plan one&#8217;s reading in any more coherent fashion. More thought needs to go into the preparation of bundles in cases such as this. And, unless the material is such, and is so arranged, that one can sensibly just read the bundle from cover to cover &#8211; and that is rarely the case &#8211; it is essential that a detailed index is provided. An index which merely describes a document as &#8220;exhibit ABC1&#8221; &#8211; and the index I was initially supplied with here did not give even that information &#8211; is worse than useless. The index must contain proper descriptions of the documents. Again, experience of the application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Direction </span>in the Family Division suggests that, whether or not it formally applies to such proceedings, the trial bundle in a case such as this should be prepared in accordance with paragraph 2.1 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Direction</span>, that is, it should contain copies of all relevant documents in chronological order, paginated and indexed and divided into separate sections as follows: (a) applications and orders; (b) statements and affidavits; (c) experts&#8217; reports and other reports; and (d) other documents, divided into further sections as may be appropriate. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final point relates to the use of expert evidence in cases such as this. Miss Foster points out that evidence will frequently and properly be admitted in proportionality cases because assertions may well be made (and succeed) to the effect that the balancing exercise or the indeed the analysis carried out by the decision maker was inadequate. She submits that if, as here, it is the case that only one stream of psychiatric thought (and that one stream unsupported by research or other intellectual underpinning) is preferred, evidence to show the tenuous nature of this opinion and to show the alternative view is admissible. It is, she says, inevitable in proportionality cases that evidence will be admissible on the subject matter which is the core of the decision.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Miss Foster that expert evidence of the kind she refers to is admissible and that it may on occasions appropriately be adduced in cases such as this. But I confess to some misgivings about the way in which expert evidence is now being almost routinely utilised in certain types of public law cases, particularly community care cases and cases involving either children or mentally handicapped adults. In the course of little more than a fortnight during December 2003 whilst sitting in the Administrative Court I heard three such cases. In the first, where the challenge was to a decision by the Secretary of State to return a prisoner from a mental hospital to prison, the claimant adduced expert psychiatric evidence contradicting the expert evidence on which the Secretary of State had based his decision: <span style="font-style:italic">R (IR) v Shetty </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2003/3022" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 3022 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 3022 (Admin)</ref>. In the second, where the challenge was to a local authority&#8217;s community care assessment, the claimant adduced both expert psychiatric and expert social work evidence, again to contradict the expert evidence on which the local authority had based its decision: <span style="font-style:italic">R (HP and KP) v London Borough of Islington </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2004/7" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 7 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 7 (Admin)</ref>. This is the third such case. All three cases share certain features in common: (i) In each case the purpose in adducing the evidence was really to try and persuade the court that the primary decision-maker was wrong on the merits, whereas in each case the court&#8217;s function was in truth confined to a <span style="font-style:italic">Daly </span>type review; (ii) In each case the effect of introducing the evidence was to shift the focus of the challenge from the initial decision which in theory was the subject-matter of the litigation to the subsequent actual or imputed decision not to depart from the initial decision; and (iii) In each case the expert evidence in fact had no effect on the eventual outcome of the case.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Restraint is needed, and, if I may be permitted to say so, appropriately robust judicial case management. Otherwise the evidence all too easily proliferates. In the present case the trial bundle ran to three lever-arch files. Thought needs to be given to the nature of the proceedings. And, if the proceedings involve a <span style="font-style:italic">Daly </span>type review rather than a full best-interests investigation, thought needs to be given to what precise point the evidence being adduced really goes to. Too often I am left with the uncomfortable feeling that evidence is being adduced, and the case is being prepared, as if it were a best interests case when in truth it is not. A most striking example of the phenomenon, and a case where the filing of expert evidence came close to escaping all control, is <span style="font-style:italic">R (A, B, X and Y) v East Sussex CC (No 2)</span>: see my comments at paras [14], [63] and [156]. That was a case in which, as I observed at para [158], &#8220;singularly little thought had been given to identifying precisely what the task was upon which I was supposed to be engaged.&#8221; The result, if I may adapt a military metaphor, was &#8220;litigation creep&#8221;, the forensic equivalent of the &#8220;mission creep&#8221; that is the bane of military planners. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The purpose of judicial review is to challenge the decision of a public authority. Unless the evidence which is permitted to be adduced in nominal pursuit of that wholly legitimate objective is appropriately regulated, judicial review can too easily become a mechanism whereby a claimant who has not even established his right to a mandatory order (order of mandamus) can in effect compel the original decision-maker to reconsider the matter afresh in the light of all the new evidence adduced in court. And that in turn can lead all too easily to a situation where the proceedings are, in effect if not in intention, being used inappropriately as a means of monitoring and regulating the performance by a public authority of its public duties and responsibilities. I refer in this context and respectfully agree with what Newman J said in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Hackney ex p S </span>(unreported 13 October 2000) at paras [8] and [11] and again in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Mayor and Burgesses of the London Borough of Hackney ex p S (No 2) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2001/228" uk:canonical="[2001] EWHC 228 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] EWHC Admin 228</ref> at para [4].</p>
