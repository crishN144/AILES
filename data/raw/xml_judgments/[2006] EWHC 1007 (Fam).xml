	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 6 April 2006, on the application of a Teaching Hospital NHS Trust (The Trust), I made a declaration to enable the medical staff of the Trust to remove from the abdomen of a baby in their care a tube necessary to maintain her nutrition, and to move to a regime of palliative care in order to allow her to die peacefully over a short period of time.  I indicated that I would give my reasons later.  They are now set out below.  Since making my declaration K has in fact died.  However, I state my reasons as at the time of the application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">K was born on 23 September 2005 and is now some five and a half months old.  She has remained in hospital and subject to treatment by the Trust since her birth.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">K was born prematurely with an inherited condition called congenital myotonica dystrophy (CMD), a neuromuscular disorder causing chronic muscle weakness and associated with learning difficulties.  The condition varies greatly in severity.  The muscle cells of the person affected have difficulty in relaxing.  This leads to progressive muscle wasting and weakness particularly in the lower legs, hands, neck, and face.  Upon gripping, the muscle contractions take longer than normal to relax.  K is a severe case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of her birth, K&#8217;s parents were not in a position to look after her and she was immediately made the subject of an interim care order, since when the local authority has had parental responsibility for her which they have exercised in close consultation with her parents.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a long-standing problem of CMD in K&#8217;s family.  Her mother has CMD of moderate severity.  However, in the early weeks and months of her life K has experienced major difficulties in swallowing nutrition and breathing.  She had very poor breathing effort from birth and had immediately to be put on to a mechanical ventilator.  She was transferred from the hospital where she was born to the Trust&#8217;s Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit for further management.  After one week she was able to breathe for herself in air, but on day nineteen of her life, she had an apnoea (a hiatus in her breathing) which required her to go back on to mechanical ventilation for four days and then to be extubated onto CPAP (oxygen delivered under pressure through small tubes into the nostrils).  At one month of age she had a central line inserted in order to continue artificial intravenous feeding. This is known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN).  Unfortunately, K developed a serious Staphylococcus Aureus infection soon after insertion of the line, which led to septicaemia and required her to go back on to mechanical ventilation for a further forty-eight hours.  [This is not indicative of improper care.  It is a risk inherent in long term insertion of such a line].  She then had almost a month occasionally breathing for herself but mainly on CPAP.  However, on day sixty, she collapsed with septicaemia and had to return to mechanical ventilation.  It was her fourth episode of such ventilation in the eleven weeks since her birth.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By this time K&#8217;s care was presenting very substantial problems.  In particular, she had severe feeding difficulties.  She has a very severe problem with gut motility, leaving her unable to tolerate milk feeds.  A variety of methods of feeding her artificially were tried, including naso-gastric feeding (tube passed into the stomach) naso-jejunal feeding (a tube passed into the small bowel just beyond the stomach.) but she was unable to tolerate these and they led to recurrent vomiting.  She therefore became dependent on artificial nutrition, given intravenously via the central venous line previously referred to (a catheter passed into a large vein near the heart).  It was the complication and risks of blockage inherent in prolonged use of such a line which led to the bouts of infection and episodes of septicaemia to which I have already referred.  Her septicaemia has been kept at bay to date by antibiotics.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">K suffered, and has continued to suffer, from progressive weakening of her muscles.  She developed a characteristic facial appearance with a drooping mouth and falsity of muscle movement and her muscular movements have reduced.  Following her second episode of septicaemia she was afflicted by a left-sided focal seizure involving rhythmical twitching of her left arm and left leg.  Her septicaemia caused thrombocytopenia (low platelets) which in turn led to a large right-sided intra-ventricular haemorrhage (bleeding into the fluid cavity on the right side of her brain).  Despite two platelet transfusions, her platelets remained critically low so that she was at imminent risk of further life-threatening haemorrhage.</p>

	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By mid-December 2005, almost 3 months after her birth, K was markedly developmentally delayed with little interaction with her surroundings.  She had no social smile and remained in a floppy and worsening state.  She continued dependent on artificial nutrition and became jaundiced due to lack of milk feeding and long-term artificial intravenous nutrition.  She was critically ill on a mechanical ventilator and on a broad spectrum of antibiotics to treat her septicaemia, infection.  There appeared to be little prospect of her recovering from her medical problems and, assuming she survived the episode of  septicaemia she would require a prolonged period of ventilation before being able to breathe for herself again.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical staff became of the opinion that she had very small prospect of  recovering from her medical problems.  She had a very adverse long-term neuro-developmental prognosis with complete lack of ability to tolerate milk feeds.  They concluded that it would not be in K&#8217;s interests to continue with further artificial life support should she suffer a further episode of severe infection or cardio-respiratory collapse in the near future.  To further resuscitate her, if such event occurred, would only expose her to further cycles of potentially distressing intensive care treatment of the kind already undergone without altering the underlying prognosis of her developing muscle weakness.  Her parents expressed the view to the medical staff that they felt that K was suffering and should be allowed to die peacefully.  They did not wish the hospital to continue with further intensive care treatment which they felt would be pointless and would not change the long-term outcome.  However, in view of the interim care order in place, whereby parental responsibility resided in the local authority, and the fact that the parents could thus not themselves act alone in consenting to withdrawal of treatment, the Trust considered it necessary and proper to seek the court&#8217;s determination as the appropriateness of the withdrawal and withholding life sustaining treatment in the event of further crisis.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In those circumstances the hospital trust sought the permission of the court to allow them not to provide artificial mechanical ventilation or cardio-pulmonary resuscitation in the event of K having a further episode of collapse due to her underlying CMD.  The view was taken that, if she survived her current episode of septicaemia, the Trust would undertake to continue normal care including providing intravenous nutrition while attempting to re-establish milk feeds.  However, in the event of further deterioration from her septicaemia, or subsequent deterioration following recovery from septicaemia if she were to suffer a cardiac or respiratory arrest, the Trust would not instigate active resuscitation but allow her to die peacefully.</p>

She is not able to suck or swallow and has shown no sign of improvement in this respect.  Milk simply pools in her mouth and there is no active swallowing, yet no coughing.  It is not safe for her to be given oral milk feeds as she does not have the strength or co-ordination to deal with milk and swallowing.  Oral feeding would be likely to lead to aspiration of milk into the lungs which would be lethal.  She cannot receive milk or medication into the stomach which does not absorb them.  She will vomit if milk is introduced into her stomach through a tube and frequently vomits in any event from her gastric secretions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">K&#8217;s nutrition formerly involved milk feeding through a transpyloric tube which passes through the stomach and is advanced into the jejunum (small intestine).  K needs milk at 46 mls/hr.  Before her infection in December it was possible to achieve 17 mls/hr but since that time a maximum rate of 7 mls/hr has been achieved.  However, given in this way, the milk comes back into the stomach and is vomited, often with bile.  In recent weeks the tube tended to become dislodged by K in her movements and had to be replaced, which was distressing for her and in early February, a decision was taken to cease such transpyloric feeding.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as her condition and prognosis are concerned, the Consultant Neuro-developmental Paediatrician instructed by the solicitors for K makes clear that he has never seen a child with CMD of K&#8217;s severity who has survived.  She is progressively falling below the expected development of a child of her chronological age and her lack of progress indicated a very poor outlook.  He anticipates that if (as is highly unlikely) K survives, she will continue to show very poor developmental progress and will in future remain totally dependent for all her needs.  She has a visual problem which is likely to be cortical visual inattention, meaning that her eyes work but her brain has difficulty in interpreting the message from her eyes.  The Consultant&#8217;s opinion is that she is in the worst category of CMD, the question being not whether she will survive but how soon it is likely she will die.  This is in turn likely to depend on the development of illness such as chest infection or further infection in the central venous line, or the cardiac complications of CMD</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as K&#8217;s future nutritional care is concerned, the problems with her intestinal function mean that her bowel is not moving fluid in the correct direction with the result that she suffers frequent vomiting.  While it remains possible that this intestinal failure is due to a second unrelated condition, it is likely that it is simply the result, and a reflection of the severity, of her CMD.  If anything there has been a gradual deterioration of milk tolerance and it is now almost inconceivable that K&#8217;s gut function will improve.  This will leave her dependent on TPN, receiving all her energy protein and other nutritional needs as a sterile solution through an intravenous catheter flowing into one of the large veins in the chest.  This means she will continue to require high dependency care, her life support being the central line, prone to infection, blockage, or fracture.  The treatment in any event causes the liver to become adversely affected and K&#8217;s laboratory results are showing persistently abnormal liver function tests and recent deterioration.  This is likely to become worse, causing liver failure at around one year of age.  The only solution in principle for their eventuality is a liver and small bowel transplantation.  That would be a major operation which no transplant team would consider in K&#8217;s case, given all her other problems and the fact that complications of transplantation are more common in children with multi-system disorders.  The alternative of a surgical jejunostomy, an operation in which a hole is made directly from the skin of the abdomen into the intestine so that feeds can be put through a tube straight into the small intestine would be most unlikely to benefit K, given the difficulties already experienced with her transpyloric feeding; there is no reason to think such surgical intervention would assist her.  If she remains on TPN she will not be able to go home, as her care would represent too great a challenge to her parents or any foster carers.</p>

Palliative care is essentially the treatment of distress where there is a low possibility of cure and the provision of comfort and improved quality of life so far as possible.

It would not be reasonable to give other intravenous fluid as this would not provide for her nutritional requirements, and it would artificially prolong life without any benefit to her.  Analgesic sedation could be provided intravenously through a butterfly needle placed under the skin.  In these circumstances K would die peacefully and slowly.  It is probable that she would die after a small number of days although, given that she is currently well nourished, she might survive for a few weeks.  A bedroom could and would be provided for her at a local Hospice for Children where the parents could also stay, being provided with full care and hotel services.  They would be supported by a programme of support for K&#8217;s admission which would continue with bereavement care after K had died.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The care planning conference considered the two options.  First the continued use of TPN and high dependency, life-prolonging care and the second that of non-life prolonging care without TPN.  So far as the first is concerned the conference noted the bleak prognosis and that continuing to maintain K&#8217;s high dependency care was causing her inevitable stress and discomfort.  Continuing use of TPN will not improve her quality of life; rather the reverse.  If the treatment is continued, there is no reasonable chance of recovery and complications are almost inevitable.  It cannot be said precisely when such complications will occur, but it is likely that, without intensive care, they will lead to K&#8217;s early death and add to her burden of discomfort.  All those present at the conference were of the view that continued use of TPN and high dependency life-prolonging care is not justified or in K&#8217;s best interests and that the alternative option should be adopted, namely that the infusion of fluids should cease and K should receive full non-life prolonging palliative care, relief of any distress from absence of nutrition being achieved by analgesic and anxiolytic medication.</p>

She can on occasion respond to the staff and her parents when caring for her.  At times she appears comforted when being bathed or cared for by them.  She shows pleasure when her father is bathing her.  The medical staff do not think that she can smile, but the father believes she can.  She may be able to fix for a short period on a bright object held in front of her face and, fleetingly, on someone&#8217;s face.  Sadly however and in parallel, she is regularly distressed with frequent discomfort, painful procedures and vomiting.  She cries and wails and often cannot be comforted when she is unhappy or uncomfortable.  After vomiting her wailing can last up to 40 minutes and she appears very distressed.  She cannot sit up and has no head control.  She does not reach out and take objects and shows no purposeful movements.</p>

On the weekend of 13 March 2006 she became acutely unwell, though not to the extent requiring mechanical ventilation.  This was caused by a further episode of line infection and septicaemia.  She is no longer clinically ill but the episode of infection is likely to lead to one of the following problems.  An infected line is liable to fall out or to be pulled out.  The stitch which holds it in place has become displaced and there is infection in the skin around the entry wound for the line.  If the infection ceases to be controlled by the antibiotics and she becomes clinically unwell again, the line will have to be removed.  The antibiotics, although effective in controlling the infection are unlikely to eradicate the bacteria from the line so that, if and when antibiotics stop after the current planned period of five to six weeks, it is likely that infection will return.  Again the only solution will be the removal of the line.  Finally, the presence of grumbling infection on the line is likely itself to cause further deterioration of the liver function.  If this leads to liver failure, again the line will require to be removed.  If that has to be done, K would need a further operation to replace a new line.  That operation would be technically difficult as K has had Broviac lines in both of the veins in her chest which are usually used for this purpose.  Such further operation would involve discomfort, pain and distress through which the medical staff are reluctant to put K.</p>

She understands the severity of K&#8217;s medical treatment and the dilemma faced by the doctors in relation to her continued treatment.  She well understands the alternative questions posed at this stage as to whether K should continue with TPN or whether it should be withdrawn and K be allowed to die.  She has found it very difficult to make a final decision about K&#8217;s future treatment.  However she has been increasingly upset when seeing K in pain and discomfort and above all else wishes to avoid her undergoing any unnecessary distress and suffering.  On the basis that future treatment is deemed futile to improve K&#8217;s position, she accepts that palliative care is the appropriate course to take.  She would prefer K to be transferred to the hospice previously mentioned so that she can die peacefully with herself and others closest to her present.</p>

The Guardian also tried to engage K with another toy and gained a similar lack of response.  K was not in any pain at that time, the nurses informing the Guardian that for the time being her condition appears stable, although it involves vomiting on a daily basis.  The Guardian was present when the father, his parents and a family friend arrived to see K.  However, there did not appear to be any real response.  K&#8217;s father told the Guardian that he was finding it easier to talk about his feelings and discussed the question of moving K to the hospice if and when TPN was withdrawn.  The father said he would prefer it if K stayed on the ward as he knew all the staff and was comfortable with this.  However, I have been told by his counsel that he is now content for K&#8217;s final days under care to be spent in the hospice as proposed.</p>

He has confirmed the position as set out in the reports to which I have above referred.  He has made clear and I accept that, even with the most assiduous care and the successful adoption of every prophylactic technique in the face of infection, K&#8217;s expectation of life is to be numbered in months rather than years.  Even on the most optimistic assessment, liver failure is likely to occur at around the age of one year (i.e. within about 6 months), without prospect or benefit of a transplant operation to save K&#8217;s life.  At around the same time, cardiac compromise, which is already occurring due to her primary muscular disease, is likely to become critical in any event.  Since there is no realistic chance or prospect of medical intervention to make K&#8217;s intestines function properly, she will remain entirely dependent on TPN with all its discomfort and risks of infection to the end, whenever that end comes.  K&#8217;s distress and discomfort will continue and will be likely to increase rather than improve.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to K&#8217;s immediate prospects, she is at this moment clinically stable.  However, she faces a likelihood of deterioration within a few weeks either by reason of continuing infection resulting from the presence of the line (which infection antibiotics appear to be keeping at bay but are unable to overcome), or the dislodging of the line.  As to the first, tests in the last few days have shown that infection is still present.  It is likely to continue and, if so, to require removal of the line in the near future.  As to the second, because of the displacement of the stitch and the skin infection surrounding the line entry hole, dislodgment is a real likelihood.  If and when either occurs, none of those concerned think it would be proper or desirable to seek by operation to introduce a replacement line as a means of prolonging K&#8217;s unhappy life.  At that point, some fluid and antibiotics could in principle be administered through peripheral drip, but venous access has become so difficult as a result of earlier treatment that it would last for a few days only at best.  All are concerned that K&#8217;s inevitable end should be as painless and dignified as possible.  All are now also agreed that the position has been reached whereby there are effectively two realistic alternatives so far as K&#8217;s treatment is concerned.  Either the line is removed in the next few days and TPN ceases, followed by a period of organised palliative care to ensure that K suffers no further discomfort or distress by administration of suitable analgesic and anxiolytic drugs, enabling peaceful transfer of K to a hospice where her parents can be with her to the end.  Alternatively, the line is left in place and K&#8217;s regime of discomfort continues until the occurrence of an inevitable crisis over the next few weeks, which crisis would precipitate rapid deterioration and discomfort with little chance to plan for a dignified and peaceful end.</p>

It is therefore vital to bear in mind that English law places a very heavy burden on those who are advocating a course which would lead inevitably to the cessation of a human life.  In doing so, however, I take particular guidance from those passages in the judgments of Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR and Balcombe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A Minor) (Wardship: Medical Treatment)</span> at <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] Fam 33" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] Fam 33</ref> at 47 and 52 respectively, highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Wyatt</span> at paras [71] and [74].

She lived in a care home and had been fed by way of a percutaneous-gastronomy tube (PEG) for five years.  She was admitted to hospital after her PEG fell out. Her family resisted a declaration sought by the Trust that it was in her best interests to re-insert it,  because they believed that she would have wished to be allowed to die with dignity.  The consequence of not granting the declaration would have been that KH would have died slowly of thirst and starvation, although her suffering would have been alleviated by drugs.  As is made clear in paragraph [27] of the judgment of Brooke LJ, the judge came to the conclusion that in KH&#8217;s present state he could not say that life-prolonging treatment would provide no benefit and he found that death by, in effect, starvation would be even less dignified than the death that she would face in due course if kept artificially alive for more weeks, months or possibly years.

He came to the conclusion that it was in the best interests of the patient to accede to the unanimous wish of those who are responsible for her treatment.</p>

There are a number of crucial distinctions between the facts of this case and those in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">KH</span>.  In that case, it was the unanimous view of those concerned with the treatment of KH that the PEG should be re-inserted.  Here the reverse is the case and the views of the medical advisers that nutrition should cease  are endorsed by the parents and the local authority.  In the case of KH she was a sentient adult.  In this case, baby K is sentient, in the sense that she has some (uncertain) appreciation of what goes on around her, but her feelings and capacity to appreciate pleasure, pain, or the sheer sensation of &#8220;being alive&#8221; are those of a child with a developmental age of three months.

MB suffered from spinal muscular atrophy, a severe form of degenerative and progressive neurological genetic condition.  He was aged 10 months and had been unable to breathe without artificial ventilation for eight months.  He could not swallow properly and had been fed by way of gastrostomy tube for four months. He also suffered from epileptic fits.  The doctors responsible for his care wished to withdraw his endo-tracheal tube with the inevitable consequence that he would die within a few minutes because he would be unable to breathe.  The application was however opposed by his parents on the grounds that, as the persons who knew him best and were constantly attendant upon him, they were convinced that he felt and could display pleasure and recognised his parents, brother and sister and that he could see, hear and take in certain television and DVD programmes and music on CDs which were played to him.  They accepted that a number of the procedures to which he was submitted caused him discomfort and pain but thought that the doctor&#8217;s evidence to that effect was exaggerated.  The judge considered the evidence and the benefits and burdens to MB drawn up in a &#8220;balance sheet&#8221; by the Guardian.  </p>

He could both hear and see. The judge was satisfied that he could and did still feel touch and that, just as there was some touches which were painful and he did not like, there were others, particularly the stroking and handling of his parents and siblings, which he liked and which the judge assumed gave him a sense of pleasure.  </p>

Although he had the absence  of pleasures normally associated with childhood such as crawling, exploring, taking first steps, and playing with other children, he was left with a core of pleasure, in particular that derived from his relationship with his parents and family.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case K is less than 6 months old and has a developmental age of only 3 months.  She has no accumulation of experiences and cognition comparable with that of MB.  She is not, and with her short expectation of life is never likely to be, in a position to derive pleasure from DVDs or CDs and the only indication of real feelings of pleasure in her limited developmental state is enjoyment of a bath.  On the evidence before me there is no realistic sense in which one can assign to her the simple pleasure of being alive or having other than a life dominated by regular pain, distress and discomfort and unrelieved by the pleasures of eating.  Her muscular function is already severely diminished and any pleasure which might otherwise develop through increased activity and stimulation of the senses is denied to her.  She has no prospect of relief from this pitiful existence before an end which is regarded as virtually certain by the age of one year and likely to be appreciably less.  If her line is not removed she will continue to suffer pain and distress from the invasive treatment which she already experiences and the prospect is of the likely necessity for removal of her line  in the near future which will merely add to her distress.  If she were to have the necessary further surgical operation to replace the line, she would require mechanical ventilation which is also invasive and painful.  There would be no improvement in her condition or improvement in her expectation of life.  In these circumstances, I have no doubt that it would not only be a mercy, but it is in her best interests, to cease to provide TPN while she is still clinically stable, so that she may die in peace and over a comparatively short space of time, relieved by the palliative treatment contemplated, which will cause her neither pain nor discomfort and will enable her to live out her short life in relative peace in the close care of her parents who love her.</p>
