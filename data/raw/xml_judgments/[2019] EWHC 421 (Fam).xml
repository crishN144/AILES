In January 2015, following a fact-finding hearing (August 2014) and multiple welfare hearings, a district judge sitting in the Family Court at Worcester determined, exceptionally, that it was in the best interests of the boys that the father should have no further direct or indirect contact with them; the boys were then aged 4 and 2.   </p>

The application was heard by His Honour Judge Plunkett on 5 July 2018, without formal notice to the mother, or to the solicitor for the child (the boys having been joined to the earlier proceedings and represented by a Children&#8217;s Guardian under <span style="font-style:italic">rule 16.4 Family Procedure Rules 2010; </span>&#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">FPR 2010</span>&#8217;).  The Children&#8217;s Guardian, whose role at the conclusion of the proceedings had converted to one of named &#8216;officer&#8217; under a Family Assistance Order, had been invited to attend the hearing on 5 July, but was not in fact present.   By order of 28 August 2018, the judge granted the father&#8217;s application.   </p>

Her single ground of appeal is that the Judge was wrong to grant the father&#8217;s application without hearing from her, or receiving her representations. On 30 October 2018, Williams J granted permission to appeal.  I heard the appeal on 21 February 2019, and announced at the conclusion of the hearing that I would allow the appeal and remit the case to Mr Justice Keehan as Family Division Liaison Judge of the Midlands Circuit.   </p>

In his application, the father asserted that &#8220;there has been ample time between the last order and this application to progress contact&#8221;, and claimed that he &#8220;now &#8230; has insight into how his behaviour has contributed to the current state of affairs&#8221;.  Given the extensive review of the evidence and the arguments at the end of 2017, and the very recent dismissal of a number of applications (5 January 2018), HHJ Plunkett would have been perfectly entitled, in my judgment, to have given this application fairly short shrift. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The appropriate procedure for a court to follow when presented with such an application, in my judgment, is that laid out in the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> (see [18] above), namely that the application should be considered &#8216;in the first instance&#8217; on the papers, or at on an oral hearing which can be &#8216;without notice&#8217; to the respondent particularly if there are concerns about the effect on the respondent of learning of a fresh application (what Wall LJ referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> at [92]/[93] as &#8220;certain sensitive circumstances&#8230; a case in which the stress of previous litigation has destabilised the family, and in which the fragile capacity of the resident parent may well be adversely affected by the service of an application for permission to apply&#8221;&#8211; see [18] above).  If the applicant seeks an oral hearing, he/she should not be denied this.  If the application is without merit, then it can be dismissed at that stage, and the potential respondent may well have been spared any engagement with the process.  However, if the application shows sufficient merit (i.e. the applicant has demonstrated a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> case that there is a need for renewed judicial investigation on the basis that he has an arguable case), the court should list the application for an &#8216;on notice&#8217; hearing to allow the respondent to make representations.  This procedure is clearly indicated from the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> but it was not followed here. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I would like to make three further points, which strongly support the approach outlined in [40] above.  First, the grounds laid out in an application for permission to make a fresh application may not tell the whole, or indeed a true, story; the situation </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">&#8216;on the ground&#8217; may not be as the applicant asserts.  Before a judge opens the gateway to fresh litigation &#8211; in circumstances when a court has earlier taken the exceptional course of imposing a restriction on further applications &#8211; an  opportunity should be given to the respondent to fill any factual gaps, or correct any factual errors (deliberate or unwitting), in the material on which the judge is being asked to consider the application, and to respond on the merits.  On this point, it is illustrative to reconsider what I set out at [36] above.  Secondly, as Hale J contemplated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re N </span>(see [16] above), there may be no &#8220;genuine need to invoke the court's assistance in the problem that had arisen&#8221; &#8211; a point which Thorpe LJ repeated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span> (see [13] above: he referred to there being no need for &#8220;renewed judicial investigation&#8221;).  It may be that the issue &#8211; when analysed with the benefit of <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> parties&#8217; contributions &#8211; does not warrant the expense and time of court intervention, thereby saving the parties&#8217; and the court&#8217;s limited resources.   Thirdly, and yet more significantly, only by offering the respondent an opportunity to be heard will the judge, in my view, be fulfilling his or her obligation under the &#8216;overriding objective&#8217; under the <span style="font-style:italic">FPR 2010</span> to deal with case &#8220;justly&#8221; and &#8220;fairly&#8221; (see [10](iv) above): there will be few, if any, situations in which the respondent is not likely to be materially affected by the grant of the application to re-open the litigation. Justice and fairness surely require that the respondent is given the chance to inform and influence the decision whether further litigation should be instigated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">A subsidiary but not unimportant point, relevant on the particular facts of this case, is that the mother <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> had notice of the father&#8217;s application to apply for a <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span> order because the court had sent her a copy of the directions order setting up the hearing (see [34] above).  In the circumstances she did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> benefit from the application being dealt with on a &#8216;without  notice&#8217; basis; indeed, ironically, she was then in a worse situation because &#8211; knowing of the application &#8211; she was then advised that she could not participate in it, and was therefore powerless to try to influence its outcome.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-style:italic">Reasoning: </span>The judge&#8217;s rationale for granting the application was ostensibly wrong.  While child welfare may be relevant to the issue, <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref></span> does not apply to the issue which he had to decide; this is not a &#8216;best interests&#8217; decision.  Although this is not central to my decision, I am satisfied that the judge erred in this respect.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I do not underestimate the challenges to HHJ Plunkett, an extremely experienced judge in this field, of dealing with the issues in this difficult and &#8216;toxic&#8217; private law children&#8217;s case, which were wide-ranging and complex.  These are, in my judgment, some of the most demanding cases in family law.  The judge had understandably, and at his own direction as the Designated Family Judge for the court, assumed responsibility for this case from one of the district judges in his court; by the time he inherited the case, two of the most exceptional and Draconian orders available in private law compendium had already been made.  I have no doubt that he conscientiously analysed the issues raised by the father over a prolonged period, and in the context of multiple different applications. I am firmly of the view, however, that on the father&#8217;s application for permission to apply for a <span style="font-style:italic">section 8</span> order, which is under challenge in this appeal, he adopted, as it appears he had in the past<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:2.65in"> See [24] and [25](i) above. </p>
	      </authorialNote>, a flawed procedure, particularly on these facts.  I have further concluded that his ultimate reasoning was erroneous. The appeal must therefore be allowed.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I propose to remit the application for hearing before Keehan J (as FDLJ for the Midlands Circuit) for him to determine, on notice to the mother and children&#8217;s solicitor, the father&#8217;s application for permission to make a <span style="font-style:italic">section 8</span> application.  As I advised the parties at the conclusion of the hearing, I have requested that the application be listed as soon as possible; I am conscious that, for the second time, and wholly unacceptably, the father&#8217;s application for permission to make his <span style="font-style:italic">section 8</span> application will have taken more than one year to resolve. </p>
