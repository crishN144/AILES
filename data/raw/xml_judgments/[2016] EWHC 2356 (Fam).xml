X describes the staff as being &#8220;professional, kind and organised, affording a feeling of comfort&#8221; and treating them with &#8220;respect [and] courtesy.&#8221; Y, when she addressed me in court, spoke movingly of their gratitude to the clinic for its role in &#8220;creating our family.&#8221; X also referred to the approach of the clinic&#8217;s &#8220;person responsible&#8221; after the error was discovered as having been &#8220;professional, kind and supportive.&#8221; Y recalls that he apologised, an apology he repeated in his witness statement. They were grateful to the clinic for having put them in touch with specialist solicitors and for having agreed, in principle, to pay their costs. Unsurprisingly, when they were told of the legal issues and the doubt about X&#8217;s parentage they reacted in a way which is distressingly familiar in these cases. In her witness statement, X says that &#8220;knowing I did not have legal rights to be [Z&#8217;s] parent was completely overwhelming and rocked me to the core.&#8221; For the first time ever in her life she suffered depression. When addressing me in court she described the information as &#8220;truly heartbreaking&#8221; and repeated how she had been &#8220;rocked to my core.&#8221; Y described the news as &#8220;devastating.&#8221;</p>

There was initial delay on the part of the clinic in disclosing the medical records, which generated unnecessary legal costs. Thereafter, most unhappily, and despite the clinic&#8217;s assurance that their costs would be paid, X and Y have suffered considerable and needless anxiety as a result of the practical difficulties their solicitors have had in extracting payment.</p>

(1) In an email dated 27 April 2016, the clinic&#8217;s solicitors told X and Y&#8217;s solicitors that they would receive payment of outstanding invoices &#8220;shortly.&#8221; In fact, payment was not made until 20 July 2016. (2) On 20 May 2016, the clinic&#8217;s solicitors said that &#8220;These are NHS processes and very slow.&#8221; (3) On 2 June 2016 X and Y&#8217;s solicitors felt it necessary to put the clinic&#8217;s solicitors on notice that &#8220;Your client&#8217;s continued non-payment is generating additional legal costs which will fall at your client&#8217;s door to be paid.&#8221; They had also made clear to the clinic&#8217;s solicitors on 20 May 2016 that X and Y were making payments on account of costs. (4) These delays continued even after I had made an order on 20 July 2016 providing that &#8220;the clinic will pay the reasonable costs of this application within 14 days of the making of this Order.&#8221; (The order went on to provide a mechanism for resolution of any dispute.) </p>

Mr Powell in his position statement &#8211; also dated 15 September 2016 &#8211; stated that &#8220;payment is being made today.&#8221; Y, when she addressed me in court, eloquently described how this had added to the stress and their feeling of unfairness and how they had become fearful of being left with a substantial financial burden. She said, in words reflecting what many parents have said to me in other cases, that she did not want this to happen to any other parent ever again. </p>

The strain on them is immense. If process is delayed because of obstruction on the part of the clinic, that is shocking. The original administrative incompetence in these cases is bad enough; to have it aggravated by subsequent delay, prevarication or obstruction on the part of the clinic merely adds insult to injury.&#8221;</p>

But I doubt that everything can properly be laid at that door. The bureaucrats, administrators, and lawyers involved need to understand the immense emotional impact on the ordinary people unwillingly caught up in these cases of the sudden and profoundly disturbing discovery that something has gone &#8216;wrong&#8217;. We must, everyone involved in the process must, do everything appropriate to ensure that, once the proceedings have started, these cases are dealt with as quickly and smoothly as possible. It may be that, as part of the approach, the court should in future be invited to make costs orders &#8216;as the case goes along.&#8217;</p>
