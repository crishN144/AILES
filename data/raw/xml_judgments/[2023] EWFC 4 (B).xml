This resulted in the applicant&#8217;s evidence being &#8216;part heard&#8217; overnight on the first day and in her having to give evidence over a longer period than the respondent, but I determined that this was a necessary and unavoidable adjustment to make to ensure that the respondent had the best opportunity of fairly participating (and notwithstanding that he had been removed only as a consequence of his own behaviour).</span></p>

I gave each party a deadline of 4pm on 7 December to provide me with independent documentary evidence of the most recent balance for any accounts/investments that were in dispute, making it clear that I intended to use the most recent figure for which there was independent evidence (such as a screenshot of a balance from an online banking account). Having complained bitterly that he would be unable to obtain the evidence in that tight timeframe, the respondent was in fact able to provide me with updating documents by the evening of 6 December. The date of the documents provided by him shows that they were in his possession before the start of the final hearing and so it is entirely unclear to me why he did not serve them on the applicant&#8217;s solicitor earlier as this would have avoided unnecessary debate over bank balance figures. Nonetheless, this direction avoided the need for further oral evidence on the issue of bank account balances and thus reduced the amount of time either party was required to be in the witness box.  </span></p>

For example, when Ms Driver asked the respondent why he had failed to file a statement dealing with the issue of his Egyptian inheritance (as had been directed by HHJ Robinson in April 2022), the respondent became very agitated telling me that the hearing in April was a &#8220;fake hearing&#8221;, that HHJ Robinson had no jurisdiction to make the order, and that he had not agreed to the applicant being involved in a valuation exercise because her lawyer would &#8220;bribe the agent&#8221; (quite apart from the total absence of evidence for any of these serious allegations, the question he had been asked had nothing to do with valuations anyway, and the respondent has still failed to provide any cogent explanation for not complying with the direction to file a statement). </span></p>

Ms Driver then took the respondent to his Form E [p.115] where the respondent had written that his mother suffered from &#8216;severe dementia&#8221; and asserted that he was paying her care home fees and medical treatment and also had control of her finances as she is &#8220;&#8230;unable to care financially for herself&#8221;. At this point, instead of simply accepting that there was an obvious contradiction between his written and oral evidence, the respondent claimed that his mother&#8217;s dementia had &#8216;improved&#8217; since he filed his Form E such that it is now what he called &#8220;minimal dementia&#8221;. He went on to say that his mother had felt &#8220;imprisoned&#8221; in the UK (when she was living with the respondent and applicant) and that her health has much improved now she has returned to Egypt. He then deflected the question, taking his answer off on a tangent complaining of his mother&#8217;s treatment when in the UK and resuming his theme of having been &#8216;wronged&#8217; by the English legal system. </span></p>

The respondent says there is no intention to register/notarise because there is no benefit to him of doing this and it costs money to do so.

Whilst the applicant has continued to provide financial support to their adult son, their son is now 30 years of age and is a hospital doctor living independently with his girlfriend. I do not consider that the financial maintenance of the parties&#8217; adult son is a &#8216;need&#8217; of the applicant&#8217;s going forward. I am of the same view in respect of the parties&#8217; adult daughter, who is now aged 27.</span></p>

The slightly higher figure on the applicant&#8217;s side of the balance sheet above is justified by the issue of the costs order from the divorce proceedings and the non-matrimonial nature of a proportion of the jewellery. Moreover, the applicant has continued to work post-separation and an element of the funds in her sole accounts is non-matrimonial having been earned post-separation. I consider that the modest difference in the parties&#8217; overall net positions in favour of the applicant adequately takes into account these factors whilst also acknowledging that the respondent has continued to discharge the mortgage on the former family home and that the respondent also has the benefit of his Egyptian inheritance.</span></p>

It is not clear to me what the respondent&#8217;s position is regarding these items and the applicant did not deal with the issue of chattels in her s.25 statement or in oral evidence. On her form E the applicant has only itemised &#8220;china&#8221; valued at &#163;500 and &#8220;silverware&#8221; valued at &#163;500 and so it follows that all the additional items on her schedule must individually be worth less than &#163;500. </span></p>
