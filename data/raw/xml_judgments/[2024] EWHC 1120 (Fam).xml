The father is also in person, and was at the appeal hearing, although unlike the mother he had been represented by leading counsel at the hearing when the original order, for the appointment of a psychologist to carry out a global psychological assessment of the family, was made. The mother seeks her costs of the appeal hearing against him, and also against the children&#8217;s guardian, who, along with the father, resisted the appeal.</span></p>

This rule applies only to financial remedy proceedings, and not to this hearing, which was an appeal in private children proceedings. In family law proceedings, the normal rule that costs will follow the event has been disapplied, But CPR 1998 r.44.2(4) and (5) apply both at first instance and on appeal. These are private law children proceedings where costs orders generally are rare, but the court nevertheless retains a discretion to make such order as to costs as it thinks just (FPR 2020 r.28.1), and in deciding what order if any to make the court will have regard to all of the circumstances including the conduct of the parties, and whether a party has succeeded on all or part of their case (CPR 1998 r.44.2(4).</span></p>

As Wall LJ pointed out in&#160;EM v SW, In re M (A Child)&#160;</span><a class="Hyperlink" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/311.html" style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/311" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 311" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 311</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">, there are differences between trials and appeals. At first instance, "nobody knows what the judge is going to find" (para 23), whereas on appeal the factual findings are known. Not only that, the judge's reasons are known. Both parties have an opportunity to "take stock" and consider whether they should proceed to advance or resist an appeal and to negotiate on the basis of what they now know. So it may well be that conduct which was reasonable at first instance is no longer reasonable on appeal. But in my view that does not alter the principles to be applied: it merely alters the application of those principles to the circumstances of the case.</span></p>

Whilst the Family Court is not strictly a &#8216;no costs&#8217; jurisdiction, as explained it generally operates on that basis in the absence of unreasonable or reprehensible behaviour. I consider that by analogy in proceedings such as these, where no costs order was in fact made by HHJ McPhee at first instance at a hearing where the father was represented and the mother was not, it is appropriate similarly to consider whether it is appropriate to limit any award of costs or to make no order at all.</span></p>

I agree with Ms Krishnan for the Guardian that in the absence of an application for a 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> party costs order, the application must in fact be one against the children who were represented by a CAFCASS guardian, under a legal aid certificate. I accept that that would not have been the mother&#8217;s intention. However, whether made against CAFCASS as a third party, or against the children&#8217;s CAFCASS guardian, the outcome would, I am clear, have been the same. </span></p>

It would be, in my view, a difficult precedent if guardians in such proceedings as these found that, if ever there was an appeal by a parent against a court&#8217;s decision, they might find themselves liable for a costs order if they had not supported the winning side on that appeal. Their role is to make submissions to the court from the point of view of the child, not coloured by the competing interests of the other parties, and I am entirely satisfied that this is what the guardian in this case has done. I am consequently not persuaded that a costs order against the guardian in merited in this case, following my determination of the appeal in the mother&#8217;s favour.</span></p>

Prima facie, the mother says that she is entitled to an order for costs against the father, having succeeded in her appeal. I do not however consider that the father&#8217;s position was unreasonable in the appeal, in that he was defending the order made by HHJ McPhee, and supported in his position by the guardian, and I excuse, as he has been a litigant in person since the original hearing before that judge, both his emailing my clerk directly without copying in other parties, and his direct expressions of dissatisfaction with the outcome of the appeal, in the absence of any legally trained filter. I also must have regard to the reality of the situation in an appeal such as this, against a case management decision made in private law children proceedings, which is that whilst a discrete issue, all of the arguments advanced have been aimed at serving the best interests of the children who are its subjects. I note also that the father has paid his own costs of representation below, at a time when the mother was unrepresented; the position on appeal was reversed. I would also add that, given the already fraught relations between the parents in this case with which the Family Court has been seeking to deal, the making of a costs order would only be likely to further entrench the parties, which would not serve the interests of the children at all.</span></p>
