Further, there is a lack of clarity about the payments made to the surrogate mother. The part of the agreement between the applicants and the surrogate mother that should set out the payments has no specific sums inserted, either in the section dealing with monthly payments or compensation. Due to the more recent position taken by the clinic in refusing to respond to further enquiries, it has not been possible to obtain any more information. This has meant, once again, the court is left in a position of having to consider the application without the full background.</span></p>

Commercial surrogacy is permitted in Ukraine. Renaissance provided an all inclusive package for a cost of EUR 26,000. In fact the applicants paid EUR 31,000 as an additional EUR 5000 was due in the event of a twin pregnancy. The joint agreement between the applicants and the surrogate mother prepared by BioTexCom is a subsidiary agreement governing the relationship between the parties. On the second page of that agreement there is no obligation on the applicants to make any payments to the surrogate mother; the sections that set out the payment are left blank. The contract between the applicants and Renaissance included all payments to the surrogate, medical costs and legal assistance with regard to obtaining birth certificates and passports for the children, as well as accommodation costs for the applicants whilst they were in Ukraine. In addition, the agreement provided that the clinic would carry any risks, at no additional cost to the applicants, of a failed surrogacy arrangement. </span></p>

However, this can only be on the basis of the court drawing that inference; the surrogate mother has not been served with the application for a parental order and there has been a considerable lapse of time since the consent documents were signed.

On the face of the documents signed by the surrogate mother, in particular the documents signed in February 2014, there is consent given more than six weeks after the children&#8217;s birth. However, there is limited, if any, information as to the circumstances in which that consent was given; in particular whether she had a &#8216;full understanding&#8217; of what was involved in giving that consent. Whilst the position taken by the clinic in not co-operating further with any enquiries made to gain a better understanding may be justified as a matter of Ukrainian law, it means this court is deprived of having all the relevant information. On an issue as fundamental as consent, in the context of circumstances where what is being sought is to change the status of a child the court, in my judgment, should be very cautious about drawing inferences in circumstances such as this. </span></p>

The terms of this document seem to suggest she was receiving payments direct from the applicants, in their statements they have stated this was not the case. Based on this document it appears the surrogate mother received payments totalling EUR 1,800 during the period of the pregnancy.</span></p>

The information regarding her address is that it was in a very run down area of Kiev, and she may not have even lived there. The applicants have produced some information giving details of Ukrainian average monthly wages for the period to September 2014. In Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH) the highest was 3,619 and the lowest 115. At an exchange rate of 1 EUR to 25 UAH this means the surrogate mother received in the region of 5,000 UAH per month during her pregnancy, which on the limited information available is significantly higher than the average national monthly wage.</span></p>

Clearly that is well in excess of the payments in this case, and raises the spectre here that the payments are at a level to raise a concern as to whether the surrogate mother was a willing participant in this arrangement. Despite the disparity in these figures it appears, on the information the court has, the sums paid were not disproportionate to reasonable expenses when considered in the context of the information about average wages, together with the evidence provided by the applicants about their dealings with the surrogate mother.</span></p>

The court has the benefit of the two reports prepared by Mr McGavin, an experienced member of the Cafcass High Court Team. He recommends parental orders are made in relation to both children. He discussed the applicants&#8217; health with them and was satisfied by the responses made. The applicants have reported in their written evidence that neither has any health concerns. One of the matters Mr McGavin rightly raises in his report is the need for the applicants to make satisfactory arrangements, in the event that they are unable to care for the children. At the hearing I was informed by Ms Cabeza that those arrangements are in hand, all relevant documents are drafted, the male applicant&#8217;s niece has agreed to be a testamentary guardian and these arrangements will be implemented once the parental orders are made.</span></p>

That will reflect the position in their country of birth, where the applicants are their legal parents. If the parental order is not made the surrogate mother will remain, as a matter of English law, the legal mother of these children in circumstances where there is no realistic prospect of her having any future role in the children&#8217;s lives. Their de facto parents are the applicants, their lifelong welfare interests are best served if that reality is reflected in their legal relationship with the applicants.
