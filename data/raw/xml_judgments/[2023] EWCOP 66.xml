He lives with his mother, and the support is currently being provided by an organisation called New Leaf. It has been in place since 1 July 2023. Prior to that there had been similar organisations who had provided the support but for various different reasons set out in the papers those arrangements had been terminated. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">The evidence demonstrates that normally takes about three to four minutes and the support worker takes a number of steps described in the evidence to manage the risks involved with that activity for JI, such as ensuring that he only has sufficient money, namely &#163;20, for the private lap dance, and also the support worker reminds JI of appropriate behaviours and the importance of leaving the room once the dance has finished. That activity and support for that activity has been part of JI&#8217;s care plan since 2019, and by and large has taken place on a monthly basis, generally at JI&#8217;s request. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Integrated Care Board and the Local Authority are of the view that the support workers are at risk of committing an offence under section 39 of the Sexual Offences Act, in that it could be said that the care workers cause JI to engage in sexual activity, or they are creating the circumstances for the sexual activity to take place. The Integrated Care Board considers the risk of this is more than fanciful. As a consequence, they have made the decision to phase these visits out gradually to manage the impact on JI. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">The NHS Trust and the official solicitor take issue with the Integrated Care Board&#8217;s interpretation of section 39, and consider that JI&#8217;s best interests require that such visits continue as meeting JI&#8217;s best interests to explore his sexual identity, and as JI has said himself, to manage his sexual urges. In the balance sheet analysis in the papers, it refers to JI&#8217;s frustration and aggressive reaction if he considers he is not able to undertake activities that someone with capacity could. </p>

He submits that making that declaration goes too far. It amounts to pressure, and that if there is any challenge to the funding decision made by the Integrated Care Board and/or the Local Authority, it should be challenged by way of judicial review. </p>

The care plan was developed in 2019 and since then our notes show that there has only been one incident, JI thought a dancer would meet him in a restaurant following a dance. JI&#8217;s treating team responded to this incident by providing additional support for JI. There is a risk that restricting JI&#8217;s access to Adult World would be a significant loss to him due to his limited access to meaningful activities. JI has accessed Adult World for a significant period of time and therefore the risk of agitation and behaviours of concern is likely to be greater if he is no longer able to access Adult World. JI only accesses Adult World once a month.&#8221;</p>

He relies on what is said by Baker LJ at paragraph 75 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>, when Baker LJ helpfully gives a steer about other situations when care workers are asked to assist people who have the capacity <span style="font-style:italic">to</span> consent to or engage in sexual relations, but lack the capacity in other respects as JI does in this case, for example to make decisions about their care, treatment or contact with other people. </p>

	      <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;Firstly, the merits of making such a declaration will turn on a thorough analysis of the specific facts of the individual case. Secondly, in making such a declaration the Court may have to consider carefully whether the steps proposed under the care plan have the potential to amount to a criminal offence under section 39. Thirdly, as set out in the cases cited above, any declaration would not be binding on the prosecuting authority although no doubt it would be taken into consideration in the event of any subsequent criminal investigation.&#8221;</p>

It may no longer be an issue in March, I do not know, there may be other ways JI can explore his sexual identity or urges, and as I had indicated in the documents that the Court has got, JI chose not to pursue that activity in November as a result of him prioritising his financial resources in a different direction. </p>

The situation he was envisaging is that there was an actual care plan in place. In relation to the future declaration sought on behalf of the official solicitor, that care plan is not yet in place, and that will be the position when the Court reconsiders this case in March. </p>

He has rightly directed the Court to the decision of <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v TZ (No. 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/973" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 973" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 973</ref>, where the Court there at paragraph 55 gave very careful guidance about the essential elements that there should be in this care plan. </p>

	    <p class="Judgmentparas" style="margin-left:0.39in">I cannot emphasise enough in this particular case, and because of JI&#8217;s particular circumstances, the importance of there being a meaningful TZ care plan that is produced and used and regularly reviewed to be able to help support JI, having identified what the basic principles are, but also providing tangible support in relation to education and empowerment for him. Support and intervention to enable JI to be able to break the cycle that seems to have appeared in this case of him being unable to be able to manage and make decisions in relation to the social and other needs that he has.</p>

So all I am doing at this stage, because of the experience of Counsel in front of me, is putting down a very clear marker in the hope that the message will go out to all of those in your chambers and your solicitors. If there is very good reason not to comply with a direction the Court, of course, will always consider any request, but it is causing real problems in managing cases, managing Court lists and managing hearing times caused by a culture of casual non-compliance with court orders.</p>
