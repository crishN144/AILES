The defendant is 37 years old and is a specialist neurological physiotherapist. The parties began a relationship in early 2016. They have a child together, N, who is 5 years old. The defendant also has two older children from a previous relationship, aged 13 and 12. </p>

On 24 November 2017, the defendant applied for an ex parte non-molestation order which was made on the same day, in relation to an incident on 12 November 2017 when she had reported domestic abuse to the police. At the return hearing the order was directed to remain in place until 24 November 2018. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December 2017, the claimant sought contact with N and made a C100 application for a child arrangements order. A finding of fact hearing took place on 26 and 27 March 2018 before District Judge Barraclough sitting in Huddersfield to determine the defendant&#8217;s allegations of domestic abuse. Judgment was given on 9 April 2018. Out of 17 allegations before the court, 4 were not proven, 3 fell away through the claimant&#8217;s admissions to the court and 10 allegations were found proven. Those proven allegations &#8220;did not necessarily amount to domestic abuse&#8221;; that was as far as the judge was willing to go in his findings. </p>

The court therefore ordered the claimant to be referred to a Domestic Abuse Perpetrator Programme (&#8220;DAPP&#8221;) and for Cafcass to carry out the referral by 2 May 2018. On 18 September 2018, the claimant was referred to DAPP and on 27 September 2018, the DAPP provider assessed the claimant as unsuitable for DAPP for three reasons: first, that the surrounding circumstances and frequency of the domestic abuse incidents indicated low to medium risk; second, the claimant had passed his employer&#8217;s vetting and psychodynamic risk assessment; and third being on location and deployable with the Armed Forces at extremely short notice, meant that attending a programme of behavioural change that meets weekly would be impossible to sustain. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A Section 7 report dated 21 December 2018 recommended no direct contact between N and the claimant. The report was prepared by a Cafcass officer who had not seen the claimant, nor had she considered the fact-finding judgment of 9 April 2018. On 8 January 2019 District Judge Barraclough ordered an addendum report to be prepared to ensure that the claimant was spoken to by Cafcass. That report recommended that the claimant should have indirect contact with N. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 12 March 2019 the Cafcass officer spoke to a RM officer and made untrue allegations about the claimant which led to the suspension of the claimant&#8217;s training. This led to the claimant intimating a claim against Cafcass for defamation and misuse of private information. Cafcass conceded liability. In a settlement agreement dated 6 March 2020 Cafcass apologised, agreed to pay the claimant&#8217;s costs and the sum of &#163;27,500 in damages. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">District Judge Barraclough in his later judgment dated 8 April 2019 had concerns with the Cafcass officer&#8217;s views, especially that the claimant was a &#8220;particularly dangerous man&#8221; which had clearly been influenced by her discussions with the defendant. The Judge did not accept this and found that the officer had prejudged the matter. He held that he nonetheless needed clear and cogent reasons to depart from Cafcass&#8217; recommendations for contact and directed the appointment of an independent social worker.</p>

However, on 30 January 2020, the defendant began a second set of children proceedings, applying to suspend all contact under the final order. This was refused by Judge Barraclough. The defendant then sought to appeal that refusal. Permission to appeal was refused by Her Honour Judge Lynch on 18 February 2020. </p>

Instead it allows a party to communicate with any other person (a) to enable that party by confidential discussion, to obtain support, advice or assistance in the conduct of the proceedings, or (b) to engage in non-court dispute resolution, or  to make and pursue a complaint against (c) a person or body concerned in the proceedings or (d) regarding the law, policy or procedure relating to the proceedings (FPR 12.75(1)). However, if a disclosure is made by a party for purpose (a), then no further onward disclosure by the recipient is permitted (FPR 12.75(2)). This was presumably designed to prevent members of a party&#8217;s family acting as disclosure proxies for that party.

That is the context in which the Family Procedure Rules have to be interpreted and applied. Too narrow an interpretation of the rules would, in my view, jeopardise the welfare of children. It is axiomatic that the administration of justice and the protection of children requires disclosure of information between professionals to ensure that children are protected. In this case the police were investigating allegations of abuse between adults in a family and as part of the investigation asked the CAFCASS officer for details of the background. Part of the purpose of the conversation, in my view, was plainly the furtherance of child protection. The dispute between the adults, the history of harassment by S leading to the restraining order and the further allegations by S against the mother plainly raised concerns of professionals about the risk of harm to the children.&#8221;</p>

Para 6 merely says &#8220;on 22 January 2016 SP received a telephone call from a police officer and in the course of their conversation disclosed certain information about the proceedings.&#8221; In my opinion this decision does not throw any light on the question I have to answer. </p>

Disclosure by a party of, say, a s.7 Cafcass report to a non-specialist police officer would fall outside that freedom and be a breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12</ref>, and thus a contempt, although the seriousness of the breach would be mitigated by the fact that were such a disclosure to have been made by a party to a specialist police officer or by the Cafcass officer to a non-specialist police officer, it would not amount to a breach. It is hard to understand why this aspect of the law of contempt, which, given its nature, ought to be as straight-forward and transparent as possible,  appears to be so arbitrary and bereft of logic. </p>

Specifically, he argues that the restriction contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 12</ref> should not be construed to prevent a complainant from speaking to the police and seeking their help. This could, he submits, have the effect of lessening the willingness of another similar person to seek help from the authorities. It would be inimical, he argues, to the public interest to deter such persons from being able to seek help from the police and being discouraged from speaking out.</p>

First, he relied on the privacy afforded to the child N in the then ongoing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> proceedings and suggested that discussion of the issues in dispute in the defamation proceedings at an open hearing or in an open judgment would be liable to link the child, the claimant and the defendant to the Family Court proceedings and to undermine the confidentiality ordered by the Family Court in respect of those proceedings. Second, he relied on his past and intended future service as a Royal Marine in the armed forces, to which a high degree of confidentiality attaches. Personally, I consider the first reason, namely that the claimant is a civil litigant and at the same time a party to a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> proceeding, to be a very doubtful basis for derogating from open justice in a civil suit to be heard publicly. By contrast, the second reason does have validity, and the claimant will be granted anonymity for himself for that reason.</p>

She also knows that there are good reasons to anonymise the claimant having regard to his role in the armed forces, and that he will be anonymised.
