The upshot is that any order (whether emanating from this Court or from Spain) is incapable of practical implementation now or in the near future.  On 15 March 2020, the FCO advised against all but essential travel to Spain; two days later, the FCO advised against all but essential international travel generally. There is indeed limited opportunity for international air travel between the two countries.  The Spanish Government declared a State of Emergency on 14 March 2020.  In the UK there is a mandate for social distancing, to protect in particular those most at risk from the virus who are the elderly and those with pre-existing health problems (QD has such a condition).  The UK Government has published specific guidance for residential care providers to minimise the risk of virus transmission in care homes, and, at the time of writing, it has announced that it will shortly be asking those over 70 to self-isolate for 12 weeks. </p>

It is not clear whether dementia care is available at Vista Al Mar.  KD has apparently applied to withdraw the criminal denunciation against the Applicants which she had lodged before the Spanish court.  She has offered a range of undertakings to effect QD&#8217;s smooth and appropriate return: including, (i) not to support a prosecution of the Applicants; (ii) to take steps necessary to secure a hearing in the Court of First Instance No.2 in Orihuela in respect of her petition for a declaration of incapacity; and (iii) not to remove QD from Vista Al Mar without advance permission of the Spanish Court. </p>

She further accepts that the direction should be stayed pending the conclusion of the pandemic.

Quite apart from any other consideration, this would (a) enable the courts of his state of habitual residence to determine issues of his long-term care and residence and (b) make it easier for KD to visit QD regularly (even though it would make contact with BS more difficult).  Both have had to accept, however, that there would need to be a further &#8216;welfare&#8217;-type hearing once the pandemic has passed, in order to assess at the very least the practicalities involved in effecting the proposed return. </p>
