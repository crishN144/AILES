The perceived forensic purpose of this focus has been two-fold; first, to seek to identify the moment when the parties began cohabiting or became committed to each other, and secondly, having identified that date, to seek to identify what wealth the husband owned at that date for the purpose of establishing the extent of his pre-marital wealth.</span></p>

However, these passages have to be put in context and, in particular, have to be applied in the framework of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.  It would, in my view, be a very regrettable step if parties were obliged or even encouraged to conduct a financial account after a long marriage.  I do not consider that this can be what the House of Lords intended.  I will return to this later in my judgment.</span></p>

Again, each side blames the other.  From my perspective, both are to some extent responsible.  There was, in my judgment, no justification for the husband relying on the matters he set out in that part of the form E which deals with bad behaviour or conduct, even though he made it clear that this related to the breakdown of the marriage and not to the wife&#8217;s conduct during the marriage.  Likewise, I can see no justification for the wife also relying on this paragraph by the general incorporation of the statement she annexed to her form E.  This statement was an unfocused document, but it included allegations about the husband&#8217;s behaviour which were as unnecessary as the allegations he had made.</span></p>

The relationship started in the middle of 1984.  They both had their own houses and their own work.  They would spend variable amounts of time together, with the wife travelling to visit the husband at his house in Manchester.  At Christmas 1984 the wife decided to end the relationship, but the husband persuaded her not to.  She remained living in York and visiting the husband, until she sold her home in York and bought the property I have mentioned in Salford.  In her affidavit the wife said that she sold the property in York in July 1985 and moved to live with the husband until she bought her property in Salford in September 1985.</span></p>

In her oral evidence she said that she wanted to retain her own independent dignity.  I do not accept that the parties were living as a couple at this time, as asserted by the wife in her affidavit.

In cross-examination she accepted that the husband had never or almost never stayed at her property.  Whilst it is clear that the parties were spending a significant amount of time together and the husband was, by this time, providing the wife with financial support, they maintained their separate homes, and also, in my judgment, spent significant periods apart in those respective homes.</span></p>

He says that over a period of time the wife was pressurising him to marry, but he would not agree.  He gradually relented, but put conditions as to the nature of the celebrations.  This was, he said, in early 1988.  Whether the parties agreed to marry in September 1987 or early 1988 would have no effect on my decision, so I do not propose to resolve this dispute.</span></p>

I propose to make a broad assessment of the position, taking into account the points made, both during the evidence and in the parties&#8217; respective submissions.  </span></p>

He had started the property business since at least 1972.  He might not have made much money in the very early years, but they provided the foundation from which he was able to take advantage of what he called &#8220;the boom years of the 1980s&#8221;.  The husband points to the fact that in 1984 he owned his own home, a substantial property in Manchester, a number of expensive cars and his business.  I propose only to refer to some of the evidence produced in support of the husband&#8217;s case that he was a man of wealth in 1984 and even more so in 1988.</span></p>

These show that the husband&#8217;s business was well established, both in 1984 and in 1988.  Mr. Mostyn submitted, it appeared almost as a matter of principle, that the husband should not be able to argue that these accounts do not show the value of his then business interests.  It is true that the net asset value set out in the balance sheet in the accounts appears at this distance in time to be relatively modest, rising from &#163;107,000 in 1984 to &#163;425,000 in 1988.  However, it is well known that company accounts, in particular balance sheets, do not necessarily by themselves show the true value of a business.  For example, in this case the properties usually appeared in the accounts at the lower of cost and net realisable value, as against actual value.</span></p>

Elements of this are undoubtedly flawed.  There is a valid question over whether all the company liabilities have been included.  This is not susceptible of a simple answer, as many of them are income debts, and some are debts due to the husband and to the pension fund, which does not appear in the schedule, but which was then worth something in the order of &#163;200,000.</span></p>

However, broadly assessed, the effect of the schedule is to show that the husband, in particular through his companies, had significant resources at the date of the marriage.  One property alone, Centre Lane, which the husband had bought for &#163;110,000 at the end of 1986 or early 1987, was sold in May 1989 for &#163;1.75 million after he had bought an additional three acres for &#163;70,000, pursuant to a pre-existing option.  Whilst the figure given by the husband of &#163;2&#160;million cannot be justified, I&#160;accept that this property was worth well in excess of &#163;1 million and, as a result, by way of example, that the company balance sheet could justifiably be increased to reflect this.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOYLAN:  Right.  Then, if it has to come back, yes.  Simply on submissions?</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. POINTER:  You will want a written statement from each side, but it will not need to be long.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOYLAN:  Right.  It is quite unlikely that that could happen this term.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. POINTER:  I understand that, my Lord.  I think your Lordship knows the way in which my client has put his case.  Bearing in mind that time will start to run from now, I think it appropriate that I should ask your Lordship for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal at this juncture ----</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOYLAN:  Yes.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. POINTER:  -- which I now do.  Your Lordship knows the way our case is being put.  I am not going to spend time amplifying that application.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOYLAN:  Certainly.  Do you want to identify any particular feature that you would say I had wrong, or do you just say generally?</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. POINTER:  The scale of departure from equality, in the light of the resources pre-marriage that were demonstrated to your Lordship on the evidence, and the Human Rights point.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE MOYLAN:  Yes, thank you very much.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;text-indent:-0.42in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. MOSTYN:  I now make a similar application, whether it be activated or not, that we have to do it now, we have been told.  Same grounds.  Scale of departure - far too much.</span></p>

In my view, I have applied the law correctly to the facts that I have found them, and that the decision that I have reached is within the proper limits of my discretion, and so I reject both applications for permission to appeal.</span></p>
