She maintains that both she and the child are at risk of death if her family were to find out about the child.  The mother&#8217;s case is that she found out that she was pregnant at approximately 30 weeks, having had an MRI scan for other health reasons.  She maintained that she was using contraception.  When she told the father that she was pregnant, he told her that he was married and had four children and a wife in Pakistan.  Initially, the mother said that the father said he would arrange for the mother to give birth in Pakistan, and then a member of his family would care for the child.  However, she said that she later found out that the father had arranged for her to have an abortion.  When she found out about the pregnancy, it was too late for her to have an abortion.  </span></p>

Her actions pre-birth were also consistent with that belief.  They invite the Court to grant them declaratory relief to relieve them from assessing or considering placement with the maternal family.  All parties agree that the declaratory relief should be granted.  There is no effective challenge to the mother&#8217;s account on that risk.  I agree.</span></p>

The Local Authority in light of the risks raised had issued proceedings, as the mother was then not only refusing to register the birth, but also did not want to appear on the birth certificate at all.  The Local Authority felt that she needed protection.  The Local Authority now accept that they could have applied to complete the birth registration pursuant to declaratory proceedings.  In any event, care proceedings now no longer fit the bill, and the risks do not require ongoing care proceedings.  They therefore invite the Court to grant them permission to withdraw the application for a care order.  That is agreed by the mother and the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  I also agree.</span></p>

In my judgement it does not.  In the vast majority of cases where Article 37b is engaged the Court will have no difficulty or face any impediment in complying with the terms of the Vienna Convention.  In giving the requisite notification to the foreign authority.  There will be rare cases, such as the circumstances of this case, where it would be wholly inimical to the welfare best interests of the child to give the requisite notice to the foreign authority.  The Vienna Convention is not enshrined in our domestic law.  The terms of the Convention should ordinarily be complied with, but where to do so would be contrary to the welfare best interests of the child concerned, I am satisfied that the Court may conclude it would not be appropriate to give the requisite notification.&#8221;</span></p>

Her case is that she does not want the Local Authority to communicate with the father any further.  She has hitherto refused to provide any contact details for the father.  Her case is that she has been trapped in a nightmare since discovering her pregnancy.  She has sought to do the best for the child, whilst fearing for her life.  The line should be drawn and no steps should be taken to notify or contact the father.  Only the mother holds parental responsibility.  There is no existing family life between the child and the father.  The father has taken no steps in furtherance of establishing a relationship and therefore has not acquired rights under Article 8.  There is no evidence that the father has any interest in him or his family establishing any relationship with the child.  Whilst the father continued to be in contact with the mother during the pregnancy and was at the birth, the mutual intention communicated to the social worker at birth was that the child be adopted.  </span></p>

So far as I know, it has not previously been suggested, nor judicially determined that that confidentiality of the mother cannot be respected and maintained.  If it is now to be eroded, there is in my judgement, a real risk that more pregnant women would seek abortions or give birth secretly, to the risk of both themselves and their babies.  There is, in my judgement, a strong social need, if it is lawful, to continue to enable some mothers, such as this mother, to make discreet, dignified and humane arrangements for the birth and subsequent adoption of their babies without their families knowing anything about it, if the mother for good reason so wishes.&#8217;</span></p>

We take a different view, but for all I can know, she may conscientiously believe that it is not in her daughter&#8217;s interest to know anything of her father, and who is to say that she might not be right.  But what am I to do?  The mother has told me herself in court, not in the witness box on oath, but from the well of the court that there is nothing more she can tell us.  There is no reason to believe that she would say anything different were she to be required to go into the witness box and either take the oath or affirm.  It would be na&#239;ve to imagine that someone, who on this hypothesis, is prepared to lie when addressing a judge direct, is suddenly going to volunteer the truth, merely because she has been put on her oath.  And is it to be suggested if she maintains her denial, that she should then be cross-examined, and if so, with what degree of vigour so that the truth can be extracted from her?  I confess that I find the idea very disturbing.  There is something deeply unattractive and unsettling in the idea that a women in the mother&#8217;s position should be cross-examined in order to compel her to reveal the name of her child&#8217;s father.  And there is something deeply unattractive and unsettling in the idea that a women in the mother&#8217;s position should be cross-examined as on this hypothesis, would almost inevitably be the case, for how else is cross-examination likely to elicit the relevant information as to the nature, extent and duration of her relationship with the father.  In relation to matters as personal and intimate as this, we should be wary of seeking to open windows into people&#8217;s souls.  And would it, in any event, be right to subject the mother to prime cross-examination on the probably dubious, double hypothesis that she is, at present, not telling the truth, but that if cross-examined, the truth will out.  And in any event, where would cross-examination get us?  It is possible that the mother would in fact make further disclosures, though I rather doubt it.  Suppose, as I think much more likely that she makes no further disclosures of any significance.  I might for all I know, be left with a powerful impression that she was not telling the truth.  But that of itself, would get us nowhere.  Contempt could not be proved unless I was satisfied to the criminal standard, satisfied so that I was sure, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the mother was telling lies.  An unlikely outcome.  And suppose that I was satisfied to the criminal standard that she was telling lies, could it seriously be suggested that she should be punished, even sent to prison, surely not?  Punishment would surely be unthinkable.  The whole process smacks too much of the inquisition to be tolerable, and it is not to be justified merely because we believe, however strongly, that what we are doing is being done in the best interests of the child.  </span></p>

He accused the mother of deliberately stalling, as he could not understand, based on the conversation he had had with the social work manager in December 2023, what the issue was.  It was clear that he no longer trusted what the mother said and accused her of either wanting him to fly back, so they could be together, or of wanting to get something from the government linked to immigration.  When she did not travel to Pakistan in October 2023, he had told her that she was now on her own in the pregnancy and that if she came after his family, he would come after hers.

Notification of any family members, be they maternal or paternal, as far as the mother is concerned the nature of the risk is as serious as it could be.  The magnitude of the risk is more difficult to judge as none of the extended family members, maternal or paternal, and the father have not been engaged upon that issue to allow assessment.  It is however, based in genuine fear.  In those circumstances the risks are too great, in my judgement, to pursue investigation and assessment any further.</span></p>

The risk of honour-based violence and the impact on the mother&#8217;s physical, psychological and emotional welfare is accepted in this case by the Local Authority and in respect of the maternal family, by the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  Honour-based violence will always be at the higher end on the bracket of considerations under this heading in my judgment.  It is amongst the most serious of consequences.</span></p>

In cases where a mother declined to identify the father she may face persuasion if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced.  In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable and maternal relatives may also be identifiable.  The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement.  Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure.  In the modern world, secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child&#8217;s existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind.  </span></p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s case is that this has already been done in a more powerful way through a court order directing the mother to provide information.  She has not done so.

In most cases the importance of the issues means that the delay cannot be a predominant factor.  There may however be circumstances where a delay would have particularly damaging consequences for the mother of the child.  For example, it would undoubtedly need to be considered if it would lead to the withdrawal of the child&#8217;s established carers or to the loss of an especially suitable adoptive placement.  There is no evidence in this case that increased delay would have a significant effect on the child over and above the normal consequences of delay in achieving permanence for a child.  I do however make the point that we are already at the point of six months post-birth.  If the Court was to embark upon assessments of paternal members who may well be in Pakistan, then a further delay of several months at the least is one that could be expected.  There is no information as to how delay would impact the current foster to adopt placement.  </span></p>

However, for the reasons that I have given in my judgment, the Court should not stand the matter down and adjourn it with the request of the mother that she provides the telephone number for the father.  This has already been tried by a court order amongst other things.  The Court should be slow to indulge in an exercise of futility and whilst there is a superficial attraction to the suggestion that the Court should stand the matter down and request the mother to provide the telephone number, that is likely to be futile in my judgement.</span></p>
