At that time the parties had the luxury of being represented by well-known specialist family Queen&#8217;s Counsel.  The parties have now run out of money.  I mean no disrespect to Mr Rainer whatsoever in saying that; he has appeared on behalf of the husband with conspicuous skill.  Nor do I mean any disrespect to the wife, who represents herself.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband was born on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1945, so he is aged 72.  He is of Iranian origin, a Muslim, and I am told he holds a number of passports.  The wife was born on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 1968, so she is 49.  She is Irish.  She was born a Catholic.  She apparently converted to Islam for the purposes of the marriage but has never practised that religion.  The parties met in 1990 when the wife was about 21 and they quickly formed a relationship.  They moved to Sharjah in the UAE in 1991.  They married on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 1992 in Tehran.  The wife was then 23, the husband, double her age, was 46.  She was his fourth wife.  He was her first and only husband.  They have three children, all born in different parts of the UAE, aged between 24 and nearly 17. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties met through work and after a period as employees they set up their own businesses.  They enjoyed successful business careers working together.  The wife describes herself as very much a people person and worked on the marketing side of business.  The husband was more the businessman and financier.  Together they were a successful combination.  By 2009, the year with which I am particularly concerned, their business and property interests extended to Ireland, USA, Iran and UAE, and they had a good standard of living.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">They were apart for quite a significant part of their time, certainly from 2007 onwards, because the wife became based in San Francisco, where the children were in school, and the husband was spending most of his working time in Iran or the UAE.  But their leisure time was spent together in any of the jurisdictions that I have mentioned.  They were to all outward appearances a happy and successful couple despite the amount of time that they spent apart because of the husband&#8217;s business needs and the children&#8217;s schooling.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of 2009 there began discussions about moving the children from America to London.  I find that the husband was particularly keen on that because it meant a ten hour flight from Dubai rather than a twenty hour flight and thus would have permitted the parties to spend more time together.  The husband says that the wife became more enthusiastic about the idea as time went on.  He puts that down to her other relationship.  But I think he is re-writing history in suggesting that the move came about, or was proposed, as a result of her, to use her word, &#8220;indiscretion&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Plans began to be made for the move.  The husband says that in or about spring 2009 he began to become suspicious that the wife was having an affair, and in July 2009 he instructed a private investigator.  That his suspicions were justified was confirmed by a report from the investigator dated 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2009.  At the time of its receipt the husband was in the UAE and the wife arrived there with the children very soon afterwards.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the meantime, the husband says that on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 2009, during an argument that he and the wife were having when in San Francisco, he picked up the telephone and rang his office in Dubai, and in the course of the conversation with the wife, overheard by other people in his office, he pronounced a talaq.  He says that call, heard by people in the UAE, satisfied the requirement of there being witnesses to the pronouncement of a talaq.  The wife denies there was any such call or discussion.  She says, yes, that from time to time he would threaten divorce when they argued but never meant it.  Nothing turns on this difference of recollection because, as I will come back to, the evidence provided by his witnesses to the Dubai court was not accepted by the court because it was conflicting.    </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn now to the crucial events of August 2009.  Armed with the report from the investigator the husband invited the wife&#8217;s brother, Patrick, to come to Dubai, which he did, arriving on or about 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August.  From the airport he was driven to a shopping mall by the husband&#8217;s driver and then in that very public place the husband revealed &#8211; and I will call him &#8220;Patrick&#8221; for ease of identification of who I am talking about &#8211; revealed to Patrick the evidence that he had of the wife&#8217;s adultery.  I heard Patrick give oral evidence, as well as having had the opportunity to read his written evidence, and I found him a wholly credible witness in all respects and I take what happened from his evidence.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband told Patrick that he was very hurt but wanted to continue with the marriage and wanted the wife to own up so that the healing process, as it was described, could start.  He wanted them to remain together.  Thus, Patrick was given the unenviable task by the husband of explaining to the wife that the husband had evidence to support his suspicion.  The wife duly owned up that she had a brief relationship with another man.  The husband was, understandably, very upset.  Patrick explained to the court how the husband was at times very verbally abusive to the wife, how he pushed her around and called her by vulgar names.  Having seen subsequent e-mails that he wrote I have no doubt that that is what he did to her.  On at least one occasion Patrick saw the husband pull the wife by her hair.  Yet, says Patrick, the husband always said that he did not want a divorce or legal process.  Patrick said that on occasions he would put himself between the parties to try to intervene and calm the husband down.  </p>

I would like to have full control over all aspects of the agreement, such as expenses, children living arrangements, their schooling etc., i.e. anything that she does henceforth has to be approved by me.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">On or about 18th August Patrick left Dubai as the parties were going to Tehran the next day for a few days.  Going to Tehran was something that they did quite frequently to deal with business affairs.  The parties had a major business in cold storage there and they had hit a significant problem with a fraud perpetrated by employees.  Patrick told me that prior to his departure there had been no talk at all of either divorce or financial settlement.  The parties were in Iran from about 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August to about 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>August.</p>

At some stage, it is not clear when from the documents, the husband&#8217;s lawyers had sent him a draft financial settlement.  On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August there were a number of important communications, and as this is the crucial day with which I am concerned on this aspect of the case, I will deal with it in some detail.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">At 11.52 a.m. a draft Power of Attorney for the wife to sign was sent by the solicitors to the husband&#8217;s PA.  The Power of Attorney which they had sent was in the widest possible terms, giving the attorney the power to do virtually anything that he wished.   There is no suggestion that the attorney was anyone in whom the wife had had any choice or say in selecting.  The Power of Attorney appears in my bundle at C9.  It is a document in Arabic, a language which the wife does not read or write.  At 12.15 they sent a revised divorce agreement, by which I think they mean a financial settlement.  </p>

At 2.46 p.m. the solicitors e-mailed back to say that Mohamed Hameed agreed to add the points to the agreement.  At some stage, presumably, but there is no e-mail referring to to it, that amended agreement was provided to the husband.

She did not seriously challenge in evidence that they were her signature, although had previously suggested that they could be forgeries.  The husband says that the contents of the Settlement Agreement were discussed between the parties and hammered out over a ten day period between 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August.  I do not accept that evidence.

Secondly, the husband was still re-writing the agreement as late as 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>.  Thirdly, I do not accept that the husband was between 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> expecting to divorce.  Indeed, it is the opposite of what he was saying to Patrick.  </p>

The wife was packing to go back to London that evening with the younger two children.  Although the documents refer to her leaving on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August it plainly must have been 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, as I think the parties now agree, because by the morning of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> they were at the Marriott Hotel Maida Vale, and there is a bill for breakfast.  Therefore, she must have left on the evening flight on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August.  Amidst the packing up and the welter of high emotion which existed in the household the husband presented the wife, as I find, with the Power of Attorney to sign in a language she did not comprehend and of which she was given no explanation, and a Settlement Agreement.  She was given no opportunity to take advice and, as I have already mentioned &#8211; if I deal separately with the Power of Attorney and the Settlement Agreement &#8211; she was given no explanation of the Power of Attorney.</p>

I accept that if she had been given such opportunity she would have been very reluctant to sign it.  Some of its clauses are draconian.  In particular in relation to the children, they were to remain in the custody and guardianship of their father irrespective of their place of residence and schooling, which was to be determined in the sole discretion of the husband.  There were severe restrictions on the wife&#8217;s conduct of her house, which included no entertainment beyond 10 p.m., certain people not under any circumstances being allowed within the premises, restricting the amount of time that she was allowed to employ a babysitter, and the instances in which she was allowed to go out to a restaurant.  It added that the children could only travel with her with the knowledge and approval of their father, and that the place of residence of the children and the place of education will be in the final decision of their father alone.  </p>

There was a schedule of liabilities that were attached but there appears to have been no specific value attributed to any of the assets.  There did not appear to have been any supporting documents in relation to any of the assets, and there was no opportunity to invite any questions.  In brief, it was an agreement which the wife was asked to sign in the absence of disclosure.  I accept her evidence that if she had understood it and had the opportunity to study it she would not have signed it.  I will revert to the Settlement Agreement later when I consider the question of notice because it makes a reference to divorce which I need to come back to.  </p>

His conduct in these proceedings has been most unfortunate, to put it mildly.  He has completely failed to engage and has declined and failed to answer the questions that were put to him by the court pursuant to the order of Mr Justice Peter Jackson (as he then was).  That order was made in September.  Before then the wife&#8217;s lawyers had been persistently trying to set up a meeting with him from late 2016.  Their file shows that he was completely evasive, either ignoring e-mails that were sent to him or deliberately saying that he was available only on dates that they had told him that they were not available on.  However, they did manage to get to see him on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017.  </p>

That came about because the wife told me that she had heard a voice recording at the offices of DWFM Beckman, at the time that they were instructed by the wife, when the attorney admitted that he had never met or communicated with the wife.  The solicitors had ceased acting and exercised a lien for their fees but I felt I could not do proper justice to this aspect of the case with that piece of evidence, and it is to their credit that they provided it so speedily.  Their evidence confirms that what the wife said was true.  </p>

His only explanation was that he had moved offices and his computer files had been corrupted.  Mrs Moussaoui asked to see file creation files for clients during this period, but he did not have one for the wife.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject the submission for the following reasons.  One, it does not follow that if the wife did get leave under Part III, as she almost certainly would whether or not the husband agreed, that the relief she obtained would be the same as she would obtain under a financial remedy application under the Matrimonial Causes Act.  Thus, her interests are not protected.  Secondly, even if the husband did agree to the granting of permission she would still have to fight the case against the background of the husband saying that there had been a valid divorce in 2009 and that weight should be given to the agreement that was made at that time.  Thirdly, I think that he is taking out of context that passage of the authority.  Even if the financial claims were to be identical that does not seem to me to release the court from its duty to consider the statutory criteria.  If there has not been notice, and there has not been ability to participate, as I find, the court should not abdicate its duty to say that it will not recognise the divorce.  Fourthly, I find there may be a difference in a variety of ways, which one can envisage, as to whether the wife was divorced in 2009 and 2017.       </p>

Plainly, an act of sexual intercourse will be the most obvious example of intent, but it is not a pre-requisite.  Mr Edge told me that there has to be some form of intimacy, however that word is defined, within the ninety day period.  It could be evidenced by the sharing of a bedroom, pretending to the world, or displaying to the world, that they were still married.  All the matters which evidence the intent to continue the matrimonial partnership have to be taken into account.  It is, thus, a wide-ranging examination.  The husband says that if a decree is to be revoked on this basis it can only be properly revoked if the wife is given notice of its revocation and it is recorded within three months.  I will revert to this argument in a moment.   </p>

From 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September to 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November she was in a rented apartment at Fraser Suites, Stanhope Gardens, and from 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November in a further rented apartment in Kensington Court Gardens, where she was for, I think, at least a couple of years.  Both rented apartments were two bedroomed apartments with reception areas, which had been rented through the husband in the names of both parties as the tenants.   Living there was the wife and the two children, and from time to time the husband.  According to the timeline that I have been given it appears that the parties were together in London between 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, in San Francisco seeing the eldest child between 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October and 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, back in London between 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, and together for at least some of the time between 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, when the parties were recorded as being in London but also for a few days in Rome.

She worked for an hour a day at the Fraser apartments, sometimes doing an extra hour at 5.30 p.m., when her worked stopped, and in the second flat between 6.00 p.m. and 9.00 p.m.  Her oral evidence was not as clear or as definite as her written statement was.  In particular, she withdrew from her written statement that when the wife was there and the husband was not the wife would sleep in in the mornings, five days a week, and that Paulina would get the children up, give them breakfast, and get them off to school.  That evidence seemed to me to be fairly implausible, and indeed she accepted that it was incorrect and that it was the wife who got the children to school, Paulina&#8217;s job being to help get the breakfast ready.  I do not think that this was a deliberate lie, as the wife argues.

To the outside world they appeared as a couple as they were before.  Hotel bookings continued to be made by the husband&#8217;s PA describing them as husband and wife.  Financial transactions continued as they had been before.  Loans were taken out on an American property in 2012, and again later, in joint names as husband and wife.  They even had a meeting, I think in 2010, although I was given no precise date of it, with the Vice-President of Iran in which the husband presented the wife as his wife.  The wife did everything she could to help the husband try to sort out the difficult financial situation that had arisen with the Iranian cold storage business.  All of this is inconsistent with what the husband says was their new divorced status.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband even told me that in 2010 he transferred 70% of their main asset, the Tehran cold storage business, into her name, albeit as trustee for the children.  She denies that these assets ever belonged to the children.  But why would he do that, I ask, if this was a wife whose claims had already been dealt with in a financial settlement?  I should say that a document subsequently prepared from the husband&#8217;s office says that the transfer of shares took place in March 2014.  Whether it is 2010 or 2014 does not seem to me to make a material difference.    </p>

First, and most obviously, if all this happened why did the husband get a divorce?  Why did he have the wife sign the financial settlement document, albeit, it needs to be said, that it was in significant part never implemented.  Thirdly, why did he obtain a different sort of separation agreement, which I have not yet referred to, which appears at p.292-3 of the bundle?  </p>

It is a document which gives the wife no rights to anything whatsoever.  Custodianship of the children is given to their father.  She has no claim in respect of dowry or of alimony.  It gives her absolutely nothing at all.  It is not consistent with the Settlement Agreement. The husband said that it was meant to apply to Iranian assets only but there is no such restriction on its face.  It is signed by the wife but it is in Persian, which the wife can speak but cannot read.  If anything, it just seems to me to be further evidence that she signed whatever he put in front of her.  </p>

I think that these documents, that is the divorce, the financial settlement, and the Iranian document, were all obtained in or about August 2009 without the knowledge or understanding of the wife for the husband to keep in reserve if matters went wrong.  I think he wanted to save the marriage but he wanted to have a parachute with which to bail out if things went wrong.  </p>

It is seen in a series of documents from 2012 when the husband transferred his share in the jointly owned Irish property to the wife, as he said he would under the Settlement Agreement, bringing with it a tax liability of about &#8364;40,000.  I cannot provide an explanation of that, but it does not sit happily with the other documents and transactions to which I have already referred.  It is an anomaly.  I give it weight and I put it into the balance.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">By way of completeness of my review of the evidence I should add that the parties remained on largely good terms and presented as a couple until early 2016.  At that time they had major disagreements about matters that I need not go into, save to say that part of the husband&#8217;s anger was his belief that the wife had formed a relationship with another man.  The husband has written a large number of electronic messages to the wife, some of which I have read, which are of the most appalling abuse.  They certainly demonstrate a domineering and haranguing nature when roused.  For these purposes, though, what is striking about them is not only his anger that she had allegedly formed another relationship, which if divorced she would be perfectly entitled to do, but also his very frequent references in those documents to the fact that they should get a divorce.  He says that he only wrote that to emphasise that if she thought they were still married then they should get a divorce.  But it is very striking that not once in these electronic documents does he say &#8220;we are already divorced&#8221;.      </p>

Sharing a bed would in my view fall on the former side of the line as to presumption that conjugal relations would occur would apply.&#8221;              </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have found as a fact that certainly towards the latter part of the three month period there was an intention on their part, and it may be for the whole of that period, to continue or return to the marital state, evidenced principally by their life continuing virtually as it was before the events of late August and September 2009.   In the light of my findings as to notice and participation, I do not have to make any findings on whether or not there had been sexual relations or seclusion in that three month period.  I find it difficult to say when sexual relations took place but I am entirely confident that it was long before 2015, the date given by the husband.  I am further satisfied that they did share a bed for at least some of the relevant period thus satisfying the condition to prove intent and further that all the other indications show the intention to continue/return to the marital state.  </p>

First, it seems to me to be utterly illogical for me to rule that the wife would have to be given notice of revocation of a divorce of which she was completely unaware.  I agree with Mr Edge that to make the recording of the revocation a mandatory pre-condition to its existence would be similarly illogical.  As he says at C39: </p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In my view, logically this cannot be the case as there must be cases where the parties simply resume family and marital life without referring back to the court during the Idda.  (That is the three month period).  Furthermore, the EM (which is the explanatory memorandum to the personal status law) makes it clear that the new process was instituted to aid the wife and so was meant as an additional measure not an exclusive one, and this accords best with the provisions of the PSL and traditional law.  The requirement for its recording is evidential rather than mandatory.  Thus, if a revocation is recorded it would be unnecessary for a court to undertake the sort of exercise that I have had to undertake.  But the fact that it has not been recorded does not mean that the marriage cannot be declared to have been revoked.&#8221;  </p>

First, the wife at a late stage of these proceedings has sought to persuade me that the Dubai court had no jurisdiction to grant a decree in the first instance because she says neither party was habitually resident in Dubai.  Mr Edge says the test in any event is for citizenship rather than habitually resident.  But she has raised this argument very late.  There is very little evidence.  The Dubai court were satisfied that it did have jurisdiction and I should not go behind that.  </p>

It has been obvious throughout this hearing that the parties have found it very difficult.  I have not found that either party has the monopoly of truth or virtue.  I am sure they both care deeply for their children, who have been so affected by these proceedings, and I urge them as strongly as I can to sit down and mediate their remaining differences so that they can cease this battle and the whole of the family can benefit.</p>
