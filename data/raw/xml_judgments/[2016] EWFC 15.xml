	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This is the final judgment in care proceedings concerning seven children. The background history is set out at length in my earlier judgment <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/60" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 60</ref>, delivered on 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> July 2015, and need not be repeated in any detail here. In short, the proceedings concern a Muslim family of South Asian origin. The mother is Pakistani but born in this country. The father was born in Kashmir and came to this country as a young man where he married the mother. Together they have nine children, eight of whom, seven boys and one girl, were originally the subject of these proceedings. I have anonymised their names for the purposes of these proceedings as follows &#8211; SB (a boy, now aged rising 17), SM (a boy, rising 15), AS (a boy, 13), AB (a boy, 11), AQ (a boy, 9), Z (a girl, rising 8), AH (a boy, rising 6), and AW (a boy, rising 5). At the time of the welfare hearing in February 2016, the mother was heavily pregnant and expecting her ninth child. In the period when this judgment was being prepared, she gave birth to her baby, a girl, (&#8220;M&#8221;) who is now the subject of further proceedings. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">As explained in my earlier judgment, until relatively recently the family was not known to social services. The children attended school and were variously described in complimentary terms as being delightful, polite and a credit to their parents. In May 2013, AS alleged that he had been beaten by his father with a stick. In January 2014, SB alleged that he was being physically assaulted by his father. A section 47 investigation concluded that the children should be supported as &#8220;children in need&#8221;. The report recorded that the parents were finding the children&#8217;s behaviour challenging, said that they did not want to use physical chastisement, and accepted that they needed support in particular with SB because he was &#8216;pushing boundaries&#8217;. When more allegations of physical abuse emerged, further investigations were carried out by social services and the police, and in May 2014  the local authority started care proceedings. All eight children were removed from the family home and placed in foster care, initially in three placements. The local authority carried out an extensive assessment of the family and, at the end of August, it was decided to rehabilitate the children with their parents in stages and to provide extensive support for the family. </span></p>

Further concerns emerged about sexualised behaviour demonstrated by some of the other children. It was decided that the children could not return home pending further investigations. Subsequently, Z was interviewed by the police and gave further details of the allegations of abuse perpetrated by SB, which included full penetration. SB himself was interviewed and emphatically denied the allegations. At the end of November 2014, Z alleged that she had been sexually abused by SM. She reiterated these allegations in a further police interview. SM was also interviewed but denied the allegations. SB and SM were subsequently charged with sexual offences arising out of Z&#8217;s allegations. </span></p>

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:2in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;The fact that Z was sexually abused by two older brothers in the family home in my view is clear evidence of failure to protect. The parents plainly ought to have exercised much greater vigilance. Much is made of the small size of the family home. In such circumstances, a reasonable parent would have been aware that such abuse was taking place or at risk of taking placed and taken steps to prevent it. Furthermore in the mother&#8217;s case, I find that she knew that Z had blood on her knickers. That ought to have alerted her to the possibility that the child was being abused. Yet she failed to take any action. In my view the evidence is insufficient to lead the court to reach the conclusion sought by the local authority that these parents knew that their daughter was being sexually abused. On balance, however, I find that they ought to have known and ought to have taken steps to stop it happening. To that extent, I conclude that they have failed to protect their daughter from abuse.&#8221;</span></p>

First, the threshold criteria required under section 31 are plainly satisfied. Secondly, there must be a further series of comprehensive assessments to determine what further steps need to be taken to protect the children. It may be that in the course of those assessments further information may emerge which will shed light on exactly what has happened in this family. Thirdly, for the time being the children must remain placed away from their family. Like the guardian, I am extremely concerned about the history of successive placements which all these children have endured. This court will now scrutinise rigorously all future plans about the children to ensure that the placements meet their specific needs&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">&#8230; the parents were unsatisfactory witnesses. I take into account their circumstances and their cultural background. I recognise that answering questions in court, especially on such sensitive matters about the treatment of their own children, must have been a difficult experience for them. Nonetheless, I found both parents to be evasive and unreliable witnesses. In closing submissions, Miss Cook [leading counsel for the local authority] characterized their attitude at times like &#8216;almost a blind and irrational denial&#8217;. In each case, I conclude that, for one reason or another, the parents are concealing information, both to the allegations of physical abuse and over-chastisement and the allegations concerning sexual behaviour within the home. The mother retreated into saying that the allegations were not possible and that, as she did not see it, so it could not have happened. She also reiterated on several occasions that she had told the children &#8216;boys don&#8217;t touch girls&#8217; bits and girls don&#8217;t touch boys&#8217; bits&#8217;. </p>

He alleged that they had been encouraged to make the allegations by the social worker and Mrs X. At one point, he suggested that the social worker and SB&#8217;s girlfriend, were related, apparently simply on the basis that the share the same (very common) surname. He seemed to find it difficult to acknowledge that the older children would have the capacity to think independently. The father alleged that social services had manipulated the thoughts of all the children, older and younger. Asked why SB was saying what he was saying, the father said that it was because he was still a child. As for the sexual allegations, the father&#8217;s explanation in oral evidence was that they had been concocted by Mrs X and the social worker SC. Mrs X had for some reason unclear to me sought revenge against SB. The social worker SC had, according to the father, been against him from the start, and had therefore fabricated the allegations. He said that the social worker had told the foster carers to lie about what had been said to the children. He said SC had done these things to make money and because she enjoys it. &#8230;&#8221;</p>

At that hearing, the parents applied for a global assessment to be carried out by Phoenix Forensic Consultants Ltd. The court already had therapeutic needs assessment reports on all seven children carried out by BRS, a specialist multi-agency child and adolescent mental health service, whose assessors included a therapeutic social worker and a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist. The parents had been asked to take part in the assessments (which were completed between February and May 2015) but had declined to do so. It is their case before me that they took this course having taken legal advice. I decided that the proposed assessment from Phoenix was necessary and gave permission for it to be commissioned. I gave further directions in preparation for a final welfare hearing in February 2016, to include final assessments and care plans by the local authority, statements by the parents and SM, and reports by the two guardians, one representing SM and the other representing the six other children.

I also had a short informal meeting with SM in the presence of his counsel. In the course of the evidence, it emerged that the current foster carers of AH and AW had spoken of the possibility of offering them a long-term home.

The local authority has also agreed to consider arranging for some of this parental contact to take place in the area close to the family home, in accordance with SM&#8217;s wishes.

Mr Josty submits that, although he does not accept the findings, the priority he gives to his younger siblings&#8217; welfare demonstrates a degree of insight into the overall situation. In Mr Josty&#8217;s words, however, he craves a home life and asks the local authority and the court to consider a foster placement as an alternative to his current placement in the residential unit. In her evidence, the social worker SC accepted that the local authority had not considered long term foster care for SM. Mr Josty contends that this is a significant gap in the local authority&#8217;s case and that, as a result, the court cannot conclude that the care plan represents the best option for SM. </span></p>

The parents have demonstrated a commitment to contact and provide an important ongoing link with SM&#8217;s life in his home community and with his family and cultural background. In respect of sibling contact, Mr Josty, on behalf of SM, roundly criticizes the local authority for failing to focus on the need to arrange and facilitate contact for SM with his brothers on a regular basis. Mr Josty therefore urges the court to make a contact order to ensure that future sibling contact takes place in accordance with the plan. Mr Josty submits that this omission on the part of the local authority has only exacerbated the problems arising from his sense of separation and isolation from the family and his disruptive experiences in foster care. Mr Josty is similarly critical of the local authority for failing to ensure that SM gets back into mainstream education as quickly as possible. Given these deficiencies, Mr Josty submits that there is considerable cause for concern as to whether the local authority will conduct future reviews into SM&#8217;s situation with the degree of thoroughness and care that he plainly requires. Mr Josty therefore submits that, in the event the court approves the broad scheme of the local authority plan for SM to stay in the current residential unit, it should require the local authority to amend its care plan so as to provide for definition of the process of review of the placement and the adequacy of the contact with parents and siblings, clarity as to who will be involved in contributing towards the review process and confirmation that in the event of a change of independent review officer, the parents and SM will be notified of the name of the new officer within a defined period of time.</span></p>

She agreed that he was more settled at his current placement that he had been elsewhere, that it was a good place for him to be and that she therefore did not oppose the care plan, although she was not happy with the level of contact being proposed.

His experiences in care since being removed from the family home in May 2014 have been just as disrupted and unsettling as those suffered by his older brothers. He has moved foster home no few than 8 times. On more than one occasion, he has absconded and returned to the family home. His latest move took place in January 2016 when he returned to a foster carer with whom he had lived for a period some months earlier. He has appeared to be more settled in this placement, although very recently there has been concerns that he has started absconding again. His education has also been disrupted. He has attended three schools, with episodes of exclusion, absconding and refusal to attend. Since September 2015, however, he has attended one school where he appears to have settled.</span></p>

Their report provides some insight into his needs, although the authors of the report warn that the findings were limited as a result of the lack of opportunity to build a therapeutic relationship with him. In addition, the assessor&#8217;s work was impeded by the parents&#8217; refusal to meet the staff. At one point prior to the fact-finding, the father told them that the children did not have any problems and did not need more assessments.</span></p>

Plainly, this presents a matter of enormous significance to any person, particularly a young person of his age and cultural background. It has been reported that he has formed a relationship with a older boy and has demonstrated some risk-taking behaviours. He has reported feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts and has claimed to have experimented with drugs and alcohol. The BRS assessors described him as a child who feels very much alone in the world and whose behaviours suggest that he is not at all secure. They suggested that his risk-taking behaviour with the older boy was driven by a need to be loved and accepted. AS has discussed with some of his carers his experiences at home and has alluded to &#8220;horrible things&#8221; that happened there, although he has refused to give any details. He has also made some acknowledgements to the assessors of his own behaviour towards another child in one of his foster homes (which was a matter considered in the fact-finding hearing but in respect of which no findings were made) but was unable to discuss this in any detail. </span></p>

They also advised that he needs therapeutic assessments for his emotional well being and sexually inappropriate behaviour, in respect of which, as set out above, he has made a very limited acknowledgement. It was observed during contact that his siblings appeared to be at ease in his presence, valuing interaction and play with him. The three younger children &#8211; Z, AH and AW &#8211; all reflected positive thoughts and protective themes around his role and relationship to them. The assessors concluded that &#8220;all of the children would benefit from consistent contact with their other siblings which should be managed on an informal basis by their care givers who have a good understanding of each child&#8217;s global needs and are able to support the children in building positive sibling relationships&#8221;. The assessors also concluded that, when the children are settled in their permanent placements, sibling family therapy should take place to support them in developing a health group narrative and an understanding of theirs and each others&#8217; experiences.</span></p>

Because of concern about his possibly sexually deviant behaviour towards another child in an earlier foster home, (which, I stress, has not been the subject of any finding by this court but about which he has made some limited acknowledgement), it is thought likely that he would need to be placed on his own or with older children who do not have such complex needs.

His sexuality is an important part of who he is and this does not fit with the ideas of his parents. He is negatively affected by the expectations they put on him.

The guardian notes that, as he does not openly express his feelings, it can be difficult to understand and engage his thinking or the impact his experiences have had on him. She adds, however, that AB is insightful and understanding of the issues  being considered in court. Although he would like to return home, he was able to recognise the concerns held by professionals.

Children like AQ need support in learning to regulate their emotion from an attuned and sensitive care giver to allow them to develop these skills. They conclude that it is clear that AQ&#8217;s needs are high and a skilled carer will need support in managing him. This would, they advised, be more easily met in a placement without any other children, at least in the short term. The frequency of contact with his parents needs to be considered as he seems to be avoiding these times by refusing to get in the taxi, and his behaviour has seemed to be variable in contact.

The guardian&#8217;s conclusion is that the parents are unable to provide her with this and any plan for her to return home without this insight and protection from her parents would be extremely damaging to her. The guardian observes that Z remains confused about her feelings in respect of her parents. She clearly loves them but she does wish for them to change. She has remained consistent in respect of her home life experience and the guardian says that it was sad to hear her say that her happiest memory has been going into foster care.</span></p>

In the event, the current carers have now decided that they can not continue to care for the boys, and the local authority care plan is for adoption.

He also frequently comments on others behaviour and the assessor suggests that this could indicate anxiety about the consequences of negative behaviour. According to their foster carer, there has been some evidence of sexualised behaviour from AH towards AW. AW complained that AH had &#8220;touched his bits&#8221;. AH had not denied that this had occurred. AH has expressed a wish to be with his parents, but the BRS assessors detected no sense of a genuine emotional connection with his parents or a desire to be close to them. In respect of AW, the assessors interpreted the contact sheets as showing that AW felt closer to his mother than to his father. They have also detected evidence of feelings of anxiety about their parents in both little boys. On one occasion, when the mother told them that they would be returning home soon, both boys needed to go to the toilet. Subsequently, AW has expressed that living where he is now is &#8220;all good different&#8221; compared to when living at home with his family. The assessors identified a sense that AH has settled in his foster placement and is enjoying the new stimulating opportunities available to him and as time progresses has become further detached from his parents. AW has observed to become more settled both at school and at home with his carer. The assessors conclude that, in a stable, safe and boundaried environment, AW feels settled and is able to positively engage with those around him. Initially both boys struggled to follow the boundaries that were put in place by the foster carers, but over time there has been significant change in this respect.</span></p>

In the case of a very young child, whose concept of faith is undeveloped, his religious persuasion is necessarily that of his parents. If their religion changes, so will his. As he grows older, however, he will inevitably, to use the local authority's phrase in this case, "make his own choice", irrespective of his parents' wishes and feelings. Some children follow their parent's faith throughout their lives, others do not. There is nothing a parent can lawfully do to force a child to believe anything. Once he is developmentally of an age to make a choice, the choice is his. In such circumstances, it would be absurd to impugn a local authority for failing to sustain the religious persuasion of a child who had decided for himself that he did not wish to follow his parent's faith. </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I therefore conclude that the subtle and careful language used in section 33(6)(a) requires an equally subtle and careful interpretation, rather than the inflexible, and in my view unworkable, interpretation for which the father contends. When a young child is made the subject of a care order, the local authority is under a duty to ensure that he is not brought up in any different religious persuasion from that followed by his parents prior to the care order. If the local authority breaches that duty, it will be exceeding the limitation imposed on its exercise of parental responsibility by section 33(6)(a) and, in appropriate circumstances, the parents may apply for judicial review or seek injunctive relief for breach of statutory duty or under the Human Rights Act. Furthermore, so far as possible, the local authority must ensure that the child is bought up with a full appreciation and understanding of his religious heritage and background. If his parents subsequently change their religion, the local authority must have regard to that fact. In my judgment, however, it is not obliged, nor indeed permitted, to take any steps that would be contrary to his overall welfare. Equally, if one parent, but not the other, converts to a different religion, the local authority must have regard to that fact, particularly perhaps if the parent returns to a former religion previously practised within the extended family which constitutes a significant aspect of the child's heritage, but again the local authority is not obliged nor allowed to take any steps that would be contrary to his overall welfare. And as the child develops and makes his own choices, the local authority must respect his personal autonomy and freedom of conscience, provided again that by doing so it is safeguarding his welfare. </p>

I do not underestimate the challenges which this case has created for the local authority. Finding and maintaining separate foster placements for these children has been very difficult, and it is perhaps unsurprising that in doing so the authority has not been able at all times to meet the religious and cultural needs of the children. I am satisfied that the social worker was aware of these needs and of the importance of meeting them, but equally I am satisfied that this factor has at times been lost sight of amidst the overall problems thrown up by this case. As my judgment in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re A and D</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> demonstrates, the approach to a child&#8217;s religion and culture requires sensitive handling and analysis, particularly as the child grows older and starts to think independently. There is a danger, in our increasingly secular society, that those responsible for looking after children in care &#8211; both foster carers and social workers &#8211; will not truly appreciate the importance of a child&#8217;s religion and culture. If possible, children should be placed in foster placements that are culturally appropriate. In the case of Muslim children, they should where possible be placed with Muslim carers, and furthermore with either Sunni or Shia carers in accordance with their own background. Manifestly it will not always be possible to achieve a placement that meets these requirements alongside the other welfare needs of the child. In those circumstances, the local authority must devote particular attention to how the child&#8217;s religious and cultural needs will be met, in terms of religious observances, education and lifestyle, including diet.</span></p>

The outcome is set out fully in the report. It was concluded that most of the risk factors were not present in the father&#8217;s case. There were sufficient concerns about him based on past behaviour to indicate that he is at raised risk of reacting in a violent way with his children. This was, however, set against the absence of any other real predictive indicators. The authors of the report commented that he possessed many skills that would lead him away from violence if he was given some educative and therapeutic work now.  Assessment of the risk factors associated with sexual abuse concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that he would act in a sexually harmful way towards the children. Psychometric testing identified some signs of narcisstic and paranoid personality traits, although not at a level to amount to a disorder. The authors of the report observe that it is at times of stress that personality characteristics present at their most extreme. </span></p>

She described her mother as &#8220;brilliant, one of the best you could have&#8221;, and said that she never chastised her and her siblings. The authors of the report comment that, if it was right that the mother&#8217;s parents did not use corporeal punishment, one might have expected that the mother would have learnt significant skills of negotiation and discussion with her children. The mother reported no experiences of bullying or negativity. Mr. Lowe commented that such a person faced with extreme difficulties does not have the coping skills necessary to manage. The mother recognised that her children were growing up in a different environment and there were increased pressures on her and her husband to respond in ways that neither of them experienced. </span></p>

She also accepted that she had used levels of physical punishment that were inappropriate, although she did not accept all of the findings on this issue. Mr. Lowe and Ms Tunbridge doubted whether in the current proceedings either parent would be able to publicly accept the level of physical abuse that took place within the family. What they are able to do &#8211; separately from each other &#8211; is accept that the father&#8217;s behaviour had been excessive in a set of situations, in particular with the older boys, which they had no real understanding of how to manage. Mr. Lowe and Ms Tunbridge regard this recognition as a starting point potentially for therapeutic involvement with the family.  </span></p>

They would need to give a clear commitment to the work. They need to undergo a parenting course (which in their supplemental report they described as a typical local authority course involving 12 weekly meetings of 2 hours&#8217; duration) and engage in some educative work about sexual abuse in families, how to recognise it and deal with it. They advised that the father also needs to engage in some stress and anger management treatment, which in their supplemental report they said should be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy. Mr. Lowe and Ms Tunbridge concluded that the prognosis was good. As to timescales, they indicated in their report that, if Phoenix were to do the work, it could be completed in 6 to 8 weeks and should start one week before the children returned home. As to the children&#8217;s sexualised behaviour, they commented that it is necessary to work with the two older boys intensively. Any intervention would need to be driven by the needs of the individual children which would require a thorough assessment of each child. In answer to supplemental questions after production of their report, they said that any return home by SM would need to be managed, with a risk assessment carried out after he has completed the intervention work. </span></p>

It is possible to hold both of these things at one time and for them to be in conflict and unresolved. The intervention that he was proposing would establish whether the father was capable of changing his thinking so as to ensure that the children were safe.

He agreed that what was required was not just an acceptance of the findings but also acceptance of responsibility for what has happened. As for the mother&#8217;s statements to him about Z&#8217;s allegations, he did not accept that there was ambiguity. He believed that she was acknowledging that something had happened to Z. Cross-examined by Miss Davis on behalf of the younger children&#8217;s guardian, he agreed that both parents struggle to see things from the children&#8217;s point of view. He thought that, with regard to the impact of the offences on the children, the parents&#8217; attitude had shifted, but accepted that there was a risk that if Z returned home, she would come under pressure to retract her allegations to &#8220;save the family&#8221;.

I have already referred to the father&#8217;s lengthy assertion at the hearing in October 2015 of the reason why he did not accept the findings. In their written statements filed after the Phoenix report was filed and immediately before the final hearing, there was a slight shift in attitude. In her statement, the mother asserted that she was willing to engage and would be fully committed to any work that would enable the children to return home. She said that she had acknowledged that sexual abuse &#8220;might have happened&#8221; and that she did not want there to be any future abuse in the family. She said that she has struggled and continues to struggle and come to terms with how and when it could have happened. She said that she truly believed that she and her husband had been totally written off as ever being able to care for the children, regardless of any commitment they may have to make changes to develop their understanding to allow the children to return home. She said that she wanted to draw a line under what she had believed or not believed in the past and move forward, She acknowledged that she had felt bitter towards Mrs. X in the past but now wished to simply focus on the children. The mother also wrote a handwritten letter to me which I have read carefully in which she said, amongst other things, that the children&#8217;s religious needs were not being respected in care, that since the findings had been made, it has put a lot of stress on her and her husband coming to terms with what has happened, and that they were not bad parents. She added: &#8220;I would like to say I accept your judgment and also my two boys being convicted.&#8221; </span></p>

He recognised that the court had considered all the evidence, and that a jury had found the older boys guilty beyond reasonable doubt. As a result he said that he had &#8220;to acknowledge that they are the decisions that have been made.&#8221; He said that he would welcome the opportunity to work with Mr. Lowe to ensure that the children are safe and learn more appropriate methods of chastisement. He also stated, however, that the attitude of the local authority towards him and his wife throughout the process has left it difficult for the social workers to carry out any work with them. He reiterated his criticisms of SC, asserting that she was prejudiced against him because they had registered a complaint against her. He set out various criticisms of the local authority&#8217;s management of the children in care, and of their failure to arrange parenting classes. He concluded by asserting that he and his wife were not a significant risk to the children, and claimed that the best thing that could happen to the children was for them to be &#8220;reunited to live at home and just experience normal family life living together as a family, going to school, and being part of the local community.&#8221;</span></p>

In her oral evidence, the mother said: &#8220;I do accept SB raped Z. It is really hard but I do accept it. I accept SM sexually abused Z.&#8221; This was, so far as I am aware, the first time that the mother had made such an express statement. It was clear to me listening to her evidence that it was a very difficult thing for her to say. When asked why she had not said this to the social worker conducting the pre-birth assessment in respect of the new baby, only a few weeks prior to the hearing, she said that it had been hard for her and she was trying to take it all in &#8211; &#8220;it&#8217;s not easy, so much has happened&#8221;. She also does not accept some of the details of the allegations, for example that she had seen blood in Z&#8217;s knickers. Cross-examined by Miss Davis on behalf of the children, she acknowledged that, at the time she told Mr. Lowe that she wanted to ask Z what had really happened to her, she did not know whether Z&#8217;s allegations were true or not. According to the guardian, the parents had said as recently as 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> January that they did not believe that Z had been sexually abused. When Miss Davis put this to her in evidence, the mother said that she did not think that she had said that to the guardian. She said that the father had now told her in the last few days that he accepted that Z had been sexually abused, but she was not sure if he still believed that SC had made Z make the allegations. She acknowledged that it is not normal for sexual activity to occur between children, or for children to exhibit sexualised behaviour, but said that she did not know how it had happened in her family and had not really thought about it.  She added that she had been saying that they needed to keep everybody out of it and deal with it themselves. Cross-examined by Miss Cook, she denied that either she or the father had ever used excessive force in chastising any of the children, including SB and SM, although in re-examination she acknowledged that physical abuse had occurred.  On the other hand, she said in evidence &#8211; apparently for the first time &#8211; that it was not all SC&#8217;s fault that the children were in care, but rather the fault of her and her husband. She continued to urge the court to allow the children to return home, although she agreed that it would not be practicable for all the children to be returned together, and therefore suggested that the younger children should come back first, to be followed by the order children at a later date. </span></p>

His reason for accepting this now was that he had read that Z had repeated her allegations to her new carer. Pressed further by Miss Cook, however, his position was not as clear, even allowing for the fact that he was giving evidence through an interpreter. Asked whether he accepted that SB had raped Z, he replied &#8220;yes, possible&#8221;. Asked why he had told Mr Lowe that Mrs. X had made Z make the allegations to get revenge, he said that she had said to him that she would get revenge on SB, but now he had independent information from the new carer. The father further said that SB had exaggerated the extent of his beatings and started confronting him when he had the support of his parents. Asked whether he still believed there had been a conspiracy involving social services, he said that he had changed his opinion to some level, meaning, as I understood it, &#8220;to some extent&#8221;.  Cross-examined by Miss Davis, he agreed that when he saw the guardian he was still saying that Z&#8217;s allegations were untrue. He said that Z had said that Mrs. X had beaten her and threatened to do so again, but now that Z had told her new carer, an independent person, that she had been abused, he had changed his mind about the truth of her allegations. Up to that point, he has believed that she was making the allegations under the influence of SC and Mrs. X. Pressed again as to whether he believed that Z had been sexually abused by her older brothers, there was a long pause before he replied yes. Later, he said that he did not accept that AQ had behaved in a sexualised way towards another child in the foster home, adding; &#8220;my children do not touch each other sexually&#8221;. When asked to explain the sexualised behaviour exhibited by AH to AW, he said that the foster carer&#8217;s account was not trustworthy and untrue, pointing to the fact that at the earlier hearing the court had made no findings about the earlier conversation between the two boys recorded on her IPad. Later, he referred to the widespread presence of sexual imagery in this country, and to the importance attached to sex in British society, and added: &#8220;if something happened [to my children] it happened because of these factors and not because of me. My children have been influenced by the society and I don&#8217;t know what they are being told to perform by the carers and the people they are with.&#8221;</span></p>

These assertions must be assessed, however, in the context of their earlier statements, both in writing and orally, and of their dealings with the social workers and other professionals, and having regard to the conclusions I drew about their evidence in my earlier judgment as quoted above, namely that they were evasive and unreliable witnesses who had concealed information from the court. In all these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the parents&#8217; limited acknowledgment in their oral evidence represents their true opinions and feelings. The father&#8217;s explanation for the reason why he has now, very late in the day, accepted Z&#8217;s allegations &#8211; mainly, that she repeated them to an &#8220;independent&#8221; person, namely her new carer &#8211; was totally unconvincing and implausible. It may be that at some level they recognise that, without acknowledging the truth of Z&#8217;s allegations, it is unlikely that they will be allowed to resume care of their children. That recognition in itself represents some progress, but only to a very limited degree. Both the mother and father are to my mind a very long way from genuinely accepting that the allegations are true. They have not begun to understand the extent of the physical and emotional harm suffered by Z, or the seriousness of the conduct of SB and SM, nor in my judgment have they begun to realise the extent of their failure to protect the children and the harm that has thereby resulted. The father&#8217;s assertion in evidence that any sexualised behaviour demonstrated by his children was caused by the corrupt society in which they now live, and not through any fault on his part, shows the extent of his lack of awareness of his responsibility for what has occurred. In her final analysis, the guardian concluded that the mother and father are unable to take any responsibility for their actions, but, rather, apportion blame to others or minimise the concerns. I agree. Nothing I have heard in the course of this hearing has caused me to question this assessment. </span></p>

The father&#8217;s acknowledgement to Mr. Lowe that the incident involving SB in the middle of the night involved him fighting with himself rather than his son may well present the start of a process of understanding, but it is no more than a start.

It is possible that over time the parents may come to accept my findings, and develop an understanding of the degree of harm they caused to the children, and achieve the changes necessary in their parenting. It may be that, with professional help and guidance, they may learn new skills as parents so that they can protect their children from sexual abuse, and manage the behaviour of their children as they get older and face the challenges of growing up in modern society. In my judgment, however, it is likely to take a very considerable amount of time and hard work to achieve these changes. I consider that the Phoenix assessors have seriously misjudged these issues. There is considerable force in the guardian&#8217;s observation in her final report that in some respects the Phoenix assessment appears to validate the actions of the parents by simply suggesting that they lacked parenting skills and have a level of naivete. I also agree with the guardian that the assessors did not really challenge the parents and substantially based their assessment on information taken from the parents at face value. Furthermore, they did not address the risk to the children of placing them back with the parents at a point when they had not made any significant changes in their parenting. Accordingly, I agree with Miss Cook&#8217;s submission on behalf of the local authority that the assessment was wholly unrealistic in terms of timescales either of the parents&#8217; ability to achieve change, or as to how long the children could safely wait for the changes to be achieved. These deficiencies in the Phoenix assessment were exposed in Mr Lowe&#8217;s oral evidence, notably in the shift in his opinion both as to the timescales necessary to achieve change and as to the point in the process at which the children could be safely returned home. </span></p>

The parents&#8217; behaviour towards the professionals throughout these proceedings demonstrates that they are unable and/or unwilling to work with those challenge them. This is highlighted in particular by their allegations that they had been the victims of a conspiracy orchestrated by SC.

Furthermore, the parents, and in particular the father, have during contact sessions made a number of comments to the children which, in Miss Davis&#8217;s phrase, have exposed the children to their conspiratorial world. The contact records show that the mother on occasions attempts to prevent the father making inappropriate remarks but with limited success. </span></p>

They need first and foremost to be safe in the care of whoever is looking after them. In their treatment of Z and her allegations of abuse, their physical abuse of the older boys, and their response to AS&#8217;s expressions as to his own sexuality, the parents have demonstrated the difficulties they have in identifying and meeting the needs of the children. I accept Miss Cook&#8217;s submissions that the children are in urgent need of stability now, not in several months time when further work has been done. All the children are damaged to some extent, some profoundly so, and some are having therapeutic work for sexualised behaviour. In Miss Cook&#8217;s phrase, the parents are themselves not even on the first rung of the therapeutic ladder. </span></p>

SM has made progress at the unit and has at last returned to mainstream education, but he is still in the early stages of addressing the consequences of his conviction, and needs to build a therapeutic relationship within the protective surroundings of the unit. A return home, or to another placement in his home town, would manifestly be contrary to his interests at this stage. I acknowledge that he wishes to return home and have thought carefully about that and about everything else that he told me when I met him and everything said on his behalf by Mr. Josty, but it is simply unrealistic to contemplate any placement other than remaining at his current unit under a care order at this stage. It is true that the local authority does not appear to have considered the option of a foster placement near to his home, but in my judgment to move SM at this stage, when he has just returned to mainstream school and embarked on his GCSE course and in is in the early stages of addressing his offending behaviour, would be to jeopardise his future welfare. I accept the analysis of the local authority and guardian that his welfare plainly requires him to stay at the residential unit for the time being. The local authority will, however, be under an obligation to keep this placement under review. I anticipate that in the summer of 2017, when his Crown Court order expires, and he finishes his GCSEs, it may be appropriate for him to move, depending on the progress he has made. </span></p>

First, I endorse the view of the guardian, JC, now accepted by the local authority, in an amended care plan, that his contact with his parents should take place once per fortnight. SM wishes to see his parents once a week, but in my judgment that is neither practical nor in his best interests. The contact must remain supervised, but I do think the local authority should consider arranging some contact to take place in his home town, and, in due course, at the family home. I accept the local authority amended care plan on this issue and do not think it necessary to make any court order in respect of parental contact.</span></p>

SM is at present having indirect contact with his older brother SB but contact with his other siblings has been very infrequent. The local authority plan now is for contact with AS, AB and AQ to take place four times a year. The plan for contact with AH and AW depends on the court&#8217;s decision as to their long term future placement (see below). If the younger boys are placed for adoption, the local authority plan is for contact to take place twice a year, either face to face or by letter box. The local authority plan is silent as to the level of contact if AH and AW are not placed for adoption, but I infer that in those circumstances it would be appropriate for their contact with SM to be similar to the contact he will have with the other brothers. Currently there are no plans for contact between SM and Z. SM does not wish to have contact with her and the terms of his rehabilitation order preclude any such contact taking place. </span></p>

I recognise that the local authority has failed to address this aspect at times in the past, but, given the complex needs of the children and the importance of maintaining a degree of flexibility in the contact arrangements to meet those needs, it would in my judgment be wrong to impose an order. I accept the local authority&#8217;s assurance that it will arrange contact in accordance with the plan. The issue of sibling contact should, however, be an agenda item at every LAC review and the independent reviewing officer must carefully monitor this issue to ensure that the needs of SM, and the other children, for inter-sibling contact are properly being considered by the local authority.</span></p>

I accept Mr Josty&#8217;s trenchant criticism which in fact is valid not only for SM but also for the other children. I acknowledge the local authority has sought to address these criticisms in amendments to the care plan. But in my judgment, as SM will not be living in a culturally appropriate placement, the onus on the local authority to meet his cultural needs is even greater. Accordingly, I shall require the local authority to amend its care plan again by identifying and appointing a named specialist worker, selected from the local authority or for an independent agency, who is from the same cultural and religious background as the family, to work alongside the allocated social worker and devise and implement an additional component of the care plan to address the cultural and religious needs of SM (and, as I will explain below, the other children). Crucially, the specialist worker must involve SM in devising his customised plan and should also consult with SM&#8217;s parents on this issue. Once agreed, the details of the plan must be shared with the staff at SM&#8217;s residential unit and the local authority must carefully monitor the extent to which it is being followed. I recognise that this imposes an additional burden on the local authority which is already committing very considerable resources to this family, but, given the failure of the local authority adequately to address the cultural and religious needs of the children hitherto, there is much work that needs to be done to repair the damage and to ensure that the local authority complies with its statutory obligations. </span></p>

Secondly, if all the children return home, they would have the benefit of living together. Thirdly, by returning home, they would return to the home and community in which they lived all their lives until removal at the outset of these proceedings. Fourth, they would be returning to a home consistent with their religious and cultural needs. Fifth, they would be returning to the care of their parents with whom they have a close attachment, and who cared for them throughout their lives up to the date on which they were removed. I remind myself that this family was unknown to social services prior to May 2013 and that the children were described as being delightful, polite and a credit to their parents.

Secondly, they will be returning to the care of parents who inflicted physical abuse on older children. Thirdly, the parents have demonstrated no significant capacity to change and, in my judgment, any change in the parents&#8217; attitude and understanding will only be achieved after a prolonged period of work and therapy. At present, I do not believe that these parents really accept the degree of child abuse that took place in their household, or that they were culpable for failing to protect the children from that abuse. The father believes that responsibility for the break up of his family rests upon the social workers who have, in his view, perpetrated a conspiracy against him, and with society as a whole which has corrupted his children. The parents&#8217; lack of insight into the extent and causes of the children&#8217;s harm means that they are singularly ill-equipped to protect the children from future harm. </span></p>

She acknowledged that this would inevitably involve a short further delay but described the delay as &#8220;planned and purposeful&#8221; and pointed out that it would impose no hindrance to the plans for the children who already live in their intended full time foster placements. The advantages of this course would be that it would hold open the possibility of the children returning home. The disadvantage is that it would entail yet further delay for an indefinite period. As stated above, however, I reject the opinion of Phoenix as to the timescale of the work required. As already indicated, I consider this to be a very significant underestimate.

Overall, however, the picture is that, after the very disruptive experiences in care in the early stages of these proceedings, all four children have now, to varying degrees, settled down. All four children have vulnerabilities, perhaps AB to a lesser extent than the others, but in the case of AS, AQ and Z they are each, in different although connected ways, highly vulnerable. The security each has achieved in his or her current placement is very important and their future welfare depends on consolidating and maintaining that security. A further linked advantage is that, within the security of their current placements, each child can access the therapeutic assistance that each is going to need, to varying degrees and at different times, to recover from their experiences.</span></p>

The first is parental contact. The local authority plans to reduce contact to three times a year. I accept that a reduction in contact is now an appropriate step but in my view the proposed reduction is somewhat greater than necessary or appropriate. I consider that the appropriate level of contact hereafter would be four times a year, but in each case the local authority must keep the question of contact with the parents under careful review. Each child has different needs and the keyworker, LAC review, and the IRO must carefully review the question of the parents&#8217; contact on a regular basis. It is likely that as time goes by each child&#8217;s needs for contact with his or her parents will change, particularly if the parents engage in therapeutic or other work and demonstrate a greater understanding of the history of abuse and their own culpability.</span></p>

The local authority care plan is for this to take place once a month. This seems to me to be consistent with the children&#8217;s overall welfare, but with these caveats. First, as already stated, I accept the criticisms levelled by Mr Josty on behalf of SM, but which apply to all the children, that the local authority has not properly addressed the issue of sibling contact in the past. So great have been the demands on the local authority, and in particular on SC, that they have at times lost sight of the importance of sibling contact. Secondly, for that reason, and for the general reasons of the children&#8217;s welfare, it is incumbent on the local authority &#8211; the social worker, LAC review, and IRO &#8211; to pay careful attention to this question to ensure that these errors are not repeated in future. Thirdly, although the general plan is for contact once per month, it must not be forgotten that each child is an individual, and that relations between siblings are different so that their needs for contact are different. For example, it may be in the interests of AB and AQ to have more frequent contact. This must be carefully monitored and kept under review. </span></p>

This is a further illustration of how the local authority has struggled with the complexity of the issues arising in this case. Miss Cook on behalf of the local authority was obliged to put together hurriedly some handwritten amendments which were subsequently, after the hearing, reduced to an amended care plan document. Although the court therefore has some analysis of the option of long term fostering, it does not inspire me with confidence that the local authority has truly considered this option before coming to its recommendation.

The advantages of a return home are that the children would be returning to the home to which each has expressed a wish to return and to the parents with whom they have a close attachment, and they would return to the home and community in which they lived all their lives until removal at the outset of these proceedings, and to a placement that was culturally appropriate.

Given their very close bond, and the fact that they have always lived together, this is manifestly of crucial importance. Thirdly, long term fostering would enable the boys to remain members of this family. In this respect, they would be treated no differently from their siblings. Their sense of identity as members of the family would be maintained. Fourth, they would be able to have regular contact with their parents, in all probability at the same level as their four middle siblings namely four times a year. Fifth, they would be able to join in contact with their siblings, presumably at the same frequency of once a month.

In addition, they would be at risk of repeated moves of foster placements, as has unfortunately occurred with their siblings during the course of these proceedings. Furthermore, as they cannot stay in their current placement, a decision that they should be placed in long term foster care would involve a move to new carers unknown to them and to a placement that will be untested. In addition, it is asserted that in many cases long term foster carers do not enter into the arrangement with the same degree of commitment as adopters. Without the complete legal responsibility which comes with adoption, long term foster carers may not feel the same degree of personal responsibility for the children.

They would have the opportunity to be placed within an adopted family that would prioritise their needs and ensure that they experience the safety and security they need to heal from the trauma they have suffered. Both boys require emotionally intelligent carers who are able to accept the children for who they are and nurture them with a therapeutic parenting style. It is asserted that an adoptive placement best fits this requirement. The children would not be exposed to the risks of long term fostering as identified above, but instead would have the complete security of a permanent new family. Further, as the guardian observes, many adoptive families are willing to contemplate contact with the birth family including in some cases face to face contact, and it is possible that an adoptive placement could be found that would accommodate direct contact with the siblings in this case, and, perhaps, with the parents.

Although the local authority would search for a placement that would accommodate direct contact, it cannot be guaranteed that such a placement will be found. Although the local authority would hope to place the boys together, again it cannot be guaranteed that such a placement would be found. The local authority plan is to look for a home for the boys together for six months but, if that is unsuccessful, to move then to looking for separate placements for the boys which can accommodate direct contact between them. The boys are older than many children placed for adoption and at their age it is possible that the risk of placement breakdown is greater. It is likely that an outcome that results in the fracturing of the relationship between the boys and their birth family will be contrary to their wishes and feelings. Adoption is contrary to the wishes of the parents and to the other siblings, several of whom have been very distressed at the prospect of a permanent separation from their little brothers. The wishes and feelings of the child&#8217;s relatives are a factor to be taken into the welfare consideration when considering whether or not to make a placement order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>. </span></p>

The degree of harm suffered by some of the older children, and the parents&#8217; lack of insight and understanding as summarised above, in my view preclude the prospect of a return home. No kinship placement has been identified and plainly a search for such a placement would take considerable time. To my mind, the realistic choices for the boys are therefore long term fostering or adoption. </span></p>

It is only after careful thought that the court takes a course that is contrary to the clear recommendation of the local authority and guardian. Nonetheless, in the end, I have come to the clear conclusion that the right outcome for AH and AW is that they should be moved to a long term foster placement. I bear in mind the decision of the Supreme Court in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re B</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and the very clear guidance given by the judges in that court to the effect that adoption is only to be preferred as a last resort and when the court is satisfied that nothing else will do. In this case, I am not satisfied that nothing else will do. On the contrary, looking at the overall welfare needs of these two boys, I find that long term fostering will be the better option. I accept that it does not provide the same degree of security and permanence as adoption, although a careful search for a long term foster placement ought to identify a placement which is capable of providing a strong degree of stability and which meets all of the needs of the children, including their cultural needs. In my judgment, however, the sense of identity and the importance for these children of maintaining lasting and meaningful relationships with their siblings and parents is such that long term fostering is to be preferred. There is a very strong sense of family identity in this sibling group and this is just as important to these little boys as to their older siblings. They would, in my judgment, suffer a profound sense of loss were they to be deprived of the opportunity to sustain that relationship. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S.1(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> requires me to have regard, amongst other things, to the likely effect on the child throughout his life of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person, and the relationship which the child has with birth relatives. In this case, I conclude that the relationship AH and AW have with their brothers and sisters as part of a close sibling group is a fundamental aspect of their lives and of their sense of identity. Maintaining that lifelong relationship is therefore a crucial aspect of their welfare throughout their lives. </span></p>

Parental contact should in my view be four times a year and for the reasons identified above, sibling contact should take place once a month. The local authority must carefully monitor contact to ensure that it is tailored to meet the needs of the individual children. For the reasons set out above, I consider that the cultural and religious needs of the children require a specialist worker to be identified to devise a more detailed plan to address this important issue. </span></p>

The local authority has issued separate proceedings in respect of M and her future is as yet uncertain. The local authority must now address the question of contact between M and her siblings. That is another indication of how this case requires constant monitoring and review to address its multifarious complexities can be addressed. These children have a range of needs which are going to need intense work. It is imperative that the local authority makes available adequate resources to ensure that the needs of the children are fully met.</span></p>
