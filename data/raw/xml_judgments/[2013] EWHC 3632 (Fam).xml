And so Mrs AD made a telephone call in which she asked the Applicant what should happen &#8211; was she content for C to be brought back by his father and delivered home by him, or would she (the Applicant) come round and collect him?  The exact words that Mrs AD recalls and which were given in evidence before me this afternoon were these:</span></p>

The Respondent makes the point that that cannot have been right because it would have taken him and C some time to come from Aunt S&#8217;s home and in that time the Applicant would have been well out of the house.  There is very little in that point because even on the basis of an assumed slow walking pace of even a couple of miles an hour, in a minute or two a significant distance would have been covered.  I see no probative significance or value in that point.  The accounts given are that the conversation outside the gate that ensued between them took five to ten minutes.  The Respondent says ten minutes, supported by the Applicant&#8217;s own sister.  What the Respondent says is that there was an uncontroversial conversation about the prospect of contact the next day and that as he was leaving, having accepted what the Applicant said about that, she engaged him in conversation about the house which then developed over the ten minutes and resulted in them shouting and swearing at each other.</span></p>

It is not proved on the evidence before me that he went there deliberately in breach.  There is too much confusion about what he was told by his mother about it and what she understood about it.  It is clear as well on the evidence before the Court that the only conclusions open to the Court is that this went on for ten minutes or so, that in terms of her  reaction to it, the Applicant never left the scene.  Notwithstanding that they were divided by a wall throughout, there is no evidence to suggest that she could not have done so. She told the police at one stage as recorded in the relevant PPD1, that there was no problem.  Today she said that  she meant that there was no problem in the sense that he was going to hit or strike her. </span></p>

Though the logs do not record the precise details, the evidence from Miss JJ is that the police were there between 9:30 to 9:45. We know that on the basis of the photograph that was made and which I accept was made by the Applicant from her phone, that this call came in at 9:34.  It would indeed be the most extraordinary coincidence of vanishingly unlikely proportions that on this occasion somebody with mischief in mind phoned and relayed this message at the very time that it is now established that the police had in fact visited the Respondent in response to the events of 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> May 2013.

This was not a version off pat; it did not show any indication whatsoever of them having &#8216;put their heads together&#8217; on this to come up with a consistent version.  Indeed, their versions are not consistent; they are not word for word.  Miss O&#8217;s evidence was very balanced on this, declining to say she could recollect any specific words. The others were qualified as well, fairly so in my view, about what they could hear.  But all were sure that, having heard the voice in the circumstances they described, that it was him. </span></p>

Again, that has to be contrasted with what is said in his statement because it has an immediate issue on credibility.  The Respondent said in his statement that he did not swear at all.  He puts that down to oversight but it cannot be down to oversight because it was an issue specifically addressed in and not omitted from his statement. It is not something that he did not think about.  His statement clearly indicated that he did think about what he had said and whether he had sworn and concluded that he had not sworn. But he had and that affects his credibility in relation to this issue.
