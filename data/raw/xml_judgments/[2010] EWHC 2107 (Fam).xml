It suffices to record that the first of the judgments set out my reasons for declaring that it was in HM&#8217;s best interests to reside and be cared for at Y and described how, despite that order, her father, PM, removed her to Israel. The second judgment set out, amongst other things, the steps that had had to be taken, both in this country and in Israel, before HM was returned to this county on 8 April 2010 in the care of her mother, KH, pursuant to orders made by the Family Court, District Court and Supreme Court of Israel. The fourth judgment set out, amongst other things, my reasons for deciding that, despite what had happened, it was still in HM&#8217;s best interests to reside and be cared for at Y.</p>

There is, in fact, nothing to suggest that he has ever returned from Israel. I should add that, although I am satisfied that the applications now before me have been served on PM by email as permitted by paragraph 2 of the order I made on 30 April 2010 (as, indeed, I am satisfied that the order itself was so served), PM is in breach of paragraph 1 of the order, which required him to provide the parties and the court with an address for service. </p>

The Official Solicitor seeks an order that PM pay the costs incurred on behalf of HM since 30 October 2009 (the date when he abducted her to Israel) on the indemnity basis. Those costs, it is said, run to many tens of thousands of pounds.

The States of Guernsey seeks orders that PM (a) pay its costs in relation to the hearings before me on 30 April 2010 and 20 July 2010 in the sum of &#163;4,475 and (b) reimburse it the aggregate sum of &#163;15,548.52 (being the costs and expenses of KH&#8217;s travel to and accommodation and subsistence in Israel, as met by the States of Guernsey). </p>

And I can think of no reason why he should not pay the costs. In particular, this is not, unlike many such cases, the kind of case in which making the order sought is likely to make matters any worse than they already are or where not making the order sought is likely to have any beneficial effect, whether on HM, KH or anyone else. Whether I make the order or decline to make the order will not, in my judgment, have the slightest effect on, or make the slightest difference to, the way in which PM is likely to behave, whether in relation to HM, KH, Y, the States of Guernsey, or the care co-ordinator. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have mentioned, the costs the Official Solicitor seeks, and which I agree he is entitled to recover as against PM, include the costs he incurred in obtaining legal advice from Israeli lawyers. It was essential to obtain such advice if this court was to be in a position to decide what steps to take, just as it was essential to do so if there was to be any prospect of repatriating HM to this country. The advice which was obtained formed the basis of the proceedings so successfully pursued in Israel. The Official Solicitor asks me to declare that this was a reasonable disbursement on HM&#8217;s public funding certificate (both in principle and as to the amount of the costs thereof). I have no hesitation in doing so. It was, to repeat, essential in HM&#8217;s interests that such advice be obtained. Without it she would never have been repatriated. And it cannot be said that the actual cost of the advice was other than reasonable.</p>

This point is as utterly devoid of any technical as of any substantive merit. Guernsey has, appropriately and helpfully, participated throughout in the proceedings before me as an interested party. As such it is entitled to make an application for payment of its costs. So far as concerns its costs of the proceedings before me it is, for the reasons I have already given, entitled to an order against PM. It has confined its claim to the sum of &#163;4,475 in relation to just two of the various hearings before me. I agree that it is entitled to an order and, in all the circumstances, being satisfied that this is an entirely appropriate and justifiable sum, I shall summarily assess these costs in the amount claimed. I shall accordingly make an order that PM pay the costs of the States of Guernsey summarily assessed in the sum of &#163;4,475. </p>

In an earlier judgment I explained why I had jurisdiction: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re HM (Adult), PM v KH and anor (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/870" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 870 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 870 (Fam)</ref>, paras [39]-[40], [45], applying <span style="font-style:italic">Richardson v Richardson </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1989] Fam 95" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">[1989] Fam 95</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There being jurisdiction to make each of the orders sought, the question then arises as to whether, in all the circumstances, I ought in fact to make the orders. So far as concerns the order sought by the Official Solicitor there can, in the circumstances, be only one answer. For all the reasons I have referred to as justifying the other orders he seeks, the Official Solicitor is, in my judgment, entitled to this further order. The entirety of this litigation since 30 October 2009 has been caused by PM. He should pay the costs. There is no reason why either the Official Solicitor or KH should have to pay any part of the costs of the litigation, whether in this country or in Israel. Insofar as those costs have already been met, in accordance with orders I have made, by recourse to funds belonging to PM but under the control of the court, those payments should be confirmed and the orders confirmed as &#8220;final&#8221;. I am further satisfied, and shall so declare, that the amounts claimed and paid in respect of the proceedings in Israel were reasonable. I shall make an order to that effect. </p>

There is no reason why KH should have to pay these costs and, for the reasons I have already given, every reason why PM should be required to do so. I shall accordingly make an order that PM pay her the aggregate sum of &#163;8,925, being that part of her costs of the proceedings in Israel which she has funded from monies she borrowed for that purpose from friends and relatives. There is no need for these costs to be assessed in any way. It is quite plain from the evidence before me that KH borrowed this amount and then paid it to her Israeli lawyers who, it is equally plain, applied it in meeting their professional bills. Nor is there is any factual basis for disputing the quantum of these bills.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as the first point is concerned, it has to be remembered that KH went to Israel not merely because she was litigating in the Israeli courts but because I had made an order directing PM to deliver HM into her care in order to facilitate her (HM&#8217;s) return to the jurisdiction: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re HM (Adult), PM v KH and anor (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/870" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 870 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 870 (Fam)</ref>, para [24(i)]. So KH went to Israel in order to enforce, in the way I had directed, an order I had made to safeguard HM&#8217;s welfare. Had the order directed (say) a social worker or one of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s officers to go to Israel for that purpose, the court would plainly have had jurisdiction to order PM to pay the costs and expenses thereby incurred. Why should it make any difference, in circumstances where it was imperative that this exceptionally difficult and sensitive task be undertaken by someone HM would recognise, trust and accept, that the task was entrusted by the court, as in my judgment it had to be entrusted, to KH rather than some professional? It cannot make any difference. This was expenditure which had to be incurred and, to repeat, had to be incurred only because of PM&#8217;s own wrongful and unlawful acts. Moreover, the only reason why KH&#8217;s stay in Israel became so protracted was because of PM&#8217;s response to the litigation. He was no doubt entitled to defend the proceedings as he did. But the proceedings having been necessitated by his own acts, and having been ultimately resolved against him, there is no reason why he should be exonerated from the financial consequences; on the contrary there is every reason why he should reimburse this expenditure. And it can make no difference that he is being required to reimburse the States of Guernsey, which has paid KH&#8217;s bills, rather than KH herself. </p>

KH has explained to me how she and HM and JM (who, entirely understandably and appropriately, had gone to Israel with her mother to give her practical as well as moral support in an unfamiliar country) spent their time in Israel. PM seems to be suggesting that they were living inappropriately, indeed extravagantly. I am quite satisfied that they were not. HM had to be kept active, happy and amused with appropriate activities. The drinking of wine in moderate quantities is hardly an extravagance in a Mediterranean country. And KH is not to be criticised for smoking in the stressful circumstances in which PM had placed her. KH was in Israel for some eight weeks, from 14 February 2010 until 8 April 2010, together with HM and JM. And there were also the travel costs to and from Israel. I am satisfied that this was necessary and appropriate expenditure and, for all the reasons which by now will be obvious, expenditure which should be recouped from PM. I shall accordingly order that PM reimburse the States of Guernsey the aggregate sum of &#163;15,548.52 it claims.</p>

Secondly, and, as Ms Giovannetti points out, in breach of one of the orders I made on 12 November 2009 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re HM (Adult), PM v KH and anor (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/870" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 870 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 870 (Fam)</ref>, para [24(iii)]), PM has never provided details of his assets.

I agree that such an order is appropriate, as I also agree that the order I made on 6 November 2009 (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re HM (Adult), PM v KH and anor (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2010/870" uk:canonical="[2010] EWHC 870 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWHC 870 (Fam)</ref>, para [24(ii)]) can properly be directed to stand as an interim third party debt order, with no further interim order being required. Plainly, as Ms Giovannetti acknowledges, PM and X should be given an opportunity to object to the making of a final third party debt order. I shall give appropriate directions with a view to the further consideration of a final third party debt order against X being adjourned to be heard by the judge hearing the committal application on 9 August 2010.</p>

In my judgment, KH&#8217;s claim should have priority, so that she is put in a position to discharge her legal (and moral) obligations to the friends and relatives who rallied round in her (and HM&#8217;s) hour of need and lent her the money to get the proceedings in Israel under way. As to the balance, the Official Solicitor and the States of Guernsey are agreed that it should be divided in the ratio of 80 (HM) and 20 (States of Guernsey). I shall make an order accordingly.</p>

I would urge anyone tempted to adopt such a view to read the judgments, in particular the judgment which Roderic Wood J gave on 21 November 2008 and my first two judgments, handed down on 28 October 2009 and 30 April 2010 respectively. The reality, as they illustrate, is that the driver of this litigation is, and has for a long time been, PM&#8217;s relentless determination to have his own way, come what may, and to wear down anyone and everyone who stands in the way.</p>

She feels that throughout the protracted proceedings the judicial system has not acknowledged or addressed this issue, with the consequence, she says, that she has been left unprotected and vulnerable to further abuse; a situation compounded more recently by the necessity to represent herself as a litigant in person, a task which, she says, has placed an enormous strain on her in difficult and distressing circumstances.
