Cumbria County Council, represented by Mr Damian Sanders, issued care proceedings on 3 January 2018.  The first respondent to those proceedings is R&#8217;s mother, S, represented by Ms Sarah Dines.  The second respondent is R&#8217;s father, E, represented by Mr Nicholas HowellJones.  The father has parental responsibility for R. R is represented through her Children&#8217;s Guardian, Rebecca Tomlinson, by Mr Peter Rothery.  R is the subject of an interim care order in favour of the local authority. </p>

Specifically, the mother contends that the new information available to this court allows the court to be satisfied that (a) it was in fact the father who was responsible for R&#8217;s injuries and (b) that the mother was not in fact present when those injuries occurred.   </p>

Whilst additional questions were put to the jointly instructed experts in this case (Dr Stoodley (Consultant Neuroradiologist), Dr Cartlidge (Consultant Paediatrician), Mr Richards (Consultant Neurosurgeon) and Professor Lloyd (Consultation Ophthalmologist)) no one sought to cross-examine those experts with respect to the answers provided.  In addition to the evidence given by the mother and the father, I heard evidence from Michelle Challender (independent social worker), Peter Sykes (allocated social worker), Dr Young (consultant adult forensic psychologist) and Rebecca Tomlinson (Children&#8217;s Guardian).  I have also heard brief oral evidence via video link from Ms Nugent, a contact supervisor. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">At this final hearing the local authority proposal is for the placement of R with her paternal grandparents under the auspices of a Special Guardianship order.  The local authority also seeks a 12 month supervision order to support that placement.   The mother&#8217;s primary case, predicated on this court agreeing to revisit the findings of Parker J in the manner the mother contends for, is that she wishes to care for R herself.  Her secondary case, in the event that the court does not agree to revisit the findings of Parker J is that she agrees to R being cared for under the auspices of a Special Guardianship Order by the paternal grandparents. For his part, the father supports the positions taken by the mother.  On behalf of R, the Children&#8217;s Guardian agrees that R should be placed permanently with the paternal grandparents.  However, given what the Children&#8217;s Guardian contends are the particular complexities of this case, and in circumstances where the proposed placement is untested, the Children&#8217;s Guardian contends that the placement should take place initially under the auspices of a final care order for reasons that I examine in more detail below. </p>

Parker J&#8217;s judgment should be read with my judgment and, save as set out below, it is not necessary for me to repeat those matters here.  Following the findings of fact made by Parker J a number of assessments were undertaken as follows:  </p>

He states that what happened was an accident and asserts that he subsequently lost his memory of this until recently and this was why he did not disclose this earlier.  However, he indicated to the Independent Social Worker that he is aware of what had happened but did not disclose this for fear of what may happen.  He is struggling significantly at this time with his mental health, is exhibiting some post traumatic stress symptoms and there is evidence that R being distressed can act as a trigger for his own distress.  Whether or not this could be due to the guilt he feels about what happened, it indicates some continued vulnerability that I think he needs some time to explore more fully before there is consideration of him re-joining the family, thus I would advocate him moving out of the family home for a period of time, if possible back to his family home where he has the support of his parents.&#8221; </p>

The report of the Children&#8217;s Guardian makes clear, and she made clear in her oral evidence, that even were the court to accede to amending the findings made by Parker J, there is a high degree of risk in returning R to the care of her mother whilst the mother remains in a relationship with the father or whilst any purported separation is in its infancy.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian&#8217;s assessment is that the mother would be likely to gravitate back to this relationship and, as such, her capacity to safeguard and protect R would be thus limited. The Children&#8217;s Guardian is clear that should R not return to the care of her mother, the paternal grandparents are the appropriate long term carers for R, albeit she differs from the local authority as to the appropriate legal framework for such a placement. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.47in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;...there is undoubtedly medical evidence which casts a question mark over some at least of what has happened. Whether that question mark is serious, whether it is in fact possible that it has or could have any effect on the second part of the hearing, is a matter exclusively for the trial judge and not for the Appeal Court. I ought to say that the additional evidence which we have accepted to be adduced, for what it is worth, would more appropriately be considered at the trial stage than at the appeal stage. It is evidence both as to medical opinion and also some evidence of what is sometimes termed disclosures. All of those are matters that can properly be investigated by the trial judge. I can see no reason why His Honour Judge Hunt should not be the trial judge. Indeed, I agree with counsel representing the other parties that it would be wrong for it not to be Judge Hunt, because he is the one judge who has had all the evidence up to now. He is able to reconsider what he has done, if he considers it necessary, in the light of any further evidence that has come since the hearing before him.&#8221; </p>

As in this case, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M and MC </span>the care proceedings were ongoing and had reached the stage of a welfare hearing.  In this context, Thorpe LJ held that in such a situation the court should avoid the extremes of, on the one hand, <span style="font-style:italic">completely</span> reopening the issues of fact that had been tried and, on the other, ignoring the later development when considering the welfare stage of the proceedings.  Within the context, the Court of Appeal held that the appropriate resolution of this tension is for the court to conduct the welfare hearing taking the findings of fact as a foundation but making adjustments to take account, where necessary, of the later confession, giving the parent opportunity to explain himself in the witness box and the local authority the opportunity to question him on his evidence.  In this regard, at [13] and [14] Thorpe LJ observed as follows: </p>

Particularly, courts must be guarded in acceding to applications for yet another trial of an issue of fact in what should be the relatively brief period between the preliminary hearing of disputed facts and the subsequent hearing to dispose of the outstanding application for care orders. </p>

That of course is one extreme. The other extreme would be to reject the development absolutely and treat the previous finding of fact as incapable of being revisited. There is, between these two extremes, an obvious middle way, and that is to conduct the disposal hearing in such a way as to adopt the process of preliminary hearing as the foundation, and then to make such adjustments as are necessary to reflect subsequent developments rigorously tested through the process of examination-in-chief and cross-examination. Judge Hamilton clearly suspected that there was no greater value in the fifth statement than in the earlier statements, and in that suspicion he may be right. But no complete conclusion can be reached without affording the mother the opportunity of explaining herself in the witness box and answering as best she can the local authority's response, namely, that the fifth statement is contradicted by or is inconsistent with, the medical evidence.&#8221; </p>

The Court of Appeal observed that it has increasingly been recognised that it is usually unreliable and often dangerous to draw a conclusion from a witness's demeanour as to the likelihood that the witness is telling the truth, noting research suggesting that interlocutors cannot make effective use of demeanour in deciding whether to believe a witness and some evidence that the observation of demeanour diminishes rather than enhances the accuracy of credibility judgments.  Within this context, Leggat LJ stated as follows at [40] and [41]: </p>

Still less does it follow that there is no value in oral evidence. But research confirms that people do not in fact generally rely on demeanour to detect deception but on the fact that liars are more likely to tell stories that are illogical, implausible, internally inconsistent and contain fewer details than persons telling the truth: see Minzner, "Detecting Lies Using Demeanor, Bias and Context" (2008) 29 Cardozo LR 2557. One of the main potential benefits of cross-examination is that skilful questioning can expose inconsistencies in false stories. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.43in;text-indent:0in">[41] No doubt it is impossible, and perhaps undesirable, to ignore altogether the impression created by the demeanour of a witness giving evidence. But to attach any significant weight to such impressions in assessing credibility risks making judgments which at best have no rational basis and at worst reflect conscious or unconscious biases and prejudices. One of the most important qualities expected of a judge is that they will strive to avoid being influenced by personal biases and prejudices in their decision-making. That requires eschewing judgments based on the appearance of a witness or on their tone, manner or other aspects of their behaviour in answering questions. Rather than attempting to assess whether testimony is truthful from the way it is given, the only objective and reliable approach is to focus on the content of the testimony and to consider whether it is consistent with other evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and with known or probable facts.&#8221; </p>

Proportionate to these is the degree of credit his testimony deserves from the court or jury.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Within the context of the foregoing legal principles, this court must bear in mind that the  assessment of the credibility and reliability of the parents should coalesce around matters including the internal consistency of their evidence, its logicality and plausibility, details given or not given and the consistency of their evidence when measured against other sources of evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and other known or probable facts.  The credibility and reliability of that parent should not be assessed simply by reference to their demeanour, degree of emotion or other aspects of their presentation.  This of course works in both directions.  It is as problematic to rely on an impression that a witness has an &#8216;honest&#8217; tone, manner or presentation, for example that they appear &#8220;genuinely upset&#8221;, as it is to rely on an impression that the tone or manner of a witness appears &#8216;dishonest&#8217;, for example that they cross their arms or look at the floor.

They may arise for a number of reasons.  One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability.  Another is that they are lies told for other reasons.  Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing or relaying the account.  The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.  As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process that might inelegantly be described as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">story-creep</span>&#8221; may occur without any necessary inference of bad faith.&#8221; </p>

There is no mechanism for a care order to be discharged on the happening of a fixed event or otherwise to be limited in time.  The exercise of parental responsibility by a local authority cannot be constrained once a full care order is made other than on public law principles of unlawfulness, unreasonableness and irrationality.  The judge should have reflected on the fact that if the local authority did not in due course apply to discharge the care orders themselves it would have been incumbent on the proposed special guardians to do so and to satisfy the test for leave to make that application without the benefit of legal aid, given that in the circumstance of a disagreement with the local authority it would be highly unlikely that the special guardians would be in receipt of funding from them.  </p>

This lapse in memory, he contended in his oral evidence, had continued through his police interview and the subsequent Police investigation which looked specifically at the circumstances in which R sustained injuries, through the case management stage of these proceedings setting up the fact finding hearing to consider that same question, through the finding of fact hearing (notwithstanding that Ms Dines asked the father <span style="font-style:italic">in terms</span> during cross examination at that hearing whether R had been injured in an accident involving the rocking chair) and for some three months after that hearing as assessments were undertaken as to the welfare options for R.   </p>

He conceded that, by contrast, he has an accurate reflection, indeed an acutely accurate recollection of giving R CPR, of attending hospital and of the events that led up to the point at which R was injured.  Thus, the father&#8217;s asserted temporary amnesia covers, and <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> covers, the point at which R was injured, coupled with a further and specific revision of his account of when R became acutely unwell in relation to the point at which the parents contend the mother became present in the room. </p>

Further, in their closing submissions both Ms Dines on behalf of the mother, and Mr Howell-Jones on behalf of the father pressed this aspect of the case.  However, as I have noted above, it is important for this court to bear in mind that context that the court&#8217;s assessment of the credibility and reliability of the parents should coalesce around matters such as the internal consistency of their evidence, its logicality and plausibility, details given or not given and the consistency of their evidence when measured against other sources of evidence (including evidence of what the witness has said on other occasions) and other known or probable facts.  The credibility and reliability of that parent should not be assessed simply by reference to their demeanour, degree of emotion or other aspects of their presentation.  Within this context, I am satisfied that this is a case in which the manifest internal inconsistency, illogicality and implausibility of the father&#8217;s new account must weigh far more heavily in the balance than the parents emotional presentation when the new version of events was given. </p>

Whilst he supported the mother&#8217;s primary case, in the event that the mother remained the subject of the findings as determined by Parker J he too endorsed the placement of R with his parents.

During the course of cross-examination Ms Challender made clear that her views stood not only if Parker J&#8217;s findings were not the subject of amendment, but also were the findings to be amended to exclude the mother as a perpetrator of the injuries and to find she was not present when the injuries occurred. Ms Challender further made clear that she arrived at this latter view in circumstances where the mother has manifest untreated emotional issues and where she made a conscious decision to remain in a relationship with the father notwithstanding him hiding his culpability for the injuries to R for some eighteen months.  In particular, Ms Challender stated that she could not be confident that the mother would not try to protect the father in the future in circumstances where the parents have an imbalanced relationship and the mother remans dependent on the father.  Within this context, Ms Challender made clear that her conclusions as articulated in her report would not change even were the court to adjust the findings of Parker J in the way contended for by the mother. </p>

It was clear from her evidence that there is little &#8216;depth&#8217; to her acceptance of the father&#8217;s assertion of culpability and I was left with little confidence that she would be capable of challenging any narrative propounded by the father.

The contact records for that contact are before the court.  One record has been the focus of particular attention at this hearing, namely that for 12 June 2019.  On that day, the contact record, authored by a Ms Nugent, records the mother stating that she was not stressed at all and that she and the father had &#8220;done nothing wrong&#8221;.  The mother disputed this account and Ms Nugent was called to give evidence by video link.  Whilst cross-examined in detail by Ms Dines, Ms Nugent was adamant that she had heard the mother state that she and the father had done nothing wrong.  Further, Ms Nugent was clear that the mother had made other statements to this effect both before and after the finding of fact hearing.  Insofar as her evidence was contradicted by the mother, I preferred the evidence of Ms Nugent, which was lent weight by the contact note prepared within days of the contact taking place and her emphatic and repeated confirmation that this is precisely what the mother had said.  </p>

Dr Young further stated in evidence that she considered the father still to be &#8220;in a place of denial&#8221; and not able fully to accept his culpability and that the question of the mother&#8217;s ability to sustain a separation from the father remains unclear.

First, father made clear to Dr Young that he still does not discount the possibility that there is, in fact, a medical explanation for R&#8217;s injuries.  Second, whilst during the course of her cross-examination of Michelle Challender Ms Dines sought to characterise the current relationship between the parents in a variety of ways that sought to suggest that the mother had made progress by building distance between herself and the father, both parents were clear that (a) they are living apart physically but remain engaged to be married, (b) they still have strong emotional connection and rely on each other for emotional support and (c) that each entertains a hope that they and R will be reunited as a family unit in the future.   This is entirely consistent with the position articulated at the FGC held only some 11 days prior to the commencement of this hearing, where it was made abundantly clear that &#8220;[The father] and [the mother] are currently living separately but remain in a relationship&#8221; and, as I have noted, &#8220;the hope is that [the father] will be able to return to the family home with [the mother] and R in the future...&#8221;.

In particular, the SGO Support Plan contains no clear information on how and to what extent the paternal grandparents will be supported with respect to managing the risks presented by the parents, with managing the complex family dynamics, in dealing with issues such as the safe supervision of contact and provides no provision for training or regular review.   </p>

Within this context, whilst enjoining the court to have regard also to the Transition Plan, during cross-examination the social worker was forced to concede that it too is very sparse in these respects.  Other aspects of the support for the paternal grandparents explored with the social worker in cross-examination also lacked certainty, with issues such as the identity of life story resources awaiting the decision of &#8220;a manager&#8221;. </p>

However, as the Children&#8217;s Guardian points out, the approach of Cumbria results in a child protection case that has resulted in an order being made under the child protection provisions of Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> being managed by the local authority under the children in need provisions of Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, which provisions were designed for a different purpose and for a different constituency of children.

Whilst I remain optimistic that [the paternal grandparents] will endeavour to ensure R has a positive and happy upbringing and will do whatever is required to support her, there remains uncertainty as to how in reality this placement will progress.  As R has not lived with [the paternal grandparents], the realities of what support they need are not yet know[n], it is only through the testing of a placement that the support needs of the grandparents, placement and R become clear.  It is possible that [the paternal grandparents] and by the placement, R, could be disadvantaged by a support plan endorsed by the Court that may not in reality meet their needs.&#8221; </p>

They feel very much without a voice within the process and whilst I was meeting with them, they had many questions about what the implications going forward would be.  Whilst this does not deter them from wanting to care for R, there is a worry that they may be left without the support they need, and they may feel powerless to ask for anything further.  They do have concerns in respect of their relationship with the Social Worker(s) that R has had and that this is not an effective working relationship.  I accept this may be their perception of the situation based on the experience they have had as part of these proceedings; however, such a perception could be a barrier to an effective working relationship going forward.&#8221; </p>

Aside from the welfare merits of the orders, which were not adequately reasoned, the concept of a short-term order is flawed.  There is no mechanism for a care order to be discharged on the happening of a fixed event or otherwise to be limited in time.  The exercise of parental responsibility by a local authority cannot be constrained once a full care order is made other than on public law principles of unlawfulness, unreasonableness and irrationality.  The judge should have reflected on the fact that if the local authority did not in due course apply to discharge the care orders themselves it would have been incumbent on the proposed special guardians to do so and to satisfy the test for leave to make that application without the benefit of legal aid, given that in the circumstance of a disagreement with the local authority it would be highly unlikely that the special guardians would be in receipt of funding from them.  </p>
