CL is LL&#8217;s mother. The respondents to the appeal are the Swansea Bay University Health Board (&#8216;Health Board&#8217;), LL by his litigation friend AB, VL (LL&#8217;s father) and Swansea City Council (&#8216;local authority&#8217;). The local authority took no active part in this appeal. CL seeks permission to appeal, if that is granted, and the appeal is successful for the matter to be remitted for re-hearing. The first and second respondents opposed the appeal. The third respondent opposed the appeal save for a limited aspect of Ground 3.</p>

On 22 December 2023 CL filed a COP35 appellant&#8217;s notice, followed by grounds of appeal and a skeleton argument on 30 January 2024. On 14 February 2024 I made directions, listed the application for permission to appeal with appeal to follow if permission is granted on 6 March 2024. That order was varied by agreement on 1 March 2024 and the appeal was listed on 21 March 2024 when the hearing took place. Judgment was reserved.</p>

The fact that this order is not limited in time is one factor that the court can consider.  The order provides for decision making to be vested in C when she is not in a position to make those decisions.  That is a factor that the court can weigh.  The effect that an order or the continuation of the deputyship would not enhance the collaborative approach required in this case with clinicians and indeed might, at worst, be detrimental to it, are relevant factors to the section 4 assessment. </span></p>

But, in my judgment, the submission by the Health Board and the litigation friend is a sound one in this regard: wishes and feelings on a conceptually complex matter such as this deputyship is difficult, if not impossible.

In s 19 the requirements for those who satisfy the test for appointment of a deputy are set out (18 years or over; to require security be provided, and to require the deputy to submit such reports to the Public Guardian at such times or intervals as the court directs). S 58 created the office of the Public Guardian, specifying the functions of the Public Guardian, which includes to supervise deputies appointed by the court (s58(1)(c)), that can be done in a number of ways as set out in s58. These provisions include the power given to the Public Guardian to deal with representations and complaints about the way a deputy appointed by the court is exercising his powers (s58(1)(h)). For the purposes of enabling the Public Guardian to exercise his functions he is given powers under s58(5) and (6) which enable him to inspect certain records (i.e. health records) and may interview P in private. Finally, s19 sets out the restrictions on deputies, for example they must exercise their authority in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss1</ref>-4 MCA, they cannot decide issues of capacity and s20 listed other limitations. </p>

Due to the complexity of LL&#8217;s position the Judge failed to properly analyse and balance the structure that would replace it; (vi) he failed to give any adequate reasons for rejecting the narrowed authority of the alternative deputyship which in turn impacts on his s4 evaluation.</p>

The two grounds under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s16(8)</ref> are mutually exclusive.

How those powers can be used are further specified in non-exhaustive lists in ss 17 and 18, which both use the term <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;in particular&#8217;</span> providing lists to illustrate, not limit, how the powers can be used. This is supported by the Explanatory Notes that refers to the lists in ss17 and 18 as being non-exhaustive and indicative lists. To that extent Mr Patel submits the Judge was mistaken to refer to the provision of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s16(8)</ref> as an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;oddity&#8217;</span> as to how it relates to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s16(7)</ref>, as it is in other parts of the MCA.</p>

The purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s16</ref> is to establish a broad set of powers to make decisions on P&#8217;s behalf, with built in flexibility to cover the many different situations it could apply to in the context where P has lost capacity and a decision must be made.

The Court of Protection is by necessity an agile and responsive court.  It makes orders that reflect changing circumstances to promote the needs and best interests of P.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">I  reject Mr McKendrick&#8217;s over reliance on the scheme within the MCA to regulate deputies to underpin his submissions regarding the interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s16(7)</ref> and (8).His contention that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">if the deputy has no authority to act contrary to P&#8217;s best interest why would Parliament provide the court with the power to discharge a validly appointed deputy because the discharge is in P&#8217;s best interest</span>&#8221; rings hollow when such an interpretation is considered in the light of the various compelling examples Mr Patel listed in his submissions. If Mr McKendrick&#8217;s submissions are correct that would result in the court being unable to discharge the deputyship order in the circumstances listed by Mr Patel, when P&#8217;s best interests demands such an order is made. To accept Mr McKenrick&#8217;s submissions would wholly undermine the purpose of the MCA. The justification given by Mr McKendrick of any perceived unfairness for the deputy does not stand up to scrutiny in circumstances where the deputy can fully engage and participate in the process that results in any decision.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in">In his reasoning at [74]-[83] the Judge&#8217;s focus was rightly on discharge, as that was the application he was being asked to determine. He clearly had in mind the context in which deputyships are granted but his analysis was on balancing the impact on LL of either granting or refusing the application, and the relevant competing considerations.  This is well illustrated by what he set out at [74] when he stated: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;In my judgment, it is appropriate to discharge the deputyship in its entirety. Many of the decisions in respect of which authority is provided under the deputyship are now matters that are firmly before the Court of Protection or are otherwise matters in respect of which [CL] is no longer the decision-maker, in particular residence, with whom P should live, the day to day diet and dress, leisure and social activities, provision of care, services and future care. To retain a deputyship in respect of those matters would be disproportionate and unnecessary and would represent an unjustifiable intrusion into P&#8217;s life and decision-making. Such an order would be contrary to the principles of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(4)</ref> and the guidance thereto and the principles echoed through the case law.&#8217; </span>There the Judge was carefully weighing in the balance the impact on LL of retaining or discharging the deputyship. He then went on from [75] to consider the proposed variation and reached the conclusion he did at [80] in rejecting the proposed variation and considered the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;appropriate approach is for consultation to be pursuant to section 4(7), supplemented by the protocols&#8217;</span> and for there to be a collaborative approach.</p>
