Perhaps it was a combination of all of these.  R&#8217;s family launched (in correspondence) a number of serious allegations about Signia and its failures to care for R in very many ways.

She was incapable of understanding the pros and cons of sharing a house and was incapable of understanding the nature of the different people with whom she might share a house. She was incapable of understanding different support that might be available to her in different residential settings. She was incapable of understanding the ways in which she needs support beyond the most basic concrete support (such as helping her to batch cook food and helping her not to get lost). She was unable to understand the ways in which she is extremely vulnerable and the ways in which she requires support to meet her intangible needs and keep herself safe.

This was, it hardly needs saying, to have been a momentous event, some two years since R had seen her family.  R went to some lengths to prepare for this gathering, including buying some food.  R&#8217;s mother sent a message to her about SA attending.  Then two days before the gathering, R cancelled it.  It seems to me that this was a result of the fact that SA and his mother both felt that SA was being drawn into R&#8217;s family disputes; they wanted to avoid this.   SA had told R that he did not think that he would be welcome at the gathering.  A furore followed, with R&#8217;s family being led to believe that Signia (and Ms TB in particular) had undermined the arrangements for the party.  I should say that, having reviewed the material, I do not consider that the cancellation of the 17 November gathering had anything to do with Signia or XCC, but was truly because R was highly sensitive to how her family viewed her relationship with SA; the upset about the police visit was not far below the surface.  However, as with so much else in this case, a potential step forward, which had all the hallmarks of promise, fell apart with recriminations and accusations flying.</p>

A further concern to Ms TB, and a deterrent to successful engagement in the mediation, was that during this period in which mediation was being attempted, the family ignited fresh allegations of fraud which on no account would be amenable to mediation, and which would inevitably complicate the relationships further.</p>

At that meeting, Ms TB proposed to the mediator a list of proposals for closer communications between Signia and the family including a key worker for R whom the family could contact directly. The mediator circulated Signia&#8217;s proposals, presenting them as a positive contribution.</p>

A further &#8216;section 42&#8217; safeguarding enquiry was formally initiated as a result of Ms AT&#8217;s referral, but concluded with the view that all matters complained of had already been addressed.  Given the persistent allegations of financial fraud, Signia offered to undertake a further audit in December 2022, but the family did not agree and chose not to participate.</p>

The Applicant and Third Respondent were insistent that the staff had deliberately alienated R against the family in retaliation for the family having raised complaints about financial mismanagement and other issues.   They aver that R has been &#8220;influenced into believing untrue things about us and other members of her family&#8221;.   During his oral evidence, the Applicant made a not-so-thinly-veiled suggestion that Signia had adopted a racist stance in its dealings with his wife.  The family considers that Signia have changed R's e-mail address, blocked members of the family from the WhatsApp groups, written communications as if they are from R (in language the family does not believe she is capable of).  I was left with the clear view from their written and oral evidence that their focus was on finding fault with Signia, regrettably showing little or no introspection or reflection of their own contributions to the current situation.  More worrying to me was that they seemed to find it hard to focus on R, and often deflected their answers (to questions about R and her situation) to find further reason to attack Signia and/or the Local Authority.  It was apparent from their written evidence that both the Applicant and the Third Respondent are meticulous with their research and referencing of the issues; their statements are lengthy, and reflect a preoccupation on the detail and a fixation on the shortcomings of the care agency caring for R.  In a similar vein, I noted that PB had commented that in the first year of his involvement as R&#8217;s social worker (2020-2021) he had received over 400 pages of communications from the Applicant.  </p>

I am not similarly persuaded.  I have seen no evidence which suggests that the Signia staff have acted in such a way as to sap R of her free-choice to meet with them; on the contrary, I was impressed by Ms TB and accept PB&#8217;s assessment of the quality of care which they offer to R.  I accept Dr McKay&#8217;s persuasive view that if the staff had conveyed to R deeply negative views about R&#8217;s family, R herself would not hold or communicate positive thoughts about her family.  Dr McKay is of the view that R has a desire to reconcile with her family, but lacks confidence that it will be a positive experience; the recent attempt would confirm this.  I am satisfied that PB in particular has made concerted efforts to persuade R to see her family, but those efforts have been in vain.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Third Respondent gave some thoughtful and insightful evidence about her sister, telling me that she felt that R had a tendency to say what she believed the listener wanted to hear.  I think that she is probably right about this, and I can identify instances in the evidence where I suspect that this has happened.  For instance, she knows that Signia is in dispute with her parents; therefore when she speaks with Signia about her parents it is often in negative tones.  When she spoke with others, including in the Talking Project, she gives a different view.  I do not think that this happens all of the time, and I am satisfied that there is also much evidence of R&#8217;s ability to say what she thinks irrespective of the likely sympathies of the listener.  It does mean that &#8211; going forward &#8211; those with whom she lives need to consider subtly challenging those views, and/or not overtly endorsing them.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;In my opinion, [R] lacks capacity to make decisions about contact with others due to her inability to understand the pros and cons of contact with people. She has responded to the conflict between her family and [Signia] by separating them into two separate camps of people and by choosing to cut an entire group of people out of her life. This is a very rigid and autistic response to the difficulties she is facing, however has the effect of her not needing to hold opposing views and ideas in her head or accept that people she likes, loves and needs may have differing views. It is, in a way, a very primitive defence mechanism, which is in keeping with her developmental age and autistic traits&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For these proceedings, Dr Katherine McKay, Chartered Clinical Psychologist, was instructed on a joint basis to consider R&#8217;s capacity in this regard; she has opined on several matters over a period of time.  Dr McKay had provided a report at the beginning of last year (31 January 2022) dealing with a number of the capacity issues on which declarations have already been made (see &#167;4 above). Latterly Dr McKay has assessed R&#8217;s capacity concerning contact, amongst other matters.</p>

Although challenged by the family on her approach to her task, I agree with Mr McKendrick that her assessment and its methodology was both thorough and robust; in my judgment, she tested R appropriately in order to establish her capacity.  As earlier indicated, she had met with R on a number of occasions previously, which was a great advantage: she was able to begin her assessment with some pre-existing knowledge and experience of R&#8217;s abilities and limitations.  </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;She had a good understanding of the nature of the relationships with professionals, family members and others. She was aware that there were people involved in her life who were transient, and paid for their employment, whereas her family and her boyfriend were not. She was very clearly able to consider the positive and negative aspects of having contact with each person. [R] showed an ability to call to mind positive memories of being with her family, as opposed to having purely polarised negative views. Her ambivalence regarding her family was evident (as it had been in my previous report), and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">she reported feeling loved, and loving her family, and at times missing them, but also feeling controlled and criticised by them. </span>She reported feeling ongoing negative feelings associated with the police being called in the past, which distressed both [R] and her boyfriend (regardless of the &#8216;truth&#8217; about who called the police, [R] remains upset about this, in part due to the impact on her boyfriend) &#8230; Thus, [R] was assessed as having capacity to make decisions around contact. [R] herself was also able to make suggestions of things that would make her more amenable to having contact with her family, such as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">doing this on &#8216;Zoom&#8217;</span>, although her priority in this area was <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">for the cessation of legal proceedings</span>&#8221;.

She knows her family well and she loves them, but has been hurt by them (for the many reasons which I have discussed above) and deeply so; she feels it very keenly.  I do not think that the family see how badly they have hurt R and this is perhaps in part why they cannot accept that she can make a capacitous decision in this regard.  R has been clear in saying that she would like to see her family on Zoom initially; this is perfectly understandable.  I further sense that she is not saying that she will not want to see her family ever again; she is very clear that a number of impediments to contact need to be cleared first &#8211; the disclaimer of the LPAs, and the end of these proceedings being the most important.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that R has vacillated in recent times (reference 17 November 2022 and June 2023) over seeing the family (or members of them) is perfectly understandable, and utterly predictable; it is not evidence of inappropriate pressure being applied on her to change her mind.  Nor is that that she does not understand the information relevant to a decision on whether to see her family. She does understand that information; she can use and weigh that information; she can retain it, and can communicate her views.  But &#8211; and this is the key &#8211; I find that she is deeply conflicted, very aware that she is caught in the crossfire of the dispute between her family (which fundamentally she loves) and Signia (in whose care she lives, and whose relationship she values). She may say to people that which she thinks they want to hear. That of itself is not an indicator of a lack of capacity; many fully capacitous people do exactly that.  Her vacillation is not, or not necessarily, an indicator that she is coming under pressure, let alone undue pressure, from external sources.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At [83], Munby J went on to define the concept of &#8216;vulnerability&#8217; in the context of the inherent jurisdiction, in this helpful passage:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.05in">&#8220;The inherent jurisdiction is not confined to those who are vulnerable adults, however that expression is understood, nor is a vulnerable adult amenable as such to the jurisdiction. The significance in this context of the concept of a vulnerable adult is pragmatic and evidential: it is simply that an adult who is vulnerable is more likely to fall into the category of the incapacitated in relation to whom the inherent jurisdiction is exercisable, than an adult who is not vulnerable. So it is likely to be easier to persuade the court that there is a case calling for investigation where the adult is apparently vulnerable than where the adult is not on the face of it vulnerable. That is all&#8221;.</p>

R&#8217;s family point to the abrupt change of attitude towards them in the autumn of 2020, when the family started to challenge the professional care-givers about their conduct, as evidence that &#8220;over a period of eight months she had been subjected to an intense process of influencing&#8221;.

It needs to be borne in mind that R has turned against us during a period when she has not seen us, meaning that we have not been able to do anything bad to her.

But it is not &#8216;necessary&#8217; for me to make orders in relation to them in order to liberate R to make decisions freely, nor is it &#8216;proportionate&#8217; ([66] and [76] of <span style="font-style:italic">DL</span>) that I should.  I am conscious of the need to guard against adopting an overly paternalistic attitude to a vulnerable adult who is the subject of the proceedings, and to make orders in (what McFarlane LJ referred to as) the &#8220;hinterland&#8221; of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> which undermine the very concepts of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> itself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, I have been invited to consider evidence in relation to the care provider for R, and whether a case is made out for a change.  This only arises because of the family&#8217;s unhappiness with Signia, for all of the reasons rehearsed in this judgment &#8211; their negligent care of R, of compromising R&#8217;s health and welfare to the point of risking her life, of theft, of allowing R to be sexually abused, of fraudulent charging of housing benefit, of coercion and an abuse of power.  Mr Fernando, in his closing submissions, made the valid point that the delivery of care provision is an important issue in its own right, on which R could be expected to make a capacitous decision &#8211; particularly given that I have found that she has capacity to decide to remain at Castle Hill, and has capacity to make decisions about what support she needs on a day-to-day basis with an adequately supported environment.  I accept his point that a change of care provider is not a peripheral decision linked merely to the question of contact.  There is nothing on the face of the papers to suggest that R lacks capacity to decide on her care provider.  However, the point was clearly trailed in the oral evidence, I was addressed on it by counsel, and I have been asked to express a view.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am very sad for R that the intense and bitterly-fought disagreements at the centre of this litigation have dominated her life for nearly three years; the disputes have adversely affected the key relationships with all the people who matter most to her &#8211; her family, her staff network, and SA.  This litigation itself has, I am sure, caused deep distress to R, and indeed to so many others; I fear that this hearing will have done little to repair or heal relationships.  I am sure that the family are grieving the present absence of the relationship with R; this was evident.  They are also very angry with what they see as a lack of professionalism (and worse) from her care provider. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For these reasons, there is at least one conclusion which it has not been difficult to reach in this case.  And that is that these proceedings should now come to an end.  R has repeatedly said that she is unhappy by the court&#8217;s involvement; I am sure that she blames her parents for having initiated the litigation, and that this very issue in itself undermines the efforts which have been made to promote reconciliation.  I accept the evidence that R has regularly lost sleep with worry about the court&#8217;s involvement in her life, and that for a time she was &#8220;struggling&#8230; crying every night&#8221; because of them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with PB and Ms TB that R does show a good level of interest in, and empathy for, her family, but she is clearly conflicted; she has feelings of love and obligation towards them, but a strong desire to pursue her own interests and be free from what she sees as their &#8216;control&#8217;.  I find that she has been relatively steadfast in the last three years in her view on the issue of reconciliation; she has attempted to meet the many demands placed upon her by professionals, and has been frustrated by having to answer repeatedly many similar questions, when she has already made clear her position.   I share the optimism of Ms TB that when the litigation has ended, and particularly if R&#8217;s wishes are respected and hostilities cease between Signia and the family, R will feel freer to explore the options around seeing her family. I also agree that this may take time, and perhaps some third-party help from a personal counsellor for R.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Other issues raised by the parties at this hearing have not yielded answers with the same ease.  While the Court of Protection is accustomed to making important decisions about an individual&#8217;s capacity to make decisions, and declarations about their best interests, it is not able to order or declare how people should think, or what they should do to get on better with each other.  And that, in large part, is what needs to change in this case for the situation to move on.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I repeat my view, so that it is clear, that it is plainly in R&#8217;s best interests that she achieves a reconciliation with her family.  I am satisfied that all the key professionals from whom I have received evidence in this case recognise the importance of supporting R to do so; this will I hope be advanced by a reduction in hostilities around R, and the promulgation of collaborative, clear, consistent, and positive communications between all those who connect on a daily basis with R about the importance of family in R&#8217;s life.   The objective will be better achieved if the context in which R lives contains many of the features of the supportive frameworks which I have outlined above.   I do not feel it right that I should prescribe the precise terms of the supportive framework; it should nonetheless incorporate &#8211; so far as possible &#8211; the essential points raised by each of the parties which I have included in my judgment above.  It would be helpful if XCC could draw together a draft supportive framework, drawing on those points, for consultation with the key parties.</p>
