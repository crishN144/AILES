	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 November 2003 a wholly deserving father left my court in tears having been driven to abandon his battle for contact with his seven year old daughter D. She was born on 2 August 1996. That battle had lasted for precisely five years. It was on 11 November 1998, a matter of days after the parties separated on 2 November 1998, that mother petitioned for divorce and on the very next day that she began proceedings for a residence order. From almost the moment when the parties separated there were problems about contact. As matters stand today, direct contact has ceased &#8211; it has not taken place since 20 October 2001 and father has not even seen his daughter since 1 December 2001. Such indirect contact as is taking place is far from satisfactory. </p>

The system has failed him. &#8230; I feel desperately, desperately sorry for him. I am very sad that the system is as it is.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is also worth giving consideration to increasing the frequency with which anonymised family court judgments in general are made public. According to current convention, judgments are usually made public where they involve some important principle of law which in the opinion of the judge makes the case of interest to the law reporters. In view of the current climate and increasing complaints of &#8216;secrecy&#8217; in the family justice system, a broader approach to making judgments public may be desirable.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those who are critical of our family justice system may well see this case as exemplifying everything that is wrong with the system. I can understand such a view. The melancholy truth is that this case illustrates all too uncomfortably the failings of the system. There is much wrong with our system and the time has come for us to recognise that fact and to face up to it honestly. If we do not we risk forfeiting public confidence. The newspapers &#8211; and I mean newspapers generally, for this is a theme taken up with increasing emphasis by all sectors of the press &#8211; make uncomfortable reading for us. They suggest that confidence is already ebbing away. We ignore the media at our peril. We delude ourselves if we dismiss the views of journalists as unrepresentative of public opinion or as representative only of sectors of public opinion we think we can ignore. Responsible voices are raised in condemnation of our system. We need to take note. We need to act. And we need to act now.</p>

For that reason, because to name them would reveal where the parties come from, I have also anonymised the District Judges and Circuit Judges who dealt with this case in the County Court before it was transferred up to the High Court.</p>

The Annexe is long but I make no apologies for that. The history of the case is long &#8211; too long &#8211; and it is important that those who wish to ponder the implications of this judgment should have available to them proper details of what has happened. In due course I shall return to the Annexe in order to draw from it the lessons that I believe need to be learnt. But first I must flesh out in a little more detail some of the salient features of the litigation. What follows is taken in large part from the two judgments that I have given in private.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case raises issues some of which have recently been considered by Wall J (as he then was) in three important judgments: <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Intractable Contact Dispute: Interim Care Order) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/1024" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 1024 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 1024 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 FLR 636" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 FLR 636</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Re O (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/3031" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 3031 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 3031 (Fam)</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">A v A </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/142" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 142 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 142 (Fam)</ref>. <span style="font-style:italic">Re O </span>received much publicity, not all of it accurate. Wall J&#8217;s three judgments require to be read together. Not merely do they contain a number of immensely valuable and important insights and lessons which are of general application; they neatly illustrate three different types of what are conventionally called intractable contact disputes. At the risk of some over-simplification it can be seen that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span>it was the mother who was primarily responsible for the problems, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O </span>it was the father, and in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A </span>both parents shared the responsibility. The cases also illuminatingly illustrate different techniques for attempting to resolve disputes of this kind. In all three cases the mother was the residential parent. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span>residence was transferred to the father by means of an interim care order followed in due course by a residence order; in <span style="font-style:italic">Re O </span>the father&#8217;s contact was stopped; in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A </span>a joint residence order was made.</p>

His view of others was equally balanced; he had no difficulty in adopting another&#8217;s perspective and could easily acknowledge alternative viewpoints and alternative hypotheses.

But as early as 1 April 1999 the difficulties were such that the father was driven to apply for a penal notice. By 26 April 2000 matters had got so bad that on that day mother was given a suspended sentence of seven days&#8217; imprisonment by a Circuit Judge. On 20 February 2001 she was given an immediate sentence of fourteen days&#8217; imprisonment by another Circuit Judge for what he described as &#8220;flagrant breach of court orders&#8221;.

The last contact, as I have said, took place on 20 October 2001. The contact planned for 26 October 2001 was sabotaged by mother. I need not set out the details.

Moreover I have no doubt that [D]&#8217;s behaviour on this occasion was brought about by mother. [D] had clearly enjoyed contact on the two previous weekends. Why on earth should she not want to see her father again? It can only have been because of what mother was saying or doing. In the nature of things I cannot know what goes on between mother and [D] when they are at home together. But it is obvious that mother, even if she was not actively poisoning [D]&#8217;s mind against her father, was wholly unable to conceal from [D] her own antipathy to father and her own resistance to the very idea of contact. For this grave breach of her duty &#8211; not so much to the father and to the court: much more to [D] &#8211; mother bears a heavy responsibility.&#8221;</p>

Father behaved most foolishly and in a way which I am sure he has come to regret bitterly. But mother needs to ask herself why father behaved in that way. The plain answer is that it was her constant sabotage of contact that had goaded him beyond endurance. But for her endless prevarications, wrigglings and obstruction of contact the incident on 1 December 2001 would never have taken place. For father it was simply the last straw &#8211; and whatever it was that made him lose his temper it was something pretty trivial. But father would have had to be a saint not to have acted otherwise. It may have been father who made the first overt move but, overwhelmingly, it is mother who carries the responsibility &#8211; the legal, parental and moral responsibility &#8211; for what happened on that occasion.</p>

I simply refuse to accept that there is any equivalence &#8211; legal, moral, parental, or in any other respect &#8211; between a father who is &#8220;entrenched and rigid&#8221; in his desire to have the contact which everyone other than the mother thinks he should have with his daughter and a mother who is &#8220;entrenched and rigid&#8221; in her opposition to that contact. What is this father supposed to do? Just walk away from the problem &#8211; walk away from his daughter &#8211; in the faint hope that perhaps if he does not press for contact something will happen? Surely not! Is he to be criticised for continuing to invoke what thus far has proved to be the wholly inadequate assistance of the court? Certainly not! He would, in my judgment, be fully justified if he believed as a responsible and loving father that the time for appeasing mother has come to an end.&#8221;</p>

There were 43 hearings conducted by 16 different judges: nine hearings were before five different District Judges, 25 hearings were before no fewer than seven different Circuit Judges, and a further nine hearings were before four different High Court Judges. It is true that one Circuit Judge conducted nine hearings, another Circuit Judge five hearings, and another Circuit Judge four hearings, as I did also. But as against that modest degree of judicial continuity it has to be noted that two judges conducted only three hearings, five judges only two hearings and a further five judges only one hearing each.</p>

The parents&#8217; evidence (including exhibits) filed during the period down to the hearing before the Circuit Judge on 31 August 2001 ran to some 165 pages; since then there has been more than 400 further pages. The expert evidence runs to 388 pages. A total of more than 950 pages! This almost ceaseless proliferation of paper is in large measure the product of delay: every time the case is adjourned, further reports and more evidence are required to ensure that the court is kept up-to-date. </p>

Final hearings listed on 19 January, 29 June and 5 July 2000 and on the first available date after 16 March 2001 were all adjourned. The final hearing which had initially been fixed for 30 June 1999 did not in the event take place until 28 August 2001.

Allegations that turned out to be wholly groundless, and which could and should have been resolved at a very much earlier stage, were not judicially determined until August 2001. Allegations of domestic violence that surfaced in October 2000, and which I strongly suspect were either groundless or greatly exaggerated, have never been the subject of any judicial determination.  </p>

But only on 31 August 2001 was the step taken of involving an independent social worker with the remit of facilitating the implementation of overnight contact.

The original consent order made on 27 November 1998 provided for the father to have over seven hours unsupervised contact each weekend. Difficulties emerge: in plain language, the mother obstructs contact. On 7 June 1999 the contact is reduced to two hours at a contact centre. On 19 January 2000, and again on 12 April 2000, orders are made providing for unsupervised contact for three hours. Mother obstructs contact. On 26 April 2000 a suspended committal order is made.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This last point requires some elaboration. It is to be noted (as observed by Professor Gillian Douglas in her comment on the case in [2003] Fam Law 639) that, as defined by the Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Sylvester v Austria</span>, the obligation on the state to enforce its own court orders is more onerous that had previously been suggested in <span style="font-style:italic">Glaser v United Kingdom </span>at para [70]. Professor Douglas correctly pointed out that <span style="font-style:italic">Ignaccolo-Zenide v Romania </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Sylvester v Austria </span>were both cases in which the delays complained about arose in the context of proceedings under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. She speculated as to whether the Court had thus been &#8220;influenced by the summary nature of abduction proceedings&#8221; or whether the Court&#8217;s approach was in fact &#8220;a general one regarding delays in family matters, rather than one focussed exclusively on the special nature of abduction cases.&#8221; She went on to suggest that if the latter view turned out to be correct then there might be significant implications for our domestic practice. In fact the matter has since been resolved by the Court which, in <span style="font-style:italic">Hansen v Turkey </span>at para [107], reiterated in a non-Hague Convention case the approach it had earlier adopted in both <span style="font-style:italic">Ignaccolo-Zenide v Romania </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Sylvester v Austria</span>.</p>

At para 4.2 it identified a number of key elements to the achievement of that paramount objective, including &#8220;the highest practical level of judicial continuity and case management&#8221; (para 4.2.1) and timetabling of all cases to final hearing at the earliest practical stage and the reduction of intermediate hearings to no more than four (para 4.2.3).

Like him (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span>at paras [11], [19]) I believe that judicial continuity in private law cases of any complexity is essential, because, if delay is to be minimised, what he aptly referred to as &#8220;strict judicial control&#8221; is required. <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span>, as he pointed out at para [9], was a private law case that clearly demonstrated the benefits of judicial continuity. I do not suggest that private law cases need procedures as complicated and prescriptive as those set out in the Protocol.

Guardian&#8217;s reports, though immensely valuable, may not be enough. The children may need a social worker who can remain with them long enough to form a long-term relationship (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M </span>at para [127]). The children and their warring parents will often need and can often benefit from skilled social work intervention. That was the thinking that lay behind the appointment of the independent social worker in the present case by the Circuit Judge on 31 August 2001: her most vital function was to facilitate the implementation of overnight contact. Sometimes this will work, at least in part. <span style="font-style:italic">A v A </span>provides a striking example. Sometimes it will not work. In the present case it did not, largely I think because the independent social worker first came on to the scene far too late, and at a time which can be seen, albeit perhaps only with the priceless advantage of hindsight, to have been well after the point at which the situation was in all probability wholly irretrievable.</p>

In this kind of case experts and other outside agencies can often be much more use helping to facilitate contact rather than writing reports &#8211; preparing mother and child for contact, actually being there at hand on Saturday morning to make sure that hand-over takes place, or even acting as the go-between if mother cannot bring herself to meet father and there is no independent friend or relative who can help.    </p>

And allegations which could have been made at an earlier stage should be viewed with appropriate scepticism. Once findings have been made, everybody must thereafter approach the case on the basis of the facts as judicially found.

Judicial case management where the case is allocated to a single judge affords real opportunities to combat this problem, particularly if the parties are able to communicate with the judge, and the judge with the parties, by fax or e-mail. Other things being equal, swift, efficient, enforcement of existing court orders is surely called for at the first sign of trouble. A flabby judicial response sends a very damaging message to the defaulting parent, who is encouraged to believe that court orders can be ignored with impunity, and potentially also to the child. Thus, it may in some cases be appropriate for a judge who has concerns as to whether the contact ordered for Saturday will take place to include in the order a direction requiring the father&#8217;s solicitor to inform the judge on Monday morning by fax or e-mail if there have been any problems, on the basis (also spelt out in the order so that the mother can be under no illusions as to what will happen if she defaults) that the mother will thereupon be ordered to attend court personally on Tuesday morning and immediately arrested if she fails to attend. The problem can then perhaps be nipped in the bud. There is no reason why in a case of serious recalcitrance or defiance where it is possible to establish a breach of the order the court should not, then and there, make an immediate suspended committal order, so that the mother can be told in very plain terms that if she again prevents contact taking place the following Saturday she is likely to find herself in prison the following week.</p>

A willingness to impose very short sentences &#8211; one, two or three days &#8211; may suffice to achieve the necessary deterrent or coercive effect without significantly impairing a mother&#8217;s ability to look after her children.</p>
