	      </authorialNote>. I would suggest that anyone reading this judgment should at this point turn to and read that earlier judgment. Shortly stated, I awarded a suspended prison sentence of 6 weeks against the husband, the term of suspension being that he should pay the American judgment debt, interest and costs in the total sum of &#163;1,256,676 by 16:00 on 18 March 2013. I also charged the husband&#8217;s interest in Mayfield Avenue with the sum of &#163;1,256,676.</p>

That application came before me on 4 June 2013. The husband&#8217;s father had died on 27 May 2013 and the whole family was in mourning. As an act of mercy I deferred the execution of the warrant until 1 July 2013. I also directed that any application by the wife for declaratory relief in relation to the two properties should be issued by 11 June 2013 and gave consequential case management directions, which included a direction that the final hearing should be listed with a time estimate of 4 days.</p>

On the fourth day the case was adjourned for three more days on 10 March 2014, which were all fully used. In all I heard oral evidence from 12 witnesses and had to consider documentation filling 14 lever arch files. The inquiry has focussed on events which took place between 1989 and 2006. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Normally in a case such as this the parties start on the same line. However here in terms of credit and credibility the husband starts a long way behind the wife. I have already found him to be an unscrupulous husband and a dishonest litigant. I have made clear findings (as has Judge Blum in Georgia) that with his late father&#8217;s assistance he spirited a way a large amount of valuable jewellery with the intention of defeating the wife&#8217;s claim for a financial remedy. I have found that the jewellery (or its value) still exists, but its whereabouts are unknown (see para 49 of my earlier judgment). I therefore have sympathy with all legitimate attempts by the wife to locate assets against which to enforce the unsatisfied judgment debt owed to her. But she can only enforce against a property beneficially owned by the husband. In determining whether property is or is not owned by the husband I must rigorously apply our law of property and must not allow my feelings of sympathy for the wife to colour the exercise (although, of course, when issues of credibility between the husband and the wife arise I will have in mind my previous finding of dishonesty against the husband). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicable legal principles concerning a property dispute such as this are tolerably clear and have most recently been re-stated by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Kernott</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/53" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 53" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 53</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 AC 776" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 AC 776</ref>.

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">If there is an express declaration of beneficial interests then that is, almost invariably, the end of the matter. Such an express declaration can only be displaced if it has been procured by fraudulent conduct. In this case it is said by the wife that the signed TR1 for Mayfield Avenue is a sham. A sham is of course a species of fraud. It involves the parties entering into a dishonest compact, i.e. a conspiracy, to express the true state of affairs falsely in the written agreement. I will analyse the law relating to sham transactions a little later.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">If there is no express agreement about the beneficial interests then there is likely to be (at least) a tacit understanding. This is hardly surprising as one would expect that when people enter into what may very well be the most important economic transaction in their lives &#8211; buying a home &#8211; they would have a pretty clear understanding of who owned what share of it. In determining whether there was such a tacit understanding, and if so what it was, the court will look at all the evidence holistically and will examine the whole course of the parties&#8217; conduct in relation to the property.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">In the rare case where the evidence does not reveal a tacit understanding about ownership the court can reach for the presumptions. An obvious presumption is that beneficial ownership is the same as legal title (see <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Kernott</span> at paras 17 and 51(1)). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Another is the presumption of the resulting trust.

In his view it would be &#8220;an abuse of the legal technique for ascertaining or imputing intention to apply to transactions between the post-war generation of married couples 'presumptions' which are based upon inferences of fact which an earlier generation of judges drew as to the most likely intentions of earlier generations of spouses belonging to the propertied classes of a different social era.&#8221; Some commentators believe that the doctrine has a medieval origin. The principal problem with it is that that it allows the &#8220;solid tug of money&#8221; (as Woodhouse J evocatively put it (echoing George Eliot) in <span style="font-style:italic">Hofman v Hofman</span> [1965] NZLR 795 at 800) &#8220;to submerge any faint suggestion that other [non-financial] contributions play a valuable part in the acquisition of family assets&#8221;.</p>

Although there are different degrees of emphasis and nuance all of the Justices in <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Kernott</span> accepted that where a tacit agreement could not be found by a process of inference the court could impute to the parties a fair agreement which they never in fact made but which they should &#8220;be taken&#8221; as having made (see paras 45, 60, 72, 85(2))).  Of course, as Woodhouse J pointed out, this involves a &#8220;fictional attribution of intention&#8221;, but the process has a long pedigree. One only needs to remind oneself of Lord Denning MR&#8217;s statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Appleton v Appleton</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1965] 1 WLR 25" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1965">[1965] 1 WLR 25</ref> at 28 to see how the wheel has turned full circle. There he said &#8220;A judge can only do what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Sometimes this test has been put in the cases: What term is to be implied? What would the parties have stipulated had they thought about it? That is one way of putting it. But, as they never did think about it at all, I prefer to take the simple test: What is reasonable and fair in the circumstances as they have developed, seeing that they are circumstances which no one contemplated before?&#8221;  I cannot see any difference between that statement and that of Lord Wilson in para 87 where he rhetorically asked &#8220;where equity is driven to impute the common intention, how can it do so other than by search for the result which the court itself considers fair?&#8221; </p>

In para 11 she refers to the husband having transferred Mayfield Avenue into the names of himself, his parents and his sibling. But beyond those references, almost in passing, the properties do not feature in the judgment. There is no finding concerning the present extent of the husband&#8217;s interest in them and their value did not feature in the marital balance sheet on which the award was based (see para 11 of my earlier judgment). Similarly in the Debtors Act 1869 proceedings before me the wife&#8217;s case was squarely that the husband had only a 25% interest in Mayfield Avenue; Pembroke Road did not feature at all &#8211; see paras 41 and 52. It is the wife&#8217;s case now that she has been the victim of a conspiracy between the husband and his family concerning the ownership of these properties. It is thus surprising that this view does not seem to been expressed in the previous two sets of proceedings.  </p>

I do not accept this. The documents show that the husband and father were the partners and that the wife and the mother were employees paid modest wages. Mr Shah told me that the father played the principal role in the shop. He showed me the original VAT return which discloses a VAT refund for the first period of &#163;21,018. This would suggest initial expenditure of &#163;140,000. The accounts from 1996 have been produced. Mr Kelly has prepared a schedule based on them. They show reasonable profits and drawings.

The TR1 states that the transferred would hold the property on trust for themselves as tenants in common in equal shares. The Form states that the transaction fell within category L, for stamp duty purposes, that is to say that the transfer was for no consideration and thus attracted no stamp duty. This is consistent with a prior understanding that it had at all times been held in the unified family economy which I have described. </p>

She says that it was done to defeat her claims. As against that the husband disputes that the marriage was unhappy at that time. Alpa describes the husband and wife as being blissfully happy. And it is a fact that the marriage continued for another 7 years. If the exercise was pure asset protection then it is very odd that the husband should have left himself with a 25% share. </p>

On 3 July 2009 Yogesh swore a Form E. In it he declared that he owned a 25% share of Mayfield Avenue with a value of &#163;91,200. It was his biggest asset by far (his total assets were expressed to be &#163;147,262). If the property was in truth 100% owned beneficially by the husband it is hard to see why Yogesh would be declaring 25% of it as his in his own divorce. Alpa confirmed that she settled her financial remedy claim on the basis that this 25% share was Yogesh&#8217;s asset. </p>

This peculiar statement is the high point of Mr Kelly&#8217;s case. He says it is a smoking gun. In his oral testimony Yogesh blamed his solicitors for these words but has declined to waive privilege about his discussions with them. Mr Kelly says I should draw inferences from that refusal. Mr Kelly says that the only logical meaning of those words is that the husband owned the property and that he donated 25% to Yogesh on the basis that if there was a sale of the property that share would revert to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the husband</span>. But the problem with this interpretation is that if it was a conditional gift then why was Yogesh declaring all its value as his in the property section of the Form E? On the other hand, if Yogesh actually paid off half the mortgage why did he not say so in his Form E? </p>

These three items add up to &#163;180,000. Mr Kelly has undertaken an analysis of Yogesh&#8217;s tax returns from 1996 &#8211; 2006 and has calculated that after allowing a very modest sum for living expenses the total of his after tax earnings in that decade was &#163;154,000. Therefore he says that Yogesh cannot be telling the truth about sums which were available to him. On the other hand the bank statement for YK jewellers shows a balance of &#163;115,120 as at 30 May 2002, shortly before the redemption of the mortgage.</p>
