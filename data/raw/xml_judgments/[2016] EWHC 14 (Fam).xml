It follows an application by Paul Worthington, the father of Poppi and of two of the other children.  In the course of the hearing, evidence about the interpretation of post-mortem findings was given by six professional witnesses, three of whom had given evidence at an earlier fact-finding hearing in March 2014.  That evidence must now be put together with the evidence given at the earlier hearing so that a final conclusion can be reached.</span></p>

It should not be forgotten that the death of Poppi was investigated and required a coronial investigation because there is reason to suspect that her death was violent or unnatural and because of the uncertainty over the cause of death.  It hardly needs stating that the public investigation of such deaths is of great importance. [It] follows that the inquest which was conducted last&#160;October was irregular because it failed to perform this central function.  Furthermore, it did not result in the recording of the facts which are required by the statutory scheme&#8230;. This conclusion is sufficient for the application to succeed."  </span></p>

However, I have expressed a provisional view that it should be published at or around the time that the rehearing begins, rather than it being withheld until that hearing ends. There is a proper public interest in the course that these proceedings, and the other procedures surrounding Poppi's death, have taken. The media will be able to describe matters more effectively if the original findings can be described at the point when they come under review.

The question of publicity was considered at a final directions hearing on 2 November, when I heard submissions from the parties and the media orally and, subsequently, in writing.  Having done so, I directed that the main part of the 2014 judgment would be published at the outset of the further hearing.  The published sections would include a narrative of the events surrounding Poppi&#8217;s death, an account of the concerns expressed about the investigations that followed, and a summary of the medical evidence that was then available.  The only part of the judgment that was not to be published was the section containing the court's findings, which would be published following the further hearing.  As to the conduct of the hearing, I directed that it would take place in private but that, subject to any directions given during the course of the hearing, there could be daily news reporting.

Hearings themselves remain private, but significant judgments should be published.  In cases involving serious medical treatment for children and incapacitated adults, the Family Court and the Court of Protection sit in public, but the identities of the individuals are usually protected by reporting restriction orders.  On 19 November 2015, a pilot scheme was announced under which hearings in the Court of Protection will be held in public, subject to reporting restrictions where necessary: </span><a class="Hyperlink" href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/announcements/court-of-protection-to-test-increased-access-for-public-and-media/" style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt;color:#0000FF">https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/announcements/court-of-protection-to-test-increased-access-for-public-and-media/</a></p>

There is a strong public interest in receiving information about the circumstances of Poppi&#8217;s death, now that the main obstacles to this happening have been removed.  Even so, the children and their mother will be affected by publicity, and require the ongoing protection of the reporting restriction order.</span></p>

The mother says she seemed to have a bit of a cold and she slept for rather longer than usual during the day.  C, S and P were left at home with the father while the mother took AM, J and A to school, and then returned home.  A friend of the mother&#8217;s called round with her daughter.  P was put in her cot to sleep and woken by her mother.  The mother says she felt warm and that she gave her Calpol.  The mother then left to collect the children from school, leaving P and S with the father.  When she returned, the maternal grandparents came round to the house with their three grandchildren.  They stayed for about half an hour.  After they left the only people in the home for the rest of the night were the parents and the six children.</span></p>

Having regard to the garments that P was wearing when admitted to hospital, I find that the mother is probably correct in her memory that she was put to bed wearing a nappy, a vest that fastened between the legs with poppers and a pair of pyjamas.  I prefer this to the father's statements that she was wearing a babygro or an all in one suit.  </span></p>

He went into her room and found her sitting in the corner of her cot.  She was rigid and stiff and he thought that she may have had a bad dream.  He picked her up and cuddled her and took her to his room.  He sat down on the edge of the bed with P on his lap.  He tried to give her her dummy, but her teeth were clenched and she would not open her mouth.  He thought that she was trying to pass a stool and he undid her clothing to see what was in her nappy.  He describes loosening the sticky tabs on the nappy.  He thought from the smell that she had passed a stool.  She became relaxed and stopped screaming.  He laid her on the bed crossways with her head on a pillow.  At this point AM woke and shouted &#8216;P&#8217;s woke me up&#8217; and came to the doorway of her room.  He told her to go back to sleep.  He then went downstairs to fetch a clean nappy.  While there, he exchanged a few words with the mother about what he was doing, and then went back upstairs.  P was quiet so he did not disturb her but instead got into bed himself.  After a few minutes he for some reason put out his hand and touched P.  He realised that something was wrong.  She was limp.  He picked her up and ran downstairs, calling for the mother to get an ambulance.</span></p>

Although Dr Armour holds a clear opinion about the nature of the post-mortem findings, I reject any suggestion that she has jumped to conclusions before, during or after the examination.  While I am critical of the unconscionable delay in the production of her report, her evidence was clear and considered and I find that she approached her task with seriousness and skill.   Likewise, Dr Leadbeatter gave valuable assistance.  He was a cautious witness who measured his words with exactitude, a very proper approach in a case of this kind.  In that I am bound in a very few instances to prefer the opinion of one pathologist over that of the other, this implies no criticism of the other.</span></p>

This conclusion is strongly supported by the appearance of the stool in the rectum, seen in a photograph, which appears soft and clear of blood.

If it is bruising, it could be due to sexual abuse.  Taken in isolation, it is worrying and difficult to explain.  He has never seen this finding in over 30 years&#8217; experience.  It is unique and, where one has not seen it before and there is no peer-reviewed research, one is cautious.

Dr Armour said that she had never seen anal injuries such as these as a result of constipation.  There is no evidence that P was constipated at or around the time of her death or that she passed a stool of this kind.  On the contrary, the reliable descriptions are of her stools being loose.

I was not impressed by his account.  His description of being woken by a cry and then removing P from her cot in a most unusual condition (clenched teeth, rigid body) before loosening her nappy and leaving her on the bed was puzzling.  It is hard to understand why he should have loosened her nappy or why, having gone downstairs to get another nappy, he should have begun to go back to sleep without changing P while leaving her on the bed.  There is also no explanation as to why he would then have reached out to touch P, when his whole object would on his account have been to keep her asleep as long as possible.  Moreover, in the overall circumstances, the fact that this was the only occasion (according to the father) when he and P were in the bed together raises concern when taken together with the fact that P suffered injury on that very occasion.  Overall, the sequence of events that the father describes is unconvincing as an account of a parent comforting a distressed child in normal circumstances.   </span></p>

All that can be said is that at some point after 2 am he removed P from her cot and took off her pyjama bottoms and her nappy.  He then inserted his penis or another object into her anus, causing her injury.  He probably replaced the nappy, which P filled with faeces at some point before or at the time that she collapsed.

As has been said elsewhere, there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability.  The improbability of the father assaulting P in this way must give way to the evidence that establishes that she was in fact assaulted.  As to the argument that this was a crowded house, the fact remains that the father had the clear opportunity to carry out the assault, however risky it might have been.  On his own account, the presence of two very young sleeping children in his own bedroom did not stop him from watching pornography. </span></p>

For example, that nothing concerning would have been found on his laptop, that his DNA would not have been found in the last nappy, and that other items were properly preserved and tested with negative results.  In the circumstances, he is entitled to these assumptions.  Likewise, there is a credible innocent explanation for the presence of DNA on the shaft of his penis.</span></p>

The non-production of sperm that may have followed the father's vasectomy could reduce the likelihood of seminal fluid being detected, particularly as five days had passed before the swabs were taken in a suboptimal way.  The absence of any report of P&#8217;s blood in the bedroom or living room would seem at first sight to be highly significant, but has to be taken along with the evidence that clearly establishes that she was bleeding in the ambulance moments later. </span></p>

However, it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond the finding that I have made.  Dr Armour&#8217;s hypothesis may be correct, but, like Dr Leadbeatter, I consider that the evidence on this question is not sufficiently strong to underpin her conclusion.  I have taken account of the post-mortem findings relating to the lip, the throat and the lungs.  I conclude that they are suspicious but unexplained.  Having heard from Dr A, I cannot exclude the possibility that one or more of the injuries to the pharynx and oesophagus might have been caused by the attempts at intubation during a very difficult process of attempted resuscitation.  Likewise, suffocation is not the only mechanism by which the marks to the lip might have been caused.  The blood in the nose may be associated with abuse, but I cannot discount the possibility that it may have been caused during the protracted CPR at home, in the ambulance and in hospital.  The extent of the intra-alveolar haemorrhages is more than mild but is not diagnostic.  In conclusion, it is possible that P died of suffocation, but this has not been proved by the existing evidence.  </span></p>

Given that Poppi&#8217;s body was refrigerated, the appearances at post-mortem were not in Dr Armour&#8217;s view significantly affected by autolysis, and such post-mortem changes as are seen in the sections are minimal and easy to identify.  The red blood cells and connective tissue cells were all intact.  Autolysis certainly cannot explain the bleeding at around the time of death. </span></p>

It is different from the concept of purge, which is a later phenomenon.  Having further considered the question of virus, he agreed that it did not help.

If on the other hand there is no positive evidence of trauma, she could not exclude anal penetration, but could not say on the balance of probabilities that it had occurred.  She said that the more of the signs that were confirmed, the greater her confidence.  In particular, she would place weight on perianal bruising and, because of the possible association with bleeding, on lacerations, for which she could think of no other explanation.  The undoubted anal dilatation is not a sign to be ignored, but it would not on its own persuade her that there had been penetration.  From a clinical perspective, trauma would be the first differential diagnosis for findings of this sort.</span></p>

In slightly older living children who give a clear history of recent penetrative anal abuse, there are not always signs of injury.  The anal sphincter of a child that is not toilet-trained will offer less resistance, and penetration therefore carries less risk of injury.  The dimensions of the penetrating object are of course relevant.

Disagreeing with Dr Evans, she regarded it is inevitable that there would be full-thickness laceration of the anal margin to the rectum.

She did not consider that virus could be the cause, describing the hypothesis as too far-fetched.  It is unlikely that the bleeding arose from congestion, which is a relatively common finding in any tissue.  She says that she had no pathological explanation for how the blood came from the anus, especially as there was no circulation.  She had never seen blood, as opposed to bloodstained fluid, in this location.  She regarded the appearances under discussion as being insufficient to explain the bleeding, though she deferred to the forensic physicians.

For Drs Cary, Kiho and Aziz, the finding adds nothing and is of no significance, alone or with the other appearances.

The level of disagreement from eminent experts with Dr Armour&#8217;s conclusions should incline the court against accepting her interpretations.  They submit that she conceived the idea of abuse from the outset and has interpreted ambiguous signs in accordance with that notion.  Her views have remained fixed and her evidence in relation to the two additional findings is likely to be wrong and must undermine her overall hypothesis.  To prefer Dr Armour&#8217;s evidence over that of the other distinguished pathologists would be fundamentally unsafe.

They argue that the further evidence given by Dr Armour about foreign material does not assist in reaching conclusions about the medical evidence overall.  In summary, they observe that the burden of the evidence from the pathologists is that the pathological signs do not support a conclusion that Poppi was anally penetrated by an adult male penis or similar object.

I reject, as having no recognised medical foundation, the hypothesis that the bleeding was the result of the escape of blood from congested cells due to some pressure effect at the time of death.  Nor is there any indication of what natural process might have caused a pressure effect.  It is not plausible that bleeding from the anus was the unprecedented result of prolonged resuscitation, particularly when Poppi had no coagulation disorder and where there were signs of bleeding before most of the resuscitation took place.  The possibility that blood came from higher up the gastrointestinal tract was and remains excluded, and the evidence is that Poppi neither suffered from constipation nor from chronic diarrhoea of the kind that might create anal fissures.  </span></p>

Although Dr Armour is in a minority, she has focused closely on the question and maintained her reasoning.  Dr Cary was concerned, as was Dr Aziz, that a greater amount of bruising would accompany penile penetration, but this argument does not assist in the determination of whether these small bruises existed or not.  Overall, I remain satisfied by the evidence of Dr Armour that these appearances do exist and that, on the balance of probabilities, they are bruises.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'"/><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Insofar as Dr Aziz and Dr Evans differ as to the injuries that would be caused by penetration, I prefer the evidence of Dr Evans, which is that the picture is variable.  </span></p>

I remain satisfied on the balance of probability that there was extravasation of blood into surrounding tissue and that this represents a bruise or a haemorrhage.  </span></p>

I did not find this aspect of the evidence of Dr Armour to be convincing.  There is a clear possibility that the matter to which she refers entered the pelvic cavity during the post-mortem process.  In relation to this aspect of the evidence, I prefer the views of Drs Leadbeatter, Cary and Kiho to those of Dr Armour, which are no more than speculative.  Unlike a number of the previous appearances, there is an explanation for the presence of faeculent material in the pelvic cavity that is at least as plausible as a traumatic explanation.  It is possible that Dr Armour is right, but the available evidence does not support her contention and her assertion to Mr Rowley that she was sure that there was an unseen tear in the rectal lumen was out of keeping with the generally measured tone of her evidence.  </span></p>

These conditions were subtle but, taken together, they are significant.  With regard to the first four, my conclusion, expressed at paragraph 136 of the earlier judgment, is unchanged, namely that the medical evidence points to their being caused by penetrative trauma from outside the body.  I find that the appearances in the right parametrium were also likely to have been the result of trauma, but I am not now able to reach a conclusion about the form that this took and whether it occurred in the same manner as the other findings.  It is as possible that it is the result of attempted cannulation or resuscitation as that it was caused by penetrative assault. </span></p>

I have considered a range of alternative possibilities, described above, and none of them is at all plausible.  I have also considered the possibility that the post-mortem findings and the bleeding cannot be explained.  If that was the proper conclusion, I would not hesitate to reach it.  However, this is not a case where a child has collapsed without any abnormal signs.  The evidence is not at the frontiers of science.  Poppi was bleeding, there must have been a source for the bleeding, and there is evidence that explains it.  </span></p>

It does not do so simply because others hold different views to those of a witness whose evidence has been accepted.  This further hearing took place because it was asserted that there was evidence capable of establishing an alternative plausible hypothesis for the bleeding, namely that it may have come from congested blood vessels that had been affected by a viral infection.  But even before the hearing began, that assertion had vanished like frost in May.  </span></p>

Careful assessment of the meticulous pathological and paediatric evidence has clearly established that the injuries were the result of trauma from outside the body.  </span></p>

That remains my conclusion.  Some witnesses at this hearing have expressed the view that penetration with a penis would have been expected to cause more obvious injuries.  That may be so, but the evidence does not exclude any one of a number of distressing possibilities.  As I said before, it is not possible to reconstruct the exact sequence of events that led to Poppi&#8217;s collapse without a truthful account from the father.  </span></p>
