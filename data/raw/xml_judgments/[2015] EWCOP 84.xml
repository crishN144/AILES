[</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">There was a footnote, numbered 193, which is set out in the following paragraph</span><span style="font-size:12pt">]. Even if the EPA did not make specific provision, however, it is clear that problems could still arise. For example, the awarding of a fixed annual fee might prove unsatisfactory in the light of inflation or, indeed, if it assumed a large volume of work which never materialised. But even providing for &#8216;reasonable remuneration&#8217; would leave open the question of what was reasonable in any given case. We therefore recommend that the court should be able to give directions generally as to the attorney&#8217;s remuneration and expenses (whether or not the EPA made specific provision) to cover such matters as the repayment by him of excessive remuneration and the payment to him of additional remuneration. Thus the attorney would have to apply to the court for directions if he wanted to claim remuneration in excess of that (if any) to which he was entitled under the power. This might happen as a result of a substantial and unforeseen increase in his duties. We would expect the court to be circumspect in considering such requests. One relevant factor would be the likelihood and relative desirability of the attorney disclaiming the power (in favour, perhaps, of [deputyship]) if his request was rejected.&#8221;</span></p>
