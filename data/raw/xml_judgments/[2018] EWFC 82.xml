His mother is M and his father, T.  He has played no role in these proceedings nor in N&#8217;s life to date. </span></p>

The Local Authority, Northamptonshire County Council issued an application for a care order on 12 May 2017 and on the same date, N was made the subject of an interim care order.  He was initially placed in foster care but, shortly thereafter, he was placed with the maternal grandparents, where he remains to date.   </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Local Authority alleged that the mother had fabricated and exaggerated medical symptoms in N throughout the whole of his life until he was taken into care.  They sought findings of fact against the mother which if made by this court, would lead them to apply for a special guardianship order to be made in favour of the maternal grandparents. </span></p>

The mother opposed the findings sought in relation to the allegations that she has exaggerated or fabricated medical symptoms for N, although she does accept that she was an overly anxious mother.  She sought the return of N to her care.  If this was not possible, she supported the placement with her mother and her stepfather, but under the auspices of a child arrangement order and not a special guardianship order.  This matter has been listed before me for a composite fact-find and welfare hearing.   </span></p>

It is this.  In the criminal jurisdiction the &#8220;lie&#8221; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt.  As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane&#8217;s judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8220;capable of amounting to a corroboration&#8217;.  In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">R v Middleton</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [2001] Crim. L.R. 251.</span><span/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court.  Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8217;. </span></p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">&#8216;M has presented with episodic seizure-like activities since the age of 14.  Investigations of possible epilepsy have consistently proved negative.  Her condition has variously been described as a somatisation disorder or dissociative seizures.  More recently, her condition has been described by her treating neurologist Dr S as a non-epileptic attack disorder.  All of these diagnoses refer essentially to the same condition.  The variation arising principally from the perspective of the treating doctor.  For the sake of consistency, I adopt Dr S&#8217;s diagnosis of non-epileptic attack disorder.  N has been described by his mother as exhibiting episodic seizure-like activity since the age of six months.  Seizure activity has not been observed by others except perhaps by Ms T, nursery nurse in April 2016.  Extensive investigation, including a 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalogram with video monitoring on 9 May 2017 has not revealed evidence of his epilepsy.  His condition has been described as factitious or induced illness.  This resulting in the safeguarding concerns which have led to N&#8217;s reception into care.  In summary, therefore, based on the available medical information, M exhibits a non-epileptic attack disorder.  N exhibits a factitious or induced illness, in this case meaning he does not have epilepsy but his mother is imputing this condition onto him&#8217;.  </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">&#8216;At the time of my own assessment, M was able to provide a very extensive account of both herself and her son.  She seemingly accepted her diagnosis of nonepileptic attack disorder but still remained convinced that she had been experiencing epileptic attacks.  For example, she reported having a massive seizure during the course of her pregnancy with N.  She also appeared convinced that N also suffers from epilepsy and is at risk of serious harm if not properly managed.  For example, when N was in hospital during May 2017, she feared he would become dangerously ill if not provided with oxygen.  However, in my opinion, M&#8217;s beliefs do not have the unshakeable and fantastic quality typical of psychotic dilutions so they are better classified as over-valued ideas.  M did not report any other inter-current psychological symptoms such as anxiety or depression.  On the face of it, M currently presents with a specific overvalued idea concerning her own health and her son&#8217;s health.  In themselves, overvalued ideas are not diagnostic of any psychiatric condition.  In view of the absence of intercurrent psychological symptoms or any diagnostic medical state of abnormalities, I consider that M is not suffering from any overt mental illness at the present time.  In summary, M presents with an enduring overvalued idea, not amounting to a delusional belief concerning her diagnosis of epilepsy.  She seemingly maintains that she is suffering from such a condition even though at an intellectual level, she can identify the diagnosis of non-epileptic attack disorder.  She has also become concerned that her son has suffered from epilepsy since the age of six months and remains concerned about his ongoing health, in spite of the absence of a confirmed medical diagnosis.  Although not currently mentally ill, she displays a pattern of behaviour which may plausibly arise from an underlying borderline personality disorder.  In terms of prognosis, I consider that by their very nature, M&#8217;s overvalued ideas concerning both her own and her son&#8217;s health are likely to persist indefinitely&#8217;. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">&#8216;Over-valued ideas can prove debilitating for the person experiencing them, but usually do not become seriously dysfunctional, unless they extend to involve other people such as, for example, in cases of harassment and stalking.  Currently, there is no medical treatment which can reliably alter the course of over-valued ideas.  Psychological approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy have been attempted, but the academic literature provides little evidence for sustained benefit.  Counselling approaches have also been attempted but this is more supportive in nature, rather than a method for altering the course of a strongly-held idea.  Overall, there is currently no clearly beneficial therapeutic approach which can be recommended.  In respect of prognosis, over-valued ideas typically persist for years and sometimes for life.  In M&#8217;s case, Dr S&#8217;s nudge approach to anti-convulsant medication withdrawal seems entirely appropriate, although it appears that little act or progress has been made to date.  M&#8217;s over-valued idea concerning her own epilepsy has resulted in her extensive involvement with medical services, including both emergency services and investigative procedures.  </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">If this pattern were to continue, it would reduce her availability to provide continuity of care for her child.  This could have a substantial negative impact in the absence of a supportive partner.  In M&#8217;s case, her over-valued idea has extended to incorporate her son.  Consequently, from the age of six months, N has experienced a substantial number of hospital attendances for both emergency and investigative purposes.  However, in respect of possible epilepsy, these attendances cannot have been beneficial, except only to exclude the condition.  This also reduced N&#8217;s opportunities for more normal family life and participation and developmental opportunities.  The impact is likely to become more significant as N grows older.  For example, through failed nursery or school attendance.  Overall, M&#8217;s specific over-valued idea concerning epilepsy is likely to distract her away from her parenting role and cause her to pursue a course of action in respect of N which could not be positively beneficial for him.  Inevitably, assessment of future risk is somewhat speculative.  The most likely outcome could be N&#8217;s withdrawal from appropriate, developmental or educational opportunities through unnecessary medical attendances.  This could arise particularly if M were to seek a succession of further opinions in support of her own idea.  This could also include frequent relocation in her search for support.  Somewhat more speculatively, M could seek to treat N for epilepsy by sharing her anti-convulsant medication with him.  Furthermore, M&#8217;s current overvalued idea could plausibly extend to other medical conditions for which she may seek medical attention.  For example, she was briefly concerned that N may have a hole in his heart.  I emphasis the extent of these possible risks is unquantifiable&#8217;. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">&#8216;N has had a high number of contacts with health professionals in his 21-months of life.  This is unusual for a child who has no diagnosed long-term disorder and no objective persisting clinical signs.  This pattern of contact is also unusual because of the high occurrence of normal physical signs of investigation results, despite being presented frequently as unwell.  There are an unusually high number of health contact for which there is no documented corresponding clinical signs identified by the assessing health professional.  N has recently been confirmed to have iron deficiency for which he is receiving iron supplements.  The cause is usual nutritional in toddlers, N is otherwise in good physical health and is meeting his developmental milestones.  There are long-standing concerns by the mother that N has seizures, despite assurances to the contrary by his paediatric medial team.  Reported events have not been verified by third party observations and clinical observations.  There have been diagnostic challenges as the pattern of description of these movement seizures have not tallied with known medical conditions such as epileptic seizures or epilepsy mimics.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by a high incident of inaccurate diagnosis and up to a third of people with a diagnosis of epilepsy have indirect diagnosis.  Video telemetry done in N did not identify any abnormal movement or behaviour and the EEG was reported as normal.  In my opinion, there is no evidence to suggest N has epilepsy seizures&#8217;. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.99in;margin-right:0.04in">&#8216;There are concerns by the mother that N has seizures, reported events such as vacant episodes and responsiveness and abnormal motor movements have not been verified by either third party observations or clinical investigations.  There have been diagnostic challenges as the pattern description of these movements or events do not tally with known medical conditions.  Clinical and laboratory examination after these events have been normal.  The events have not been independently observed and there was a normal EEG.  EEG is a test that detects electrical activity in the brain.  The EEG during reported events and in between events have been reported as normal.  A reported event by the mother during the video telemetry did not reveal any abnormal movements.  The view of his local medical team is that the reported events are not epilepsy fits.  N is now 24-months-old he has an unusually high number of contact with health professionals, 13 A&amp;E attendances, nine in-patient admissions and 90 communications with health are quite unusual for a child that has no diagnosed long-term disorder and no persisting clinical signs.  This is also unusual because the absence of abnormal verified symptoms and normal physical signs investigation results.  The challenges of medicine are usually more of interpretation over normal physical times and abnormal laboratory investigation results that do not fit recognised physiological processes.  From the medical records made available to me, there is no evidence to suggest that N has any long-term disorder.  He has iron deficiency and iron deficiency in a toddler is a time-limited condition and would resolve once his iron stores are replenished with iron supplementation.  N&#8217;s daily life and function must have been confusing and chaotic with frequent contact with multiple stranger professionals.  The impact of the frequent health physicians he visits, and physical examinations may be difficult to fully understand because of his very young age.  N  was reported to be very distressed when an ECG was attempted in April 2017.  Whilst this is not unusual in children, it cannot be ignored.  The impact on interaction with peers due to frequent clinical appointments may lead to poor stimulation with potential to socialise isolation and poor social communication skills.  It is unclear what opportunities N has for regular peer interaction, apart from the play activity he was reported to attend at a play centre in Milton Keynes.  There is a very strong danger of perpetuating and medicalising the unknown with further risk of subjecting N to unnecessary anxiety by further investigations.  FII is a diagnosis continuing.  The factors that cause carers to progress along the continuum are not fully known.  N is at risk of induction of symptoms&#8217;. </p>

The latter is an innate part of an individual&#8217;s behaviour and functioning.  It is not necessarily a life-long affliction but in a person who does not recognise the need to change, it is an immensely difficult condition to treat.  Indeed, there is no recognised treatment.  More importantly, the individual with over-valued ideas knows what they are doing.  They are aware of their actions and the consequences of same.  A person with over-valued ideas is more susceptible to be diagnosed as suffering from a borderline personality disorder.  Dr Campbell was hesitant about making this diagnosis in respect of the mother and, ultimately, did not do so. </p>
