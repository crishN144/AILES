The medical evidence as to the existence of injuries and their possible causes, as identified by treating doctors, are very often the starting point for an examination of whether harm has been inflicted on a child.  They together with the views of medical experts remain matters of central importance.  But as I sought to make clear in <span style="font-style:italic">K. D. &amp; L., </span>doctors and medical  experts are not decision-makers in these proceedings and, as they accept, they do not have as much information as the court and cannot make findings of  fact as to clinical descriptions given by the parents  and the  credibility of the parents.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.75in">In my view, it is most unlikely that the factual examination,  and thus the forensic process relating to it, can properly rest only on a chain of reasoning based on (a) the view of medical experts that the most likely  cause is shaking or shaking and impact, and (b) the identification of the pool by reference to the carers of the child.  That is likely only to be a step in the process, and there will a need to be a further examination of the pool and whether, given the existence of the pool, from those starting points based on role, opportunity and timing, the uncertainty and fog that creates (because the pool has more than one member) can be removed or cleared away applying a more likely than not approach.  So here questions have to be asked and answered in respect of both the Mother and the Father whether, notwithstanding the possibility that they injured &#8216;R&#8217;, given their roles and opportunity, by reference to presence and timing, the events of the relevant day or period found the conclusion either that all the circumstances show that there is not a real possibility that he or she injured &#8216;R&#8217; by shaking him with or without impact, or that it is  more likely than not that he or she did not do so.</p>

None of them were put to him as the, or a possible, cause of &#8216;R&#8217;s&#8217; injuries by any of the parties, or indeed, by me.

This, however, was not the point made against him, rather the point made against him was that a general question as to whether the Mother had injured or done anything to injure the child (which she answered in the negative) and the other points made to her in cross-examination were insufficient as a matter of procedural fairness to enable the local authority to seek fairly a finding that against a background of the timings and events of the day, the Mother had shaken &#8216;R&#8217; without expressly putting it to her, in that context.  </p>

Also it was acknowledged and accepted that the very initial accounts were given, against a backdrop of a medical investigation into meningitis or some other natural cause of the problem.  However, as I have indicated from the timetable, the possibility of N. A. H. I. came to be considered fairly quickly within the timetable.  It also has to be remembered that the parents, following information as to the extreme condition of their son, faced a journey from one hospital to another.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">This is a brief overview and was not, as I understand it, challenged.  &#8216;R&#8217; woke at around 7:00 to 7:30 and was fed by his mother, and then went back to sleep.  Around mid-morning - ten-to eleven &#8211; &#8216;R&#8217; had another feed.  After that, and this appears, for example, in the Father&#8217;s statement, there was a period in which the Mother chatted to the Father whilst sitting on the bottom of the stairs leading up to the attic, and he was doing some D. I. Y. attaching latches and handles to &#8216;O&#8217;s&#8217; bedroom door.  The common evidence of the parents was that during that conversation the Mother was holding &#8216;R&#8217; in her arms, and they were engaged in a perfectly normal conversation.  At this point, the evidence of the parents was that neither of them noticed anything wrong with &#8216;R&#8217;, it is then common ground on their account, and was not challenged, that &#8216;R&#8217; was then placed in his Moses basket just within the parent&#8217;s bedroom over the landing from the door upon which the Father was working.  At about 12:30 the Mother left to take &#8216;O&#8217; to nursery.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">The Mother then went by car to the nursery.  Her evidence is that she noticed that &#8216;O&#8217; was asleep and she stopped in a lay-by to give her a few extra moments sleep before taking her into the nursery, the Mother says that she was checking messages on her mobile phone.  She then went to drop &#8216;O&#8217; off at the nursery.  On the way home she visited a chemist to get a prescription.  That took rather longer than she had expected but she got the prescription, and then she visited another shop making an appointment, and then returned home.  As I have already indicated, on her return home she found that the Father and &#8216;R&#8217; were not there.  I will return to the Father&#8217;s account of what happened later, but the timetable indicates that he arrived at the doctor&#8217;s surgery very shortly before 1:28.  The doctor&#8217;s surgery is not far from the house.  It is his case, and this was not challenged, that he started to run to the surgery, holding &#8216;R&#8217; in his arms having had some difficulty in getting out of the front door because it was blocked by a toolbox, but then stopped a passing motorist who took him to the doctor&#8217;s surgery.</p>

There are also more problems included as to the way he behaved with his colic.  Also, and I will come back to it because it is a point the local authority rely on, the mother&#8217;s description of the feeds, and in particular the eleven o'clock feed, change in that that feed is described as, one in which he did not take much milk.</p>

They make the point that, notwithstanding the changes in description that occurred the overall picture of this child is of a child who for him was fine.  For example, they point to the evidence in the police statements that when the Mother was leaving the house she had said something along the lines: &#8220;I don't like leaving him because he&#8217;s crying&#8221;. Also there was evidence that there was an exchange between the parents along the lines of:  &#8220;He may need feeding&#8221;.</p>

I shall not deal with this in great detail because, as I have indicated, the local authority do not seek to make a major point from these developments because they accept that the earlier accounts could naturally be compressed either by the Father or by the note taker, which it seems to me is a proper recognition by them of the circumstances in which the initial accounts were taken.  The development and thus changes to the account has to be mentioned, however, because it is part of the history of this case.  In broad terms the change from the records of the very early accounts is that in them the Father is not recorded as having taken &#8216;R&#8217; downstairs before identifying that he was seriously unwell.</p>

His plan was that he would take him downstairs.  His oral evidence was to the effect (and this is not I think in the evidence or the police statements) that he would have a cuddle with &#8216;R&#8217; and would feed him.  His evidence was that &#8216;R&#8217; was floppy and appeared to him to be in a deep sleep.  He remained floppy when he carried him downstairs in his arms.

He said this: &#8220;I think that he does have a bone disorder that makes his bones more fragile than those of a normal infant, and it is possible that this contributed both to the skull fracture and to the failure of the skull to absorb and dissipate the force that caused the fracture with a consequent increase in the severity of the intracranial injury&#8221;.</p>

The points made by Professor Bishop could in fact go the other way because if the degree of force required to cause the fracture is less, then knock-on effects from something causing a fracture may be far less than in other children.  Equally, however, the other side of the argument is that there may be a lack of in lay terms &#8216;cushioning&#8217; which could mean that less force has more direct and widespread damaging effects on the brain and blood vessels of a child who suffers from this bony vulnerability.</p>

Mr May gave evidence that he has had experience of some of that becoming symptomatic, but that experience related to teenagers.  The general force of the opinion and common ground between the experts was this that the blood one would expect to see in the subarachnoid space flowing from a lumbar puncture was diverse, and you would not expect to see, and nobody had any experience of having seen, the amount of blood seen in R&#8217;s skull in the subarachnoid space following a lumbar puncture.  As to that Mr May also pointed out that it is not normal practice to scan young children who have had a lumbar puncture, but it is, as I have said, a known phenomenon that children who have had a lumbar puncture can have bleeding in the subarachnoid space.</p>

He remains of the view that they are unusual features but points out that they can be seen as being within the pattern of haemorrhaging one would expect on a shaking or shaking and impact injury.  But he says that normally, one would expect to see the brain damage being more evenly distributed through the brain, and that in this case the subarachnoid  haemorrhage is bigger than usual.  Normally what is evident on the scans is small in amount and peripheral in distribution and seen in several different areas.  That is not what is seen in this case.</p>

Dr Stoodley was firmer in his view that it was secondary from reasoning which I accept is cogent, namely that it is seen as secondary to brain damage of the type and haemorrhaging of the type one has here.

Also the bone fragility has to be factored in here because, as one has to proceed on the basis that this child has bone fragility, the act of gripping and shaking him might be more likely to cause fractures than in other children.  </p>

So, for example, it is common ground, (and this was supported, for example, by another very experienced doctor who did one of the scans Dr &#8216;N&#8217;) and it was stated by both Dr Stoodley and Mr May that if there were a shaking or a shaking and impact injury of this child they would expect it to lead to a very rapid collapse and thus to a situation in which the child was demonstrating to the lay observer as not being himself and unwell.</p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">As I have already mentioned, that process, as is shown by the exchanges at the experts&#8217; meeting and at the hearing leads to argument and assessment by reference to expertise and literature.   That process of argument and assessment also leads, as is so demonstrated, to views being expressed and argued with varying degrees of force and persuasiveness.  It seems to me inevitable that someone who thinks, for logical and compelling reasons, that X is the most likely answer or cause will be likely, when describing the position orally, to do so persuasively and in powerful terms; there is nothing unfair about that.  Dr Stoodley is someone who is good at explaining his point of view and conclusion, and therefore acting as an advocate for his reasoning and overall conclusions.  He is an impressive and persuasive witness.  So is Mr May.  The natural consequence of explaining what you think is the most likely result is that, when you have cogent reasoning to support it, you will produce a compelling case to support your view.</p>

As I have mentioned, if one does this in this case it can be seen that all of the experts thought this case to be a difficult one or one that had difficult aspects.  </p>

However, whether that real possibility turns out to be something that can be said to be more likely than not to be the case, has to be considered and assessed in all the circumstances of the case.  In particular it has to be seen how it fits in with the events of the household and the evidence of the potential perpetrators.</p>

I say that because of the generally held view of these parents, and, because it seems to me, having seen them give evidence, that it is extremely unlikely that if   one of these parents had witnessed their child being injured by the other he or she would not say so.</p>

Also, and I suspect more regularly, there are examples of parents being a party to accidents which can result in harm to a child.  Equally, I recognise and accept that an aspect of human nature is that it can be difficult to disclose such matters.  </p>

There was also an issue of a criminal incident where he became involved with the police, this was a very minor incident relating to a wall.  In my view correctly and properly neither of these matters were relied on by the local authority.

There are favourable comments made by the police as to their impression.  There are favourable comments made by doctors as to their impression.  Excellent relationships have been built up with the foster carers, one of whom I think already knew the parents because he was a work colleague of the Father.  The relationships between these parents and the foster carers is one in which the Mother said, and I accept, that she would wish the foster carers to continue to play an active part in the lives of the children.  I accept that this is unusual.  There was also a description of the parents leaving notes in the hospital chapel on leaving each night which was a very clear description of the emotional turmoil that these parents were going through and their overwhelming desire that their son would survive.</p>

I have given one example, another is the description the Mother gave of the Father arriving with &#8216;O&#8217; wearing the wrong clothes when he was looking after her, another was the description by the Father as to how the washing got done in this household.</p>

Often one simply just hears or reads that a witness made a good impression.  It seems to me that often you have to analyse such  a statement with a greater degree of care to form a view as to whether or not you think that witness is doing the best he or she can to give you an account of an event to the best of his or her recollection.  In particular it is important in that context to look at the way in which the witness deals with issues that are of importance and issues in respect of which a case can be made against them.  Again, I take some examples.  </p>

The way that he dealt with these points was not as somebody who was searching for an answer, rather he just said what he remembered.  The same can be said as to the point whether or not the baby was propelled or catapulted from the Chaise Longue his answer was, &#8220;Well what&#8217;s the real difference?&#8221;  And it seemed to me that that truly reflected his view.</p>

Again, it seemed to me that she gave her answers honestly and without searching for an explanation.  For example, she was clear, and freely accepted, possibly against her interests given the arguments that were being advanced against her, that she appreciated from a very early stage that she should be telling people about the Chaise Longue incident.  She did not assert that it was something that she had not remembered or thought relevant because it was insignificant, rather she accepted that very early on she knew she should be telling people about it but could not do so.</p>

The local authority&#8217;s case relating to the Chaise Longue incident is that it is an invention.  Originally, or earlier in the documents provided to me by the local authority, there was an alternative put forward that if the Chaise Longue incident was causative, the Mother had been negligent.  But that alternative was not pursued.  The Guardian, in supporting the local authority through submissions, indicated that she was not completely in agreement with the assertion of the local authority that it was an invented story.  Also I should record that I put to the Mother an alternative possibility namely that, rather than it occurring on the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> of April, the Chaise Longue incident occurred on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of April.</p>

First, I do not accept, as is asserted by them, that it is inherently implausible.  That seemed to be a position put forward on a mechanical basis which I do not accept.  It seems to me that it is not implausible that a very young and immobile child of this age could be placed on the Chaise Longue and either because he was jolted when the Mother stood up, albeit the Mother is small that would have some effect on the springs of the Chaise Longue, or otherwise toppled over because he had not been placed correctly, and then rolled to the floor. I add that to my mind it is not implausible, even if the child is safely lodged in the corner of the chaise long if there is some other movement which changes that position.  However, it does not seem to me that it is right to argue that point from a starting point that the child definitely was so safely secured within the corner of the Chaise Longue.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in">I accept that if as she asserts this incident happened, in my view the Mother, in her descriptions of the incident and its aftermath, did not treat it in a way that others might have done, particularly having regard to the &#8216;bone problem&#8217; within her family.  To my mind a point to be made against her that she did not raise it with anybody at the time and thus before the tragic events of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of April.  That criticism was put to her by me, amongst others, and her attitude was: &#8220;Well it had happened.  I didn&#8217;t think anything had come from it and I didn&#8217;t think any more about it&#8221;.  There were problems so far as that response was concerned in that others were indicating that &#8216;R&#8217; was perhaps behaving worse that evening or the next day.  And thus it seems to me that this is a point which is an indicator that, perhaps, the account is not being accurately given or has been invented, but it has not caused me to reach that conclusion.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in">I do not accept that the point that the mother told her own mother first of the incident takes one anywhere.  It seems to me perfectly natural that she would disclose this incident to her own mother first in the circumstances she describes it.  In that context a problem I am faced with is that the maternal grandmother was not required to give oral evidence.  In that respect the local authority accept that the Mother did tell her mother about the incident, but the court did not have the benefit of hearing that person&#8217;s description of that incident orally in the context of questioning to support the contention that the incident is an invention, and has to take her description of the incident on paper.  That description is one which accords with the Mother&#8217;s account and does not support the conclusion that mother invented the incident and tried it out first on, or first described it to, her own mother.</p>

She regrets it, realises it was a mistake, but it does seem to me that in her evidence the mother was describing her feelings and thoughts accurately and truthfully.</p>

In fact it seems they take one nowhere because in my view they are natural developing or escalating descriptions of an event describing how a child came off a Chaise Longue, when the Mother did not actually see the event on her description of it.  So, I rather join with the Father that I do not see much difference between catapulted and propelled in the context of this case in describing how or why &#8216;R&#8217; fell from the Chaise Longue.</p>

The local authority, to my mind very properly, pointed to the descriptions and the changes in them. There are, as I have mentioned, some difficulties, as to the reliance that can be placed upon the original notes. But I accept that there are inconsistencies in the descriptions given, and it seems to me that the differences can be said to be more marked after the Chaise Longue incident is brought to the fore.  However, to my mind those inconsistencies do not lead me to doubt that the Mother is doing her best to give me a full and accurate account of &#8216;R&#8217;s&#8217; feeding.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in">But, even if I was with the local authority in respect of those two lines of argument, I have very considerable difficulty in seeing how, in all the circumstances of this case, it can be said in the context of the injury under contemplation and advanced by the local authority (namely a shaking or a shaking and impact injury) that they lead to, or found, an argument that there is a real possibility that this mother so injured &#8216;R&#8217; on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of April.  This was dealt with in written submissions on behalf of the Mother.  And, in agreement with those submissions, it seems to me that a very important point in the history, which was not challenged is the completely normal discussion between the mother and the father some time after eleven o'clock when &#8216;R&#8217; had had a feed, albeit a limited feed.  This is because on this hypothesis the Mother would have so injured &#8216;R&#8217; before this.  Even leaving that discussion out of account the hypothesis involves a conclusion that it is a real possibility that having so injured &#8216;R&#8217;  the Mother, on the evidence acting normally, then goes out leaving the child,  takes &#8216;O&#8217; to school, does some shopping, and then returns.  It was described in submission that that is really off the Richter scale so far as how one would expect this<span style="font-weight:bold"/>mother to react if she had just so injured &#8216;R&#8217; and I agree.  </p>

There are unsatisfactory features of that response and attitude which he accepted in his oral evidence.

He did not at any stage seek, for example, to confess and avoid.  He did not at any stage give the impression that he was trying to fit something to a circumstance, or to give a favourable answer to a question.

An affirmative answer has a beguiling attraction because it seems to me a natural reaction is that it is easier to understand, given the general description of these parents, that an accident could occur rather than a momentary loss of control.

Therefore I accept her evidence as to the timing of that incident.  </p>

Equally, to my mind, it is properly categorised as &#8216;an accident&#8217; and would not satisfy the attribution provision in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in">To my mind, if the local authority were going to argue as they continued do, that the Mother should be included as a possible perpetrator on the basis that she had inflicted a shaking or a shaking and impact injury on &#8216;R&#8217; late in the morning of the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of April, and thus that that was a real possibility, part of their function was to expressly test the Mother on that aspect of it by express reference to the timings and events of the day described by the parents. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in">I, like counsel for the Mother at the end of her cross-examination, was unaware of precisely how the matter was going to be put against the Mother.  It was plain that the intervention then made by the Mother&#8217;s counsel was to flag up that it seemed that no point was being made against the Mother that she was a perpetrator of such an injury.  That understanding or impression, which I confess I shared, is to my mind indicative that the case that there was a real possibility that the Mother had so acted (or that it could not be found that it was more likely than not that she did not so act) was not fully and properly put.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in">This conclusion that such questions should have been put is not a conclusion that it is incumbent upon local authorities to put every possibility, or indeed, many possibilities in cases of this type.  Rather it is one that in this case the Mother should have been expressly challenged to support the argument that was put it remained a real possibility, in all the circumstance of this case, that she was the perpetrator of an injury in the manner identified as, &#8220;the most likely cause&#8221;, by the doctors.</p>

As to the approaches taken by the local authority and the Guardian, I invite them to consider them having regard to (i) the approach to be taken in law in cases of this type and (ii) my comments as to how close it seemed to me their submissions came to what, in my view, would be an incorrect approach. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.79in">Further, so far as the Guardian is concerned I would invite her to consider carefully whether with hindsight it would have been better in this case, given in particular what she knew personally of the parents and the general impression of these parents, to have taken a stance of neutrality, rather than supporting or asking for particular findings against these parents.  This an approach that is often adopted and leads to the Guardian carrying out a close investigation of the events, and thus, for example, whether or not there were other potential causes which, notwithstanding the medical conclusion in all the circumstances of the case, became the most likely, or the more likely than not solution.</p>
