I bear in mind however that in a European case a non-return under the Hague Convention is not necessarily the end of the matter because of Article 11 which applies  in Article 13 cases (so would not have applied in this case where the obstacle to return  was the fact that ACH&#8217;s habitual residence  was in England not Texas). The European position does however exemplify how Hague non-return orders are not always the end of the matter. This court has no information or evidence as to the Texan arrangements in relation to the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to a child post &#8211; Hague.</span></p>

It is against this background and the findings of HHJ Jenkins that the mother has applied for the making of the passport order.  </span></p>

Rather, the father should accept the reality that ACH's home is in the United Kingdom with her mother and, having accepted that, start working with these courts and with the mother to establish contact and to build up a relationship with his child.  Until such time as he does that, or ACH is of such an age that she cannot be effectively abducted, I take the view that his actions to date inevitably lead the court to conclude there is a real risk that the father will use the vehicle that he has put in place, namely passport and Texan orders, to enter into this country and abduct ACH. </span></p>
