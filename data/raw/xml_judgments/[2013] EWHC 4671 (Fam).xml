He was then nearly 4 years old having been born in March 2009. He was admitted to Hospital in an unconscious state on the evening of 11 March and died at the hospital later that evening. He had been in the sole care of his father prior to his admission to hospital. The father has been charged with his murder and is currently remanded in custody awaiting his criminal trial due to take place in January 2014. This hearing, to determine the facts and make welfare decisions, was listed prior to the criminal trial being fixed. No party in these proceedings made any application to adjourn this hearing. This court would have been concerned about any further significant delay in determining the future care for these young children.</span></p>

In effect permanent separation from the birth family.  The mother seeks orders that will lead to a further assessment of her to enable her to demonstrate her acceptance of any findings the court makes and, in effect, a further assessment of future risk.</span></p>

One aspect of the case that everyone agrees upon is the strength of the mother&#8217;s relationship with the children. Prior to the children being removed from her care there is no significant criticism of the mother&#8217;s day to day care or relationship with the children. One of the witnesses who lived in the family home described her as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;One of the best mothers to her children&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> She has had frequent contact with the children, five times a week for 2 hours. Her attendance has been excellent and all accounts of the contact are glowing in what has been observed. In her evidence the allocated social worker described the mother as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;very warm and loving with her children, she is very attentive to their needs and sings to them&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> a little later she said when asked about the mother&#8217;s engagement with the children &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It&#8217;s warm loving, playful, creative and a joy to watch&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> Mr Y said from his observations the mothers </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;practical, physical, emotional care of the children is excellent&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">What is so puzzling about this mother is she is someone who on the one hand has such strength of feeling and empathy for her children. On one level she has a strong maternal instinct (as has been demonstrated during this hearing; she becomes emotional at the mention of her children and her sobs for them during her evidence were both powerful and heart wrenching) yet she seems completely unable to acknowledge the history and future risks to her and the children that unite the experienced professionals who have given evidence in this case. In their written and oral evidence the social worker, Dr R and the Children&#8217;s Guardian have outlined to the mother their concerns, but she has remained resolute in her denial of the history and, they suggest, has become more entrenched in her views as this hearing has progressed. This may be due to loyalty to the husband and/or deep feelings of guilt. Whatever its roots it caused the Children&#8217;s Guardian, in his oral evidence, to shut the door he had left open in his written report filed at the start of this hearing that he would support a short focussed adjournment if there was any movement in the mother&#8217;s position. There wasn&#8217;t and put simply, his position is the children can&#8217;t wait. It was a conclusion he reached with great sadness but not, in the light of the evidence, with reluctance.</span></p>

PCs E and C attended the home, R acted as an interpreter and the police records confirm the mother reported being assaulted by the father. The mother was taken to the Police station to make a statement. She was visited there by one of the father&#8217;s brothers (although there was some suggestion this was the mother&#8217;s brother) and someone described as the mother&#8217;s uncle although the evidence was not clear about his precise relationship to the mother and whether in fact only one person attended. Following the mother speaking to the family member who attended a different version of events was told to the police, with the father not being blamed. By the time an interpreter arrived at the police station the mother had changed her mind and she signed a statement stating she did not wish to pursue the matter. When the father was interviewed later that day he alleges the mother hit him on the head with a shoe and he pushed her away causing the injury to her neck. He said R was lying. The mother in her statements and oral evidence in these proceedings denied this alleged violent incident took place, she said R was lying as she wished to have a relationship with the father. In her evidence R said she saw the mother the following morning but did not ask what was happening about any criminal charges. She said she did not hear any other arguments between the parents. She worked full time and was out of the home for approximately 12 hours a day five days a week.</span></p>

In his oral evidence Dr A said whilst he spoke the same language  he recognised that his  was rusty and he came from a different region from the mother, however he was very clear that he did not misunderstand what the mother was saying. The interpreters for the parents who have been present during the hearing said that when Dr A was asked to say in the language how the mother described being in a refuge that he used very bad grammar, however it accepted that there is no such word as refuge in that language. </span></p>

He said because he was not the treating doctor he did not examine her but did see the injuries when she showed them to the female police officer who attended later that day. He saw bruises to her arms and grazes to both her knees, which he said he specifically recalled because it corroborated the account she had given him earlier of being dragged across the carpet on her knees by the father. According to Dr A the mother described repeated assaults from the father, pressure from the community to drop the previous allegations and threats to kill her and the unborn child from the father. Dr A said following his discussion with her in the morning, he kept popping back to see her and he acted as interpreter again when the police attended in the afternoon. He remembered MM being there when the police attended.  He said he made the written record in the hospital notes about 5.15 pm that afternoon. He considered even though he was not the treating doctor it was important the information she had give him was recorded. </span></p>

He made a statement to the police on 12 March 2013, took part in a video reconstruction of what he saw on 4 March and gave oral evidence at this hearing. He was clear that what he saw was A falling from his mother&#8217;s lap as she was in a sitting position; he described A hitting the padded part at the front of the pushchair before falling to the floor. </span></p>

She met with the mother on 25 July 2013 and her written report is dated 31 July 2013. She concluded the mother did not suffer from any mental illness. The mother maintained her denial that there had been no domestic violence and Dr R expressed her concerns that if it is found that there had been domestic violence the mother&#8217;s denial and/or minimisation of what had taken place were poor prognostic factors in her ability to protect the children in the future. She gave oral evidence and did not alter her conclusion. She said that if the court found the domestic violence allegations to be true it was of concern that the mother was not able to maintain the separation from the father and this put the mother at further risk.

Prior to this case this included the support delivered within the child protection plans which were in the context of the LA being very clear it still considered she was at risk of domestic violence. Ms G said when she first saw the mother in March she arranged for a worker from a refuge to see and speak to the mother separately from the social worker to explore with the mother safety issues. During the currency of this hearing the social worker, Dr R and the Children&#8217;s Guardian have made it clear to the mother on repeated occasions their level of concern about the history of domestic violence and the evidence relating to the cause of death of C. She also understood the police had provided support to the mother through discussions about safety with the family liaison officer. She said her view is the mother is intelligent and articulate and was able to understand what Ms G was saying. She could understand the risks of domestic violence in the abstract but was simply unable to relate it to her situation.</p>

R gave a detailed account of being woken by the parents arguing, her observations of the extent of the mother&#8217;s distress, her being on the floor and the father standing over her and punching her in the mouth. It was a detailed and powerful account which according to the parents is inaccurate and one driven by jealousy, as she either had or wishes to have a relationship with the father.  Her oral account was largely consistent with her police statement, save that in her oral evidence she did not accept the mother told her of previous violent incidents between the mother and father. The police officers who attended support R&#8217;s account in their descriptions of the mother&#8217;s demeanour when they arrived. PC E mainly dealt with the mother. In her evidence she described the mother </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;cowering&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> upstairs before she came down to speak to her and being visibly scared, shaking and crying. Although she accepts R did the interpreting when she did speak to the mother she was clear in her oral evidence she elicited the information in a question and answer style, with R interpreting each question and answer with the mother. She was clear the information she recorded came from the mother and not an account taken only from R, with the mother being a silent observer. She described in her oral evidence asking to see the injuries and the mother moving her clothing to enable the officer to see them. She had an independent recollection of seeing the marks to the mother&#8217;s neck and the bruise to her arm; although PC E noted the injury to the shoulder she did not have an independent recollection of seeing it. She was clear the mother was saying, via R, that the father caused these injuries. Her observation of the injuries was supported by her entry in the CRIS report that they were sufficiently visible they could be photographed. Whilst PC C dealt mainly with the father at the home he observed what took place in the police station and thought it </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;strange&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> that the mother should change her story after she had been spoken to by the gentleman who attended the police station, who he understood to be the mother&#8217;s brother.</span></p>

R, they say, is simply lying. Whilst they accept there were raised voices they are clear she observed no assault, the mother was not on the floor and there was no reason for the police to be called. They say she was driven to lie by her desire to have a relationship with the father. PC E, they say, was lying in her account of observing any injuries on the mother and she did not glean information by way of questions and answers, it was only from R who was not a reliable source. The description of cowering and the reluctance to come downstairs was, according to the mother, because the she was in the toilet and said she would be down shortly; the mother said it had nothing to do with her being frightened. They place reliance on the fact that there was no mention from R to the police of the punch to the face or any record of any injury to the mouth.</span></p>

He described speaking to her for about an hour, and although he accepted they came from different parts of the country in question and that there may be some words that may be different his oral evidence was clear he understood what she was saying and in their discussion, which was by way of question and answer, he had no sense they were misunderstanding each other. He said at that stage he did not see any bruises or marks. After speaking to her for sometime he described regularly popping back to see her to check she was okay. He was involved again when the police arrived and he interpreted for them. This was done by him interpreting questions and answers from the police to the mother and again he said he got no sense there was any misunderstanding in what he was saying to the police and the account he was being given by the mother. He recollects he did see the injuries on the mother at this time, as the police wanted to see them and he was struck by the marks to her knees as that accorded with the description she had given Dr A earlier that day of being dragged on her knees across the floor by the father when she fell trying to escape his assault.</span></p>

First the language issue. I have carefully factored in the fact that much of what the mother is reported to have said has been via someone else interpreting for her. In this context it is important that I look at what other evidence could support what the mother is reported to have said. I also factor in the fact that apart from the incidents in April and November 2011 and the reports of D hearing shouting on 11 March 2013 there is no other evidence of domestic violence. I also take on board the submission on behalf of the mother by Mr Alomo that the fact something has been reported by a lot of people does not necessarily mean it has happened. But it also has to be borne in mind if there is no evidence of collusion and the reports are independent of each other that is also a factor that needs to be taken into account. </span></p>

It is supported in significant respects by the police officers who attended. They support what she says about the mother&#8217;s fear and distress; they observe injuries which through questions and answers the mother reports as being caused by the father. It is improbable that R could have mis-interpreted what the mother was saying without the police officer noting that was the case. No motive has been suggested to the police officers for lying or why they would make up their contemporaneous records.  In relation to R the jealous motive suggested is unsupported by any external evidence and it sits uneasily with the parents remaining living under the same roof as R. The fact that R does not mention the punch to the mouth to the police can be accounted for by the fact that she had not given a police statement at that stage. During the relatively brief time the police were at the house she was acting as interpreter for the mother and the mother had had the opportunity to clean herself up in the toilet upstairs. In addition, the account given by the father in his police interview of being hit over the head with a shoe by the mother he accepted in oral evidence was not correct, which undermines the credibility of his account now. The attendance by a member of the family so soon after the mother arrived at the police station and the change in her account is more consistent with pressure from the family on her to withdraw the allegations than the allegations being untruthful from the start.</span></p>

The account given by MM in her police statement of the mother attending distressed at her home alleging domestic violence by the father is supported by the records at the hospital, the written and oral evidence from Dr A and the accounts given by the police officers who attended the hospital. The mother does not now suggest that MM told her to make up allegations against the father in order to secure housing, although the father does. MM&#8217;s account in her police statement, which she accepts was true when she made it, gives a clear account of the mother turning up on her doorstep alleging she had been assaulted by the father. It is of note that her police statement records at the end that she made changes as she was not happy with the initial statement. Her inability to recall the details about the violence allegations in oral evidence was wholly unconvincing in the context where she was able to give detail about other matters around that time. My assessment is she felt under pressure about giving oral evidence about any detail regarding the assaults by the father. It required a warrant being issued by me to secure her attendance. The source of that pressure is more likely than not to be from the family or the community, as she gives an account in her statement of the mother being visited by members of the paternal family, which is similar to what happened to the mother in April.  </span></p>

He gave a detailed account, much of which was based on personal recollection. He was clear in his rejection of the suggestion in cross examination by Mr Alomo, on behalf of the mother, that he had somehow misunderstood what the mother said, to the extent that she was making no allegations of violence against the father. If that was the case it would have become readily apparent to him and the mother, not only when he was talking to her but by the questions being asked by the police officer. He had a vivid recollection of seeing the injuries, making the distinction that he had not seen them when he was first talking to the mother but had when the female police officer was there. This was independently supported by the police officers account. In addition I accept the account given by Dr A of his subsequent chance meeting with the mother on the bus. He gave congruent detail about that and no motive was suggested for him to lie about this. The mother did have such a motive as it did not support her account of not understanding the nature of the accommodation she was in and was part of her denial of domestic violence. Where there is any conflict between the mother and Dr A&#8217;s account of what took place at the hospital and when they met afterwards, I unhesitatingly accept the evidence of Dr A.</span></p>

MM was going to go with her and MM said she should apply for larger accommodation. She was unable to give any rationale why she was going to secure that accommodation by sitting at the hospital in the absence of anything else other than being pregnant. On her account the father did not know about this, yet he seemed unsurprised that he did not hear from her for about 3 days. She said she spoke to him on the phone when she was in the refuge. On her account he said that was the wrong way to go about getting accommodation. On the father&#8217;s account, given in his oral evidence, he said he was going to X city for three days and that is why MM went to the hospital with the mother.  He seemed to express no surprise or wish to make any enquiries as to why the mother was staying in a women&#8217;s hostel and why he was never given the address. The suggestion by the parents that neither of them realised this was a refuge for women who have suffered domestic violence until the mother had been there for three months and only after the mother had given birth to B lacks any credibility. The account given by the father of the mother only realising when she read the leaflet written in their language, that she accepts she was given before B&#8217;s birth yet only had time to read after his birth makes no sense. The mother accepted she was allocated a worker at the refuge soon after she went there. </span></p>

The birth of B and the presence of the father at the hospital due to medical complications with B would have increased that pressure. It is of note that her withdrawal statement again puts the responsibility on her of making what are said to be unfounded allegations that the father has had a relationship with another woman. I am entirely satisfied both parents knew the type of accommodation the mother was placed in and the reasons why she was placed there. The reality is over a period of time she was driven to return home by a combination of her desire to continue her marriage with her husband and her loyalty to him, together with pressure from him and the wider family to withdraw the allegations. </span></p>

I have reached the conclusion that the mother was standing as she had just fed A and was trying to wind him, both she and the witness describe A hitting the padded bar on the pram which bearing in mind the height of the chairs and the height of that bar on the pram was unlikely to be possible where the witness describes him falling from her lap. I consider he is mistaken about that. Although Dr J considered it most likely a straight fall from shoulder height to the floor would cause A&#8217;s injury he said it was less likely that it was caused either by the impact on the floor via the pushchair or by hitting the pushchair (even with padding) which could have created the 3 point mechanism described by Dr M. I have to consider that evidence together with the lack of evidence about any other incident, the relative promptness with which the parents sought medical help when they noticed a swelling, together with the difference between this event and C&#8217;s death as it is potentially explicable by a witnessed event which was accepted by Dr D. Dr M&#8217;s report gives what Dr J described as the classic mechanism for this type of fracture, but failed to give any specific consideration to what is said to have taken place in the dentists&#8217; waiting room. </span></p>

The medical evidence from both Professor R and Dr C is that in the absence of any other explanation C&#8217;s injuries were inflicted by an adult and due to the distribution of the injuries it is more likely that it was a result of a number of impacts. In his oral evidence Professor R said that C was most probably stamped on or punched and the injuries are very likely to have been fatal within minutes.

This view was given prior to the mother giving her oral evidence when she was, in my judgment, more trenchant in her denials than she had been in her interview with Dr R. </span></p>

She repeated many times that as she did not see what happened she could not consider the cause of death. But she appeared to have no difficulty in accepting and relying on information she received about the treatment of C whilst he was in Country B. Also she raised the issue of CPR being a possible cause of the injuries, but seemed unable to consider the father&#8217;s actions as being the possible cause too. In relation to domestic violence she was able to understand the impact of that on women and children but was unable to relate it to her situation.</span></p>

The arguments for making a final care order and placement orders are supported by all the professional evidence, they are united that each child&#8217;s welfare requires care orders and placement orders to be made.  The disadvantages of making such an order for the children have been carefully considered by Ms G and Mr Y and include the permanent loss for the children of the birth family, the delays and uncertainties of finding a suitable long term placement for the children and the difficulties in finding adopters with a similar racial and religious background as the children. They have been balanced with the advantages of the children no longer being at risk of future harm and bearing in mind their ages having the security and stability that comes with an adoptive placement.  I acknowledge all the support that has been given to this mother in the past and during the currency of these proceedings. However this has been without the certainty of the findings the court has now made.</span></p>

Whilst she has not shown such a change during the hearing I do not underestimate the pressure this mother is likely to have been under in the lead up to and during this hearing and the uncertainties that existed. In the light of my findings some of those uncertainties, in the context of these proceedings, have been removed by the findings I have made. Dr R did observe that it was a lot to ask the mother to change in the context of her oral evidence. I agree. She has maintained her position for so long it was going to be a difficult position to climb down from under the glare of the court and the other parties.  Having observed the mother during this hearing and in the context of the strength of her relationship with the children their welfare requires her to be given this final time limited opportunity to demonstrate those changes away from the spotlight of the court.</span></p>

That must include, in the circumstances of this case where her relationship with the children is so strong, the mother&#8217;s capacity to change in the light of the court&#8217;s findings so she can meet the children&#8217;s needs.</span></p>

I believe a short adjournment will provide a firm foundation for the children to know their mother was given every reasonable opportunity to consider her position by the court and that adoption was not sought lightly.

That can only be done by her unconditional acceptance and acknowledgment of this courts findings and actively considering a plan to manage the risk of harm in the future.

The mother has sought help in the past, but the difficulty has been her ability to sustain it and the pressures she has been put under. The description given by Dr A of the change in the mother when he saw her on the bus gives a glimpse of the change that is possible. </span></p>

She should be in no doubt that unless she makes these changes she will be unable to care for her children in the future as it will be very likely their welfare will require the parents consent to be dispensed with leading to adoption orders being made.  In order for her to even have a prospect of caring for the children she has got to unconditionally and without reservation accept the findings I have made. My findings are not dependent on what occurs in the criminal proceedings.  They stand in their own right. Any suggestion by the mother that she requires more evidence for her to be satisfied that the father is responsible for C&#8217;s death will almost certainly mean she will be unable to provide safe care for her children.</span></p>
