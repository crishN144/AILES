On her behalf, Mr Karl Rowley of King&#8217;s Counsel and Ms Ginny Whiteley of counsel argue that it is.  The mother&#8217;s application for permission to instruct a psychologist is supported by the father, C, represented by Mr Michael Jones of counsel.  The application is opposed by the applicant local authority, represented by Mr Patrick Gilmore of counsel.  The application is also opposed on behalf of the child who is the subject of these proceedings, N, represented by Mr Sonny Flood of counsel through her Children&#8217;s Guardian.</p>

Subsequent to his birth, the parents had another child, A, born in May 2021.  A died in October 2021.  The father currently stands charged with his murder.  The father&#8217;s trial for murder is due to commence later this year.  These proceedings are listed for a further case management hearing immediately following the conclusion of the murder trial.  These proceedings have already been considerably delayed for the reasons set out by the President in his judgment <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Child Post-Mortem Report: Delays)</span> [2022] EWFC 55.</p>

The local authority further points to the fact that A had five fractures to his ribs and, in addition, suffered a further rib fracture some 6 to 12 weeks prior to his death, together with a prior intercranial bleed.   Neither parent has given an account that would explain these injuries. The post-mortem investigations of A reach consistent conclusions, namely that A was most likely subjected to a significant shaking injury, with or without impact against a soft surface.</p>

Rather, there is also a range of evidence pre-dating A&#8217;s death that, if accepted by the court, would be sufficient to establish the threshold criteria pursuant to s.31(2) of the Children Act 1989.  Within this context, the police&#8217;s investigation into the death of A has encompassed not only the events concerning his death but also neglect of both children in circumstances where they are said to have been left without food for prolonged periods of time and otherwise unattended in the context of parental drug use.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having regard to the issues in this case, the court gave permission for the instruction of an ISW to undertake an assessment of the parents.  Her report, dated 13 November 2022, is now before the court.  That assessment was completed under the ParentAssess Framework, which has been developed for parents who have a learning disability and additional needs.  It is based on the DOH Assessment Framework of 2000.  In her report, the ISW relates that, ideally, a cognitive assessment should be undertaken prior to an assessment of this nature in order to tailor the assessment to their level of need.  However, the ISW details the steps she deployed to account for the fact that not such cognitive assessment has been undertaken in this case:</p>

The local authority asserts that the mother suffered emotional harm and neglect whilst living with her mother and her mother&#8217;s partner (including heroin use by her mother and her partner by way of injection in front of the mother).  As a result of this, the mother and her siblings moved to live with their maternal grandmother, who was granted a special guardianship order in 2013.  The mother left that home following an argument in late 2015 and went to live with her father, who at that time is said to have been a recovering drug user.  The mother reported that to the ISW that her father&#8217;s partner was verbally abusive towards her.  Thereafter, the mother moved to live with her paternal grandmother in March 2016.  She also received verbal abuse from her maternal grandmother&#8217;s partner whilst placed there.  </p>

She had no positive role models.  Whilst she was pregnant with A, the mother&#8217;s father died following an alleged assault.  The ISW reports that his death has had a profound effect on the mother&#8217;s emotional and mental health. The mother also reported to the ISW that she was the victim of domestic abuse in an earlier relationship.  The ISW concludes that the mother does not recognise what a healthy relationship should be.</p>

The father reported being neglected and physically abused by his own father.  The ISW report further records that the father was groomed and sexually abused for several years by a male who had befriended the family and who gave the father drugs.  That male was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.  Within this context, the ISW concludes that the father has been systematically abused and neglected by those who should have kept him safe and this has had a significant impact on his emotional and mental health and his ability to make and maintain relationships.  </p>

With respect to the mother, the ISW states that the neglect and trauma of her childhood has impacted on her parenting capacity in the absence of positive parental role models.  She considers that the mother would benefit from therapeutic assistance to explore her life experience and address the loss she has suffered.  With respect to the father, the ISW considers that his childhood experiences led to feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem and self-worth and that the father does not have the necessary skills to make and maintain relationships.  Both parents reported to the ISW that their emotional and mental health can become unstable, but neither is accessing professional support.</p>

There had been an anonymous referral in September 2020 that alleged that the father was using Class A drugs in the presence of N and that he was also driving with N in the car to collect the drugs. No further action was taken on this referral.  The ISW stated that both parents reported drug use by them at the time of A&#8217;s death.  The mother states she has used opiates, Pregabalin and cannabis.  The father states that he used cannabis and Tramadol.  Whilst both parents were adamant with the ISW that the children were not exposed to their substance misuse, with respect to the evidence of drug use, the ISW records as follows in her report at [22]:</p>

The key worker for the mother has reported that she has missed several appointments.  As at the date of the ISW assessment, neither parent had completed any drug screening since May 2022, the ISW reporting that the mother had repeatedly claimed to have been unable to provide a urine sample to be tested.  The mother&#8217;s GP records record that the mother continued to misuse illicit drugs in late 2022, with an attendance on 3 November 2022 confirming daily use of cannabis.  The mother did not attend for a drug screening the following day.  The mother&#8217;s GP records further recorded on 28 January 2022 that liver function tests suggested a diagnosis of alcohol-related liver disease.</p>

Mr Gilmore submits that within the context of the support that the ISW identifies needs to be accessed prior to the mother being able to make the necessary changes, support to address her substance misuse and a parenting course which addresses areas such as basic child development, routine, boundaries, strategies to manage any behavioural challenges, and exploring local support networks, an expert psychological assessment is likewise not required to identify what support is required to now being to address the deficits in the mother&#8217;s parenting.</p>

In that latter context, in so far as an expert psychological report might identify therapeutic input that might improve the mother&#8217;s parenting capacity, Mr Flood submits that the court must have an eye on the realistic position regarding the extent of change that is required from the mother and the timescales available for that change having regard to the needs of N, particularly where the ISW has concluded that the mother does not at present have the capacity to change.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;The short answer is that &#8220;necessary&#8221; means necessary. It is, after all, an ordinary English word. It is a familiar expression nowadays in family law, not least because of the central role it plays, for example, in Article 8 of the European Convention and the wider Strasbourg jurisprudence. If elaboration is required, what precisely does it mean? That was a question considered, albeit in a rather different context, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent) </span>[2008] EWCA Civ 535, [2008] 2 FLR 625, paras [120], [125].  This court said it &#8220;has a meaning lying somewhere between 'indispensable' on the one hand and 'useful', 'reasonable' or 'desirable' on the other hand&#8221;, having &#8220;the connotation of the imperative, what is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable&#8221;. In my judgment, that is the meaning, the connotation, the word necessary has in rule 25.1.&#8221;</p>

However, there have been a number of other <span style="font-style:italic">obiter</span> observations regarding the relative stringency of the test of necessity in the context of permitting expert evidence.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Re TG (A Child)</span> [2013] 1 FLR 1250, which predated the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-L (A Child)</span>, the court observed that the then anticipated test of necessity was intended to be significantly more stringent that the former test of &#8220;reasonably required&#8221;.  In <span style="font-style:italic">J v G v Lord Chancellor and Others</span> [2014] 2 FLR 1218, the hurdle represented by the test of necessity for expert evidence was described as a high one.  The rationale for this approach in the context of s.13 of the 2014 Act was given by Aikens LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (A Child)(Procedural Requirements of a Part 25 Application) </span>[2015] EWCA Civ 539:</p>

Unnecessary expert reports cause delays and, inevitably, costs are increased. In family cases where public funding is often involved this had meant that taxpayers' money has sometimes been wasted. Section 13 of the Children and Families Act 2014 and Part 25 of the FPR now lay down firm statutory and procedural rules that must be applied in respect of expert evidence in family proceedings. It is the duty of all family law practitioners and the courts to learn, mark and digest these provisions and ensure that they are applied rigorously&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The process of evaluating what order, having regarding to s.1 of the Children Act 1989, should be made has been described in a number of authorities following the decision in the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re&#160;B (Care Proceedings: Appeal)</span>&#160;[2013] 2 FLR 1075 to the effect that adoption can only occur if parents are unwilling, or are deemed by judicial process to be unable, to discharge their responsibilities towards the child and that, accordingly, the granting of a care order with a care plan of adoption is an option of last resort.  In light of this decision, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the process of deciding what order, having regarding to s.1 of the Children Act 1989 (and, where the care plan is one of adoption, to the Adoption and Children Act 2002 ss. 1 and 52), should be made requires a global, holistic evaluation and analysis of the child's welfare needs followed by a side by side analysis of each of the realistic options for meeting those needs in order to reach a decision as to which of those options is the most proportionate having regard to the need to afford paramount consideration to the welfare of the child (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (A Child)</span> [2014] 1 FLR 670).  </p>

Intrinsic to that analysis and determination will be consideration of any risk of harm presented by the mother and her capability as a parent under s.1(3)(e) and 1(3)(f) of the Children Act 1989 respectively.  It is to these issues that it is said an expert psychological evidence would relate.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court now has the benefit of a comprehensive and closely reasoned report from the ISW.  That report sets out in clear terms the current multiple factors generating deficits in the mother&#8217;s parental functioning, including her childhood history, past trauma, her emotional and mental health, her substance misuse and her previous relationships.  Within this context, I am satisfied that an expert psychological assessment is not necessary to make clear to the court the origin of the mother&#8217;s current difficulties and the current nature and extent of her parenting deficits consequent upon those difficulties.   In particular, and by reference to the list of matters it is said by the mother an expert psychologist would be asked to address, I do not consider it necessary in this case for the court to have a <span style="font-style:italic">psychological</span> formulation in respect of the mother in order for the court to determine the matters before it.  The impact of her childhood experiences and trauma are plain from the report of the ISW, as is the nature of the mother&#8217;s relationship with the father and the nature and extent of her substance misuse in so far as she has disclosed it to the ISW.  Likewise, the question of the risk of harm to any child in the mother&#8217;s care is readily ascertainable from the ISW report and does not necessitate a &#8220;psychological perspective&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nor is it necessary in my judgment for the court to have an expert psychological report in order to identify what support is required for the mother to address the deficits in the mother&#8217;s parenting. The ISW also deals in detail in her report with the steps that the mother needs to take in order to address the deficits in her parenting.  In this latter regard, the ISW is clear in identifying the primary elements of support that the mother currently needs to access in order to be able to begin make the necessary changes, <span style="font-style:italic">starting</span> with engaging with support to address and overcome her substance misuse and including a parenting course which addresses deficits in <span style="font-style:italic">basic</span> parenting skills.  The ISW also carries out an assessment of the mother&#8217;s current capacity to change, concluding in clear terms that she lacks the capacity at this time to learn and that, due to her vulnerabilities, she does not have the capacity to address the current identified gaps in the other parents parenting capacity.  In this context, whilst the court will need to consider at the final hearing in this case whether there is any practical way of the authorities providing the requisite assistance and support the mother requires, it is not necessary in my judgment for the court also to have in this case an assessment from a <span style="font-style:italic">psychologist </span>dealing with the issues support, therapy or other intervention for the mother or her &#8220;psychological&#8221; capacity to change.</p>

The conclusion of the ISW is in stark terms in this regard. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Until the mother prioritises dealing with her substance misuse, the ISW is clear that she will not be in a position to address the other areas of difficulty.  The evidence before the court however, is to the effect that the mother continues to use drugs and demonstrates a less than consistent engagement with the services that aim to help her cease her drug use.  In the context of this unwillingness thus far to avail herself fully of support in respect of substance misuse and mental health, the mother has not begun to address the first hurdle to dealing with her parenting deficits.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that it is not necessary for the court to have an expert psychological report looking at wider issues of whether and to what extent the mother is able to access support, whether any support they do access is appropriate and whether such support will act to mitigate the mother&#8217;s difficulties and over what timescale, in order to determine the proceedings justly. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I acknowledge that the ISW recommends an expert psychological assessment at a number of points during the course of her report.  However, it is clear from those passages that the ISW sees the function of such a report as providing <span style="font-style:italic">further</span> information, rather than as being necessary to fill lacunae in the information on the mother without which a conclusion cannot be drawn.  At no point does the ISW suggest that her conclusions are conditional on such a report, or that such a report will result in the need for her to revisit those conclusions.  Rather, the whole tenor of her recommendation that such a report be obtained is to further inform the therapeutic and support options available to the mother <span style="font-style:italic">beyond</span> the primary element of substance abuse support that the mother <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> access and engage with in order to be able to begin make the changes necessary to place her in a position to care for N.</p>

I acknowledge that the arguments for an expert in a care case where permanent removal is threatened <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> be significantly stronger than in a case where the stakes are not so high.  It is further the case that the overriding objective in FPR 2010 r. 1.1 requires the court to deal with the case justly, having regard to the welfare issues involved. However, the test remains whether an expert report is <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span> to determine the proceedings justly.  For the reasons I have set out above I am satisfied that the fact that adoption is a potential outcome in this case does not serve to change the conclusion of the court that in order to determine the issues in the care proceedings it is not necessary in this case to have the benefit of an expert psychological assessment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the conclusion that it is not necessary in this case for the court to have the benefit of an expert psychological assessment in order to determine these proceedings justly is also not altered by the fact that there is time in this case to complete such an assessment ahead of the final hearing.   By reference to the test set out in s. 13(6) of the Children and Families Act 2014, an expert assessment is either necessary to determine the proceedings justly or it is not.  In those circumstances, where the court has concluded it is not necessary, that conclusion will not change simply because there is time to complete the assessment.  To conclude otherwise would be to succumb to the tug of pragmatism (see <span style="font-style:italic">Rehan Malik v Governor of HM Prison Hindley (No.2)</span> [2022] EWHC 2684 (Admin) per Fordham J) and to fail to apply the test of necessity with the rigor that the authorities make clear is required.   In this context, the concession that were the court to hear and determine the matter <span style="font-style:italic">today</span> it has sufficient evidence to do so, amounts in fact to a concession that an expert psychological assessment is not necessary for the court to determine the case justly <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span>.</p>

Whilst this might indicate that such an expert assessment would be useful, or even valuable, the fact that an expert report may clarify or, to use the ISW&#8217;s phrase, further inform the court on issues relevant to the court&#8217;s determination does not cross the threshold of necessity that applies to applications of this nature.   </p>

In that document the President identified that since 2016/17 there has been a 33% rise in the number experts instructed in public law cases.  There will, of course, be <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> public law cases that require an expert psychologist to evaluate a parent&#8217;s functional capacity to meet the needs of their child, particularly where there are discrete issues of, for example, complex mental health presentations, difficult questions of behavioural, emotional or neuropsychological functioning, serious forensic risk or chronic substance misuse or addiction, but this will not <span style="font-style:italic">inevitably</span> be the case even where those issues exist in a case.
