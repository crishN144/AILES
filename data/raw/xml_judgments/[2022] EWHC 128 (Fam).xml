	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">&#8220;Forced marriage is a violation of internationally recognised human rights standards. Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses&#8221;, Art.16.2 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Forced marriage is a form of domestic abuse and is a criminal offence. Forced Marriage Protection Orders perform an important role in protecting individuals, including children, who are threatened with forced marriage, for example by prohibiting a parent from taking their child out of the country. However, the source or nature of information that a person is threatened with forced marriage may itself require protection. There may be good grounds not to disclose that material to the child&#8217;s parents or to others who are subject to restrictions imposed by a Forced Marriage Protection Order. When such material is withheld, how should the court manage hearings at which a Forced Marriage Protection Order is challenged? In this judgment I set out my reasons for sanctioning the appointment of a Special Advocate to represent the interests of the respondent father. Such appointments will be rare in the family justice system but they merit careful consideration in Forced Marriage Protection Order applications where the applicant relies on material that cannot be disclosed to a Respondent but the respondent challenges the justification for the order and applies to have it discharged. </p>

He told A&#8217;s school that she and her sister would be taken out of school to visit Bangladesh for a short period to visit their paternal grandfather who had broken his leg. A and B had previously missed at least three years from school in England due to an extended trip to Bangladesh. South Yorkshire Police were contacted and, following a review of the evidence, on 13 November 2020 the police seized the passports belonging to the father and the two girls. On 18 November 2020 the Local Authority applied without notice for FMPO&#8217;s in respect of each child. The court made the orders sought. Notice of the application and the orders was then given to the mother and father. After a hearing on notice, the orders were extended. They have been further extended at numerous subsequent hearings and remain in force as set out above. The father&#8217;s passport was returned to him, but the court has ordered that the girls&#8217; passports be retained by the police.

In this context, I have deliberately chosen the word "accommodation" to reflect the court's approach. The required judicial analysis is not a true 'balancing' exercise in consequence of the imperative duty that arises from the absolute nature of Article 3 rights. Where the evidence establishes a reasonable possibility that conduct sufficient to breach Article 3 may occur, the court must at least do what is necessary to protect any potential victim from such a risk. The need to do so cannot be reduced below that necessary minimum even where the factors relating to the qualified rights protected by Article 8 are particularly weighty. Hence the need to find a word other than 'balance' to describe this process of analysis.</p>

The facts of the present case, in which the judge's order imposes a permanent travel ban upon K leaving the UK, presents the conflict, between the need to protect the individual from serious harm against the individual's freedom to conduct their private life as they wish, in stark relief.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">[39] Once again, all parties before the court were in agreement that an assessment of proportionality must be undertaken. On one view, "proportionality" may seem to be an inappropriate concept when the court is considering an absolute Convention right such as Article 3. However, in cases where there has not yet been a forced marriage, the court will not be dealing with the certainty that future harm will take place but, rather, the assessment of the risk that it may do so. Where protective measures will necessarily limit the freedom of the protected person and others to enjoy other Convention rights, it will be necessary to evaluate, with a degree of precision, the extent of protection that is necessary in each individual case. In this regard, the exercise to be conducted in a FMPO application is broadly similar to that undertaken where the risk of future harm arises from the potential for Female Genital Mutilation ("FGM"). In that context, this court (Irwin, Moylan and Asplin LJJ) considered the imposition of a "worldwide travel ban" in an FGM case in Re X (A Child: FGMPO) (Rev 2) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/1825" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 1825" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA Civ 1825</ref>.</p>

The first is that it is very widely drawn. It is extra-territorial in its application and orders may be both made and discharged ex parte. Secondly, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> plainly creates a protective / injunctive jurisdiction. Its object is to prevent forced marriages by protecting those who may be, or have been, forced into marriage. The position in relation to respondents, moreover, seems to me robust, and the only criterion for protecting a respondent to such an order appears in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>D(3), where the order is made ex parte and the court is required to give any respondent "an opportunity to make representations" (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>D(3)).

The court, in my judgment, is entitled to take the view that any forced marriage is a breach of human rights, and that where &#8211; as here &#8211; a responsible body such as the police have credible information sufficient to invoke the court's jurisdiction and form the basis of court orders, an issue arises which &#8211; in the context of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and the jurisdiction it provides &#8211; entitles the court to act and make its orders, irrespective of the truth or otherwise of information which has led to the application.</p>

In such circumstances, I fully recognise that factual issues may arise which the court is required to investigate. However, not only is that not this case, but, even if it were, it does not seem to me that that special advocates have any role to play. The police - or the alleged victim &#8211; argue that certain information likely to lead to a breach of the rights provided by ECHR Articles 2, 3 or 8 should not be disclosed. Balanced against that are the ECHR Article 6 (and possibly 8) rights of the persons subject to the order. Given the protective nature of the court's jurisdiction, it seems to me that the court can decide the issue of whether or not the order should stand without either detailed investigation of the factual issues or the intervention of special advocates.</p>

Article 6 protects a party's right to a fair trial "in the determination of his civil rights and obligations". To force a person into marriage is manifestly not a civil right, still less an obligation. In my view, accordingly, it is arguable that ECHR Article 6 is not engaged in an application for a FMPO. In any event, since the court permits the exercise of jurisdiction ex parte and on the basis of the applicant's belief, it does not seem to me that a respondent's right to apply to set the order aside entitles him or her to access to information which, if abused, will lead to serious breaches of the rights of the person to be protected. </p>

A person against whom the order has been made (A's parents in this instance) may well deny forcing A into marriage &#8211; or any intention of doing so &#8211; and may assert that the order represents a breach of their ECHR Article 8 right to respect for their family life in arranging a marriage for their daughter. We are thus back to the dichotomy identified in paragraph 9 of this judgment. Assuming, therefore, that ECHR Art 6 is engaged, it nonetheless seems to me that the right to a fair trial manifestly does not entitle a party either to see all the documents in the case or to have all the information in the possession of the court: - see Munby J's analysis in Re B.</p>

Quite apart from any other consideration, while it is recognised to be a "valuable procedure" in certain limited circumstances, it is also clearly an "imperfect" one (see respectively Lord Bingham at [35], and Lord Hoffman at [54] in Secretary of State for the Home Department v MB <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2007/46" uk:canonical="[2007] UKHL 46" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] UKHL 46</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 AC 440" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 AC 440</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 3 WLR 681" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 3 WLR 681</ref>).</p>

Nonetheless, procedures have been adapted in the family court to replicate as appropriate the arrangements for a closed material process, to achieve fairness, and ensure the protection of the Article 6 rights of the parties. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am persuaded that a Special Advocate should be appointed to represent the interests of the father in this case. All of the parties agree to that course. I am also persuaded that the Special Advocate should have the opportunity to address the court both in relation to the question of disclosure of the closed evidence, and, if the court then determines that some or all of the closed evidence should remain closed and so withheld from the parents, to represent the father&#8217;s interests at a final hearing of the application for FMPO&#8217;s and the father&#8217;s application to discharge them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I note the weight of authority that the use of Special Advocates in family proceedings is and should be only rarely required. Nevertheless, on the basis of the evidence currently before the court, including the closed material, whilst mindful that I have not yet received submissions on behalf of the father in relation to that evidence, I have determined that a Special Advocate should be appointed and that the procedures set out below should be adopted. My reasons are as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">FMPO&#8217;s are a vital means of protecting the fundamental rights of the protected person but they also have a far-reaching impact on the respondent. Breaches of such orders, without reasonable excuse, constitute an offence punishable with imprisonment of up to five years. Furthermore, in this case the court&#8217;s orders include withholding the children&#8217;s passports from the parents so that the family cannot travel abroad together as the father wishes to arrange. The children&#8217;s mother appears to be living abroad so the consequences of the orders are particularly profound for the family. Accordingly, the orders in this case have a very important purpose and a very significant impact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">At present, following closed proceedings, I am satisfied the FMPO&#8217;s and passport orders are justified on the basis of the evidence I have seen, which includes the closed material. The evidence establishes that A and B are under threat of forced marriage and require protection. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">The court is entitled to determine that certain evidence should not be disclosed and to take into account that closed material to determine that an FMPO should be made. It may well be, following the approach of Sir Nicholas Wall, that on initial consideration of a FMPO application the court can take a view of the material without disclosure to the respondent and without taking steps to allow the respondent to scrutinise or challenge the material. However, when an application is made to set aside a FMPO and/or a passport order made to support a FMPO, then consideration has to be given to how to manage the issue of disclosure and whether there is a role for a Special Advocate - <span style="font-style:italic">A Chief Constable and another v.

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In this case the closed material is of profound significance. The Local Authority has conceded that it could not justify seeking a FMPO or the passport order on the basis of the open evidence alone. I agree that without the closed material there would be insufficient grounds to justify the making of the orders. Accordingly, were the applicant Local Authority not permitted to rely on the closed material, there would be no protection of the children by way of FMPO&#8217;s.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">On the present evidence that I have seen, and prior to any submissions from a Special Advocate, I am satisfied that there would be a significant risk that were the court to order disclosure of the closed material as the father seeks, the Local Authority would withdraw its application rather than elect to disclose. Accordingly, there would be a risk that the opportunity to protect the children&#8217;s rights by way of FMPO&#8217;s would be lost.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The hearing to determine whether final FMPO&#8217;s should be made or whether the existing orders should be set aside, will involve the four stage approach set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K</span> (above). It will involve an evaluation of the underlying facts based on the admissible evidence and an assessment of the need to protect the children and of risk on the basis of those facts. In this case, where the respondent father contests the basis and justification for the orders made, it is difficult to envisage how he could meaningfully participate in such a hearing unless he has some means of scrutinising the closed material. He cannot make a reasoned challenge to a decision to make the FMPO&#8217;s without knowing anything about the evidence on which they have been made. </p>
