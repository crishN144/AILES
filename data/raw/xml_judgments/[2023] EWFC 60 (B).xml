	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Unfortunately this is not the only case that has been before me recently in which a previous judgment given by the court has been completely ignored. For example it is not unusual, following a fact-finding hearing, to see the local authority repeat in its final evidence allegations which were not found proved. The present case was simply a particularly striking example of the problem. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;If a legal rule requires a fact to be proved (a &#8216;fact in issue&#8217;), a judge or jury must decide whether or not it happened. There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.&#8221;</p>

Not only is such a finding admissible, but it is evidence with presumptive weight; otherwise, as Peter Jackson LJ observed, &#8220;there would be no purpose in admitting it. It would be meaningless to treat it as &#8216;just another piece of evidence&#8217;.&#8221; </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re W (A Child) (Adoption: Delay) </span>[2017] EWHC 829, [2017] FLR 1628 a local authority had included within its final care plan the words, &#8220;the local authority considers [the father] is likely to have caused physical harm to [the children]&#8221;. In fact, at an earlier hearing the District Judge had dismissed one of the local authority&#8217;s two allegations of physical harm, and the other was not pursued. Nevertheless, the allegation of physical harm persisted within the local authority&#8217;s corporate memory and was later presented as fact to prospective adopters and to the father&#8217;s employer, with the result that he lost his job. The then President of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, was highly critical of the local authority&#8217;s &#8220;cavalier approach to the facts and disregard for precision.&#8221;</p>

The local authority was put to proof on the s31 threshold criteria, which the Official Solicitor did not accept were met.

In it I set out the findings I made on the disputed issues of fact and my conclusions about the evidence. I found some of the local authority&#8217;s threshold allegations proved, but not others. I accepted some of the parents&#8217; criticisms of the LIFT assessment, but not all. Overall I found that the conclusions of that assessment were sound. I determined that neither parent would be able to care for the children, together or separately, and that unless there was a family member available to care for them (which at that stage was a possibility, but no more) this was a case where nothing else other than adoption would do. </p>

Paragraphs 94 to 100 set out my overall impression of F&#8217;s evidence. Paragraphs 197 to 204 set out my conclusions about his parenting capacity. At paragraphs 75 and 76 I said:</p>

However it clearly had sufficient time to request the files from LB Tower Hamlets, and although the March 2021 judgment was missing it must have been obvious from those papers that a judgment had been delivered. The final bundle in W and X&#8217;s proceedings, which included my judgment, was and continues to be accessible on Caselines, the document management system used by a number of local authorities, and could have been made available to LB Newham at the press of a button. </p>

At best, the court would have been presented with an unnecessarily conflicted and confusing picture. At worst, a decision of huge significance to V and his parents could have been taken on the basis of information that was simply wrong. </p>

My tiredness and frustration during the first hearing perhaps meant that my tone was sharper than it needed to be, for which I apologise. Part of the reason for delivering this judgment in writing, after the end of the hearing, was to ensure that the problems set out here did not become a distraction at the second hearing on the Friday, and that the focus at that hearing remained on V and the interim arrangements for him. </p>
