It is also common ground that they have been wrongfully retained here.  The Father has rights of custody for the children pursuant to section 2 of the Family and Guardianship Code.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">I cannot comment on matters relating to the children&#8217;s experiences or the impact of returning to Poland upon their wellbeing.  With regards to [the Mother], it is concluded that her mental health <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">is highly likely to deteriorate further if she were to return</span>.  In my opinion, this is most likely to occur in the circumstance that [the Mother] is having to rely upon [the Father] and the paternal grandparents, or if she were unable to ensure adequate distance from [the Father] to be able to process her experience of the relationship and associated depression, anxiety and trauma symptoms. A return to the home that she shared with the father is likely to impact upon her mental health as will any regular ongoing contact with [the Father]. In order to minimise the impact on her mental health, she is likely to require support outside of the paternal family, a separate living space and independent life away from [the Father] so she can process and cope with the end of the relationship and the impact she feels the relationship has had upon her. [The Mother] said she is isolated in Poland and has no other support and therefore feels she cannot return. It is my opinion that [the Mother&#8217;s] mental health difficulties will make it difficult for her to integrate and establish an independent life in Poland. [The Mother] is currently heavily reliant upon her family due to her current mental health difficulties.&#8221;</p>

So far as Dr Pickering was aware the Mother was not being prescribed any medication.  Nor, she said, had the Mother ever spent any time hospitalised because of her mental health.  Dr Pickering did not think that the Mother was in need of hospitalisation.  She was asked whether the Mother&#8217;s condition was of such a severity that she was unable to get out bed in the morning.  Dr Pickering replied that the Mother was struggling and that her mother was helping her.  Although she presented with severe depression and said that there with feelings of being overwhelmed,  the Mother was able to function.  At the moment the only help she was receiving for her depression was counselling.</p>

Dr Pickering said it was difficult for her to say whether arranging therapy in advance of a return would help with the transition back to Poland.

Miss Renton suggested to her that there were two ways of mitigating the effects of a return to Poland: support outside of the paternal family and having an independent life.  She asked whether in the absence of both of those factors it was correct that the Mother&#8217;s condition was highly likely to deteriorate.  Dr Pickering said that if the Mother returned, the risk that it would lead to a deterioration would be more heightened if she was in a situation where there was ongoing contact with the Father.  The deterioration could be lessened if she lived completely separately and had support.  Miss Renton asked whether or not the effectiveness of the CBT was dependent on the Mother having support and an independent life.  Dr Pickering agreed that CBT would be more effective if the Mother was outside the stressful situation and could process those experiences.  She was asked about the fact that previously the Mother was advised to stop CBT until out of the relationship with the Father.  Dr Pickering agreed that the Mother had to be in the right environment for the CBT to be effective.  She was asked about whether she had any concerns about the Mother&#8217;s parenting in England.  Dr Pickering said it was not within her remit to assess the Mother&#8217;s capability to parent.</p>

At the end of that treatment, the Mother was likely to be better able to understand and manage her symptoms.  In answer to a question from me, Dr Pickering confirmed that pharmacological treatment might last a longer period of time but that was a matter for the GP.</p>

At the hearing Mr Bennett indicated that the Father would also agree to pay all utilities bills on the Mother&#8217;s property either directly or indirectly.  He also agreed that the state child benefit of 800 zloty per month per child should be paid direct to the Mother.  The Father would take any steps necessary to ensure that maintenance is paid to the Mother. These arrangements could all be put in place in advance of the return to Poland which would mitigate the effects on the Mother&#8217;s mental health of a return to Poland.  Mr Bennett noted that the court could make a return order containing conditions that had to be satisfied before the children&#8217;s return (relying upon <span style="font-style:italic">Walley v Walley</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2005/910" uk:canonical="[2005] EWCA Civ 910" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWCA Civ 910</ref> as authority for such an order).

He noted the Mother was not suicidal, had never been hospitalised, she had previously accessed psychological and social services in Poland before.  Although he accepted that each case turned on its own facts, he submitted that the Mother&#8217;s mental health issues were significantly less severe than in cases where the court had refused summary return because of a parent&#8217;s mental health.  The protective measures were such that the children would not be placed in an intolerable situation.</p>

He argued that a &#8220;teased out&#8221; indication that T did not wish to return to Poland because of the Father&#8217;s shouting was not sufficient to amount to an objection as opposed to a preference.  Mr Bennett argued that if, contrary to that submission, the court concluded that T had objected then the court should exercise its discretion and direct return in any event. The concerns leading to the objection can be met through the protective measures. The children&#8217;s entire lives have been in Poland.  The policy considerations underpinning the 1980 Hague Convention strongly support their return. </p>

In her submission there were no protective measures that would mitigate the risks.  If she was wrong on that, then the protective measures were &#8220;woefully inadequate&#8221;.  The Mother had no friends in Poland, only a few acquaintances.  She is severely depressed and anxious and completely reliant on her parents.  The effectiveness of CBT was dependent on the Mother having a support network.  It would not be the appropriate environment for the Mother in Poland.  The Mother would need more than the 1500 zloty maintenance offered by the Father and the 800 zloty per child benefit. There was no evidence that the Father would be able to make those payments or that he would be able to fund the Mother&#8217;s treatment.  All of which led Miss Renton to submit that the Article 13(b) defence was made out.  </p>

It matters not whether the mother's anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable.

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

Recognising the tension between the summary nature of these proceedings and the court&#8217;s inability to resolve factual disputes between the parties and the risks that the children if will face if in fact they are true I take them at their highest.  Having done so, the question is whether they represent a &#8220;grave risk&#8221; that the children would be exposed to a physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the children in an intolerable situation.  Taking the allegations at their highest, in my judgment there would be such a grave risk on three counts.  First, the risk to T of physical and psychological harm if the accounts of the Father shouting at her and pushing her are true.  Second, the risk to the children of being witness to the Father&#8217;s abusive behaviour to their Mother.  It is well established that it is not reasonable to expect children to be exposed to seeing and hearing the abuse of their own parent (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span>, para 34, cited above).  Thirdly, the risk to H of witnessing the Father&#8217;s behaviour towards his sister, T. </p>

The question is whether or not the impact on the Mother&#8217;s psychological health would be such as to expose the children to a grave risk of psychological harm such that they would be in an intolerable situation (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> at para 34).  </p>

Mr Bennett argued that those cases indicated a significantly more severe psychiatric history.  Miss Renton argued that the absence of a suicidal risk did not mean that the Mother&#8217;s case was dissimilar to those cases where return had been refused.  She referred to the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span> where the mother&#8217;s psychological health was similar to that of the Mother&#8217;s.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with the parties that each case needs to be determined on its facts.  Other cases concerning instances where a parent&#8217;s mental health has been raised by way of an Article 13(b) defence may be helpful as a benchmark for a decision (see para 41 of the judgment of Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Article 13(b)(Mental Ill-health)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2023/2082" uk:canonical="[2023] EWHC 2082 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWHC 2082 (Fam)</ref>).  The key factor is that those cases where return has been refused are predicated upon evidence that the impact on the parent&#8217;s mental health of a return would be such as to give rise to a grave risk that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation.  Although there are some similarities between this case and the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S,</span> it is notable that in that case that the impact of return would be such that the mother&#8217;s capacity to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">hold herself together</span>&#8221; would be undermined and would diminish her attachment to the child (see para 18 of Lord Wilson&#8217;s judgment).

Although the Mother told Dr Pickering that she would have difficulty accessing doctors by herself (see above at paragraph 42) the evidence indicates that the Mother has been able to access support. Whilst I accept that the Father&#8217;s parents had previously helped in accessing some of that support, there were other occasions when the Mother accessed support herself. </p>

However, the Mother&#8217;s mental health is not the only basis upon which the Mother advances an Article 13(b) defence.  Whilst the parties addressed each of the two aspects of the Mother&#8217;s defence separately, they each rightly argued that I needed to take into account the cumulative effect of both aspects.  The cumulative effect of the allegations  must be considered so as to evaluate the nature and level of any grave risks that might potentially be established as well as the protective measures to address such risks (<span style="font-style:italic">Re.

That means that the children and the Mother would not be returned to the former matrimonial home nor to the block of flats that is owned by the Father&#8217;s family.  The Mother and the children can live independently and separately.  That would significantly go towards ameliorating the grave risk of harm to the children through witnessing abusive behaviour by the Father and it would also significantly assist in the efficacy of the CBT treatment for the Mother.  It would mean that CBT could be commenced when the Mother is away from the stressful context of living in the former matrimonial home and in the block of flats owned by the Father. </p>

The Father has said that he would make the maintenance payments in whatever way the Mother requires so that she can have independence.  Payment of the maintenance offered in advance and an undertaking that the Mother will receive the child benefit direct would meet this objective. </p>

That preference seems to be a wish to live in England with her mother rather than that T objecting to a return to Poland.   However, she expressed a strong adverse reaction when asked about returning to Poland (she screwed up her face in distaste and nodded vigorously in response to Ms Veitch saying it &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">looked really not want to go back to Poland</span>&#8221;).  In the letter to the Judge she said that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I really don&#8217;t want to go back to Poland</span>&#8221;.  Accepting there is a fairly low threshold at the gateway stage (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, at para 70), I conclude (albeit with some hesitation) that T &#8220;objects&#8221; to the return to Poland.  </p>
