I delivered an earlier judgment in this case in which I reviewed the framework of applications for recognition and enforcement under Schedule 3 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (MCA).

I do not propose to rehearse the background history here. SM has been treated in the UK at a specialist facility, Ellern Mede for which there is no equivalent in Ireland. She has made considerable progress, though that that has not been linear. Her progress has been punctuated with very significant periods of regression.</p>

The President noted that the HSE&#8217;s application was supported by SM&#8217;s Committee in wardship, the General Solicitor and by her social worker. The following paragraphs of the judgment require to be set out in full:</p>

That progress is evidenced by a number of reports which are before the Court and they include the first report from [Dr R], a consultant psychiatrist&#8230; and her report is dated 12th April 2024. She provides a very detailed report on [SM]&#8217;s progress since she moved to Ellern Mede&#8230;It does show some significant positive changes and improvements, including [SM]&#8217;s acceptance of some food and also her increased preparedness to communicate with members of staff. Also, as [Dr R] notes, [SM] has been showing forward thinking in terms of wanting to consider discharge options and she has been engaging in that.</span></p>

She notes that [SM]'s mental state has improved significantly since she was admitted in January 2024, and she says that in her opinion continuing or ongoing in-patient treatment for [SM] for a number of months, she says, as least a further six months is warranted on the evidence. She also expresses the view that [SM] does lack capacity to consent to this treatment in care and that she does need the framework, the legal framework in place in order for them to continue to provide the treatment and care that they've been providing to [SM] since she moved to Ellern Mede.</span></p>

And equally, she says, that despite the positive progress that [SM] has made that she does continue to be at risk of malnutrition, self-harm, physical health complications and self-neglect and, further, that she will require psychotropic medication and high levels of specialist support in the various areas that are mentioned, physiotherapy, dietetics support, support with self-care, socialisation work and, most importantly, trauma-informed therapy and a specialised trauma therapist, &#8230; has been identified and I think will commence, if she hasn't already commenced, working closely with [SM] and it is anticipated that if [SM] were to move to a step-down type placement that [the therapist] would be able to remain involved because trauma is obviously a very significant feature of [SM]'s case.</span></p>

So she says that the placement with Ellern Mede, which has been secured and funded by the HSE, is the only viable option at this point. She also confirms the question of capacity as I have mentioned.&#8221;</span></p>

The examples of that progress included coming off her NG feed, engaging with the trauma therapist, engaging in psychotherapy, having all meals as food and nutritional supplements as well as other little day-to-day steps forward. Her vulnerability was emphasised in terms of sitting on the mattress for almost half of the day, remaining non-verbal and the distress caused in going to the bathroom.</span></p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.49in"><span style="font-style:italic">First, by including Schedule 3 in the MCA, Parliament authorised a system of recognition and enforcement of foreign orders notwithstanding the fact that the approach of the foreign courts and laws to these issues may be different to that of the domestic court. These differences may extend not only to the way in which the individual is treated but also to questions of jurisprudence and capacity. Thus the fact that there are provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that appear to conflict with the laws and procedures of the foreign state should not by itself lead to a refusal to recognise or enforce the foreign order. Given that Parliament has included section 63 and Schedule 3 within the MCA, clearly intending to facilitate recognition and enforcement in such circumstances, it cannot be the case that those other provisions within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that seemingly conflict with the laws and procedures of the foreign state are mandatory provisions of the laws of England and Wales so as to justify the English Court refusing to recognise the foreign order on grounds of such inconsistency. In such circumstances, it is only where the Court concludes that recognition of the foreign measure would be manifestly contrary to public policy that the discretionary ground to refuse recognition will arise. Furthermore, in conducting the public policy review, the Court must always bear in mind, in the words of Munby LJ that &#8220;the test is stringent, the bar is set high&#8221;.</span></p>

As the Ministry of Justice has observed, inevitably there may be concerns about some of the foreign jurisdictions from which orders might come. But as the Ministry also observes, taking account of such concerns is surely the purpose of the public policy review. Although no wide-ranging review as to the merits of the foreign measure is either necessary or appropriate, a limited review will always be required as indicated by the European Court in Pellegrini. That will be sufficient to identify any cases where the content and form of the foreign measure, and the processes by which it was taken, are objectionable. It also seems to me that the circumstances in which Schedule 3 is likely to be invoked, and the number of countries whose orders are presented for recognition, are likely to be limited. In oral submissions, Mr Rees pointed out that, in theory, the Court could be faced with applications to recognise and enforce orders from any country in the world, including, for example, North Korea or Iran. That may be right in theory, but common sense suggests it is, to say the least, unlikely in practice, at least in the foreseeable future. And if such orders were to be presented for recognition, the public policy review would surely lead swiftly to identifying grounds on which recognition would be refused. It is much more likely that the orders presented for recognition will be those of foreign countries whose legal systems, laws and procedures are closely aligned to our own. Concerns of this nature can be addressed by admitting evidence of the process by which the foreign protective measures were made and general evidence relating to the legal system of the state that made the order.</span></p>

As a result, in such cases there is likely to be repeated requests to scrutinise a succession of orders. Recognition and enforcement is likely to require close co-operation, not only between the medical and social care authorities of the two countries, but also between the Courts and legal systems. The Convention provides a mechanism using the Central Authorities but, pending ratification of the Convention, there may well be the need for direct communication between judges of the two jurisdictions.&#8221;</span></p>

I accepted the HSE&#8217;s submissions in this regard, agreeing that the Schedule 3 regime provides effective protection of an adult&#8217;s rights, even where it may apply for long periods. Indeed, I recognised that the arrangements between the HSE and English health care providers, via Schedule 3, have many advantages (see paragraphs 44-51). I noted that a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;striking benefit&#8221;</span> of the Schedule 3 regime is that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it provides clarity of responsibility. There is a clear, unbroken chain of command from patient to court. It also provides an avoidance of &#8220;jurisdictional confusion&#8221;, which ought always to be regarded as inherently dangerous and potentially inimical to the welfare of the adult concerned&#8221;</span> (paragraph 49).</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The High Court in both jurisdictions has been vigilant to safeguard SM&#8217;s fundamental rights and freedoms. It is always troubling to every judge to see the protracted restriction of individual liberty in cases of this kind, particularly so where that concerns a vulnerable young person. The obligation of the courts is to make such restrictions only where identifiably necessary and for the shortest period possible. SM has expressed herself as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;satisfied to be receiving treatment at Ellern Mede&#8221;</span>. She expresses herself carefully and with much thought. She is not prepared to say that she consents to the treatment. Instead, she observes that it is difficult to say she wants to be there as she does not want her experience to be perceived as positive. Plainly, it is not. The regime is, of necessity, challenging and distressing.</p>

Her diagnosis in my opinion is in keeping with a depressive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and eating disorder namely anorexia. Over the last six months [SM]'s presentation has deteriorated again to the point where she is isolated now in her room and has stopped talking, electively mute, walking eating and caring for herself. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">[SM] needs assistance with the very basics of daily living and appears to be in a state of learned helplessness.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (my emphasis)</span></p>

Given this is now the second time [SM] has presented in this way, my impression is that her current presentation appears to have shifted from a typical eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, to one that is more severe and in keeping with pervasive arousal withdrawal syndrome or PAWS as her functional disabilities have extended to domains other than feeding, including walking, talking and caring for herself. [SM]'s mental state remains very unwell and fragile. The nature and degree of her mental disorder is in my opinion one warranting ongoing inpatient treatment on a specialist eating disorder unit for at least the next 12 months. This will need further review depending on mental state and level of risk nearer the time.&#8221;</span></p>

I consider her position to be entirely well reasoned. Indeed, I am bound to say, it does not sit comfortably with the conclusion that she lacks capacity to litigate. Similarly, her recognition of the benefit of treatment at Ellern Mede and her careful navigation of the issue of consent also show indications of, at very least, some degree of capacity or potential for decision taking in this sphere.

SM&#8217;s capacity to consent to treatment requires equally scrupulous review, recognising that it may fluctuate. Into such review, must always be factored the recognition that a refusal of treatment, whilst it might objectively be regarded as unwise, will not always be an incapacitous decision.</p>

As the definition of &#8220;adult&#8221; in Schedule 3 para 4 plainly extends to persons who may not be incapacitated within the meaning of section 2, it follows that the Court will be obliged to recognise and enforce orders of a foreign court in terms that could not be included in an order made under the domestic jurisdiction under the MCA. This is subject, however, to its discretion to refuse recognition and enforcement where that would be manifestly contrary to public policy. I agree and adopt Hedley J&#8217;s conclusion in Re MN that a decision to recognise under paragraph 19(1) or to enforce under paragraph 22(2) is not a decision governed by the best interests of the individual so that those paragraphs are not disapplied by paragraph 19(4)(b) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. Thus it follows that the Court will be obliged to recognise and enforce a measure in a foreign court order even where applying a best interests test it would not be included in an order made under the domestic jurisdiction under the MCA. Again, however, this is subject, to its discretion to refuse recognition and enforcement where that would be manifestly contrary to public policy.&#8221;</span></p>

I accepted the HSE&#8217;s primary submission that the Schedule 3 regime is apt to provide effective protection of an adult&#8217;s rights, even where it may endure for a significant period. Indeed, I recognised that the arrangements between the HSE and English health care providers, via Schedule 3, have many advantages (see paragraphs 44-51). I observed that one <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;striking benefit&#8221;</span> of the Schedule 3 regime is that:</p>

It was for this reason, that I took time to consider the scope and ambit of SM&#8217;s ECHR Convention Rights, which were, and remain, engaged. In doing so, then as now, I appreciate that recognition of a foreign measure would not be granted in circumstances where, to repeat Baker J&#8217;s phrase, the order would be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;manifestly contrary to public policy&#8221;</span>. Moreover, in the analysis of that issue, it is necessary always to bear in mind the observation of Munby LJ, as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re L (A Child) (Recognition of a Foreign Order) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1157" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1157" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1157</ref></span> that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the test is stringent, the bar is set high&#8221;</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">SM&#8217;s welfare has been unswervingly in focus during the Irish High Court&#8217;s exercise of its inherent jurisdictional powers. It is clear, however, that SM&#8217;s capacity has fluctuated over the last 6 months and may well continue to do so. Some of her recent recorded observations are, as I have commented, both measured and insightful. I consider that, in such circumstances, having emphasised both the duration and the draconian nature of the order that I am invited to recognise and enforce, I am required, properly respecting SM&#8217;s rights, to satisfy myself that she continues to lack capacity in the sphere of decision taking surrounding her medical treatment. This I regard as my obligation, both under the Human Rights Act 1989 and in ensuring that this order remains compatible with public policy in England and Wales. As the papers presently stand, I am not yet able to undertake this exercise in the way that is required, as analysed above. For this reason, I propose to direct an up-to-date assessment of SM&#8217;s capacity to understand and consent to her continuing treatment. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not require any assessment as to whether such treatment remains in her best interests. Like the Irish High Court, I am entirely satisfied that it is.</p>

That report is to be filed by 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2024. For the avoidance of doubt, I am satisfied that the evidence as it presently stands, enables me to continue to recognise and enforce the orders of the Irish High Court.</p>
