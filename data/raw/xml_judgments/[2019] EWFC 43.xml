When the matter was next listed the court joined the children as parties, appointed the parental order reporter as the Children&#8217;s Guardian who was represented by Ms Carew, from Cafcass Legal. The email from the applicants was treated as an application for leave to withdraw their application pursuant to rule 29.4 Family Procedure Rules 2010 (FPR 2010). In deciding such an application, the welfare of the child is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.<span style="font-weight:bold"/> Directions were made for the Children&#8217;s Guardian to file a further report and for the applicants to attend the next hearing on 18 June. </p>

Whilst she recognised the court could make a parental order without the attendance of the applicants as the rules (rule 13.9 FPR 2010) only require the attendance of the applicants at the directions hearing, that was not a course she supported. This is an order that, if made, changed the status of the children and required participation (save in exceptional circumstances) in the process by the applicants. The last time anyone saw or had anything other than email contact with the applicants was in mid- March, some three months ago. </p>

Both Ms Carew and the Children&#8217;s Guardian have made extensive efforts to contact the applicants to outline the possible consequences of their position. To date none of those efforts have met with a positive response and there is no evidence to suggest any change in the applicant&#8217;s position. </p>

In this case, although it is an option the applicants may change their mind there is no sign of that to date and it is not a course that is proposed by the applicants.

Whilst on one view this will meet the welfare needs of the children as it will secure their legal status with the applicants in a lifelong way the position remains that there are evidential gaps in the information the court requires to satisfy the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54</ref> criteria. In addition, even if those gaps could be filled there remains the fact that any information about the applicants and the circumstances of the children are now somewhat out of date. The applicant&#8217;s position whilst explicable through what they see as the court requiring further information (that they do not consider necessary) remains, in my judgment on the information the court has, lacking focus by them on the lifelong welfare needs of the children in their care. By taking the position they have they have risked the children&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs being met by pursuing their application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.2in">Fourth, to grant the applicants deemed application for leave to withdraw the application under r 29.4 (1) FPR 2010. Such an application can only succeed with the permission of the court (r 29.4 (2) FPR 2010). As the court&#8217;s decision involves a question with respect to the upbringing of a child the child&#8217;s welfare is the courts paramount consideration (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1 (1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>). This course is supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian as although he considers the applicants position to be contrary to the welfare needs of the children he cannot see any advantage to the children for the application to be left in abeyance without any prospect of the applicant&#8217;s changing their mind. In any event, if they did it would be open to them to make a fresh application. Although such an application would be after the period of 6 months following the birth of the children had expired (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54 (3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>) the court is very likely to allow the application to proceed, as such an order will meet the welfare needs of the children. If the application was withdrawn it would be on the basis the child arrangements order remains in place. That ensures the applicants retain parental responsibility.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.2in">Ms Carew has also submitted that the court should make a separate free-standing parental responsibility order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>. She supports that by drawing the courts attention to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>. This provides that where the court makes a child arrangements order in favour of the father and it is a live with order, then the court &#8216;must&#8217; make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> giving the father parental responsibility when the father has not otherwise acquired it (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/12/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 12 (1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>) . Mr Z in this case does not have parental responsibility by virtue of being on the birth certificate when the children were registered in Country A, as the birth certificate is not recognised here for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4</ref> (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4</ref> (1A) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>) and he had not acquired it any other way. He is, however, the father by virtue of his biological connection and the fact that the surrogate was not married. Consequently, he is the father (as there is no-one else who is deemed the father) but does not have parental responsibility by virtue of the CAO made previously by the court, therefore the court is required to make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4</ref>. As Ms Carew points out, it is only a parent who can be given an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4</ref>. Ms Y cannot have such an order as her parental responsibility arises only from the child arrangements order, as the surrogate remains the legal mother. This means, as a matter of law, her parental responsibility could be said to be more precarious as it would be discharged automatically on the discharge of the child arrangements order. Whereas parental responsibility under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4</ref> can only be discharged by an application to the court or the making of an order that affects status, such as an adoption order. As Ms Carew submits there is no difference to the quality of the parental responsibility, but an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref> </p>

This can have implications both in the short and long term. For example, the applicants will need to consider such matters as what provision is made following their deaths, as their status in relation to their eldest child and the younger children is different. They will need to ensure this difference is properly provided for, to make sure that whatever provision they intend should happen actually takes place. </p>
