		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that something must be done to prevent the waste of costs and court time, and prejudice to the applicant, caused by applications to set aside which have only questionable chances of success. That must of course be balanced by a proper application of the threshold of "substantial ground." But as Deane J said in the Federal Court of Australia in an entirely different context, "the word 'substantial' is not only susceptible of ambiguity: it is a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision": Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1979) 42 FLR 331" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1979">(1979) 42 FLR 331</ref>, 348. </p>

	      <content>
		<p class="ind" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present context the principal object of the filter mechanism is to prevent wholly unmeritorious claims being pursued to oppress or blackmail a former spouse. The threshold is not high, but is higher than "serious issue to be tried" or "good arguable case" found in other contexts. It is perhaps best expressed by saying that in this context "substantial" means "solid." Once a judge has given reasons for deciding at the ex parte stage that the threshold has been crossed, the approach to setting aside leave should be the same as the approach to setting aside permission to appeal in the Civil Procedure Rules, where (by contrast with the Family Proceedings Rules) there is an express power to set aside, but which may only be exercised where there is a compelling reason to do so: CPR r 52.9(2). In practice in the Court of Appeal the power is only exercised where some decisive authority has been overlooked so that the appeal is bound to fail, or where the court has been misled: <span class="Emphasis">Barings Bank plc v Coopers &amp; Lybrand [</span>2002] EWCA Civ 1155; <span class="Emphasis">Nathan v Smilovitch</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/759" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 759" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA Civ 759</ref>. In an application under section 13, unless it is clear that the respondent can deliver a knock-out blow, the court should use its case management powers to adjourn an application to set aside to be heard with the substantive application.  </p>

	  </paragraph>
	</level>
	<level eId="lvl_5">
	  <heading class="jus" style="text-align:left">The differences between the various tests referred to by Lord Collins are very subtle and highly nuanced. We now all know that a substantial/solid ground is a stiffer test than a "serious issue to be tried" or a "good arguable case", albeit, as Lord Collins points out, the word "substantial" is calculated to give rise to ambiguity. In my opinion a solid/substantial ground will be shown where the court can confidently say that the probability is greater than or equal to 50% that the applicant will achieve a substantive order were the matter to be tried.</heading>

	      <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;text-indent:0.5in">I should say a few words about procedure. Here W has filed a statement, submitted a skeleton, and instructed counsel.  The reason she was able to do all this was because she was served with the originating process, even though there was no requirement to do so. There was some faint protest raised at the presence of her legal team and I was asked not to read the skeleton submitted on her behalf. I think that there is a helpful analogy to be drawn with the appellate process, an analogy that is given legitimacy by para 33 of Agbaje. Although an application for permission to appeal is strictly ex parte it is a commonplace for the other party to file a skeleton in opposition, and such a skeleton is invariably read (in my experience). Moreover, the Court of Appeal has full power to adjourn the application for permission to be heard inter partes either with or without the appeal proper to follow if granted.</p>

The Working Paper suggested that the ground for leave be that in all the circumstances the case was a proper one to be heard, but it added (para 53, n 195) that the court would have an inherent power to deal with individual cases in the most convenient way, e.g. by adjourning an application for leave to enable evidence to be filed by the other side; and by dealing with applications for leave inter partes and (if leave is given) with the substantive matters at the same hearing. The Law Commission Report recommended that the filter should require the applicant to establish "a substantial ground" for the making of the application, and if necessary Rules of Court could specify the circumstances in which the respondent could object: para 2.3.  </p>

The forename and the maiden name of the wife's mother is:  SK.  The forename and the maiden name of the husband's mother was: HJ.  The husband was born at the place of the marriage, i.e. in Southend-on-Sea in the county of Essex in England.  The solicitor Michael H&#252;ppi has assisted the spouses in drawing up the divorce settlement.  The spouses are at present still living together, but see each other rarely, as the husband is a cameraman and is generally away during the week.  As from August 2007, he expects to obtain permanent employment, from which he will earn between SFr. 60,000 and SFr. 70,000 per annum.  Both spouses have a pension within the meaning of the AHV [Old Age Pensions Regulation], the wife in Germany and in Switzerland, the husband in England.  The husband also has a company pension in England and the wife has a small company pension in Switzerland.  As the various systems are scarcely compatible, both spouses have waived the right to a pension rights adjustment.  I discussed the settlement with the spouses and there were no amendments.  The wife is happy for her maiden name Z not to be mentioned if possible, including in the final decree.  She apparently has bad memories in that regard, as when I asked her about it, she broke down in tears.  Having discussed the matter in full, I imposed a 2-month period for reflection for the spouses and provided them with the prepared declaration of confirmation." </p>

From the terms of the ruling it can be seen that Dr Pfister had before him a copy of the parties' joint 2005 tax return. This records the parties' assets in Switzerland and abroad. In line 31 alongside the legend Liegenschaften (real property) is recorded the value of CHF400,000. This is a reference to the London flat. That figure is carried to line 33 as part of a total figure of CHF430,001 which bears the legend Total der Verm&#246;genswerte" (total assets). The word Verm&#246;genswerte appears in clause 3.2 of the agreement. Yet H says that he was not aware that clause 3.2 embraced real property.

It does not address their joint bank account or a joint policy. Moreover, the tax return to which the judge referred stated, correctly as at 2005, that the flat was jointly owned. The judge must be taken to have been intending to approve the continued joint ownership of the flat.  Thus it is submitted that if the order in fact confirms the sole ownership of the flat by W then it is flawed by a mistake.</p>

So it is that H comes to this court &#8211; to remedy supposed deficiencies in the Swiss law of rectification.</p>

If this shows that a provision awarded is designed to enable one spouse to provide for himself or herself or if the needs and resources of each of the spouses are taken into consideration in the determination of its amount, the decision will be concerned with maintenance. On the other hand, where the provision awarded is solely concerned with dividing property between the spouses, the decision will be concerned with rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship and will not therefore be enforceable under the Brussels Convention. A decision which does both these things may, in accordance with Art 42 of the Brussels Convention, be enforced in part if it clearly shows the aims to which the different parts of the judicial provision correspond.</p>

This will be the case whether the needs are for accommodation or income; and whether they are satisfied by way of Duxbury lump sum or periodical payments; or by the supply of one or more homes; or by pension sharing.</p>

	  <heading class="ind" style="margin-left:0in">[80]  The ruling by the European Court was that a lump sum payment was to be regarded as maintenance if its purpose was to ensure the former spouse's maintenance. Although its formulation differs slightly from that of Jacobs AG (who spoke of the 'essential object' of the order for payment), the European Court expressly approved much of Jacobs AG's opinion. The following propositions may be derived from this decision: first, whether a claim is for maintenance depends upon an autonomous interpretation of the term, and the label given to the claim by national law is not decisive; secondly, payment of a lump sum or transfer of property may be in the nature of maintenance if it is intended to ensure the support of a spouse; thirdly, payment of a lump sum or transfer of property which serves only the purpose of a division of property or compensation for non-material damage is not in the nature of maintenance; fourthly, a payment or transfer of property intended as a division of assets will concern 'rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship'; fifthly, whether a claim relates to maintenance will depend on its purpose, and in particular whether it is designed to enable one spouse to provide for himself or herself or if the needs and resources of each of the spouses are taken into consideration in the determination of its amount, or where the capital sum set is designed to ensure a predetermined level of income; sixthly, where the provision is solely concerned with dividing property between the spouses, the decision will be concerned with rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship and will not therefore be enforceable under Brussels I. </heading>

I adhere to that. The approach is never to assess the award by reference to the principles or rationales as if they are separate heads of claim. Rather, the results suggested by the separate principles or rationales coalesce in the decision making process in a highly fact-specific way.  So, for example, Mrs Lambert's claim for &#163;10m was being equally justified by reference to both needs and sharing . Even Mrs Charman's &#163;48m contained an ingredient for the satisfaction of need, even if other factors "elbowed aside" that factor . </p>

It is significant that Lord Collins' third primary piece of guidance in para 73 is that "where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse". That is plainly the track down which this case would go were it permissible to do so. But needs is forbidden territory under the Lugano Convention.</p>

But even if the Lugano factor were not in play I would consider it extremely improbable that H would be able to persuade a court hearing this matter substantively that he did not understand what he was doing when he signed the TR1 and the Swiss divorce settlement. Thus we have here a classic foreign post-nup, but in this case bolstered by a foreign order.

Of course I am alive to Lord Collins's sweeping away of an accumulation of judicial glosses that had piled up on Part III but I would be most surprised if he were saying that a different test should apply to a post-nup being considered under Part III as compared to one being considered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss25</ref> and 35 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>.
