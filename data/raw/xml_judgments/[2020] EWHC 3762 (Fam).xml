It follows that this conduct cannot have been anything apart from an attempt to scare the Mother by making false claims about orders that the Father had obtained when this was untrue.  I consider that the Father deliberately presented a false picture to the court in 2018, continued that conduct between the two sets of proceedings and continued it in these proceedings.  I am therefore satisfied that it is appropriate to require the Father to make a substantial contribution towards the Mother&#8217;s costs of these proceedings based on the Father&#8217;s conduct. </p>
