The parents are Mr F and Ms H.  Mr F is the applicant in these proceedings and he is represented by Ms Dowse.  Ms H is the respondent and she is represented by Ms Stout.  Both counsel have put their clients&#8217; cases thoroughly and with determination and skill and I am most grateful.  Time was lost during the hearing, much of the third day for reasons beyond any of our control.  As a result, this judgment which I am giving on the afternoon of the fourth day, not long after the ending of submissions, will not deal with every point or document even if that were desirable or possible.  Nor, it is fair to say, have I had time to edit what I want to say as I would wish.  However, I have come to very firm conclusions and am confident that what I am going to say sufficiently explains how I have reached them.</span></p>

The proceedings started with a flurry of applications from the end of June into August 2023, initially by the father, then the mother.  The applications which remain to be determined are the father&#8217;s applications for child arrangements orders, prohibited steps orders and specific issue orders in relation to both boys, and the mother&#8217;s application for a non-molestation order for herself and for a child arrangements order and prohibited steps order in relation to the boys.  There were proceedings briefly brought by the father in the High Court but I do not think I need to be concerned now with those.</span></p>

There was a hearing before me on 23 August 2023 when it became clear there was a need for a fact-finding hearing because it was the mother&#8217;s case that she and the children have been the victims of the father&#8217;s domestic abuse, in particular, coercive and controlling behaviour, which the father denied.  It was apparent that Mr F intended to make allegations of domestic abuse, in particular, coercive and controlling behaviour against Ms H he having said there was abuse concerning the children in his original application.</span></p>

Cafcass were asked to prepare a report which was to be informed by this judgment as well as by their own enquiries.  The children&#8217;s previous school was directed to provide disclosure of their records.  Police disclosure was also ordered.

Mr F is white and Ms H is black.  The twins are therefore of dual heritage with D being very fair and B having a darker complexion and dark hair.  Both parties have made allegations against the other.  The mother&#8217;s allegations can be divided into three categories: that the father was controlling emotionally, verbally, financially and physically abusive to her.  She alleges that the respondent was emotionally abusive to her and the children because of the way he treated her in front of the children and the way he encouraged the children to treat her, and that he was excessively controlling of the children and aggressive and physically abusive to them.  The father&#8217;s allegations can be divided into these categories: he alleges that the mother was emotionally abusive, threatening, coercive and controlling of him and financially abusive to him, that the mother was emotionally abusive of the children and that she was physically abusive of the children.  </span></p>

That is one of the main reasons why the Courts try to establish the facts of what has happened when one or both of the parents say that domestic abuse which is a wider term has taken place.

In short, a pattern of coercive and/or controlling behaviour can be as abusive as or more abusive than any particular factual incident that might be written down and included in a schedule in court proceedings&#8230;It follows that the harm to a child in an abusive household is not limited to cases of actual violence to the child or to the parent.  A pattern of abusive behaviour is as relevant to the child as to the adult victim.  The child can be harmed in any one or a combination of ways for example where the abusive behaviour:</span></p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities.  However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the Court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence.  Indeed, in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable&#8221;.</span></p>

They disagree about the particular incidents which are dealt with in their allegations but also disagree profoundly about the nature of their relationship.  A person who has been subject to domestic abuse including possibly coercive and controlling behaviour can react to what has happened to him or her in various ways.  For example, she or he can take a long time to realise their situation and give the impression of a happy relationship to others in the meantime.  She or he can be intimidated by their partner either directly or subtly so that they feel unable to be honest about how they feel to outsiders and within the relationship.  It is sometimes the case that a traumatised person&#8217;s memory is affected and that can affect the evidence they give.  A person in this position can find it hard to give evidence about their experiences because it is so painful to relive what has happened.</span></p>

He has forbidden her to have friendships with men save for one homosexual man.  Her family is not welcome.  She says he has not allowed her to use the household machines such as the washing machine.

He says he told the mother off for calling him or the children names or being aggressive or mean to him.

Allegation four, he says that it is coercive and controlling behaviour because the mother has lied in her statements to the Court and manipulated the authorities.  He says he is the victim and not the perpetrator.  Allegation five is that the mother has financially abused him because she would not contribute to household bills and kept her financial details a secret and tried to mislead him as to how much money resulted from the sale of her flat.</span></p>

Ms H was able to say things she had done which she regretted on several occasions when it was not necessary to do so.  She has reflected on the past 10 years and has acquired now a degree of objectivity about what happened.  Her evidence about the impact on the boys was that she was acutely aware that damage had been caused and that she failed the boys for allowing them to live in this situation for so many years.

Both parents were working but I understand that Mr&#160;F earns more which is not surprising as Ms H took five years out of work to care for the twins.  She may have managed to start a small savings pot.  Most of the childcare and the running of the home was undertaken by Mr F which was his choice.  The boys were increasingly hostile toward their mother from whose care they were generally excluded.</span></p>

If, on the other hand, these things have resulted from the boys and their mother being under the coercive and controlling behaviour of their father, it is easier to understand how, prior to 23 June 2023, this was a household where Mr F&#8217;s rules were what matters when Ms H after 10 years in the relationship had no legal ownership of the home, where most of the childcare and the running of the housework was done by Mr&#160;F which is what he wanted but was against her wishes and the children&#8217;s behaviour was increasingly disturbed and out of control.</span></p>

Mr F has a letter from his sister which adds little evidentially.  She reports clutter in the family home after the mother and the boys left.  She says that Mr&#160;F told her about being called names by Ms H and her mother which he said started with the Croatia holiday and how he said that she also did this to the boys.  His sister says that Mr F had told her about the ending of the Croatia holiday and how Ms&#160;H had shouted at him that he wanted her dead so he could have the children.  It is not clear when Mr F told her this and she did not make a statement or give evidence, though I am told that it was the father&#8217;s wish that she did but he was not permitted to do so.  She says that Mr F has told her that Ms H does not like visitors, that she visited on the boys&#8217; birthdays in 2022 after their celebrations and did not feel welcome.  </span></p>

She said that he felt bullied and manipulated, that she called him names and behaved in a childish and unreasonable manner.  She then says that they were not really in contact much but earlier in 2023 he had told her that he had become very concerned about the welfare of the boys, that Ms H was calling them names and they were scared to be left with her when Mr F went out.

There is very little detail about anything else.  Ms H has accepted that she behaved childishly, for example, by sticking her finger up at the doorbell camera which she says, and I accept, Mr&#160;F used to monitor her comings and goings and to which she had no access.  It was Mr F who told the boys that their mother had just sworn at him through the doorbell which was wholly unnecessary.  The evidence supports Mr F&#8217;s unhappiness in their relationship since at least 2020, maybe earlier but mostly, this is self-reporting and does not support findings of domestic abuse but at its highest, some bad behaviour by Ms&#160;H which this judgment puts into context.  This is not because there is some higher standard that a man has to prove when he is the victim of domestic abuse, it is because Ms&#160;H has not been a perpetrator of domestic abuse against Mr F.</span></p>

For that reason, even after reaching the conclusion that she was in a relationship of coercive control, she had been highly reluctant to leave the family home abruptly and until very recently, was tolerating a home environment that was becoming more abusive and controlling while she investigated potential ways forward that would cause the least harm to the family including considering the possibility of having to remain in the family home for up to a year after separation until things could be officially agreed.  Ms H finally took the very difficult decision that it was crucial to remove herself and the children as a matter of urgency when the negative impact of the unhealthy home environment on the children became more apparent and their behaviour both at home and at school deteriorated&#8221;.</span></p>

There is nothing in Ms&#160;H&#8217;s character or behaviour to make me think that Ms H planned back in July&#160;2022 when her therapy started that she would make up all these allegations which are consistent with all her allegations in order to be able to produce such a letter in proceedings which she had not yet thought of .  By the time this letter was written, Ms H had had 42 sessions with the therapist and I think it is much more likely that Ms H has discussed with the therapist over that year the experiences which she has now told the Court about.  I find this is reliable corroboration of Ms H&#8217;s case.  It is also important to note that the therapist notes the improvement in Ms H&#8217;s mental&#160;health and well-being since she left despite the difficult circumstances of her living arrangements and the pressure of the proceedings and the correspondence.  I agree that this is supportive of the impact of living with Mr F on Ms H&#8217;s wellbeing before she left.  </span></p>

Mr F gave these to them in May 2023, I believe, and they took them to Centre Parks in Belgium over the half-term holiday.  The Maternal Grandmother, Ms H&#8217;s mother, gave evidence that when they left Centre Parcs, each boy had only written on the first page of their diaries.  Mr F, however, has produced several pages of B&#8217; diary and quotes various things which B has written, allegations against the mother and The Maternal Grandmother.  Ms H told me that the boys do not say negative things about their father in his earshot but they have always been encouraged to listen and report back.  She said that the boys know that their father requires a full report on everything to do with her.</span></p>

For example, she recalls her mother telling her that she must be an idiot for allowing Mr F to treat her as he did in a conversation after the boys were in bed.  This has been reported by B in his diary that his mother called him &#8220;a bloody idiot&#8221;, or his grandmother, I cannot remember, which did not happen.  I believe Ms H.  Most eight-year-old boys do not want to keep diaries and it is significant that their father gave them the diaries just before the holiday which he was not participating in.  I find this was part of his manipulation of the boys and that the entries after the first page were not done of the boys&#8217; own volition.</span></p>

I do not need to resolve this and cannot do so.  It is, though, important for me to note that the boys told the police on 23 June that they wanted to go home.

I find the allegation proven.  The videos which Ms H has produced of the family in the snow, particularly, the one in the garden, is of great significance.  I find this behaviour of Mr F was typical of how he treated Ms H.  He wanted to exclude her from the family activity.  He wanted the boys to think negatively about their mother.  Mr&#160;F&#8217;s explanation of how he only behaved in this way because of the mother&#8217;s previous behaviour is a clear nonsense.</span></p>

This is not a case of serious physical abuse in this at all.  However, I remind myself that one of the ways that the boys have been affected by Mr F&#8217;s behaviour is to attack their mother physically.  Therefore, Mr&#160;F should have been extremely careful not to model any physical abuse at all.  I do find that he pinched her when she snored at night.  This was an example of Mr F&#8217;s rigidity of thinking.  He told me that when they first got together, Ms H told him to nudge her if she snored and he thought it was unfair that she was now saying something else.  He could not understand that situations change.  People change. People change their minds.  Ms&#160;H became chronically short of sleep because of the constant interruptions because Mr&#160;F was always, she says &#8220;pinching&#8221;, he says &#8220;nudging&#8221; her at night.</span></p>

It is the case that Ms H could have physically walked to football but she was so much under Mr F&#8217;s control and so very wary of causing his displeasure or upsetting the boys who were programmed always to support their father she could not go.  Similarly, he prevented her from sitting down and having breakfast with the children.  His explanation that this was because Ms H distracted them unreasonably and caused arguments is not credible.  It was all part of Mr F distancing the boys from their mother.  I find Ms&#160;H was generally not allowed to have a bath other than on Sundays.  This tallies with what the Maternal Grandmother says about Mr F checking the water meter.  Mr F denies this and suggests that Ms H chose only to bath once a week which I do not find credible.  Ms H is clearly a lady who is concerned about her appearance.  </span></p>

I think it is most likely that the family and friends of both parents felt unwelcome at the family home because the atmosphere there was so toxic and because the place was a mess.  I do not make a finding against either party on this issue.  What is of more concern is that the boys did not have friends around and Ms H alleges this was because Mr F made it clear this was not welcome.  On the balance of probability, I find this proven as Mr F&#8217;s attitude to outsiders as described by the Maternal Grandmother was far from welcoming and Ms H, I know, is now having the boys play with other friends which was not happening before.</span></p>

On the balance of probability, I find the allegation that Mr F tracked Ms H to be proven.  It appears it was the father who set up all the electronic devices and the incident in Victoria was quite sinister and not how a partner in a healthy relationship behaves.  I believe Ms H when she told me that the doorbell video was only accessible by Mr F and that he used it to keep a watch on when she went in and when she went out.  Her behaviour in sticking a finger up at Mr F was, as she said, &#8220;childish&#8221; but does not constitute any form of domestic abuse and signified, I think, the beginning of Ms&#160;H finding defiance very deep in herself and which led to her being able to leave.  I also accept Ms H&#8217;s evidence that she never told Mr F anything about her counselling and, therefore, that he can only have found out about it from scrutinising her movements or accessing her private emails.  </span></p>

No.  I find that Mr F created so much pressure on Ms H about such matters that she felt constricted in how she could behave and what she could do.

I do not find that Ms H belittled the children by name-calling and I find this is an allegation largely manufactured by Mr F as I have already set out.  I am sure that on occasions call one or other of the children &#8220;Piggy&#8221; or told them off for their behaviour, and rightly so as their behaviour sounds dangerous and harmful to themselves and to others.  However, I do not find this was done to belittle them.

She was acutely aware that the property was in Mr F&#8217;s name, and most couples in this position with eight-year-old twins would have moved to a larger property in joint names.  She knew she was in a very difficult position.  I do not think it at all likely that Ms H threatened to leave the home with the children.  When she finally did this, she did it secretly because she was aware that Mr F would have tried to stop her as, indeed, he did by his many court applications and through the Local&#160;Authority.

He still requires them to walk in a certain way more suitable for very young children and does not allow them to have access to many of their toys and books which are boxed up.  She says he was hypervigilant about the children not causing a mess when doing craft activities.   The father completely denies all this and blames the hoarding which he accuses the mother for there being insufficient room for the boys to have their toys and books out.  I prefer the mother&#8217;s account.  It seems to me that order is very important to Mr&#160;F and he seems to be a person with many anxieties.  Ms H describes how he will not drive abroad though he will at home.  I have no doubt that he too has suffered from the very stressful circumstances in this home but his attempts to impose control and order on the home and those within have been very harmful to these children and to Ms H.</span></p>

The boys have reported to the school that their parents and have pushed them and otherwise, their mother has hurt them, for example, by scratching.  Mr F has reported this about the mother but did not report that he was the one who used physical discipline against both boys.  Mr F has described &#8220;tapping&#8221; and &#8220;slapping&#8221; the boys but does not think slapping is hitting which, of course, it is.  The boys have reported the boys pushing them.  Since leaving the home, B has reported some further past behaviour by Mr F which is of concern.  B was upset because shortly before they went to the refuge, he says his mother scratched him deliberately.  I am sure she did not.</span></p>

I am sure that when separating them when they have been fighting, both parents have had to intervene physically and, no doubt, one or both of the boys have got hurt during this.  Ms H has been on courses to help her manage the behaviour and for contact in future, it will be important that Mr&#160;F does the same course.  I do not consider this is a case where I should find physical abuse of the children against either parent.  The boys&#8217; behaviour must be addressed and it appears from Ms H&#8217;s evidence and that of the Local Authority that it is improving.  Neither boy should be at risk of harm from each other.  Their mother should not be at risk of physical harm from either boy.  Neither parent should use physical discipline.  I am sure both parents have shouted at the children but Ms H has now learned different techniques to manage their behaviour going forward.</span></p>

This allegation concerns the ending of the family holiday which the Maternal Grandmother ought to have participated in in July 2020.  It was a most unfortunate situation.  I am sure that Mr F was particularly anxious about the prospect of the flight home being missed by any or all of them.  Alternative travel arrangements both to the airport and then home could have been arranged.  It would have been much better if Mr F could have conceded that he could have behaved better.  He was not able to do so.  Both parents clearly said unpleasant things to the other when back in London and before Ms H got to casualty.  I am not going to make a finding that this was emotional abuse.</span></p>

This was a very poor decision by Mr&#160;F because it causes me even more concern for the future relationship between the boys and their father than it would have done if I had just been asked to make findings and made findings on Ms H&#8217;s allegations.  The fact that Mr F has constructed a whole carapace out of false allegations will be a very significant factor in the welfare aspect of this case because unless Mr F faces up to his conduct and can be assisted to make major changes, there will always be a serious risk that that the boys will once again be embroiled in his false allegations and his false narrative.  The damage to their emotional and psychological health if this behaviour continued or was repeated would, in my judgment, be of the most serious kind.</span></p>

I do not find that Ms H emotionally and verbally abused Mr&#160;F as he describes in 2016 to 2023.  The fact that Mr F describes the holiday to Croatia being, in effect, the last straw does not tie up at all with Ms H&#8217;s evidence of the Maternal Grandmother&#8217;s evidence about that holiday.  I am sure that it was Mr F&#8217;s behaviour which was unacceptable and not Ms H&#8217;s although the journey back to the airport and what then happened in London was bad behaviour on both sides.  I also find that Ms H did not intimidate or control Mr F.  Mr F gives as an example that Ms H told him to stay in one place when they were out at a festival in Ireland.  Having heard about the festival from Ms H, this was sensible advice and so far from being &#8220;controlling behaviour&#8221; as defined in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/17" uk:canonical="2021 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Abuse Act 2021</ref>.

In any event, I am sure Ms H&#8217;s evidence that Mr F knew full well that she was due to go out and that he went to Tesco on purpose is the correct one.  The sticking up of her finger at the doorbell I have dealt with; childish behaviour and not emotionally abusive, not coercive, not controlling and not domestic abuse.</span></p>

This allegation is misconceived.  Ms H was right to limit contact with the father in the light of the abuse I have found and which she, of course, knew most about.  Furthermore, it was the Court which made the decisions on the arrangements for contact.  Allegation four is also misconceived and, as will now be apparent, another allegation which applies to the applicant and not the respondent.  I do not know nor should I know what the legal advice to Mr F has been but I think the lawyers need to learn from this case that it is not appropriate to include such allegations in a domestic abuse case.  </span></p>

This allegation is again an allegation which I have found against the applicant who has tried to turn it against the respondent.  It was the applicant who financially abused the respondent and this allegation is frankly ridiculous in the context of the financial circumstances of this family.  I have accepted the respondent&#8217;s case that she did not work for five years, that she was, therefore, dependent on the applicant for five years but had to use her savings, her redundancy money, the proceeds of the sale of her flat to supplement the family, the household and to buy what she and the children needed when the applicant did not provide sufficiently.  I agree with Ms Stout that Mr F&#8217;s real complaint here is that he had not had sufficient control over the mother&#8217;s finances.</span></p>

I reject Mr F&#8217;s description of family life and I have preferred Ms&#160;H&#8217;s.  This is another example of Mr F distorting what has happened in this family.  In particular, here, I prefer Ms H&#8217;s evidence that Mr F would shut himself up with the boys at bedtime to get them to report to him and to shut Ms Mayer.  She tried to spend some time with them and enjoyed showing them photos at bedtime; not videos but talking about the memories that the photos invoked.  I accept her evidence that she did, on occasion, refer to him making himself indispensable but I do not find she did so in a mocking way more than on maybe one occasion.  The recordings I have listened to really do not prove anything.  I do not accept Mr F&#8217;s account and the sliver of truth in the centre of this allegation really does not amount to domestic abuse.</span></p>

This allegation is not proven and I have been clear that I prefer Ms H&#8217;s evidence.  I am sure both parents, on occasion, shouted and they have called each other names.  However, this is a theme which Mr F has particularly worked on to create a false narrative.  I find no evidence of Ms H belittling him and it is an inversion of what happened in this relationship.  Mr F is not a victim of domestic abuse.</span></p>

Mr F prevented Ms H from tidying her things and the boys&#8217; things.  Both parties became uncomfortable about having people home. I do not find Ms H controlled the condition of the home or who could visit.  Allegation nine: I have dealt with this false allegation earlier.  The point is that Ms H did not make these threats because she did not feel strong enough until June 2023 to leave, and she was too frightened of being prevented from taking the children with her if Mr F threw her out to make such threats.</span></p>

I have dealt with these false allegations earlier when dealing with Ms&#160;H&#8217;s allegations.  I am aware, for example, of B telling the school in the spring of 2023 that Ms H had pushed him off the sofa.  Ms H does not think this happened and I accept this is not something that she would do on purpose.  I have seen a video of how she responded when D was hurting her on the sofa and it was to shrink from him, not to push him off the sofa.  This is an example of B being manipulated by his father to make false reports about his mother at a time when Mr F was very worried in relation to the children as to what would happen if he and Ms H physically separated.</span></p>

Both parents when trying to separate the boys who were fighting occasionally hurt the boys, and that was inevitable.  The boys&#8217; behaviour resulted, in part, because of the emotional abuse and manipulation of the boys by their father but also because they were constantly exposed to shouting and conflict between their parents.  </span></p>

I accept Ms H&#8217;s evidence that she only started this plan about two weeks before she left.  It is not an example of somebody who is in control of everything.  Her actions were justified and in the interests of the children and were made in desperation.  I disagree with the submission made on behalf of Mr F that Ms H could have agreed to a 50/50 arrangement with no need for a fact-finding hearing.  I disagree that there was no need for supervision.  This is not about physical threats.  This case has been about the pernicious impact of coercive and controlling behaviour on a mother and on the children, on the erosion of this mother&#8217;s sense of self until with the assistance of therapy, she was able to form the resolve to remove herself and the children from a very harmful situation.</span></p>
