I&#160;say &#8220;somewhat surprisingly&#8221; because the current law has been in force since 1970 and there have been many cases involving attacks on consent orders made; but my researches and the researches of counsel have not unearthed one where the ground relied on is the lack of capacity of the party in question to enter into a compromise.</span></p>

One reason may be that it was regarded as unnecessary because all financial orders made in financial proceedings require the approval of the court anyway.  However, that does not really answer the question which is this: does a compromise such as the one in the case here, which may have been made, unknown to everybody including the court, by one party who is lacking capacity, have validity?  In my opinion it would be a strange thing if there was a different criterion applying in the civil and family spheres, and I&#160;am quite satisfied that if one party to a compromise lacks capacity, then that will act to invalidate any consent order, even if neither the other party nor the court is aware of it.  I&#160;reach that conclusion relying on the policy reasons advanced by Mr.&#160;Justice Bean in his judgment at para.30 in these terms:</span></p>

I&#160;can only indicate some of the matters to be considered in accessing a client&#8217;s capacity.  The client would need to understand how the proceedings were to be funded.  He would need to know about the chances of not succeeding and about the risk of an adverse order as to costs.  He would need to have capacity to make the sort of decisions that are likely to arise in litigation.  Capacity to conduct such proceedings would include the capacity to give proper instructions for and to approve the particulars of claim, and to approve a compromise.  For a client to have capacity to approve a compromise, he would need insight into the compromise, an ability to instruct his solicitors to advise him on it, and an understanding of their advice and an ability to weigh their advice&#8221;.</span></p>

In my view the case that she had capacity at that time is unarguable.  Following her return from hospital it is true that she gained some kind of an improvement although she remained heavily medicated, but as against that one has to remember that she was making the impulsive and unwise decision to represent herself.  So, I&#160;am of the view that there is an issue of capacity that deserves to be tried.</span></p>

But, either way, I&#160;believe that the case is distinctly arguable, and so I&#160;would grant permission to appeal in relation to that ground as well as into the ground of lack of actual consent or withdrawal of consent.  But, as I&#160;have indicated, I&#160;believe that this is a matter which can properly be tried at first instance.  </span></p>
