Her solicitors have come off the record.  The order debarred her from relying on any written evidence in response to the claim but the day before the hearing she sent a six page hand-written letter which I have read and which can only be seen as an opposition to the claim.  It was accompanied by a short letter from the home manager of the care home where she resides.   </p>

At about that time she experienced a breakdown and began to see a psychotherapist.  C says that between 2000-2010 she would see her parents every two to three weeks when she would go home to help with domestic tasks.  In late 2000 C met a man who became her partner.  They have been in a committed relationship for most, if not all, of the time since then.   </p>

There is no suggestion that in so doing she did not have her father&#8217;s blessing.  The account had in fact been established in or about 1995, but C did not access it until 2007. </p>

It may well be that an additional factor affecting C&#8217;s father&#8217;s thinking was that from 2010 C had broken off contact with her parents.  Whilst she would take her father&#8217;s phone calls, she did not ring her parents nor go to their home.   </p>

She is visited there approximately monthly by her son.  She will spend the rest of her life in residential care and is not capable of living independently.  It is plain from her communication to the court that it is a matter of great sadness to her that she does not see her daughter or grandchildren.  Indeed, as I understand it C has not seen either of her parents in the last decade save at and around the deceased&#8217;s funeral. </p>

First, she says that she needs a home.  She is living in a twobedroom rented flat, the rent of which is currently &#163;590 per month.  It is on an estate which is being emptied by the landlord and C says that she faces persistent low-level harassment from the landlord and his agents.  The accommodation is plainly less than ideal, comprising as it does a small bedroom which the children share by use of bunkbeds and her own bedroom and a living room.  She says that she would like to buy a two-bedroom flat.  In her statement she put the cost of this at &#163;375,000 - 500,000 but curiously only produced property particulars for properties in the bracket &#163;450,000 - 525,000.  When I said that I required particulars in the lower part of the bracket I was provided with a number of property particulars which included two at &#163;380,000, one with two bedrooms and one with three bedrooms, which C readily accepted would meet her needs.   </p>

At the moment her income is limited to child benefit and universal credit in the total sum of just over &#163;1,000 per month.  This calculation by the Benefits Agency assumed that her partner is living with her and able to contribute his wages towards their expenses.  However, he is not living with her for the reasons explained and most of his income goes on his own accommodation and living costs.  I deal with this further at paragraph 66(ii) of this judgment but without a contribution from him, her shortfall is running at &#163;1,338 per month.  As a result, she asks for a 3 year maintenance fund of some &#163;48,000.  If I am against C on her wish for a home, C asks for an enhanced income fund to provide for a more comfortable standard of living.  </p>

In that case the claimant had entered into both a Damages Based Agreement with her first set of solicitors and a Conditional Fee Agreement with her second solicitors and arguably might be liable under both agreements.  The judge disregarded the potential DBA liability and considered the CFA.  In that case there was a success fee representing a 50% uplift on costs which as at 7 June 2019 (i.e. almost a year before trial) stood at approximately &#163;24,000 + VAT with a substantial (but unquantified) increase as a result of the trial.
