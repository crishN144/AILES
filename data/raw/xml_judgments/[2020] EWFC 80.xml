Their relationship developed swiftly in early 2020, and the mother moved to live with the father initially in State B and then they moved to his home in State A; the lifestyle which the couple enjoyed in that period reflected the father&#8217;s remarkable wealth.  The parties discussed marriage; in February 2020, the father formally asked the mother&#8217;s father for the mother&#8217;s hand in marriage.  At about that time, the mother became pregnant. In the weeks which followed, the relationship swiftly deteriorated.  It is unnecessary to record the cross-allegations on which I have made no adjudication, save that it is relevant to record that the mother appeared to spend lavishly on the father&#8217;s credit card, purchasing luxury items.  The mother&#8217;s case is that this was encouraged by him and matched his own opulent spending (&#8220;he almost instructed me in the art of high spending&#8221;); the father disputes this, asserting that the mother was greedy.  He claims that he tried many times in vain to limit her profligacy, and it was her extravagance which irredeemably strained the relationship. </p>

There is some dispute about whether those discussions were conducted under the privilege of &#8216;without prejudice&#8217; protection; the mother says that they were not.  The father maintains that they were, by operation of the law of State B (where the negotiations were being conducted in part).  The simple fact is that the details have been shared with me; they contain proposals that the father make significant financial provision for the mother and Zoe, including a property at $15,000pcm rent, an $120,000 annual tax free allowance, lease arrangement for a Range Rover car, and a nanny ($60,000p.a.).   On 2 September, the father proposed to lodge $200,000 with the mother&#8217;s lawyers as &#8220;an advance of living expenses for [the mother] in contemplation of her returning to [State B] so the parties can continue in good faith with completing the Agreement&#8221;.  The mother&#8217;s lawyer replied: &#8220;if the $200,000 is not put in [the mother&#8217;s] UK counsel&#8217;s account by 4 September 2020 there will be no further discussions&#8221;.

As things stand, it appears that the dispute between the parties is narrowing to whether the surnames of the mother and father should be connected by a hyphen.  </p>

He alludes to the fact that in early autumn 2020 the mother had been, duplicitously (my word not his), negotiating an apparent reconciliation and financial package while instructing Hunters to pursue financial claims in England.  The father disputes the mother&#8217;s wish or need to live in London, asserting that she is being &#8216;impulsive&#8217;, and that she could or should remain close to her family in the North East of England for the time being which is, after all, what she craved as she left the USA; in this regard he points to the content of the 29 July 2020 e-mail (see [6] above).  He proposes that she can rent suitable property close to her father and stepmother in the North East for &#163;2,000-&#163;2,300pcm.   The father argues that the mother&#8217;s plan to relocate to London is also tactical, in order to elevate the value of her claim.  He disputes the need for her to have a full-time nanny for Zoe, when the mother does not work.  The father has highlighted various aspects of the mother&#8217;s claimed living expenses as revealing of the mother&#8217;s excessive ambition in these proceedings.  </p>

However, for as long as any client has incurred significant outstanding legal costs with his or her solicitor, there is no doubt but that they become bound ("beholden" per Mr. Harker, see [9] above) to each other by the debt; this may well impact on the freedom of, and relative strengths within, their professional relationship. Further, the solicitor may feel constrained in taking what may be important steps in relation, for instance, to discovery, or in relation to exploring parallel non-court dispute resolution. The debt may materially influence the client's stance on possible settlement, and the solicitor's advice in relation to the same: a client &#8211; without independent resources &#8211; is in a vulnerable position, and may be more inclined to accept a settlement that is less than fair simply because of the concerns about litigation debt. This would not be in the interests of this, or any, child in <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1 </span>proceedings. A level playing field may not be achieved where, on the one side, the solicitor and client are 'beholden' to each other by significant debt, whereas on the other there is an abundance of litigation funding. Though there is an increasingly familiar and commendable practice of lawyers acting <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> in cases before the family courts, particularly where public funding provision previously available has been withdrawn, legal service providers, including solicitors and barristers, are not charities, nor are they credit-agents. It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect solicitors and the bar to offer unsecured interest-free credit in order to undertake their work; there is indeed a solid reason for lawyers not to have a financial interest in the outcome of family law litigation&#8221;. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.09in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[24] In <span style="font-style:italic">Rubin</span>, Mostyn J was not considering legal costs funding in ongoing proceedings; he was dealing with truly 'historic' costs which had arisen in two separate sets of proceedings (i.e. divorce and child abduction), which had, importantly, <span style="font-style:italic">concluded</span>. The financial proceedings had been stayed (proceedings were now ongoing in California), and the mother and children had returned to California, pursuant to orders made by Hogg J under the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention 1980</span>. There was, as Mostyn J observed, no further litigation in this country, and no litigation in prospect. I consider that Mostyn J was right to reject a legal costs funding application as a vehicle to recoup the costs of either or both of these concluded claims. But that type of application is distinguishable from the type of situation here, where the legal costs funding claim arises in relation to costs reasonably and legitimately incurred within ongoing proceedings prior to the determination of the legal costs funding application.&#8221; </p>

Such an approach could be problematic. I agree with the essence of Mostyn J's approach &#8211; namely that a clear case would need to be shown that the solicitors are reaching the end of their tolerance &#8211; but the approach described in [16] of <span style="font-style:italic">Rubin</span> ought not to be applied too strictly, otherwise it would work materially to the disadvantage of the honourable solicitor who is prepared to soldier on (perhaps somewhat against their better commercial judgment) for the good of the client or the case.&#8221; </p>

In this particular regard, I consider that the mother&#8217;s claim is similar (albeit not identical) to the &#8216;historic&#8217; costs claim in <span style="font-style:italic">Rubin</span>, and I do not find that, without the payment to these firms, the mother will not reasonably be able to obtain appropriate legal services for the proceedings going forward.   While Mr Roberts was right to argue that the mother should not be saddled with large debts at this point, he rightly and fairly conceded that if the costs incurred by firms other than Hunters are not met at this stage, the mother&#8217;s current and future representation will not be in jeopardy.  As it happens, I should add that I do find it hard to understand the mother&#8217;s case that her <span style="font-style:italic">English</span> lawyers ran up costs in excess of &#163;34,000 for working on the US agreement, which was more than <span style="font-style:italic">double</span> the figure of $18,683 being charged to the mother by lawyers in State B. The burden was surely on the US lawyers, not the English solicitors given that it related to the negotiation of an agreement that would have been performed entirely in State B?    </p>

However, it is not the mother&#8217;s wish to remain in the North East, and I take the view that her desire to return to live in London at this stage is reasonable, and not (as he argued) impulsive.  Until returning to her father in July 2020, the mother had not lived in the North East for over ten years; she had chosen to live in the capital in the past in her adult life, she has friends and some family there. Her mother is said to be &#8220;in the process of moving to London&#8221;.   Interestingly, in her 29 July e-mail to the father </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">(referenced above) the mother spoke of the parties renting a home together &#8220;in London&#8221; before returning to the USA.  A strong theme of her rationale for being in London, contained in her evidence and urged on me by Mr Roberts, is that the mother believes that it will be easier for the father to visit London to spend regular time with Zoe, than it would be for him to travel to, and stay in, the North East for this purpose.     </p>

I am unpersuaded that the mother should have the facility to rent a property at c.&#163;9,500 per calendar month for herself and Zoe.  The mother&#8217;s proposals </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">are in my judgment significantly in excess of what she and Zoe reasonably need.  The parties have not presented rental comparables for properties less exclusive than Regents Park /  St Johns Wood and its ilk.  Accordingly, I have worked for present purposes on the premise that the mother would need no less than <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">&#163;4,750pcm</span> to rent a reasonable apartment in a desirable part of London for herself, Zoe and the nanny (with possibly one spare room).  If the mother is able to make small but significant economies from the overall budget which she has presented (and which, in most respects, I have accepted) she should be able to afford a little more by way of rental allowance, enhancing her rental options.  </p>

She nonetheless claims the cost of a full-time nanny, currently at &#163;1,400 per week (reducing to &#163;1,000 in February 2021).  On balance, I am inclined to accept this expense; I do so in part because I note that the father himself had considered that the expense of a night nurse was justifiable when the plan was for the mother and Zoe to live in the USA, and had paid the deposit to secure such a service; he had also offered her a nanny.  The father appears to accept that he has quite a significant corps of staff tending to him.   Overall, I consider that the mother is entitled to benefit from support in London in her care of Zoe at this stage at the rate claimed.  </p>

She has selected a Range Rover sport as her chosen vehicle, as &#8220;this is the make and type of car I drove in [the USA], and it is the make and type of car we discussed in the [American] negotiations&#8221;; it has an on-the-road sale price tag of c.&#163;70-75,000.    The father proposes that the mother will not need a car at all and can rely on taxis.   I reject both their cases.  I am of the view that the mother will need a good quality car, but living in London and for the purposes identified, she will not need such a large or powerful car for Zoe as a high performance Range Rover sport; her leasehold car costs can properly and reasonably be met within a somewhat smaller allowance. </p>
