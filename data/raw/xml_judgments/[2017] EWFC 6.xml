TJ was relinquished at birth by his mother (&#8220;the mother&#8221;).  TJ has lived with prospective adopters (Mr. and Mrs. X) since late-November 2015. They have now issued an application to adopt TJ.  The case has been referred to me to consider an important issue: namely, whether the Court should authorise the Local Authority <span style="font-style:italic">qua</span> Adoption Agency not to notify TJ&#8217;s wider family of his existence.   </p>

By this process the Local Authority can request the court to make a "decision on a question which is unlikely to involve a substantial dispute of fact' (<span style="font-style:italic">rule 19.1(2)(b)</span>). It is I suggest the mechanism which is contemplated by <span style="font-style:italic">rule 14.21 FPR 2010</span> for the invoking of the inherent jurisdiction where no proceedings have started and an adoption agency or local authority requires "directions on the need to give a father without parental responsibility notice of the intention to place a child for adoption". In this situation, <span style="font-style:italic">Part 19</span> provides an obvious mechanism. The Local Authority here suggests that clarification of whether there should be notification to consular officials, and/or notification to or assessment of extended natural family is directly analogous with the issue of the possible non-notification of a father without parental responsibility. <span style="font-style:italic">Part 19</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">FPR 2010</span> derives from <span style="font-style:italic">Part 10</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">Family Procedure (Adoption) Rules 2005</span>; the procedure under <span style="font-style:italic">Part 19</span> helpfully permits an application to be made without naming a respondent (<span style="font-style:italic">rule 19.4 FPR 2010 </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">FPR PD19A</span>, para 2.2).&#8221;</p>

I am not in a position to assess whether this is true or not, but note that this explains at least in part her strong wish that he does not know of TJ&#8217;s existence.</p>

The mother informed no-one of her pregnancy; she has a difficult relationship with her own mother, who was not considered to care for PL; she asserts that her grandparents would not be well-placed to care for TJ by reason of their age. Following TJ&#8217;s birth at hospital, the mother did not want to hold him, or even know his gender (though this became apparent to her as the staff referred to the baby as &#8216;him&#8217;).  She did not wish to see him following the birth, and left the hospital within seven hours of the birth, declining midwifery services; she indicated to nursing staff that she did not wish to care for TJ.  TJ was discharged from hospital to short-term foster carers, where he remained for three weeks before being placed with Mr. and Mrs. X.</p>

She then &#8216;went to ground&#8217; and could not be contacted.  The Adoption Agency issued placement order proceedings, and within that context, the mother resurfaced and made contact with the court-appointed Children&#8217;s Guardian.  The mother met the Guardian and gave her formal written consent to TJ&#8217;s placement for adoption, and gave her consent to adoption in the prescribed forms.  These were signed on 22 April 2016.  The mother again confirmed that she did not want to have any contact with TJ, and did not want to be advised of any future court hearings.  She made clear that none of her family were aware of the pregnancy or of the birth of TJ, and she did not want that position to change. The Adoption Agency withdrew the placement order proceedings.</p>

In those proceedings, the Annex A report had made explicit reference to the existence of TJ, but the Justices gave a direction that &#8211; given the mother&#8217;s wish for confidentiality surrounding TJ &#8211; the Annex A report should not be disclosed to the parties.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cases which come before the Family Courts involving relinquished babies will arise from widely varied sets of circumstances, and each must be determined on its own facts &#8211; a point which I made in <span style="font-style:italic">Re RA</span> at [31].  In this case, there appears to be no obvious birth family carer for TJ other than his own mother, who rejects such a role.  In that sense, this case is different from <span style="font-style:italic">Re RA</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re JL</span>.  I am satisfied that the Adoption Agency should respect the clear wishes of the mother not to notify her mother or grandparents of TJ&#8217;s existence; neither were actively considered as carers for PL, and the difficult relationship between the mother and her mother would not augur well for a secure family placement.  The issue which arises here, therefore, is whether steps should be taken to inform PL&#8217;s father of TJ&#8217;s existence in order to create the potential of a relationship between the half-brothers by birth.  Realistically, this would be limited to a relationship of <span style="font-style:italic">in</span>direct contact only <span style="font-style:italic">at best</span> if TJ were to stay living with Mr. and Mrs. X.  Any greater degree of sibling relationship would be likely to disrupt, and probably bring to an end, the current placement of TJ. </p>
