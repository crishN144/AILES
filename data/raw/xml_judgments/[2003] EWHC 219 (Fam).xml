It is a trade because, however it is dressed up, it involves the buying and selling of babies by intermediaries who pocket most of the large sums of money which change hands during the course of the transaction. It is evil and exploitative because it battens on would-be adopters who, unable to adopt through more conventional channels, are induced in their desperation to part with large sums of money to intermediaries whose motives are purely mercenary; because it battens on the emotional turmoil of disadvantaged and desperately vulnerable birth mothers who are induced to part with their babies within days of birth, who see little of the large sums of money paid to the intermediaries by the adopters and who too often, as in the present case, soon come to regret their hasty and ill-considered decision; and because it can cause untold harm to children, untold misery to their birth mothers and untold heartache to adopters.</span></p>

It is from a supposedly independent social worker. It will be observed from the report that the lady concerned does not purport, in the document at least, to have any professional qualifications for the enormously important task conferred upon her, reporting as she was about a family resident in England for the benefit of an adoption agency in Texas. Again, simply to illustrate the gross inadequacy of the report, the author of the report clearly made no inquiries of the local authority in whose area the family lived in England. Again, it may be a matter of concern that neither the author of the report nor anyone involved with the Blessed Trinity Adoptions Inc seemed to have paid any regard to the arrangements that have been put in place by the UK Government for inter-country adoptions. One would suppose that agencies such as Blessed Trinity Adoptions Inc and the supposed independent social worker would have been familiar with the existence in all countries of guidance such as we have here in the UK, published by our Department of Health, to assist in this important work being carried out in a way that safeguards and promotes the welfare of children. Some of these matters constitute offences contrary to the criminal law of the UK, those offences being committed by Mr S and by the author of the report.&#8221;</span></p>

Not only do the arrangements identify sources of advice, but they make provision for the preparation of objective, independent home study reports by qualified and experienced adoption social workers. They also provide arrangements for Home Office immigration entry clearance and other matters, and they provide for the issue of a Department of Health certificate that the Department of Health considers the material to be in order and supports the application The purpose of the procedure is to ensure that all is in order at the UK end for an adoption in an overseas jurisdiction by applicants from the UK. </span></p>

There is no reference to any qualification, experience or other credentials as a social worker, as a counsellor, or as a proper person to report to the court on such an important matter. Anybody can describe themselves as C did. The report itself is full of platitudes. It makes no reference to any inquiry of the relevant Social Services Department, which, if authorised by Mr and Mrs K, and made, would have revealed at least concerns about the parenting of Mrs K&#8217;s daughter KA in 1996 and of the two boys in 1999. It is in many respects superficial and shallow. It scarcely addresses the suitability of Mr and Mrs K to parent a black child. It says nothing about their suitability to manage twins. The report is, in my judgment, useless for any purpose other than supporting an application - any application - by Mr and Mrs K to adopt any child in whatever overseas country they chose. It is, on the other hand, dangerous, in that it misleads both by the tone of what it says and by what it does not address at all, and in that an overseas court could not have the data to perceive such shortcomings. </span></p>

They may also wish to look for a Department of Health certificate. UK adoption policy and law expect the assessment of UK applicants for adoption overseas to be made with the same care and thoroughness as for adoption in the UK. A two-tier system, applying lower standards in respect of adoption of a child from overseas, is wholly unacceptable. But experience shows that that is what happens, not always but all too often, with privately commissioned home study reports. </span></p>

That is surely because, whatever sympathy there may be for those needy for themselves to adopt, the welfare of children must at all times be the overriding consideration.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="p25" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Authority X has helpfully explained the circumstances in which it came to adopt that stance. M arrived in the country without warning. Once it knew of her arrival, Authority X took steps to ascertain the basis upon which she had been brought into the country. It was careful to clarify the nature and extent of the order that had been made in Texas. Investigations disclosed that although the order was temporary, it was valid in Texas and recognised as valid within England and Wales. Nonetheless, Authority X remained deeply concerned about the process by which C and D had &#8220;acquired&#8221; M. It therefore took advice both from BAAF and from the relevant central government authority. The advice received was that it should treat M as a child who was being privately fostered and should act in accordance with its duties under the 1991 Regulations. That it therefore did. However, and very properly, Authority X considered that it needed to take further action. It was aware of C and D and of their history as summarised in paragraph [26] above. It was understandably concerned that neither the court in Texas nor the author of the &#8216;home study report&#8217; had contacted it and asked for any information about C and D, let alone their suitability to adopt a child. Authority X became aware of previous criticisms made of the &#8220;work&#8221; in this field of Jay Carter and her husband. Indeed, Authority X eventually became involved in the police investigation into the involvement of the Carters in private international adoptions. It therefore determined that the court in Texas and Blessed Trinity Adoption Inc should be notified of the previous history of C and D as known to the local authority. </span></p>

International Social Services made enquiries to ascertain if it was possible to intervene in the adoption process in Texas. The information relayed to Authority X was that it was not possible. However the authority&#8217;s legal adviser did write, and more than once, both to the court in Texas and to Blessed Trinity Adoption Inc. In particular, by letters dated 23 May 2000, the court and the agency were clearly informed that as from 31 January 2000 home study reports could only be provided by or on behalf of an adoption agency and that Authority X would be willing to undertake that function in this case. </span></p>

It was, however, in certain respects &#8211; at least judged with the benefit of hindsight &#8211; an unfortunate document. Seventeen of its twenty-six numbered paragraphs were, appropriately and helpfully, taken up with the history which I have summarised in paragraph [26] above. But that history was set out without comment and without any attempt either to evaluate it or to explain its possible significance in the context of M&#8217;s proposed adoption. Four paragraphs of the report summarised Authority X&#8217;s involvement with the case since M&#8217;s arrival in this country. Four paragraphs described the author&#8217;s four visits to see C, D and M at their home. These painted a reassuring, if somewhat superficial, picture of things (&#8220;[M] has appeared to be thriving ... she appears to be quite a contented baby ... Conditions in the home are good&#8221;). The author reported, without comment, what she had been told by C and D about C&#8217;s health, about the state of their marriage, about the stability of M&#8217;s placement with them and about their plans for supporting M in relation to issues of identity.</span></p>

It made no attempt to analyse, explain or evaluate any of the &#8220;information&#8217; it provided. It contained no expression of professional opinion, indeed no comment at all, on any of the many points that surely cried out for cool and (in both senses of the word) critical comment. It failed to explain for the benefit of a judge who sitting in another jurisdiction, could not be expected to appreciate these things, the significance of the fact that Jay Carter had made no enquiries of either local authority and of the fact (not drawn to the judge&#8217;s attention) that the preparation of the homestudy report referred to involved the commission by its author of criminal offences under English law. It did nothing to discourage the judge from making an adoption order. On the contrary, the report would, if anything, have led Judge Kern to think that Authority X was assuming that such an order would probably, and appropriately, be made.</span></p>

It recognises that it ought to have made explicit the fact that Jay Carter was committing a criminal offence by providing any &#8216;home study report&#8217; whether before or after 31 January 2000. It recognises in particular that the report should have gone further and made explicit its view that, on the basis of the facts as set out, C and D were not suitable to adopt any child.</span></p>

Therefore at that time it felt, rightly or wrongly, that it needed the consent of C and D before it could disclose the information it had access to and which was directly relevant to the suitability of C and D to adopt. The concern was that if the report was too stringent in its terms, their consent would not be forthcoming and that the court in Texas would thus be deprived of the factual background which Authority X hoped would speak for itself to fulfil its duties under the 1991 Regulations.</span></p>

Whilst she may have been the signatory of the report she was, in the circumstances as I have described them above, necessarily acting in accordance with the advice of her employers. That, I do not doubt, significantly constrained her from expressing herself in the way in which she would otherwise have wished to. She is not, in my judgment, to be criticised.</span></p>

They surrendered her for adoption by particular people &#8211; C and D &#8211; in circumstances where that adoption has disastrously broken down. Moreover, the circumstances in which A was induced to consent to and then go through with the adoption are such as to rouse even the judicial heart to indignation. It would seem that A was transported from Chicago to Houston if not actually in labour then on the very point of going into labour and, moreover at a time when her partner the birth father B was in prison. It is a fact that her formal consent to the adoption was obtained only three days after she had given birth and that a mere four days later the order was made permitting M&#8217;s removal from the United States of America. It would seem that A almost immediately repented of what she had done but that her protests were overcome by coercion and blackmail. Those are ugly words but if the birth mother&#8217;s account to the guardian of what happened to her at the airport on her return to Chicago is true &#8211; and I have no reason to think that it is not &#8211; then coercion and blackmail is, indeed, what she was subjected to. My heart goes out to this mother and to her partner. They have been exploited and abused by people who run businesses to make money out of trading in human beings and human misery.</span></p>

We felt if [M] were to be placed with her birth parents the transition would be a difficult one and in the short term [M] would inevitably suffer significant harm as indeed do many children when we move them from their short term foster home where they are well settled and happy. One thing we wanted to assess was how [A] and [B] would be able to help [M] to cope with the loss and grief she would inevitably feel at the same time she has to adjust to a very different environment.</span></p>

Any attempt to discuss this met with such comments as &#8216;she&#8217;d just have to fit in&#8217;, &#8216;all she needs is love and there&#8217;s plenty of that to go around&#8217;. Given that we had not witnessed any emotional warmth from [A] to [their older children] in the time we had spent with the family (between 10-12 hours), we had serious doubts about the emotional nurturing [M] would receive if she was placed with them and certainly because of lack of insight and empathy for [M&#8217;s] needs, we have no confidence that [A] and [B] would be able to help overcome the trauma of a move.</span></p>

It is our view from our observations that [M] should not be returned to her birth parents. We have come to this conclusion because we believe that [M] would be at risk of significant emotional and possible physical harm for the following reasons:</span></p>

But that, let me make it clear, is not for want of trying on the part of Authority Z, the guardian and indeed the court itself. Both the guardian in July 2002 and then the two social workers in August 2002 travelled to America at public expense to interview the birth parents and ascertain their wishes and feelings. Every effort has been made by the appropriate authorities not merely in this country but also in the United States of America to notify the birth parents of the outcome of their assessment by Authority Z. I am inclined to the view that in fact one or other of the letters forwarded by Ms Lee to the birth parents in November 2002 must have got through &#8211; did get through &#8211; to its intended recipient. But even if that is not so then I am afraid that the birth parents have only themselves to blame. Neither of them has communicated either with the relevant authorities in the United States of America or with Authority Z, the guardian or the court. Nobody has heard anything from them since K and L left Milwaukee on 28 August 2002. The birth parents have not made, either to Authority Z or to the court, any further request for assessment or for the return of M to &#8216;their care. Indeed, the birth parents, from beginning to end, have never once communicated with the court, whether formally or informally. They moved without leaving a forwarding address and appear to have made no effort to communicate their new address(es) either to the guardian or to Authority Z &#8211; and this notwithstanding that during their visit to Milwaukee in August 2002 the social workers reiterated on several occasions that should the birth parents move it was imperative that they inform Authority Z (whose address they had) of their new address.</span></p>

Moreover, it follows that Jay Carter does not even seek to challenge the assessment of her work and of her competence &#8211; or lack of it &#8211; which is set out in paragraphs [48]-[52] above. I see absolutely no reason to modify any of the views I expressed in my draft judgment, the relevant parts of which appear unchanged in the final version.</span></p>

Both submitted that no useful purpose would be served by the publication or further publication of their names. Jay Carter submitted that there was no need for the matter to be reported to the authorities. Their reasons, which were essentially the same, were in summary that:</span></p>

There is, in my judgment, a plain public interest in someone who has consistently conducted herself in the way in which Jay Carter has behaved being publicly identified so that anyone who may in future come across her in some &#8220;professional&#8221; capacity should have available to them the facts as set out in this judgment. If the consequence is that she finds herself subjected to media scrutiny then that may be her misfortune; but it cannot in my view be any reason for protecting her identity if there are, as in my judgment there are, compelling reasons why the facts should be known. Nor am I persuaded that there is no purpose in my sending the papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General. I am in no position to come to any conclusion as to what activities Jay Carter may currently be involved in and the relevant public authorities should, as it seems to me, have the opportunity of carrying out their own investigations into her activities.</span></p>
