The judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved.   All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with.   Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</p>

In this way, the family may be re-united here, permanently, for the first time.  Thereafter, the Applicants hope that the Home Secretary will exercise her discretion to grant the children British Citizenship.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is apparent from the evidence filed that D and E had an unsatisfactory start to life in their care of their birth parents; their emotional and physical needs were not met, they were neglected, were often hungry, undernourished and were under-stimulated. On one occasion E was hospitalized due to malnutrition and pneumonia.  These deficits in parenting were possibly attributable (at least in part) to the fact that the children&#8217;s mother was said to suffer depression, and the parental relationship was occasionally abusive.  None of the pregnancies were planned; the birth parents have now separated.  By the time of F&#8217;s birth, Mr. S (who was at that stage in prison) and Ms. T recognised that they were failing as parents, and the wider paternal family took steps to arrange for Mr. and Mrs. G to take care of F from birth.  Mrs. G, then resident with her husband in Manila, flew to Brazil to be present at F&#8217;s birth. F was placed immediately in the Applicants&#8217; care, where he has been for all of his life.  Mrs. G remained living in Brazil with F until the domestic adoption process was completed</p>

They first came here in late 2010 for an extended stay, but Mrs G and the children could only remain (on visitors&#8217; visas) for six months.  In the summer of 2011, they all returned to Brazil.  In early 2012, the family returned and enjoyed another six months in England, again returning to Brazil during the summer (without Mr. G this time, who by then was working full-time here) when their visas expired.  In late 2012, Mrs. G and the three children came back to England to repeat the pattern; once here, they applied for discretionary leave to remain.  This application was refused, and the Home Office ordered the removal of Mrs. G and the children from the UK in March 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having returned to Brazil in June 2012 after a six-month stay in England, Mr. and Mrs. G commenced proceedings for the adoption of D and E in October of that year (see &#167;11 above).  Given the uncertainty surrounding Mr. G&#8217;s postings, they were advised to apply for domestic adoption orders within this application.  Mr. and Mrs. G were thoroughly assessed once again and approved as prospective adopters by the relevant social services department in Brazil; as before, the assessment processes conformed to the <span style="font-style:italic">1993 Hague Adoption Convention</span> and UK adoption practice.  Their care of the children, their health, financial circumstances and characters were all examined and evaluated.  A home study report was prepared for the Court and completed in June 2013. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In October 2013, a court hearing was convened and the birth parents attended.  The judge ascertained that the birth parents gave full and informed consent to the adoption, and, having read the reports and other material, declared that adoption was in the children&#8217;s best interests. The judge noted that the social work evidence recorded that the applicants have given the children &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">all their love and affection, as if they were their own biological children, and offer them a beneficial family environment &#8230;a solid family base</span>&#8221;.    The Brazilian adoption order was made on 17 October 2013.  Like an English adoption order, this order permanently extinguished the parental rights and responsibilities of the birth parents and in the following month, the children&#8217;s original birth certificates were cancelled and reissued to show D and E as the children of the Applicants.  The final versions of the re-issued birth certificates for D and E were finally produced in April 2014.</p>

However, just over two months later (3 January 2014) Brazil was added to the revised list of countries whose &#8216;overseas&#8217; adoptions would be recognised in English law: see <span style="font-style:italic">The Adoption (Recognition of Overseas Adoptions) Order 2013, </span>which revoked and replaced the <span style="font-style:italic">Adoption (Designation of Overseas Adoptions) Order 1973</span> and revoked the <span style="font-style:italic">Adoption (Designation of Overseas Adoptions) (Variation) Order 1993.</span> Therefore if the adoption order in relation to D and E had been made some ten weeks later, the children would have been entitled to automatic recognition in England and Wales.</p>
