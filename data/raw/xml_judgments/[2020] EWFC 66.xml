	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In her closing submissions, Ms Thind reminded me of what the mother had said in one of her first statements in these proceedings. It was in the context of referring to her second child B, who in 2017 was made the subject of care and placement orders and was subsequently adopted. She said she had learned from the mistakes that she had made with B and that she had changed and grown up a lot. Most regrettably, this was not the case. The issues and risks of harm which led to the removal of B from her care have been replicated in relation to her care of C. </p>

The reports on his contact were wholly positive and described a warm, happy, and loving relationship between father and daughter. He has been entirely realistic about his inability to provide a home for C. The father supported C being cared for by the mother. He opposed C being placed for adoption because he wanted to continue to play an active role in her life. </p>

It would have the advantage of C maintaining her relationships with her mother and her father. It would, however, have very considerable disadvantages for C. There would be the ever-present risk of placement breakdown or of having to move to a new foster home. She would be the subject of regular social worker visits and Looked After Children reviews and she would not achieve the sense of security, stability or of belonging that would be gained from being placed with a parent or in a permanent adoptive home.  </p>

It is a proportionate and necessary order for the Court to make. This is a case where in the welfare best interests of C, nothing else will do. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I very much regret being compelled to come to this conclusion. The mother has very many positive qualities. She is undoubtedly an enduring victim of the abuse she suffered in her childhood. There comes a time, however, when the welfare best interests of C, which is the Court&#8217;s paramount consideration, must come to the fore and be given precedence. The time may come when the mother has gained the psychological resilience and has matured to the degree that she is able take control of her needs and her emotions and to give priority to the needs of her child. The timescale for the mother to achieve this are, in my judgment, considerably outside the timescales for C to live in a stable, secure and loving permanent home. At the age of 22 months and with the large number of placements she has had in her life, that time for the latter is now.  </p>

I had sincerely hoped over the course of these proceedings that arrangements could be made which would enable C to remain living with her mother in a safe and secure environment. For the reasons given above, it has very sadly not proved possible to achieve. C is of an age when she needs and requires a decision about her future permanent placement to be made now. It would be wholly contrary to her welfare best interests, now and throughout the whole of her life, to delay making this decision whilst yet further attempts are made to rehabilitate to the care of her mother. I regret to find that any such steps at the present time, or for the foreseeable, would be futile and bound to fail. </p>
