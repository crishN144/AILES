	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these proceedings for summary return under the Hague Convention and Brussels IIR, two issues arise. First, did the father consent to or acquiesce in the child&#8217;s removal from his home state? Second, would a return expose the child to grave risk of psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable position?</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background as relevant to those questions is this. The parents are both nationals of their home state. Their relationship began more than 10 years ago. They are married. There are two children of the family &#8211; K, the mother&#8217;s child from a previous relationship, whom the father adopted (she is 15 and a party to though not a subject of these proceedings); and A who is 8 the parents&#8217; natural child.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the summer of 2014, the relationship between the parents came to an end. By July, according to the father&#8217;s evidence, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the marriage was over</span>.&#8221; In September, they separated thereafter occupying different homes. K and A lived with the mother. As K described when she gave evidence, before she came to this country her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">parents had been fighting all the time</span>&#8221; which had caused everyone to be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">stressed</span>.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In February this year, the mother consulted lawyers in her home State. On 18 February, by which time she and the children were already in England, those lawyers issued proceedings for divorce and to limit the father&#8217;s parental responsibility. The applications are currently stayed pursuant to an order of 19 July as is usual where an application under the Convention is pending.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In March, according to the father&#8217;s evidence, he was in the process of preparing his application under the Hague Convention. His application to the Central Authority in his home country was made on 17 April. At the end of May, the International Child Abduction and Contact Unit here instructed Solicitors. The application was launched on 5 June 2015.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings began in the normal way. A Tipstaff order was made and executed. The mother was personally served a few days later. The first <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> directions&#8217; hearing on 15 June was not as effective as it might have been because, by then, the mother had not indicated her precise reaction to the application. </p>

It identified that she opposed the summary return application, relying on Article 13A; and had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">given instructions that the father was fully aware that she was relocating to England and that he also had intentions to relocate in June&#8230;</span>&#8221; [I pause to observe that those facts do not disclose a &#8216;defence&#8217; founded either on consent or acquiescence]. In addition, the mother relied upon Article 13B identifying that K was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">categorically opposed to a return</span>&#8221; and that a return for A &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">would involve separation of the siblings</span>.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 21 September the final hearing was adjourned because the mother&#8217;s public funding had been withdrawn just three days earlier on 18 September. The mother&#8217;s Solicitors were afforded an opportunity to take such steps as they could to secure public funding. The case was re-listed over two days on 5 and 6 November.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I mention the litigation history because as is well known, there is an imperative to handle cases of this kind at speed. Paragraph 2.13 of Practice Direction 12F contains the guidance in relation to the time table: &#8220;Proceedings to which the Council Regulation apply must be completed in 6 weeks &#8216;except where exceptional circumstances make this impossible&#8217;&#8221; &#8211; a reference to the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision in In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Vigreux v.

The Practice Direction also identifies a number of procedural steps including a requirement for the court file to be marked to state the &#8220;hear-by date,&#8221; so as to instill urgency and ensure that applications under the Convention and Regulation are dealt with swiftly.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For reasons that I have not inquired into, beyond perusing the terms of the various orders made at each stage, these proceedings never progressed at the speed ordinarily expected. The result is that A has been living in this country for far longer that would ordinarily be the case at the end of proceedings under the Hague Convention. Had the case proceeded at the usual pace, a decision should have been arrived at by the end of July or, making allowances for the impact of the long vacation, by the end of August at the latest.</p>

At the end of the first day, after I had heard the mother&#8217;s evidence and mid way through the father&#8217;s testimony, at the Bar&#8217;s invitation, I indicated that for my part it would not be necessary for K to come to court. By then I knew how the mother put her case, how the father responded; and I had been able to formulate an analysis of the relevance of K&#8217;s evidence to the issues of consent and acquiescence. I also knew from the report of Mr John Power what was said about A&#8217;s views as well as Mr Power&#8217;s significant analysis of the likely impact upon A of a return either with or without his mother and sister. </p>

The father accepts he had been keen on the relocation idea because he wanted a new start for the family and was hoping that in a new city or country he and the mother would have been able to reconcile. He also accepts that he and the mother had gone into detail and had considered exactly how the planned move would work. However, according to the father, they had never made any firm plans about where they would live, when or how they would leave. Moreover, he denies that he had ever given the mother the impression that he would be agreeable to her relocating with the children to England on her own, without him.</p>

He said, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">As you remember, Mum had an agreement with me that we are going to the UK together and that we will live there together. We first wanted to go there after the winter half term, but then we changed our mind and decided we will go there after the end of the school year &#8230; Knowing that we&#8217;re going together, that your Mum has promised it to me.

All of my dreams and hopes were dashed in this very moment. &#8230; I was blaming you because you have wanted to go to the UK so much and that I was left alone here, thousands of miles away&#8230;. Now when I talk to your Mum, she is telling me that I knew you would go to the UK &#8230; but there was never any talk about June, only that we should go in June. I understand that you must be happy, that your dream about living in England has come true, but it has never been my dream, nor A&#8217;s. When I say to Mum something about the fact that she has cheated me and that she is lying, she either laughs at me or switches her phone off, sometimes for a few days. I don&#8217;t expect you to take my side, or to take your mother&#8217;s side, but there is I think something like honour and the given word which should be kept? </span>&#8230; &#8221; </p>

In the period prior to the mother&#8217;s departure with the children in February, there were discussions, as the father accepts, about relocating as a family. The planning exercise would seem to have been driven, at least in part, by K&#8217;s strong desire to relocate to England. As she said in evidence, she wanted &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">400% to go</span>&#8221; to England. But as the father&#8217;s retrospective messages in the third week of February reveal, there was no concluded agreement about the country, the timing and &#8211; most significantly of all &#8211; which members of the family would be going. Plans batted back and forth do not equate with a concluded agreement to relocate. They do not amount to evidence of clear and unequivocal consent.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When account is taken of the mother&#8217;s consultation with lawyers it becomes obvious that any parental discussions as to a joint venture were proceeding on an altogether false basis. By early February &#8211; unbeknown to the father &#8211; the mother had given instructions which led to the issue (on about 18 February) of court proceedings for divorce, child maintenance and to remove the father&#8217;s parental responsibility. When discussions were taking place, self evidently, each parent had an investment in achieving an entirely different outcome. The mother was intent, as I find, on a new life in England, without the father, so as to secure educational advantages for K, in particular. The father wanted above everything else to reunite the family, to rescue the marriage and would have travelled more or less to any country in the world so as to achieve those objectives.</p>

In all likelihood there would have been responses from the mother referring to their agreement, remonstrating with the father for going back on his word, asking him why he was making trouble. As it was &#8211; from the mother&#8217;s side &#8211; there was an almost complete wall of silence. It is striking that the vast majority of the written material is in one direction. When the mother does involve herself she is very brief. She never replies substantively to his messages. On one occasion she said that she had to feed the children and would talk later. At no stage, does the mother suggest that the father had been agreeable to the children leaving their home State.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The circumstances of the mother&#8217;s departure are another powerful countervailing factor against the existence of consent. The mother surely knew that the father would never have agreed to her travelling abroad with the children on the basis that he was left behind in their home state which is why she left in such a clandestine or secret fashion. Her written statement does not reveal any of the considerable deception surrounding departure. The mother simply says her friend had bought tickets for herself and the children to travel on about 10 February. </p>

However, she found it &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">hard to say really</span>&#8221; whether the father had believed she and the children were there on 15 February; and the mother denied her actions had been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">part of a deception</span>.&#8221; She said that instead of going to (the friend&#8217;s) place they had gone to the home of another friend and her daughter in England.

If there had been any truth in the suggestion that he was in agreement to the plan to leave for England, there would have been no need for any lies about where the children would be at around the time of departure. The mother&#8217;s purported reason for not telling the father, namely that he may have scared the children because of his own fear of flying, is more than &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">odd</span>,&#8221; it is absurd.

The most that could be said is that, as he continued to seek to achieve reconciliation with the mother and reunification of the family, the father did try to negotiate with the mother. What he never did, at any stage, was to indicate that he would go along with or acquiesce in the situation created by the mother. </p>

He understood this. He believes his mother may not return because life in the UK is better for her and his sister and knowing this he still avoids expressing a preference thus not offending either of his parents who, to their credit, do not appear to have sought to influence his feelings.

Knowing that it is her mother&#8217;s intention to go back together with A if an order is made, K said she thought she would stay here with her aunty who would take care of her. She explained her reasons &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">because it would really affect my education.

She showed no distress or anxiety about the effect upon either herself or A of her decision to remain in England. All the signs are, to use a modern idiom, that she is &#8220;cool&#8221; about the idea of staying here which may explain why A, in his discussions with Mr Power, was similarly accepting of the fact that he may go back even without his mother.</p>
