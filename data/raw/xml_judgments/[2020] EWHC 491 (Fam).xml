	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">I will begin by summarising the factual background to this application.  The father is forty-eight years old; the mother is forty-five.  They were married in 2002 and E was born in October 2009.  Neither parent has any other children.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">At the time of their marriage, both parents were living in the north of England, where they own a house.  The father was an engineer; the mother had run a number of restaurants.  By 2014, the father was suffering from depression and had left his job and the family was in debt.  There is a dispute, which I am not in a position to resolve, and do not need to resolve for the purposes of today, as to whether those debts arose from the failure of the mother&#8217;s businesses or whether they had been generated by the father, with the consequence that the mother had to discharge them by selling her businesses.  In any event, in 2014, the parents decided to move to Lanzarote. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Again, there is a dispute on the evidence as to their reasons for the move.  The father describes the momentum for the move as having come from the mother, who he describes as having wanted to buy a caf&#233; in the sun.  The mother, on the other hand, places the impetus for the move on the father, who began suggesting that a move to Lanzarote would &#8220;get him well again&#8221;, and because he kept telling her that it was what he needed.  I have seen a text message from the mother which describes her subsequent decision to leave Lanzarote as the toughest decision of her life because it was her dream too.  It does seem to me that the decision to move to Lanzarote was very much a mutual one. </p>

There is a dispute as to the extent to which the father worked or contributed to the family finances, although, as I explain below, in light of the manner in which this case has developed today, and in particular the evidence I have heard from Ms Magson, the CAFCASS officer, I do not now need to deal with some of the allegations that are made in the parties&#8217; evidence to the extent which I might otherwise have had to do so.  </p>

The mother sustained what she describes as a breakdown in or about 2017, as a result of which she was prescribed diazepam by her doctor.  There then followed a period by the mother of her taking strong addictive medication and combining this with heavy drinking of alcohol.  This led, unfortunately, in 2018, to a conviction in Spain for drink driving and a resulting driving ban for eight months.  It appears that this was a wake-up call to the mother as, subsequently, and to her great credit, she has weaned herself off both those prescription drugs and alcohol. </p>

I do not consider those to be particularly relevant now to the issues I need to resolve today.  However, I do need to record that one of the points of contention within the marriage was the use by the father of the matrimonial home to grow cannabis plants.  I am told that the growth of cannabis is legal in Lanzarote, although its sale is not.   </p>

There then followed proceedings in both the Spanish courts, brought by the father, and in England where the mother sought a prohibited steps order in the family court.  Those family court proceedings are currently stayed pending the outcome of this application.  The current application was issued on 5 September 2019. </p>

The first is dated 1 November 2019 and states that the mother is suffering from sufficient anxiety problems that she is current unfit to travel back to Lanzarote, and this would exacerbate her mental health problems.

However, he accepted that, in the circumstances, I should deal with the application (if I, myself, were so satisfied on the evidence) on the basis that the mother would not be returning to Lanzarote with E.  It seems to me that there is a very real prospect that Mother will indeed refuse to accompany E to Lanzarote, and I am satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, she would not do so.  My analysis of the grounds of objection must therefore be seen through that prism. </p>

Firstly, there is a gateway stage which requires me to consider whether E has objected in Convention terms to her return to Lanzarote and whether she has attained an age or degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views.  Lady Justice Black, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>, at para.76, described the test thus: </p>

The judges who try these cases do so regularly and build up huge experience in dealing with them, as do the CAFCASS officers who interview the children involved.  I do not think that they need (or will be assisted by) an analysis of how to go about this part of their task.  In making his or her findings and evaluation, the judge will be able to draw upon the entirety of the material that has been assembled in relation to the child&#8217;s objections exception and to pick from it those features which are relevant to his or her determination. The starting point is the wording of Article 13 which requires, as the authorities which I would choose to follow confirm, a determination of whether the child objects, whether he or she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his or her views, and what order should be made in all the circumstances.&#8221;  </p>

She described E as being more nuanced in relation to other matters that were canvassed with her and being able to balance advantages and disadvantages.  For example, Ms Magson described E as recognising her parents were saying different things, and she described E as understanding that there were balanced issues on which decisions had to be made.

I accept that if neither parent can speak or write Spanish (and this appears to be the case), that will significantly limit both their abilities to engage with the Spanish legal system to resolve their dispute in Lanzarote.  However, what seems to me by far the most important factor here is the situation that would await E if I compelled her to return to Lanzarote, particularly when coupled with her own clear objection to returning without her mother.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The father&#8217;s proposal that he has set out in his evidence is that the mother and E should return together and live in the former matrimonial home.  The father has indicated he would give an undertaking to vacate the property.  The father has also offered to provide financial support for E.  However, he has disclosed his bank account details and it is clear he has no savings and is overdrawn.  His bank accounts do not demonstrate any regular income.  The father has filed evidence that he is currently working, however, in reality, the sum of this evidence is three brief typed letters, all in essentially identical form, which simply indicate that he is currently doing work for three individuals.  They are certainly not formal evidence of regular jobs, with tax, national insurance, or the Spanish equivalent, being paid.  They suggest that perhaps, at best, the father is involved in casual work in which he most likely receives cash in hand. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The proposal that the father will provide a home and financial support for E is clearly predicated upon the father being available to work, and this simply would not be possible if E returned to live with him alone; that is to say without being accompanied by her mother.  I am not satisfied that he would be in a position to provide care for E whilst, at the same time, holding down the three jobs that he is apparently doing.  I am extremely concerned that to order a return in such circumstances, that is to say, circumstances where E returns to Lanzarote alone, without her mother, would be to place E in an intolerable situation.   </p>

Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress.  It is part of growing up.  But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate.  Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself.  Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent.  Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e.g. where a mother&#8217;s subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child.&#8221; </p>
