They have undergone a number of IVF procedures, which have sadly been unsuccessful.  As a result of advice they were given in relation to surrogacy arrangements, they got in contact with the surrogacy agency Conceiveabilities, who in turn put them in contact with the respondent. It is clear from what I have read they very quickly formed a strong bond in relation to the arrangement they were entering into. That strong bond has continued, not only during the pregnancy but also after E and Fs birth, because they have remained in regular contact. GH will remain a part of E and Fs life well after this Court has made the orders that are being sought.</span></p>

As I have said, the Court has the benefit of an enormously helpful and comprehensive Skeleton Argument by Ms Gamble on behalf of the applicants, and she and they will recognise much of that document in this judgment.  </span></p>

Firstly, the Court has to be satisfied that there is a biological connection between the Applicants and E and F and that they were carried by a woman who is not one of the Applicants.  The evidence is the statement from Dr William Schoolcraft dated 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> May 2015, where he confirms he transferred embryos containing the gametes of both the applicants to GH, and the consequent pregnancy resulted in E and F&#8217;s birth.</span></p>

E and F have been in the Applicants&#8217; care since two weeks after their birth, when they were discharged from hospital and have been in their full-time care since then. They clearly had their home with the Applicants when they issued the application and very obviously have their home with the Applicants now,  the Court has the enormous benefit of E and F being in Court for this hearing.</span></p>

The Court has to be satisfied that GH, the Respondent, consented freely, with full understanding and unconditionally to the Court making a Parental Order.  There are a number of documents that clearly demonstrate that is the case. She signed the Form A101A on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> September 2015.  That was four months after the birth.  It is a notarised document, as required by the Rules and clearly sets out that she agrees to the Court making a Parental Order.  That document is supported by a number of other parts of the evidence; firstly, the completion by her of the Acknowledgement of Service on  the same day, 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> September, again indicating that she agreed to the making of a Parental Order; her cooperation within the proceedings that took place soon after the birth in Minnesota whereby the Court made a Parentage Order on 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> June 2015; and her continued involvement and cooperation within these proceedings, most recently acknowledging service of notice of this hearing which she has done in the emails set out in the bundle.

Pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s54 (8)</ref> this Court has the discretion to authorise payments other than for expenses reasonably incurred.  The headline figures from the detailed breakdown in the papers that the Court needs to consider are the compensation payments made to GH as a result of the arrangement entered into.  She was paid a total of $52,523. After expenses of just over $9,500 the compensation figure left is $42,993, which is about &#163;29,500.  Secondly, there is an agency fee paid to Conceiveabilities of $21,350.  In considering whether the Court should authorise those payments it needs firstly to look at the level of those payments and consider whether they are or are not disproportionate to reasonable expenses, then to look at the good faith of the applicants and their cooperation with the authorities. The evidence demonstrates the payments made to GH and the payments to the agency fee are well within the figures this Court has seen in similar cases. They are paid through an arrangement that is permitted in the jurisdiction in which it is made.</span></p>

They took steps in Minnesota to secure their legal position there and have also taken such steps they have been able to take to secure the position in Germany.

What the Court needs to be satisfied of is that at least one of the Applicants is domiciled in this jurisdiction at the time of the application and at the time of the order.  Both Applicants were born in Germany; their domicile of origin is in Germany. What is said is that CD has acquired a domicile of choice in this jurisdiction and that even though the parties have not lived in this jurisdiction for any length of time since 2013, for reasons which I shall explain in a moment, she has retained her domicile of choice in this jurisdiction and has not abandoned it.  </span></p>

Secondly, to acquire a domicile of choice there must be both an </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">animo et facto</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, i.e. a person must both reside in a new country and also form a sufficient intention to live permanently or indefinitely in that country.  Thirdly, acquisition of a domicile of choice is not to be lightly inferred, and fourthly, important factors which are relevant considerations are whether a person has formed the necessary intention to return to live in their country of origin on the happening of a reasonably foreseeable contingency and whether they are resident in a country for a general or limited purpose. In that case I agreed with that distilled analysis of the key principles and said it had been made clear in a number of cases that long residence in a new country is not of itself sufficient to establish that the person has acquired a domicile of choice there, if they intend to return to their country of origin on the happening of a contingency which is reasonably foreseeable.  </span></p>

Although Andreas&#8217; intentions regarding both Cyprus and England are closely interrelated the adhesiveness of the domicile of origin, the incidence of the burden of proof and the level of the standard of proof all require the person contending for a domicile of choice to establish a clear case Andreas intended to live permanently or indefinitely in England.   In my judgment the question is not so much whether Andreas intended to return to live permanently in Cyprus but whether it had been shown that by the date of his death he had formed the intention to live permanently in England.  The crucial point is that Andreas has a domicile of origin in Cyprus until it is proved that he intended to reside permanently or indefinitely in England.&#8217;  </span></p>

She settled here very quickly and, as she said in her evidence, she formed the intention to live here permanently in about 2005.  That is demonstrated by a number of different factors.  She enrolled in courses; purchased a family home here; chose to have their wedding here. She also applied to naturalise as a British citizen, which she did in 2013 even though such registration had no material advantage for her because as a German citizen she had free movement in and out of this jurisdiction.</span></p>

Since then they have been searching for a replacement property here.  They became very close to finding one in 2014, but unfortunately at a very late stage that sale could not proceed due to difficulties in raising the mortgage that was required.  They have continued with their search.  They have purchased a number of investment properties in Manchester.  At the moment they have three.

The evidence demonstrates that physical absence from the jurisdiction has not changed her intention to remain committed to living permanently and indefinitely here. Despite her physical absence, her intention to reside here permanently or indefinitely has remained, the actions she is taking in continuing to be able to look for a family home in this jurisdiction, and AB to look for job opportunities to come back here support that. In addition, CD gave oral evidence of the details in relation to the schooling that they have been looking at here. Her strong motivation to live here is reinforced following the birth of E and F. She very movingly described in her oral evidence that she and her husband feel able to talk more openly of the surrogacy arrangement with their friends here and within their network in England. She said they have had somewhat negative experiences in Germany which have led them to conceal the arrangement. As AB described to Mr McGavin in their discussions, their circle of trust is much smaller in Germany as a consequence of this different attitude. CD described in her evidence one of her concerns is the children not being able to talk openly about the circumstances of their origins and for her that provides another strong motivating factor, despite her physical absence, to retain her clear intention to live permanently and indefinitely in this jurisdiction.</span></p>

First, through the occupation of her husband (he is hoping to be able to return back to this jurisdiction to work) and second, when they are successful in their plan to be able to purchase a family home here.

It is clear that as regards their status in this jurisdiction their welfare needs require that status to be put on the securest footing possible.  The Court has the benefit of a comprehensive report by Mr McGavin. He sets out from para. 41 onwards his analysis of the welfare checklist, which I readily adopt and accept.  Unless Parental Orders are made the legal status that both E and F have in relation to the Applicants would remain uncertain.  What Parental Orders will do is confer lifelong joint and equal legal parenthood and parental responsibility on the applicant parents.  It will trigger the issue of British birth certificates for the children, confirming their membership of the family they were born into and the only family they have ever known. Such orders will fully extinguish the residual parental status and parental responsibility of the Respondent surrogate mother, which is the legal position within her own jurisdiction.</span></p>
