That, Ms Gray submits, is what has happened here, with the mother being trapped in a cycle of abuse, followed by repentance by the father with him begging for forgiveness and reconciliation.  </p>

The nature of domestic violence means I should tread very carefully before rejecting allegations on the basis that a lack of past complaint means that an allegation has been fabricated.  Moreover, the mother&#8217;s own evidence, when she speaks of her shame and embarrassment of having been a victim of abuse, and the steps that she took to hide the abuse and the injuries she says she sustained from others, provides an explanation for the lack of any past complaint.  </p>

Nor has the father made any attempt to explain the email of July 2021 in which he referred to his temper and to having hit the mother in the past. </p>

I note that even now the mother&#8217;s position in Romania is that she is willing for Y to stay for a month in the summer with the father and for a week in the spring and winter holidays and given this, it does seem to me, that the mother has little concern that Y would actually be at direct risk, himself, in the father&#8217;s care.  I therefore take the view that there is relatively little substance in the allegation that is now put forward by the mother that Y is directly at risk if he spends time with the father. </p>

First, and most importantly, is the fact that this is a case where the mother is not returning to live with the father.  Even if I order a return, the parties&#8217; relationship is at an end and neither party suggest that the mother and the father would be living in the same property.  As such, it is considerably less likely that Y would be exposed to the risk of violence taking place between the father and the mother.  He can be protected further by undertakings and by the other protective measures that have been proposed.  </p>

This is challenged by the father, and he points to an email dated 19 January 2023 from Adrian Tapu, a Romanian lawyer who the mother proposed instructing to provide expert evidence in this case.  Mr Tapu suggests that Romania does have a number of personal protection measures, but their efficiency will vary from case to case, as everywhere else. </p>

She says that undertakings are insufficient and that only such an order will do because, she informs me, that although an undertaking would be binding and enforceable in Romania, only an order of the court would attract a power of arrest, as well.  </p>

However, it seems to me that, firstly, the father is clearly willing to undertake to this court and the Romanian court, not to use or threaten violence against the mother or the child or to go within 100 metres of any address at which they are living, save for the exceptions already recounted. Those undertakings are enforceable here and in Romania and Mr Basi reminds me that Romania is a party not only to the 1980 Hague Convention but also the 1996 Hague Convention as well.  Secondly, I consider that I am entitled to assume that the Romanian police have at their disposal, powers to prevent a breach of the peace or threat and assault in the way that the police would have here, and that the practical difference between undertakings by the father &#8211; which can be supported by other civil and criminal remedies &#8211; and the type of the order that is now sought by the mother may, in terms of their practical effect, be relatively small. </p>

I am not satisfied that it has been proved by the mother that the Romanian order which she asks that the father to submit to is available in this case, or indeed, that it would provide a substantially greater level of protection to Y than the undertakings that have been offered by the father.  Taking these matters into account, I am satisfied that the undertakings that have been proposed by the father provides proper protection, both to the mother and for Y. </p>

The father has refused to pay this but has agreed, as I have already mentioned, that he will pay Y&#8217;s air fare for his return.   The father&#8217;s finances are not formally in the evidence, but I was told by Mr Basi in the course of his submissions this morning, that the father earns the equivalent of &#163;450 per month of which he is required to pay 25 per cent to the mother for E&#8217;s upkeep under a Romanian court order. </p>
