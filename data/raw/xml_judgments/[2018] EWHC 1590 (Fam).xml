It is central to his being whether, as an individual or as a member of his family.  As Ms Isaacs correctly puts it, this case if fundamentally about Xs identity in his relationship with the commissioning parents.  Fundamental, as these matters must be to commissioning parents, they are, if anything, even more fundamental to the child.  A parental order has, to adopt Theis J&#8217;s powerful expression, a transformative effect, not just in its effect on the child&#8217;s legal relationship with the surrogate and the commissioning parents but also, to adopt the guardian&#8217;s words in the present case, in relation to the practical and psychological realities of X&#8217;s identity.

Latterly, she has only told her sister who, with the agreement of the other parties attending the hearing at my permission, sat in court with her for moral and emotional support, c) her forlorn hope that by having children with the second respondent they could overcome their difficulties, that he would change and they could be reunited, d) her acceptance that in the early days of the relationship and marriage there were more good days than bad days, especially when the second respondent was compliantly taking his medication,  e) her reasons for taking a photograph of the second respondent lying in a foetal position with his medication contained as spread around his head after he had taken an overdose. She took the photograph she said, and I accept, because she wanted to try and demonstrate to the second respondent how dire his circumstances were, and she wanted to try and persuade his family he had serious problems which needed to be addressed when they had previously not believed her and had rebuffed her concerns.  She was not successful in either endeavour, and f) her account of the second respondent&#8217;s rough and angry treatment of the children at times, proving to be the last straw and leading to their separation.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.58in">&#8216;AB told me that although he has a close relationship with GH and IJ, who are very attached to him, he was aware that his role is as a stepfather, and that it was important for the children to have a relationship with their father for their sense of identity.  AB said that he endeavours to nurture and promote a good relationship between the children and EF, for example, until it was suspended, he had been facilitating Skype contact.  Another time he reproached GH when he heard her say to her father she hated him.  AB pointed out that it also incumbent upon EF to strive to address the difficulties in his communication with the children.  He said he had heard GH ask EF, &#8220;Why did you leave me?&#8221;  AB said EF brushed it off, &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t understand that she is trying to understand&#8221;.  In relation to contact between the children and EF, AB said he wants to build contact because that&#8217;s what should happen, but sometimes EF can be impatient and doesn&#8217;t understand that the children are not ready.  For instance, if IJ is having a tantrum or GH is simply not ready.  He would like EF to better understand IJ&#8217;s needs.  For example, AB said, the previous week IJ had refused the birthday present that he had asked for and they had to take him on the day to choose another gift of his choice.  AB believed that the reintroduction of contact should start slowly, initially Skype FaceTime with GH only.  He was of the view there was a need to separate IJ and GH because IJ does not like change.  Sometimes he insisted that today was Saturday when it was Sunday because he didn&#8217;t want to talk to his father and he became upset.  AB told me that as a result IJ exploded at night, hitting everyone including himself.  However, AB said, EF has to listen to someone to address what she, GH wants not what he, EF, wants, because it&#8217;s all about the children, describing GH as confident and articulate.  He told me &#8220;In the past I&#8217;ve advised him to ask the children what they want, not to impose on them, like going on a train, which IJ finds difficult to cope with&#8221;&#8217;.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.58in">&#8216;I then asked GH what she wanted me to tell the judge, she replied about EF.  She said he was bad, &#8220;That he used to hit us very hard&#8221;, although she used the word &#8216;hardly&#8217;.  I asked her who had told her that her father hit her and she said, &#8216;Me I remember&#8217;.  Although she told me she could not remember where EF hit her, neither could she remember why he did, saying, &#8220;He used to get tempered very easily&#8221;.  GH continued, &#8220;And he chose Country Z over us which is a bad thing to do, that&#8217;s all I have to tell you, that&#8217;s all I really feel like telling you&#8221;.  At that point, GH stood up and asked if she could call her dad, referring to AB.  I asked her if she would like to talk about the tools she completed and she declined.  I then asked if she had any questions for me or anything to add and she said, &#8220;No&#8221;.  EF insisted CD had influenced the children against him, and had isolated them from his family too.  He told me he wanted the children to have contact with them too.  I explained to EF that it would be desirable for the children to have a meaning relationship with both him and with his family, as this forms an integral aspect of their development.  However, it could not proceed in the face of the allegations before the court and from what GH had also told me&#8217;.</p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.58in">&#8216;This brings me to the other aspect of who the children perceive to be their daddy.  Without doubt, AB is their psychological father and assumes the role of stepfather to a great extent.  He lives with them, helps CD with their day-to-day care and education and provides CD with invaluable practical and moral support around IJ&#8217;s needs.  However, there seems to be some assumption that EF has no entitlement in the children&#8217;s lives and, not least, from the school&#8217;s point of view.  It would appear he may not be receiving any school reports about the children to which he is entitled.  The school refers to CD and AB as the children&#8217;s parents.  I do not propose to suggest at all that AB has usurped EF title, simply that there is a risk that if the relationship EF and the children remains as it is, they will be further harmed by not developing a safe relationship with him and the paternal family, and instead, by continuing to harbour or foster undesirable feelings towards him, such as being rejected by him.  I therefore recommend that a joint child arrangements order be made to CD and AB for the children to live with them&#8217;.</p>
