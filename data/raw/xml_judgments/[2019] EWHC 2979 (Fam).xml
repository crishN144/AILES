The Home Office was not formally notified of this application given that (a) TY is indisputably lawfully in this country (see the Upper Tribunal decision at [9] below), and (b) even if an adoption order is ultimately made, TY will not automatically acquire British Citizenship. </p>

Ms Kakonge, for the respondent Local Authority does not oppose the progress of the adoption application.  Importantly, she accepts on her client&#8217;s behalf, that the investigations and duties of the Local Authority have not been compromised or prejudiced in any way by the non-compliance.  The Local Authority is satisfied that TY appears to be well-settled with Ms CM.  That said, it is necessary for a court to be required to consider carefully any application, particularly one as significant as adoption, which appears, in its progress to or through the court, to contravene the clear requirements imposed by statute. </p>

I have seen the electronic pro forma completed by Ms CM; I have seen the information which she supplied. Ms Kakonge sensibly conceded at the hearing that the electronic form completed by Ms CM was not &#8216;straightforward&#8217;, was not suited to this activity (the giving of notice of intention to adopt) and &#8216;could have been clearer&#8217;.  That the information provided by Ms CM was therefore, in my finding, &#8216;ambiguous&#8217; and imprecise was not entirely her fault, and the Respondent did not pursue this point.  </p>

After a long illness, TY&#8217;s mother died in 2010.  Ms CM, who lives in London, had supported TY and the family over many years, and, following TY&#8217;s mother&#8217;s death, undertook to TY&#8217;s family that she would care for and indeed adopt TY.  The filed evidence reveals that Ms CM has stepped up her involvement in TY&#8217;s life, and certainly since 2010 has arranged his daily care, fully financially supporting him and guiding, mentoring and sharing his activities and concerns.  Although physically living apart for most of this time, Ms CM told me that she initially spoke with TY three or four times a week, and as social media facilitated communication, they were in daily contact.   I have seen examples of their daily WhatsApp communications, and both of their witness statements attest to their close loving relationship.  TY says that he feels like a &#8216;brother&#8217; to Ms CM&#8217;s adult sons.  They in turn are very supportive of the plan for TY to be a full member of their family.  </p>

To complete the picture, TY&#8217;s adoption was not a &#8216;Convention&#8217; adoption; that is to say, Jamaica is not one of the (currently) 101 contracting parties to the <span style="font-style:italic">Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation with respect to Intercountry Adoption 1993</span>.   Therefore, the adoption of TY by his aunt in Jamaica is actually of minimal (if any) legal consequence in these proceedings, as it is not recognised and has no legal effect here.  </p>

The application was refused on 14 October 2015, and the refusal was upheld by the First Tier Immigration Tribunal in a determination dated 27 June 2017 (TY was, by now, 16). TY&#8217;s appeal against the First Tier Tribunal decision was allowed by the Upper Tribunal in a determination  dated 14 June 2018 (TY was 16, nearly 17) which found the First Tier judge, the Home Office presenting officer and TY&#8217;s then counsel all erred in their reading of the immigration rules and their understanding of the family law arrangements sought to be incorporated as part of the rules. The Upper Tribunal found that TY satisfied the requirements of the immigration rules on entry clearance for adoptive children and also allowed the appeal on human rights grounds. The determination was reported: see: <span style="font-style:italic">TY (Overseas Adoptions - Certificates of Eligibility</span>) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukut/iac/2018/197" uk:canonical="[2018] UKUT 197 (IAC)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] UKUT 197 (IAC)</ref> see in particular [32-33]; [46-47]; [52-60]). </p>

To recap, TY was aged 11 when the adoption process in Jamaica was commenced, was 13 when his entry clearance application was submitted and aged 17 and 5 months when his visa was issued. Ms CM complied with all the Jamaican adoption and immigration procedures. I am satisfied that she made repeat efforts to expedite these processes. TY&#8217;s visa was issued in January 2019. He travelled to the UK in the company of Ms CM (as required under <span style="font-style:italic">regulation 4(3)</span> of the <span style="font-style:italic">AFER 2005</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

She did not do so.  She had recalled that her PACT social worker had advised her to notify the Local Authority when TY arrived in the country, but not of any timescale. She ultimately notified the authority (by completing a pro forma electronic form) on 8 May 2019.  Ms CM&#8217;s notification was referred to the adoption team. The Local Authority&#8217;s adoption team manager responded by email dated 3 June 2019 advising Ms CM that: &#8220;There is no current role for the Adoption and Post Permanency Team&#8221;. Ms CM was confused by this response and assumed that she did not, after all, need to adopt TY in this country or indeed take any further action. She then contacted an immigration solicitor to check on TY&#8217;s immigration status when he attained the age of 18; the immigration solicitor referred her to Freemans for family law advice.  Ms CM visited that firm on 24 July (N.B. nine days before TY&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday). Only then did she learn of the pre-adoption requirements and the need to adopt TY here.  An application for adoption was hastily prepared and lodged the following day, and formally issued a few days later.  </p>

At that time, she was referred to PACT to whom the Local Authority was then commissioning its intercountry adoption work. Thereafter all her communications concerning the adoption were with PACT. In the report of PACT&#8217;s final assessment visit with Ms CM on 10 December 2014, the social worker recorded that she had advised Ms CM to be specific in TY&#8217;s visa application that his entry to the UK was &#8216;for the purposes of adoption&#8217;.  The report concluded &#8216;PACT will keep in close contact with [Ms CM] until [TY] comes back into the country to discuss that procedure&#8217;. That discussion on post-arrival pre-adoption procedures never took place, as PACT ceased to undertake the adoption work for the Local Authority some time in 2016.  </p>

Ms Kakonge advises me that the respondent Local Authority is now ready and able to undertake this assessment, and further submits that this assessment (in Annex A form) can be completed in less than the 12 weeks conventionally sought.  She points out that the Local Authority is not starting this work with a blank canvas; as mentioned earlier ([7]) it commissioned PACT to complete an assessment of Ms CM in 2014 so much of the background investigation has been done.  This assessment supported Ms CM&#8217;s application to adopt TY in Jamaica. </p>

It will inevitably turn on the specific facts.  Relevant among those facts will be whether Ms CM and TY have an &#8216;integrated&#8217; relationship, and whether they saw themselves in a parent/child relationship; I believe they did.  In this regard, the court notes the &#8220;concern and care&#8221; shown by Ms CM towards TY over a number of years; it is clear that she &#8220;arranged and provided&#8221; the daily routine for TY while he lived with his ailing grandmother (see [35](vii) below). </p>

This reinforced the critical role that Ms CM played in TY&#8217;s upbringing, decision-making, supervising, offering emotional care for TY, albeit that this was done for much of the time remotely. </p>

It has rightly not questioned Ms CM&#8217;s good faith, and has properly acknowledged that she was seeking to navigate these difficult waters once TY was in this country without the benefit of legal advice, and without support from the adoption agency which had assessed her.  The Local Authority further indicated through counsel that on the information provided it has no reason to question that the current arrangement for TY&#8217;s care by Ms CM is meeting his needs.  The Local Authority has also confirmed that it is not prejudiced or compromised in its ability to undertake its statutory assessment and investigatory functions now.  By contrast, TY and Ms CM would be irremediably prejudiced if the application were not allowed to proceed. </p>
