	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> On 16 November 2016, sitting in the Court of Protection, I made an order facilitating the delivery of a baby by Caesarean section performed on a 24-year-old woman with a diagnosis of autism and learning disability, hereafter referred to as &#8220;CA&#8221;. This judgment sets out the reasons for my decision.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 November 2016, less than a fortnight before the estimated date on which CA was due to give birth, the NHS Trust responsible for the hospital providing her with obstetric care applied to this court for a declaration and order that it was lawful and in CA&#8217;s best interests that she should undergo a Caesarean section to deliver her baby, if necessary using force in a way that deprived CA of her liberty. The reason given for the application was that CA was refusing any interventionist health care in respect of her pregnancy, objecting to a Caesarean section, and stating that she wanted to give birth at home, which the treating clinicians concluded was not in her best interests.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset, I cite the observations of Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The Mental Health Trust and Others v DD and Another</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/11" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 11" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 11</ref>, another case in this court concerning an application for declarations and orders facilitating the performance of a Caesarean section operation on a woman said to lack mental capacity. At paragraph 5 of his judgment, Cobb J made this observation.</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The rulings sought in this case challenge the most precious and valued human rights and freedoms. Authorisation for the deprivation of DD&#8217;s liberty and for the use of restraint (even for a short time) is sought, as is permission to intrude, by force if necessary, into the privacy and sanctity of her home. Steps to promote her physical health and well-being, it is argued, require a physically invasive medical procedure, to be conducted under general anaesthetic. I am acutely aware of the unusually onerous responsibility which falls upon me sitting as a judge of the Court of Protection in determining this application.&#8221;</p>

		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The same observations apply to these proceedings. It is therefore extremely concerning that the Trust only started these proceedings less than a fortnight before the baby was due. It should be noted that the application in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">DD</span> case was made 6 or 7 weeks before the baby was due. The issues arising in the current case were not quite as complex as those in the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">DD</span> case, but they involved a number of sensitive and difficult decisions on which CA, through her litigation friend the Official Solicitor, had an absolute right to be heard. Because of the shortage of time, the Official Solicitor had very little opportunity to digest and analyse the evidence. As a result, there was a significant danger that issues might not have received the care and attention they deserved. Fortunately, however, I am satisfied that, thanks to the efforts of the Official Solicitor and his representatives, all issues have in the event received full consideration.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This extremely unsatisfactory situation has been brought about by the failure of the Trust to start proceedings at an early stage. In this respect, the Trust has manifestly failed to comply with the guidance provided by my colleague Keehan J, in the Annex to his decision reported as <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">NHS Trust 1 v G: Practice Note</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/30" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 30" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 30</ref> as to the steps to be taken when a local authority and/or medical professionals are concerned about and dealing with a pregnant woman who has mental health problems and, potentially, lacks capacity to litigate and to make decisions about her welfare or medical treatment. That guidance is compulsory reading for all professionals involved with such cases. Of particular relevance is the guidance at paragraph 6 of the Annex:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The early identification of an individual in respect of whom an application might have to be made is essential.&#8221;</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Later, at paragraph 19, the guidance continues:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;Save in a case of genuine medical emergency, any application should be made no later than 4 weeks before the expected date of delivery. This timeframe is required for the following reasons: (i) where P is assessed as lacking capacity to litigate, it will enable the Official Solicitor to undertake any necessary investigations; (ii) to ensure the final hearing is listed and heard at least a few days before the proposed interventions; and (iii) to enable a directions hearing to be held around two weeks before the final hearing. The court and the parties will then have the opportunity to ensure the court has all the relevant and necessary evidence at the final hearing.&#8221;</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>In addition, paragraph 22, Keehan J noted:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;Late applications are to be avoided save in a case of genuine medical emergency. They have four very undesirable consequences: (i) the application is more likely to be dealt with by the out-of-hours judge and without a full hearing in public; (ii) the available written evidence is more likely to be incomplete and necessitate substantial oral evidence; (iii) it seriously undermines the role that the Official Solicitor can and should probably play in the proceedings; and (iv) it deprives the court of the opportunity to direct that further evidence, including independent expert evidence, if necessary, is obtained in relation to the issue of capacity or best interests. This approach is dictated by P&#8217;s article 5, 6 and 8 rights and best interests.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I hope that those responsible for managing the case within the Trust will carry out a proper investigation as to the causes of this delay. Hereafter, all NHS Trusts must ensure that their clinicians, administrators and lawyers are fully aware of, and comply with, the important guidance given by Keehan J in respect of applications of this sort.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application first came before me on 10 November 2016 at a preliminary hearing on the same day that the Trust had filed its application and only hours after the Official Solicitor had agreed to take on the responsibility of acting as CA&#8217;s litigation friend. At that hearing, the Trust asked the court to make an immediate order authorising the carrying out of a planned Caesarean section. Unsurprisingly, the Official Solicitor asked for an adjournment to carry out his own assessment. I agreed and listed the matter for a final hearing 4 days later (2 working days later) with a view to affording the Official Solicitor time to obtain a report from his agent on an interview with CA. I indicated that, in the event that an emergency hearing was acquired over the intervening weekend, I would deal with the application. I gave directions for the filing of further evidence for the hearing on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, including the filing of an attendance note by the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative following her interview with CA.</p>

CA&#8217;s parents had been notified of the proceedings and the hearing, and, although they informed the Trust and the Official Solicitor that they supported the Trust&#8217;s application, they played no direct role in the hearing. It is important to note, however, that they have played a very important part in caring for CA and will, in all probability, play an equally important role in future as it is the plan of the local authority for the area where CA resides to start proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and to place the baby in the care of CA&#8217;s parents under a care order.</p>

The evidence for the first incident is a series of superficial scars on her abdomen radiating from the umbilicus. On behalf of the Trust, Ms Khalique described these scars as &#8220;tribal&#8221;. CA&#8217;s mother suggested that these marks were inflicted on an occasion when CA was unwell, the purpose being to release &#8220;bad blood&#8221;. The precise circumstances in which these incisions were inflicted are unclear, but it seems likely that CA was conscious at the time and under some form of physical restraint.</p>

At the beginning of July 2016, she visited her parents. They suspected she was pregnant and took her to the GP who confirmed that this was indeed the case. It was estimated that she was approaching 30 weeks gestation, although subsequent scans revised the estimated date of arrival to 23 November 2016. The father of the child CA is carrying is unknown, as are the precise circumstances in which the baby was conceived. Although the court heard some evidence about CA&#8217;s various accounts of what had happened, it is unnecessary to refer to them further in this judgment. </p>

The evidence presented by the Trust, and in particular by Mr G and midwife DW, is that CA was largely uncooperative with medical examinations and, on occasions, with midwifery staff. She refused to provide blood samples, or to undergo gynaecological examinations, or almost any examination of her body. She did, however, agree to undergo ultrasound scans, from which hospital staff were able to glean some information about the baby, including the revised estimated date of delivery. Gradually over time, DW has managed to secure, to some extent, CA&#8217;s confidence and trust, and, as a result, CA allowed her to listen to the foetal heartbeat and to palpate her abdomen and test her blood pressure. </p>

CA seemed to have a very limited understanding of, or interest in, childcare, saying that her mother would deal with it. She was adamant that she wanted to have the baby at home and, when she was shown round the maternity ward and delivery room at the hospital, showed an aversion to the machinery and a mistrust of medical staff, saying &#8220;no one can touch you at home, I trust no one.&#8221; In discussion about childbirth, she said simply &#8220;they just come out when they&#8217;re ready and that&#8217;s it&#8221;. According to DW, she had no expectation of possible pain or bleeding. Later, when seen by psychiatrist Dr I, she said she would not experience any pain because her friend had a delivery without suffering any pain. When she eventually watched the DVD, she did not seem inquisitive about the mother&#8217;s evident pain, and stated that she would definitely not have an epidural injection. DW noticed that she never relayed back the information which professionals had told her. Despite forming a good relationship with her, DW continued to find CA challenging and, on occasions, unpredictable and difficult.</p>

CA&#8217;s mother told him that CA had been given a diagnosis of autism in 2008, and gave descriptions of CA which Dr I stated in his oral evidence confirmed the diagnosis. Dr I described the rigidity of thinking which CA demonstrated around a range of issues &#8211; for example, childbirth &#8211; as being typical of autism. Dr I was very confident of his diagnosis of learning disability and autism, and explained in oral evidence that the combination of conditions was important.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were a number of striking aspects of CA&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings which command respect. Most striking of all, perhaps, were her strong independence and ardent wish to have the baby at home and do it all by herself. On the other hand, it is plain from Ms Hejabizadeha&#8217;s note, as it is from the other evidence, in particular that of DW, that CA has little understanding of what is involved in labour and childbirth.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seemed likely that this clear expression of her wishes was linked in some way to her own early experiences, and in particular of being cut. It is, of course, essential to avoid speculation. In my judgment, however, it was an inference which this court could and should draw that her aversion to medical treatment was linked to her traumatic experiences as a child. On behalf of the Official Solicitor, Ms Gollop was critical of the Trust&#8217;s failure to address the issue of CA&#8217;s trauma when preparing her for the delivery of the baby. In opening submissions, she emphasised the fact that CA has experience of men cutting her abdomen repeatedly against her will and that no one therefore knows how she would feel and react to the experience of recovering from a general anaesthetic, surrounded by doctors and nurses whom she already trusts very little if at all, only to find that she had been cut again. Ms Gollop suggested that CA may well not experience a Caesarean section as less traumatic than a vaginal delivery.</p>

Given CA&#8217;s antipathy towards medical examination, assessing and treating this heightened risk of a tear would be more difficult than usual. Mr G observed that a substantial proportion of deliveries &#8211; just over one in four vaginal deliveries &#8211; lead to an emergency Caesarean section. Statistically, therefore, there was a significant risk that a vaginal delivery in CA&#8217;s case would lead to such an emergency.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his report, Dr I concluded that the option of a vaginal delivery was unrealistic due to CA&#8217;s refusal to allow the midwife to carry out repeated vaginal examinations to monitor the progress of her labour; her refusal to talk through various options for pain relief; her refusal to allow administration of any necessary injectable medication if required; her anticipation that the baby would just &#8220;pop out&#8221;; her lack of realisation that the experience of first delivery may be long and often painful; her reluctance to comply with instructions and the consequent risk of lack of cooperation, for example when instructed to push, leading to an uncoordinated or chaotic labour process. He therefore concluded that CA was not adequately prepared to go through the process of natural birth and that, if she was allowed to proceed with that of mode of delivery, it was likely to end with an emergency Caesarean section. In his opinion, this would be the least desirable option and the most risky for both mother and baby. It would be practically difficult to assemble the multi-professional team of her choice for a natural birth out of hours, or in the likely event of an emergency Caesarean section. Dr I also formed the opinion that CA was unlikely to understand the rationale for a Caesarean section in an emergency due to her heightened anxiety and was therefore unlikely to cooperate. This in turn was likely to lead to delay, putting both baby and mother at unnecessary and avoidable risk.</p>

This would not only allow assembling a team of familiar faces but also would reduce the risk of uncertainties and chaos. He was aware that CA may require a degree of restraint for the administration of injectable medication, but the alternative options of a natural birth and/or an emergency Caesarean section also likely to require a degree of restraint. Restraint was therefore in all probability unavoidable whichever option was preferred.</p>

In his view, however, there would be a greater risk of psychological damage if CA started a vaginal delivery but then had undergo an emergency Caesarean section after experiencing the pain, anxiety and trauma of the emergency. Dr I was further concerned that during a vaginal labour CA&#8217;s attitude to medical procedures and doctors, coupled with her phobia of needles, would lead her to continue to refuse pain relief. Whilst acknowledging that many people on the autistic spectrum have a higher pain threshold, Dr I was concerned that CA would suffer untreated pain during labour which would cause a greater anxiety and distress which would be exacerbated if labour was prolonged.</p>

But looking at the evidence overall, it is manifestly clear that the balance comes down decisively in favour of a planned Caesarean section. I accept the analysis set out in the balance sheet provided by Mr G and his colleague. I accept the further evidence of Mr G that there is a substantial risk that an attempted vaginal delivery would lead to an emergency Caesarean section. I accept the evidence of Dr I that an emergency Caesarean section would cause the greatest degree of psychological damage to CA, and that a planned Caesarean section is likely to lead to the least psychological damage of the options in this case.</p>
