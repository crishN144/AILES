If her diabetes is properly managed, she is able to be fit and healthy. If it is not, she can rapidly become seriously unwell, and could die. In the past she has not been able to engage with those professionals who are responsible for her diabetes care. That led to her becoming seriously ill with ketoacidosis. She required hospital treatment. She was fortunate not to die.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">In a reasonably lengthy judgment, I decided AH lacked the capacity to make these decisions. This judgment follows the hearing considering her best interests. There have been no challenges to the decision I made in my earlier judgment, nor to the evidence on which that decision was based. Although capacity is time as well as issue specific, and therefore may change over time, there is no reason for me to change my decision on AH&#8217;s capacity. In fact, the evidence of her engagement since that decision would tend to confirm what I decided.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">At the final hearing just before Christmas, no live witnesses were required by the parties. I did hear from AH herself, who spoke to me candidly about her views. However, those representing her did not actively challenge any of the evidence. That evidence comprised mainly of updated statements from the Social Workers LA and Learning Disability Nurse, JC. I have also considered all the evidence that was the basis of my earlier judgment, too.</span></p>

That meant she would spend a period of a few months at the placement. She would be deprived of her liberty there because she was not free to leave and could only leave the placement for visits to her own flat with the permission of staff and was required to return in accordance with her care plan.</span></p>

She does not want to be at Placement 1. She wants to be in her own home. She is allowed to go there, but she is in effect on leave when she does, and she has to return to Placement 1 when required. She is not allowed permanently to leave Placement 1 and reside somewhere else. Whilst she is at Placement 1 she is under continuous supervision and control, i.e. necessary monitoring, and is not free to leave as and when she wishes.</span></p>

Between the interim and final hearing, those representing AH asked a number of questions of the public authorities designed to ensure that the Court was in possession of all the evidence it needed to make a final decision. These questions concerned the nature of AH&#8217;s relationships with staff and residents, and her engagement with activities at the placement, and their position on AH&#8217;s best interests for residence and care -which are pretty standard in cases of this sort. However, they also probed into the availability of various types of care package. </span></p>

I have referred to this as &#8220;leave&#8221;- a term borrowed from the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (MHA). What I mean by this is that AH is still subject to the regime at Placement 1, and still subject to the control exercised from there, and liable as a matter of law to be returned there in accordance with the Order of this Court. As part of that arrangement, she is permitted to spend a night- usually one a week- at her own home. This is very important to her. Although she says she is very unhappy at Placement 1, she is in fact enjoying a great deal of her own time. Being able to visit and stay at her own flat are clearly very important to her. Having read the exhibits to the ALR&#8217;s most recent statement, it is very clear that having her own home, even if she is only able to be there some of the time, and only when others permit her to be there, is extremely significant to AH.</span></p>

It provides her with the safety and security of a safe residence where her physical health and compliance with her insulin can be monitored, along with having her own place to enjoy- and over time, no doubt time at home would increase if and when her physical health was seen as more robust.</span></p>

She is able, with that support, to meet her social care needs. She has lived in her flat for about 17 years. She has support throughout the week in the community. She received her treatment (insulin/monitoring) from District Nurses. She came and went as she wished. Unfortunately, there is one need she has which is extremely significant- namely proper and consistent monitoring and regulation of her diabetes. This is where the disengagement (or perhaps inconsistent engagement) occurred leading to that need not being properly met. The consequences were dire- ketoacidosis and significant illness and potential death.</span></p>

As debated during the hearing, the concept of risk has two aspects: first, the likelihood of something happening in certain circumstances and secondly, the seriousness of the consequences if it does. In AH&#8217;s case if she disengages the consequences are likely to be very serious and quite possibly fatal. As far as the likelihood of her disengaging is concerned, she was very clear when she spoke to me that she would ensure she engage in the future. That, however, was subject to the usual qualifications as to how her treatment plan would be decided by her. </span></p>

At that point, it is inevitable that the Applicants may have to adopt a similar approach to the one they have adopted here by seeking the approval of the Court for the use of coercive powers that restrict AH&#8217;s liberty or deprive her of it. As I have already said, that is if she is not unlucky and dies before those steps can be taken.</span></p>

AH is presently safe and well. She is regularly and consistently monitored and treated. This can go on indefinitely. She can remain well. She can continue to develop friendships with people at Placement 1. She can engage in activities there. The alternative is that she can go home. When she disengages, and the word, according to the Applicants is &#8220;when&#8221; and not &#8220;if&#8221;, her &#8220;decline is inevitable&#8221; to quote Mr Fullwood. Once that happens, she may die. Even if she does not die, she will need hospital treatment and then she will be in the same position as she was in March 2022- she will need a specialist placement where she can be monitored and treated.</span></p>
