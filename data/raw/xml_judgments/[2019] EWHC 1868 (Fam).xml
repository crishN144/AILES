There is a very clear and important distinction between a so-called &#8220;forced marriage&#8221; and an &#8220;arranged marriage&#8221;.  The law tolerates arranged marriages and they are lawful.  This case is not concerned in any way whatsoever with arranged marriages or any suggestion of an arranged marriage.  It concerns only a suggestion that there might be, or might have been, a forced marriage. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.07in">I wish to stress and make very clear at the outset of this judgment that forced marriages, when they occur, are a terrible scourge.  Indeed, the very notion of a &#8220;forced marriage&#8221; involves a brutal contradiction in terms.  It is fundamental to any civilised notion of marriage that it is entered into freely and voluntarily, and in the exercise of free will.  Those who do, or may, force others into marriage commit very serious criminal offences which, when proved, are likely to lead to substantial sentences.  Nothing at all which I will shortly say is intended in any way whatsoever to soften the approach of courts, and, indeed, society as a whole, in outlawing and preventing, so far as possible, forced marriages.  However, and having said that, the facts and circumstances of the present case illustrate, in my view, an issue of procedural concern which I have previously encountered in other cases and which needs squarely to be addressed.  That issue is whether the appropriate applicant in cases such as the present is, or should be, the police, or the Foreign and Commonwealth Office through its Forced Marriage Unit (&#8220;FMU&#8221;).  I will return to that issue later. </p>

Over 30 years ago, when he was aged about 24 or 25, a Somali man travelled to this country as a refugee.  He has lived here continuously for the subsequent 30 years and has been, for an appreciable time, a British citizen.  He still lives here now and is in the courtroom as I </p>

They lived together in England and have altogether six children, who range in age from about 30 down to 20.  There are two sons and four daughters.  The present proceedings concern their second daughter and fourth child.  It does seem to be the case that she has had some history of mental ill health or instability which, however, has been treatable and controlled by medication.  </p>

It does seem that there was some involvement by the FMU at that time.  Back in England, M became pregnant by a man whose identity is uncertain and who does not seem to have played any further part in her life.  Before she gave birth to her son, M returned to Somalia.  It is said by her father that she has said that she went back to Somalia to give birth there because she knew that the local authority here in England were expressing concern for the unborn child because of her own history of mental ill health.  So (as many other mothers have done in such circumstances) she travelled abroad before the birth.  At all events, M has remained living ever since in Somalia and her own mother (her father&#8217;s wife) has since travelled to Somalia </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.07in">On 30 April 2019, the Metropolitan Police issued an application in the High Court for leave to apply for a forced marriage protection order, and for such an order.  That application was supported by a witness statement made by a woman detective constable dated 29 April 2019.  The woman detective constable described in her statement how M had previously travelled to Somalia and returned from there in 2017.  She went on to describe that a report had been made to the police by the FMU in December 2018.  The gist of the information received by the police from the FMU was said to be that the FMU had, in turn, received information from a named worker in a Somali charity based in Cardiff.  That information </p>

He has given evidence about his own early history and the composition and structure of his family.  He said that he himself has not been in Somalia since 2016.  He said that his daughter, M, travelled voluntarily and freely to Somalia at a time when she was already fully adult and expecting her first child.  He said that it is not true that she has been forced to marry.  He said that he has spoken to her many times on the telephone.  She has told him the name of the man whom she has married, although the father himself has never met that man nor otherwise heard of him, nor has any knowledge of him or his family.  He said that his daughter, M, has told him that she chose the man herself as her husband; she is living with him as a family; and is now expecting a baby by him which will be her second child.  He said that it is his understanding that the reason why his daughter went to Somalia in 2018 was for fear that the social services might remove her first baby from her after that baby had been born.  He said there had been a number of meetings between her and social workers.   </p>

The first situation is where a marriage has not yet taken place but there is evidence that a person may be forced into a marriage or an attempt may be made to do so.  The second situation, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>A(1)(b), is where a person has already been forced into a marriage.  Clearly, in the situation where a marriage has not yet taken place, a court has to consider and evaluate the degree of risk or likelihood that a forced marriage is threatened, or may take place if not prevented.  Such an evaluation no doubt requires a judgment as to future risk and likelihood, weighing all the known facts and circumstances of the case in point.  There is, frankly, no evidence at all in the present case that there is some risk or likelihood of M being forced into a marriage in the future unless that is prevented.  All the evidence, such as it is, from any available source is to the </p>

The evidence from M&#8217;s father, which I considered to be consistent, credible, and worthy of belief, is all to the effect that M has already married somebody in Somalia.  So the present case falls squarely within paragraph (b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>A(1). </p>

Again, on the balance of probability, it seems to me that there is no sufficient evidence to that standard that the marriage was forced.  All the evidence available to me, apart from that from the father,  is double or triple hearsay from unattributed sources.  I have not even been told the name of the representative at the FMU. </p>

It thus seems to me, on the basis of the available evidence, that, on the balance of probability, the marriage which has taken place is not a forced marriage.   </p>

At one point, she is describing what the FMU has told her that the worker in Cardiff had told the FMU that M had allegedly told the worker in Cardiff.  In other places, she is quoting what the FMU has reported to the police about alleged communication directly between M and the FMU, but there was no attempt to adduce in evidence any statement from the representative of the FMU with whom such communication allegedly took place. </p>

No member of the public has ever made contact with the police on her behalf.  The person or body who contacted the police was the FMU, which is a part of the Foreign and </p>

M is herself a British citizen, and I perfectly understand that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office may consider that it has a duty to protect persons who are British citizens even when, at all material times, that person is already abroad.  I, for my part, cannot see any convincing reason why the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, through its FMU, cannot itself apply to the court for leave to make an application in such circumstances, if the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, one of whose functions is to consider the wellbeing of British citizens abroad, considers that such an application should be made.   </p>

In the first email sent during the morning of 5 April 2019, a woman detective constable in the Metropolitan Police (not the same woman detective constable who subsequently made the witness statements) said to her correspondent at the FMU that: </p>

From reading through all the information the police has, it is believed the police are not the best placed authority to seek this order.  All the information we are receiving has come from the FMU FCO or [the worker in Cardiff], it&#8217;s not first hand information to police.  Social services are concerned for the child and M, as they previously did before she returned to Somalia.  So it seems that they would have an interest in this.  From seeking advice about this, the FMU can seek a forced marriage protection order, is that correct?  Would this not be best for your department to do as you have maintained the contact with M?...&#8221; </p>

When the FMU says &#8220;we don&#8217;t actually have the capability&#8230; unfortunately&#8221; to apply for FMPOs, they presumably mean that they do not currently have the funding or manpower resources to do so.

It is a matter ultimately for the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs to decide how he apportions and distributes the large funding available to him.  But, frankly, this exchange of emails reads to me very clearly, as the police correctly identified, that on the facts and in the circumstances of this case (i.e. in which no complaint had been made directly to, or investigated by, the police) it was not a police matter, at any rate unless and until there was later credible evidence to the effect that a criminal offence had been, or was about to be, committed. </p>

As I have said, I regard the email from the FMU on the afternoon of 5 April 2019 as a very unconvincing attempt to shuffle off responsibility to another.  This has had the very undesirable effect that these proceedings have continued with double or triple hearsay statements from the police who, frankly, have no knowledge of their own about matters at all.  Leave was granted to a body, namely the police, whose connection with the person to be protected and knowledge of her circumstances was much more slender than that of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. </p>

The father is a gentleman who was disabled at a young age by polio.  He is in receipt of disability allowance, which he is able to supplement to a small degree by working as a taxi driver.  His means are very modest indeed.  He has not been shown to have done anything wrong at all, either in relation to his daughter or these proceedings.  He has been forced, out of his own very meagre pocket or borrowings, to obtain funding in order to properly defend and represent himself, and although I have not yet heard the application for costs, it provisionally seems to me that he has a strong basis for asking for costs.  However, there is only one body against whom he could make such an application, namely, the police who are the applicants in these proceedings.   </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Mr Bunce has already trailed an argument that the police should not be held in any way responsible for what has happened since, he submitted, the deputy High Court judge granted leave to apply.  I am afraid that is always a very unconvincing argument, no matter the circumstances in which it is advanced.  In all sorts of situations in the law, far, far removed from forced marriage protection, applications can only be made with the prior leave or permission of the court.  For instance, claims can only be made for judicial review after the court has granted leave.  But if ultimately such a claim is unsuccessful, it is extremely lame, and rarely a defence to an application for costs, that some judge at a short hearing, or on paper, thought it appropriate to grant leave.  So it may yet transpire that, as a result of their somewhat meekly caving in to the email from the FMU on the afternoon of 5 April 2019, the police find themselves picking up a bill for costs which properly ought to lie with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">In my view, the lesson from this case (and this is something that I have experienced before) is that in this class of case, namely, where the proceedings have initially been triggered by the FMU of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and not by some complaint being made directly to the police, the police ought to be much slower before making an application pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>C for leave to apply.  The police should be much more questioning as to whether they are the appropriate applicants.  Further, if such an application is made to the court, the court should, in my view, be more questioning and circumspect than the deputy judge was on this occasion about whether or not it is appropriate to grant leave to the police.  The correct response may well be to refuse leave to the police, but to require a clear message to be sent to the FMU of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that if they remain concerned about a British citizen abroad, it is open to them, or to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, to make their or his own application for leave. </p>
