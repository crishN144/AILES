	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The parties had been married for about 24 years, they had two children. Very tragically, the eldest child of the parties, B, suffers from a genetic abnormality which means her interaction with the outside world is very limited. She requires 24-hour care in the family home, which has been adapted for her needs. Her condition is deteriorating, and her life expectancy limited. This undoubtedly creates a difficult situation for not only her parents, but also her 12 year old sibling, C.  B was represented by the Official Solicitor in the proceedings as there was an issue about her care; initially whether she remained in residential care, more recently whether she remains in the care of her mother or the parents jointly. The mother works as a teaching assistant and the father is a solicitor. The main assets of the parties consisted of the family home (net equity &#163;645,000), an investment property (net equity &#163;268,000/&#163;241,000), savings of &#163;44,000 in the father&#8217;s name and the wife&#8217;s pension.    </p>

The parties had agreed the family home should remain as a home for B, for as long as she needs it. HHJ Tolson Q.C. granted the non-molestation injunction and made orders regarding the father&#8217;s time with B, neither of which is challenged.  </p>

The effect of the order is that the mother could remain in the family home after it was no longer required for B. HHJ Tolson Q.C. justified the departure from an equal division of assets on the basis of a number of factors, including an inheritance from the mother&#8217;s side of the family that contributed to the purchase of the family home, his conclusions as to the father&#8217;s earning capacity, and the needs of C to continue to have the stability of living in the family home. He also satisfied himself that the father&#8217;s needs would still be met. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The court emailed the parties on 30 April to inform them that HHJ Tolson Q.C. had fixed a hearing on 10 May. The hearing was attended by the mother&#8217;s solicitor, Ms Silwal, and the father&#8217;s counsel, Dr Proudman. The transcript of the hearing confirms the correction in the draft judgment for the mother&#8217;s income from &#163;10,000 to &#163;16,700. Dr Proudman also raised the issue of liability for CGT on the transfer to the father of the jointly owned investment property and how the sum of &#163;50 pm payable by the father for B is made; whether it is paid to the mother or into a trust account. HHJ Tolson Q.C. confirmed in relation to the CGT that it will <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;lie where it falls on the order that I&#8217;ve already made&#8217;</span>, when it was drawn to his attention that it would be paid by the mother he said &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">..I was giving effect to your open offer&#8217;.</span>  HHJ Tolson Q.C. refused the application by Dr Proudman for permission to appeal for the reasons set out in his written judgment dated 22 May, this referred to the further representations that had been received by email from the mother&#8217;s solicitor and the father. In that judgment he set out that the changes in the mother&#8217;s income figure did not affect his assessment of the division of capital. In relation to the CGT he acknowledged the judgment was silent on the question of CGT on the investment property but stated that it was clear he was approving the mother&#8217;s open offer and the liability for any CGT should rest with the father. He said he did not accept the CGT figure of &#163;29,000. Mr Feehan now accepts it is, in fact, somewhat less than that figure.  </p>

On 27 March they included the father to file a skeleton argument by 8 April cross referenced to the bundle and judgment limited to 15 pages (inclusive of the schedule of assets used at the trial) and a bundle limited to 150 pages. On 4 April the father emailed the court to say that the skeleton argument needed to be 21 pages and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the size of the bundle is difficult to reduce&#8217;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a reduced bundle will otherwise likely lead to an injustice&#8217;.</span> On the same day Cohen J directed the bundle should be limited only to relevant papers, which are specifically referred to in the skeleton argument or judgment, limiting the skeleton to 20 pages and listing the matter for a permission hearing on 19 June. The Respondent was invited to file by 29 April a concise skeleton argument in reply limited to 8 pages and was not expected to attend the hearing. By order dated 1 May 2019 the time for the Respondent&#8217;s skeleton argument was extended to 24 May 2019. Both parties filed addendum skeleton arguments addressing the additional grounds of appeal in the notice filed in June. </p>

Taking this as a starting point, the father on the commission arrangements disclosed to me will himself receive between &#163;110 and &#163;132 each productive hour. I cannot believe that he spends fewer that four hours a day earning fees based on his hourly rate. That equates to a daily income in the range of &#163;440 to &#163;528. I take the mid-point, &#163;484. Thus his weekly income capacity is not less than &#163;2420. He will be able to work approximately 45 weeks each year. This gives him an approximate gross income of &#163;108,900. I accept it may be much more, but I doubt very much it is less. I must allow for some expenses, but there is no evidence that he runs an office or will have anything more than travelling and other incidental expenses. There is no evidence that he travels far. I assess his earning potential as at least &#163;100,000 before each tax year&#8230;&#8217;. </span></p>

He helpfully referred me to <span style="font-style:italic">NG v SG (Appeal: Non-Disclosure) [2011] EWHC 3270 Fam </span>paragraphs [6] &#8211; [10] and [16] which emphasises the need for any inferences to be properly drawn and reasonable. Mr Feehan submits there is no evidence the father was receiving monies over and above the sums disclosed in the documentation provided by the father.  There was no lifestyle evidence to support a greater income or evidence of additional sums entering the father&#8217;s bank accounts. He submits, as a consequence, the rough and broad-brush calculations undertaken by the judge are not securely founded on any direct or indirect evidence and as a result the finding that the father&#8217;s income is actually in the region of &#163;100,000 per annum is improperly drawn and unreasonable. </p>

The judge&#8217;s finding related to the father&#8217;s earning capacity, which they submit is based on evidence, which included evidence from the husband including (i) his replies to questionnaire with attachments, (ii) the worksheet and email produced by the father on the second day of the hearing and (iii) the father&#8217;s own oral evidence. The father confirmed his hourly rate and his commission. The finding in relation to earning capacity made by the judge was, they submit, based on the number of working hours per week and the judge made a conservative estimate of 4 hours per day. The finding that the father could work more hours was part of the mother&#8217;s case, as put in cross examination of the father which was based in part on an analysis from the document produced by the father on the second day. The father accepted in oral evidence he was not maximising his earning capacity. </p>

The rationale that underpinned the judge&#8217;s finding as to earning capacity was based on the information which largely came from the father either in his oral evidence or the documents produced by him (in the trial bundle and his oral evidence), and the judge&#8217;s analysis to underpin his finding is properly reasoned and founded on evidence that was available to him. It is clear from the judgment the finding related to earning capacity and the judge expressly concluded he was not making any findings about past earnings (see paragraph [19]). He stated he <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;must, however, make some assessment at least of the father&#8217;s earning capacity in order to assess first his ability to re-house himself; and, secondly, the financial reach of the concession made by the mother. Just how much is she foregoing by way of a maintenance claim?&#8217; </span>[19]. The figures used for the analysis undertaken came from the husband&#8217;s oral evidence when he confirmed the hourly rate set out in the documents and described the commission arrangement, depending on who the referral came from. His conclusions about the father&#8217;s earning capacity was one he was fully entitled to reach on the evidence he had available to him. </p>

That consideration together with his analysis of the sharing principle and his reasons for departure, namely the contribution made by the wife&#8217;s family and the capitalisation of her maintenance claim in the context of his assessment as to the husband&#8217;s earning capacity were justified on the evidence. As Mr Feehan realistically accepted in oral submissions a significant part of his submissions on this ground was underpinned by permission to appeal the assessment of the father&#8217;s earning capacity, which I have rejected. Whilst the judge had to re-visit his analysis of the capitalisation of maintenance claims at the hearing on 10 May (due to the error in the mother&#8217;s income), having done so in his judgment dated 22 May he did not consider the division of capital needed to be adjusted. </p>

The issue was considered again by the judge on 10 May and he refused any change to the position. Mr Feehan submits that the way HHJ Tolson Q.C. dealt with this issue supports his contention about apparent bias, as he changed his mind about the liability for the CGT during submissions on 10 May. I do not accept that: in the March judgment he was following the proposals set out in the mother&#8217;s open offer and, when his mistake was drawn to his attention in the May hearing he corrected it, so it remained consistent with his March judgment. </p>

It is a narrow but important point. If matters remain as they are and there has been no time spent by the father with C the only option the father will have to seek to restore his relationship with C in accordance with what was agreed between the parties is to make a fresh application to the court, as there is no obvious route to enforce a recital to an order.  </p>

In oral submissions he drew attention to the two pages of questioning of the father by the judge regarding his income and earnings.  B was admitted to hospital on the afternoon of the second day, when closing submissions were due to be made. Both parents left court to attend the hospital. Mr Feehan submits the judge&#8217;s refusal of Dr Proudman&#8217;s request for an adjournment to enable her to take instructions prior to making submissions only added to the perception of bias against the father. He submits this perception was increased in circumstances where the judge stated at the outset of the submissions made by Dr Proudman that he did not find the father&#8217;s evidence credible. He said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;&#8230;Dr Proudman, the problem is you are going to have to convince me to believe a word your client is saying. That is the problem. I do not often say that in family cases because there is often a lot to be said on both sides but it is not looking good.&#8217;</span> He says a little later <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;So over to you, although I appreciate that is a bit of a short ball&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Having considered the proceedings as a whole I am not satisfied the ground of appeal alleging bias has any realistic prospect of success. The court has the benefit of a transcript of the two-day hearing, as well as the hearing on 10 May. Mr Feehan placed some reliance on the questioning of the father by the judge in relation to his income, stating he was not interested in the father&#8217;s tax returns but sought annual accounts, the requirement for which had been deleted from a previous questionnaire. Those questions need to be looked at in the context of the transcript as a whole and the requirement of parties in proceedings such as these to give full and frank disclosure. The judge&#8217;s intervention was after the father had given extensive evidence on the first day about his income and had then produced a print-out of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the income position from May of last year until now..&#8217;</span> whilst in the witness box on the second day. It was not until the mother&#8217;s counsel had asked a number of questions about his income (covering a number of pages of the transcript) and the document that had been produced did the judge then ask some questions. The cross examination of the mother&#8217;s counsel had suggested that the figures in the print-out appeared to establish that the father worked only a limited number of hours per month, which despite a number of attempts the father seemed unable to properly explain or account for. The judge&#8217;s questions sought to try and understand what underpinned the figures and how that related to the document the father produced on the second day. The father&#8217;s answers were becoming increasingly vague, the following exchanges illustrate the point: </p>

After the conclusion of the evidence and during submissions the judge, in somewhat direct terms, set out his concerns about the father&#8217;s evidence but making it clear his mind remained open, for example by saying to Dr Proudman <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;So over to you, although I appreciate this is a bit of a short ball&#8217;</span>. Additionally, at the conclusion of oral submissions the judge made it clear he would consider any additional written submissions prior to judgment. This all supports the position that he had not closed his mind. The credibility of the parties was clearly an important part of the case and he wanted to make sure the parties, in particular the father bearing in mind his concerns, had every opportunity to put any relevant information in front of the court. </p>

In relation to the former the judge did not just amend the figure he conducted a further exercise calculating the capitalisation of the maintenance loss for the wife to check the overall fairness of his decision. The maintenance order point was covered in the open offer letter, so came as no surprise to the father. </p>
