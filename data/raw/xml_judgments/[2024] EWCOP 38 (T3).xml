	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">KAG is a woman in her late 60s who has, over the course of her adult life, suffered occasional bouts of depression.  In late December 2023 she underwent emergency surgery for a serious condition, which was successful. Sadly, on returning home, KAG developed severe depression which led her to neglect herself, including by not eating or drinking.  She is reported to have lost as much as 20% of her bodyweight as a result, and since the middle of January 2024, she has been cared for in hospital.  There have been two short periods of detention under s.2 MHA, at the end of January and the end of April.  Neither was converted to detention under s.3, as each time, KAG agreed to remain in hospital and to continue to receive treatment.  A nasogastric tube was inserted to provide KAG with clinically assisted nutrition and hydration (CANH) in January 2024, apparently in reliance on the MCA, and without KAG actively objecting.  KAG has also been receiving psychiatric medications.  There has been some improvement in KAG&#8217;s mental health since she was first admitted to hospital, but she is still not eating and drinking enough to keep herself alive, she is very anxious, and her severe depression has not improved to any significant degree.  </p>

She has declined medication at times, and has expressed dissatisfaction with being fed by nasogastric tube.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are a range of practical problems associated with the long-term use of a nasogastric tube to provide CANH, including the need to replace tubes when they reach the end of their life and to re-site them when they become displaced.  It is difficult to ensure adequate provision of CANH because of the delays in administration while tests, x-rays and other ancillary steps are taken out to check that the tube is correctly sited.  Ordinarily, a patient in KAG&#8217;s position facing a need for long-term provision of CANH would have a PEG inserted, to provide a safer, more comfortable and more effective means of administering nutrition and hydration.  In evidence filed with the Trusts&#8217; application, consultant gastroenterologist Dr C explained that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;KAG&#8217;s physiological reserve is deteriorating on account of the length of her admission, reliance on NG feeding and largely untreated severe depression. Should things continue as they are, in terms of KAG's decreased nutritional intake, and depressive illness, there is a risk she will become too frail and unwell to undergo the PEG. With the loss of muscle mass and strength, KAG is at greater risk of aspiration pneumonia from the sedation used to undertake the PEG procedure. She will also be at increased risk of infection around the PEG site and potentially sepsis.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">KAG&#8217;s treating doctors formed the view some weeks ago that she needed admission to a psychiatric hospital under s.3 MHA  and on 3 June 2024, two medical recommendations for admission for treatment were completed.  There was a practical impediment to immediate transfer, namely that the psychiatric units would not take a patient being fed by nasogastric tube, as they did not have the nursing expertise required to manage that method of provision of CANH.   The Trusts were of the opinion that the insertion of a PEG was clinically appropriate for the reasons I have summarised, and that it could be carried out once KAG was detained under s.3 MHA and before her transfer to the psychiatric unit by application of the powers given to the responsible clinician under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref> MHA, which permit treatment for a mental disorder or its symptoms to be given irrespective of whether the patient consents to that treatment. </p>

The Trusts wrote a long letter to the local authority on 17 June explaining the legal framework and inviting them to agree to progress the s.3 admission, including by applying to displace Mr G as KAG&#8217;s nearest relative pursuant to s.29 MHA, as at that time Mr G was objecting to the admission. The Trusts explained that if the local authority did not agree, then they would make an application to the High Court (not the Court of Protection).</p>

The lawyer at the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office who picked up the enquiry responded setting out that he was inclined to the view, on the basis of the very limited information provided, that such an application would not be one which related to serious medical treatment in the terms of the Vice President&#8217;s Guidance &#8211; that question being relevant to the manner in which the Official Solicitor would obtain and fund representation for KAG if she were joined as a party to the proceedings. The Trusts later confirmed that the eligibility issue was not a serious medical treatment question, but noted that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">in the unlikely event&#8217; </span>the court found KAG to be eligible to be deprived of her liberty pursuant to the MCA, then the court would be invited to determine the PEG issue.</p>

KAG was a party to those proceedings but did not have a litigation friend: the Official Solicitor had been invited to act as litigation friend by order dated 21 June 2024, on the basis that there was reason to believe KAG lacked capacity to conduct the proceedings, but by 27 June, she had not accepted the invitation as there was no security for her costs. </p>

The Trusts had however sought a review of that deprivation of liberty on the basis that KAG was no longer eligible, given her increasing objections to her treatment.   A solicitor &#8211; Mr Z - who had apparently been approached by KAG and Mr G in connection with the displacement proceedings attended the hearing in those proceedings on 27 June and was apparently permitted to address the court, despite not being KAG&#8217;s litigation friend, and not, it seems, having taken instructions from KAG directly.  It appears that the Mr Z was intending to receive instructions from the Official Solicitor once appointed in the displacement proceedings.  Mr Z informed the court that he had spoken to caseworkers at the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office that day, and that the Official Solicitor&#8217;s view was that the question of whether a PEG should be inserted was a serious medical treatment issue that needed to be decided by the Court of Protection.  The Circuit Judge says in her judgment that:</p>

The emails that had passed between the Trusts and the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office, and which had been seen by Mr Z and the local authority, do not express any opinion on whether an application was required to the Court of Protection or any other court.  It seems that Mr Z spoke to a different lawyer at the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office on the 27 June, and Mr Z reported that the second lawyer, in consultation with the first lawyer, had said that an application to the Court of Protection was required and that the displacement proceedings should be stayed while further consideration was given to whether the PEG was in KAG&#8217;s best interests.  There is no note of the conversation between the lawyer at the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office and Mr Z.  I am told by Mr Brownhill who appears on behalf of the Official Solicitor for KAG that Mr Z&#8217;s account of the conversation as set out by the Circuit Judge is not accepted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Official Solicitor&#8217;s very clear position at this hearing was that the insertion of a PEG to provide CANH for a patient like KAG whose refusal to eat is a manifestation of her mental disorder falls clearly within the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.145</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref> and no court application is required.  If there were uncertainty as to whether the PEG insertion did fall within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref>/<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.145</ref>, because there was a dispute as to whether it was treatment for mental disorder within the meaning of those provisions, then an application should be brought by the detaining Trust for a declaration under the inherent jurisdiction, having first detained the patient pursuant to s.3 MHA.  But if there was no such uncertainty and the issue in respect of the PEG insertion was that the patient or a family member objected to it, then the appropriate remedy was judicial review by the patient, acting if necessary through a litigation friend. There was no legal requirement nor expectation of good practice, that where a patient detained under s.3 MHA objected to treatment that was proposed to be given to them under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref>, the detaining Trust should bring the matter before any court (whether the High Court or the Court of Protection) for determination. </p>

The AMHP rightly determined that the MHA was the correct legal framework to provide treatment to KAG for her mental disorder, including the provision of CANH, and that is the framework that should have been applied.

The Official Solicitor did not object to the court making a declaration of lawfulness in the exceptional circumstances of this case, but did not expect similar applications to be made in future.  This judgment should not be taken as any sort of encouragement to statutory bodies to seek the court&#8217;s intervention where there is no uncertainty on the part of a treating Trust as to whether treatment can be provided under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.145</ref> MHA, even in the face of objection by a patient. </p>

The difference makes sense because the MHA is a statutory scheme for, inter alia, detention and compulsory treatment in the public interest, where the responsible clinician has a specific role in the statutory scheme. There is no statutory process in the MHA to question the decision of the clinician.

Equally, it is clear to me that it is now in her interests for CANH to be administered by way of PEG rather than nasogastric tube.  As I have previously set out, a PEG will be less risky, more comfortable and more effective. It is reversible, and KAG will be able to eat and drink normally while it is in place should she wish. While the operation to insert the PEG has the potential to be an unpleasant experience, sedating medication will be given, and it will only last for around 10 minutes. Once in place, KAG will be able to move to a suitable therapeutic environment where she can receive the treatment she needs for her mental disorder.  Dr A was clear that this was simply not possible in her current hospital which is not a psychiatric hospital. Although KAG is fearful of the procedure, it is the only realistic option to maintain her physical health and to help her to get through this period of depression, as she has in the past.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the proceedings were issued in the Court of Protection, the central issue has been determined under the inherent jurisdiction.  Under the Court of Protection Rules 2017, the starting point for costs would be that each party bears their own costs as these proceedings concern health and welfare.  Under the inherent jurisdiction, the Civil Procedure Rules apply.  The CPR provide for a general discretion as to costs, but where cases concern a vulnerable adult, the approach taken tends to be aligned to the Court of Protection welfare jurisdiction (see further <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">T v L (Inherent Jurisdiction: Costs</span>) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2021/2147" uk:canonical="[2021] EWHC 2147 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWHC 2147 (Fam)</ref>).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, all the statutory bodies were put in a very difficult position by events at the hearing on 27 June, and in particular by Mr Z&#8217;s report that the clear view of the Official Solicitor was that a further court application was necessary. This court did not hear from Mr Z or have any evidence as to what his understanding was of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s preliminary views<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>  It might have been possible to clear up the confusion that had evidently arisen through correspondence with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office. I have not seen any evidence that the suggestion of further liaison with the Official Solicitor to clarify her position was made by the Trusts to the local authority at the time, or that the Trusts themselves tried again to ascertain the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position prior to issuing their application. I am not surprised by that, as neither the local authority nor the Trusts would have had particular reason to think that Mr Z had fundamentally misunderstood or misreported the Official Solicitor&#8217;s views.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">While it is no doubt correct that had the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position as set out at this hearing been provided to the statutory bodies at an earlier stage, this application would not have been needed, I am not persuaded that either the local authority or the Trusts can properly be criticised for not having attempted to obtain further clarification in the circumstances. Nor can I see a basis for blaming the local authority for the confusion that arose in respect of the preliminary view of the Official Solicitor as to the necessity of a court application in respect of a medical treatment decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that the fair order in the circumstances is that the statutory bodies share the costs of bringing these proceedings.  This was an unusual case with a complex procedural background, which resulted in a stalemate that had to be broken, to further KAG&#8217;s interests.  An application to the court was the most obvious way to achieve that goal given what Mr Z had reported was the position of the Official Solicitor on 27 June 2024. All the statutory bodies necessarily needed to be parties to that application given their roles in respect of KAG&#8217;s care and treatment and having regard to the framework of the MHA.  The local authority has already agreed to pay 50% of the applicants&#8217; 50% contribution to the Official Solicitor&#8217;s.  I will order that the local authority should also pay 50% of the costs of the Trusts occasioned by this application.  I am treating both Trusts as one for the purpose of sharing the costs burden, as the Trusts have been jointly represented throughout.</p>
