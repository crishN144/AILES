In this country, the first without notice hearing was held on 25 November 2021 in front of Russell DBE J.  Disclosure orders were made against the Secretary of State for Education and the Health and Social Care Information Centre.  Directions were also given for the matter to be listed for a first directions hearing for summary resolution on 13 December 2021 and a prohibited steps order was granted prohibiting the applicant and the respondent from removing Y from the United Kingdom pending the determination of the proceedings or further order.

X stated that she sought to defend the summary return and it was ordered by the judge that day, HHJ Matthews QC (sitting as a Judge of the High Court), that the port alerts should remain in place and continue until the conclusion of the next hearing.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The pertinent law around the Hague Convention 1980 is settled in its vital architecture and not in dispute between parties.  In very short order, by way of essential legal context, I would add here that the deep philosophy and explicitly stated objects of the Convention are unmistakable: the summary return of children taken from their country of habitual residence to another country, or retained there, without the consent of the left-behind parent or person with rights of custody. The Preamble to the Convention makes plain the vice it is designed to combat:</p>

W agreed that while their daughter was in England in the summer of 2021, she should explore whether she wanted to live permanently in the UK.  It went well and, therefore, X and Y spoke to the father in a telephone call around 25 June.  In that call, he consented to Y&#8217;s wish to live permanently in England.  Thus, there was no wrongful retention, but even if there was a wrongful retention, Y&#8217;s habitual residence changed to England.  She had attained some degree of integration very quickly in the UK and thus, Art.3 is not engaged.  Further, W acquiesced and did not enforce his rights of custody promptly in respect of his daughter.  If Y was returned to Italy, she would be exposed to the grave risk of emotional and psychological harm and that is due not only to the fact that she does not want to go back to Italy, but because of the risk of deterioration in X&#8217;s mental health.  X has been diagnosed with having depression and she is also at risk of becoming suicidal in adverse circumstances in Italy.  In any event, a return would expose Y to the grave risk of being placed in an intolerable situation.  There is no adequate housing for Y and X and the package of protective measures offered by W do not adequately meet the risks in this case. </p>

When, on 30 June 2021, X applied for settled status in the United Kingdom, this was a repudiatory retention.  Immediately before that retention, Y&#8217;s habitual residence was in Italy.  It had not changed.  Thus, Art.3 is engaged. W did not acquiesce, but acted promptly to enforce his rights of custody.  He reported Y&#8217;s retention in England to the police in Italy twice in September and then made a complaint to the central authority in Italy in October and issued proceedings in November.  However, he did not know for sure about X&#8217;s plan to keep Y in the United Kingdom because she was deceiving him constantly.  It was when Y did not return for the new Italian school year in September that W understood what was actually happening.  X had strung him along all the way through the summer.</p>

However, W will fund a studio or one-bedroomed flat, if necessary, until the case comes before the Italian court.  That is the correct court.

Let me begin by saying something about Ms Dunlop, the Cafcass officer.  The report of Ms Dunlop was considered by the court but not in its full, original form.  That is because there were parts that were hotly disputed by X.  Ms Dunlop was not available to give evidence and there was no indication when, or indeed whether, she would become available to testify again.  In the circumstances, I judged that the fairest approach was for X to have those parts of the reports that she disputed excised from the court&#8217;s consideration and I have completely ignored those sections.</p>

It is important that she has her medication.  If she does not have access to medication, there is what the doctor called &#8220;a severe risk of deterioration&#8221;.  She said that social stability is very important.  If X faces homelessness, then the risk of recovery is very small and there is a risk of deterioration.  Her daughter is an important protective factor and caring for her daughter is important to X.  The loss of her daughter therefore would be a trigger.  Recovery depends not only on medication but social stability and support, and access to medication.  Those are the mitigating factors, but if those are not present, then the prognosis for X is poor.</p>

However, the doctor said she appeared to have what the doctor called &#8220;an important and good network for her&#8221;.  That included her brother, her mother, and her aunties as she called them.  She told the doctor that she would spend sometimes weekends with her brother and this is a very supportive relationship.</p>

W gave evidence over several days in a fragmented way due to the timings of the case.  He came across as a forceful person.  I can readily accept that he can lose his temper and be angry and shout as X and, indeed, Y have said.  There were serious technical difficulties with the connection to Italy.  At times, the picture froze and the audio feed would not work.  It was all most frustrating, but we were able to hear and receive his evidence.  So I take into account those difficulties, but I found W to be a very frustrating witness.  Frequently, he did not answer the question and that happened even when the question was repeated to him and he was told to listen.  Sometimes, he did not.  He spoke over counsel and interrupted counsel.  He accused Miss Cabeza, who was asking questions entirely properly, of being rude.  She was not.  He is not an easy person to be in a relationship with as a partner, I can fully appreciate.  However, the essential question for the court, in terms of his evidence, is whether he was telling the truth or not. </p>

However, that allegation could not be sustained because as he immediately replied in evidence, he had gone to the police the week before.  Indeed, the court directed counsel to the case chronology at p.10 of the bundle that shows that, indeed, W had reported matters to the police on both 18 and 23 September as he had said.  So this allegation could not be right.  It might be seen, subject to other evidence I have to go through, as X searching for an alternative explanation for W&#8217;s actions other than him not having agreed to his daughter living in England and wanting her back.</p>

The problem with this submission, it strikes me, is that he had already reported matters to the police in Italy.  It is hard to understand why this report to the central authority would be differently motivated in mid-October to the reports to the police on 18 and 23 September.  He was accused of having deleted important messages and indeed, as I have pointed out, at various points in the record of messages which were downloaded on his phone, it says &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">media omessi</span>&#8221;.  The interpreter states that this means &#8220;media omitted&#8221;.  There is no evidence in front of me that media means the same as messages.  It is just as consistent with media files such as photographs being omitted.  I cannot possibly find, in the absence of expert assistance, that this means that messages, that is text messages, have been deleted.  It is speculative in both directions and the court cannot and must not do that. W did say that he had deleted some offensive messages he had received from X.  He said that he deleted these in September because, as he put it:</p>

This subsequent deterioration is consistent with the fact that Y had not come back to Italy in September.  Therefore, it is by no means clear that deleted messages would appear as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">media omessi</span>&#8221; as opposed to simply being absent from the record that was downloaded from his phone, i.e. the IT technician or expert he used in Italy.  As I have already indicated, W says that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">omessi</span>&#8221; is different from &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">cancellata</span>&#8221; which is &#8220;deleted&#8221;.

The reason is that if one looks at the time, there are approximately twenty &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">omessi</span>&#8221; entries all having the same timestamp of 20:38.  Without being conclusive, that points to the media files that the software could not reproduce in the record were, in fact, what was omitted.  As indicated, this is a matter of expert evidence, but I am far from persuaded that these entries indicate text messages deleted by W.  This is particularly so considering again, just by way of example, these 20:38 entries, these are entries from X&#8217;s West African phone.  These would not therefore be admissions by W that he wanted Y to stay in England.  Indeed, the very next day on 2 September, he is noting with apparent concern that Y was returning to school in England and he asks when she will be coming back to Italy.</p>

In fact, the opposite is what is indicated by the totality of the WhatsApp messages.  What it looks like is that when he gave his phone to the IT expert to download the WhatsApp content, the tool was not able to format and replicate certain media files, but I cannot make a finding in either direction without technical or expert support.

X has failed to do that on the basis of the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">media omessi</span>&#8221; point but, as ever, there is other evidence that casts light on the truth which is a signpost to what actually happened.  There is a message from W on 19 September at p.177 of the bundle which I have already mentioned.  This is the message saying that the right thing was for her to have returned to Italy two or three days before 10 September.  That may well be 12 or 13 September, which is the start of the Italian school year, but what is significant is what he said about it:</p>

Then there is the message on 17 June where X reminds &#8220;everyone&#8221;, at that is what it says in the message, that she sent in to renew the registration for school meals in Italy.  The renewal element strikes me as being important as it indicates that as at that date, 17 June, the plan is for Y to be at school in Italy for the new term, the school year having ended, enabling Y to come to this country in summer.  It is hard to understand how this message sent by X, even if she was just forwarding someone else&#8217;s message to W, is consistent with an intention to live in England. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, there is a message about putting a deposit for the school, even though it is only a few euros, in or around August.  All these point to the fact that W was telling the truth when he said that he did not consent to Y living in England and there was no agreement or plan to the contrary &#8211; there is nothing in the messages anything like that.  Instead, we have his acts of going to the police in September when Y was not returned for the Italian academic year.  We have his going to the central authority in October to progress matters.  There are contemporaneous messages consistent with the expectation that Y will be returned to school in Italy.  There is no message whatsoever to indicate that Y likes England and wants to stay here so the plan had evolved into her staying permanently in this country.  It makes little sense to suppose there were messages of consent and permission indicating that he consented to her relocating to England permanently interspersed with all the documented plans for her to attend next school term in Italy and W&#8217;s message on 19 September indicates that X should have brought her back two or three days before school started.  Therefore, I find that his evidence about this particular topic, whilst he gave it often in a hectoring and sometimes unhelpful way, not answering questions directly, is completely consistent with the contemporaneous records of the WhatsApp messaging.  </p>

I am bound to say that there is an affable and charming side to X, but also a calculating side.  She did not answer questions directly and plausibly at times.

This struck me as extremely unlikely that a shop in Italy in C would have lists of English school textbooks which could be ordered.  &#8220;II&#8221; is a person who owned a shop, it appears, in C which was pointed out to her.  It was only then that she accepted that this was about Italian school books.  Frankly, she was forced to have to accept it, but her answers were important because they showed she was not being honest with the court.  These steps to secure Italian textbooks are inconsistent with what she asserts, that was that there was an agreed plan for her and Y to try living in England to see if they like it.

However, this call that she has, I am completely satisfied, invented had to be before her application to the Home Office on 30 June 2021 for settled status under the EU settlement scheme and that is the function of this suggestion on the 25 June call which X has no doubt chosen with great care to fix the date there.  It is to fit in with WhatsApp messages in the settled status application.  I remind myself of <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span>.

There is no messaging suggesting she was surprised that he wanted his daughter back in Italy.  She explains that by the fact that what he said on the phone, which is not evidenced, was different to what he was saying in the messaging, which is evidenced.  This is implausible and I reject her account.  She was attempting, it is quite obvious, to keep him in the dark about her intentions and my reading of the messages is that she was leading him to believe that she would bring Y back in time for the Italian new school year.  She was fobbing him off and therefore delaying matters and, all the while, seeking to deepen Y&#8217;s roots in the United Kingdom which would make a return more difficult.  This appears to be the plan that X was developing.  It has been very carefully orchestrated and Y has been deceived about her actual intentions for months. </p>

This firmly supports his case that what X had agreed with him was a stay during the summer and nothing more but, of course, by this date on 19 September, he had, in fact, made a complaint to the police in Italy.  That was on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, the day before.  He would make a further complaint on the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>.  He said that he deleted offensive and rude messages from her later in their communications in September and I accept that.  All the messages before the court are consistent with W&#8217;s case and most of them to the extent that they touch upon Y and schooling are inconsistent with X&#8217;s case.  </p>

Having found that W did not consent to Y&#8217;s permanent relocation to the United Kingdom, I consider the application of 30 June for settled status.  Miss Cabeza realistically accepts if there was no consent from W, the application would constitute an overt act that would be a repudiation of his rights of custody.  Thus, for <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> purposes, she concedes it would be a repudiatory retention (<span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Re C and Another (Children) (International Centre for Family Law, Policy and Practice Intervening)</span><span style="color:#000000"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2018] 1 FLR 861" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] 1 FLR 861</ref>).</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There are three features that emerge from the judgment of Lord Hughes.  First, a subjective intent by the travelling parent.  I find that X had the intent to retain Y in the United Kingdom contrary to W&#8217;s rights of custody.  Second, an overt act.  I find that X acted inconsistently with W&#8217;s rights of custody by applying for settlement in the United Kingdom.  Third, there is no need for the overt act to be communicated to the left behind parent.  Here, I find it was not but that does not alter the fact of the repudiation.  Thus, I find there was a repudiatory retention on 30 June 2021.  There was a fundamental breach of W&#8217;s rights of custody.  Thus, Art.3 of the Hague Convention 1980 is engaged.  I do not therefore need to go on to consider other later wrongful retention dates postulated by the parties but I stress that if I had, I would have found that there was a wrongful retention at the latest by the start of the Italian school term which took place at the latest on 13 September 2021.</p>

Having heard evidence from both parties, I strongly prefer W&#8217;s evidence on this point.  That is because I must look at all the evidence together and the WhatsApp messages make it clear that W believed that Y would return to Italy for the school term in September.  It was agreed between the parties that Y&#8217;s habitual residence as at her departure from Italy on 11 June was, indeed, Italy.  It could not possibly be otherwise.  She was born in Italy.  She is an Italian national.  She has an Italian passport.  She has lived all her life in Italy.  Her father is Italian.  She spoke to him in Italian, as he does not speak English, and her mother is an Italian national although she is also a national, it seems, of her country of origin in West Africa.  Y went to an Italian school.  She was taught in Italian.  Her father&#8217;s family is in Italy.  She has a maternal grandmother and uncle and cousins in Italy along with two friends that her mother considers to be aunties.  They all live in and near C where Y was born and lived.  With this background, it seems to me inconceivable that between 11 June and 30 June her habitual residence changed from Italy to the United Kingdom.</p>

Mother&#8217;s intentions may have been to keep Y in England, but this was against her father&#8217;s wishes, I have found, and the intention of the wrongfully retaining parent is not determinative, as Hayden J pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B </span>[2016] EWHC 21 74 (Fam).

It would be artificial to deem them close friends within a couple of weeks, although I accept she is likely to have developed friendships.  I acknowledge that habitual residence can indeed change quickly, and X was busy taking steps to strengthen Y&#8217;s integration into life in England, I have not the slightest doubt, to make the argument that Y was, indeed, integrated sufficiently into life in England so that her habitual residence had changed. However, I judge it had not.  One only has to think of the entirety of her life and her deep roots in Italy at that point, almost eight years, and contrast that with less than three weeks in England where Y had only just started attending school.  By any rational and reasonable measure, her habitual residence had not changed by 30 June. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The consequences of this are far-reaching.  The Hague Convention 1980 cases are fundamentally about jurisdiction.  Which court should make decisions about the child&#8217;s welfare and future?  The prime yardstick of jurisdiction under the Convention is habitual residence.  As at 30 June 2021, Y&#8217;s habitual residence still was Italy.  Thus, the Italian courts have jurisdiction to make decisions about her future subject to any exceptions that are established to the requisite standard, and it is to these I will turn.  Should an exception be proved by X, the court then has to conduct a discretionary exercise as to whether or not there should be a summary return.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I briefly consider the alternative and what would have been the position should the date of wrongful retention be the term start date in Italy on 13 September.  It is unquestionably the case that X&#8217;s argument about a change of habitual residence by 13 September is stronger.  However, it is not unassailable or irrefutable.  The presence of Y in England was, I am entirely satisfied, by fraud, deception, and subterfuge.  It was entirely contrary to the wishes of the father.  I still have to weigh the almost eight years of her life in Italy against the three months in England achieved through lies and deceit.  I take into account that the preponderance of X&#8217;s family remained in Italy rather than these relatives in England.  Her mother, the child&#8217;s grandmother, was in Italy, although she travelled backwards and forwards to West Africa.  The mother&#8217;s brother was in Italy.  Those people Y had grown up with were in Italy, save for her mother who was now with her in England.  Again, Lord Wilson&#8217;s precept is significant.  There is likely to be a slower change of habitual residence if the degree of integration in the previous state was profound and deeply rooted.  I find that Y&#8217;s integration in Italy was, indeed, very deep and it would take more than the twelve weeks from mid-June to mid-September to dislodge it, despite the undoubted efforts of X.</p>

One only has to think of the WhatsApp message on 19 September where he is telling her that she should have brought Y back to Italy.  X could have been in no doubt that he wanted his daughter back in Italy.  On 2 September, he specifically asked her when that was going to happen. </p>

This is puzzling because the allegation has now attained real significance for her case.  I reject it as self-serving and untrue.  Thus, the acquiescence exception is not proved by X.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, there are a number of routes by which X submits that Y is at grave risk of being exposed to psychological harm.  First, the separation from the mother.  Although W has contributed to the care of Y, I have no doubt that X is the primary caregiver.  I also find that if Y was separated from her mother, this may cause Y psychological harm.  X&#8217;s case originally was that she would not return to Italy.  For example, in her position statement filed at the outset of this trial, Miss Cabeza stated at para.14(a) that:</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I will deal with intolerability later, but this separation is simply not going to happen before this case comes in front of an Italian court because during her evidence, when X was asked about this, she accepted that, in fact, she would go back to Italy with her daughter.  That was because, as she put it, her daughter needed her mother as she grew up.  Although W states that Y could live with him if a return was ordered, given what has happened since arriving in England, I do consider that it is better for Y in the interim not to be separated from X.  Dr Ratnam has said as much, and I accept her evidence on this.  Therefore, without prejudging intolerability and child objections, if there were a return, it should be on the basis that Y stays with her mother in Italy until the Italian court becomes seized of and makes welfare decisions about living arrangements and contact.</p>

The way it came across in Dr Ratnam&#8217;s report is rather different from how X presented it in evidence.  What she is actually concerned about is that if she did not get her antidepressant medication in Italy and she did not get psychological support if she needed it, she would start to have bad thoughts, as she put it, with the stress of the return and that may lead her to think about suicide.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I assess that there is not a real as opposed to a fanciful risk of suicide here.  I take into account the precept that where one is considering serious outcomes and serious harm, the issue does not require that there is a serious risk of it.  You can have a relevant risk of a catastrophic outcome, but in this case, there is no history of any suicide attempt.  As Dr Ratnam has explained, X does not have the suicidal intent.  There is no history of self-harm.  Dr Ratnam explained that self-harm typically related to a coping mechanism or emotional relief for people with personality disorders and there is no evidence to suggest that X does have a personality disorder.  The fact that she has no history of previously attempting to kill herself is, it seems to me, significant.  Dr Ratnam clarified that X lacked intent even when she did not have the benefit of medication.  This was a vital factor in Dr Ratnam&#8217;s estimation because X has made no plans to end her life.  Dr Ratnam concluded that the risks could be mitigated by medication, that having her daughter with X was a crucial protective factor, and creating living arrangements that reduced stresses on X would also reduce the risks.  This is where protective measures are important and I will come to those shortly.</p>

I am asked to consider X&#8217;s fears that W will hurt her or kill her.  Miss Cabeza accepts there is no objective foundation for these suggestions, but it is a question of X&#8217;s subjective belief.  This court must take X&#8217;s case at its highest but not where it lies against the weight of other evidence.  There is no suggestion whatsoever that W has ever threatened or used physical violence.  I place very little weight on X&#8217;s professed subjective belief that upon her return, he would hurt her or kill her.  It appears to me so implausible to be self-serving and strategic.  At para.53 of his statement at p.158 of the bundle, W gives an undertaking not to remove Y from her mother&#8217;s care.  That undertaking significantly reduces the risk of psychological deterioration by X.  </p>

It is frankly implausible to believe that it would not be possible for X to receive antidepressant medication in Italy.  Further, while there is no clear evidence as to the precise cost, I find it inconceivable that if X is looking after a child and was diagnosed in Italy with mental health problems, and deemed to be in need of antidepressant medication, that the cost would be prohibitively expensive so that she would not receive it.  X disputed that the citalopram would cost &#8364;3.  She stated it would cost &#8364;8.  That, it seems to me, is not excessive nor out of her reach.  </p>

It is the case that, medication aside, she is not getting any therapeutic support in the United Kingdom presently.  Ms Renton asserted by way of the most cursory Google search that Italy has one of the best healthcare systems in the world.  I repeatedly informed counsel that this case should not degenerate into a trial by search engine or Google.  So, with great respect, I do not rely on Ms Renton&#8217;s research.  These are summary proceedings and I put those suggestions completely to one side.  That said, I am perfectly satisfied that X would be able to be prescribed antidepressant medication as necessary in Italy and that she would be able to afford the cost of them, particularly if she was working as she has worked in England, and as she has worked in Italy, and/or if W makes a financial contribution until the Italian court is seized, or both.</p>

What was telling is what Dr Ratnam concluded that even when X was depressed and without medication, it had not affected the care she was able to provide Y.  That is most definitely to X&#8217;s credit, but it gives a real and telling context to the risks here.</p>

This must include the undertaking of W not to remove Y from X&#8217;s care and his provision of living expenses, the details of which I will come to.

Neither could bring any such case to the court&#8217;s attention.  Frankly, I am not surprised.  As I have indicated, these are summary proceedings.  It would not be proportionate to insist upon such expert evidence and the delay that it would entail.  There were no previous orders by experienced judges that this should happen.  I am invited to proceed on the basis of W&#8217;s undertakings save for those on finances being enforceable in Italy under the 1996 Convention.  For example, monetary undertakings are explicitly excluded and I will deal with those separately.</p>

The father says there is no accommodation difficulty: X can live with Y at her mother&#8217;s (the grandmother&#8217;s) house in C.  This a three bedroomed house but the bedrooms are occupied by guests, one by a couple and with two individual residents.  They are X&#8217;s mother&#8217;s tenants.  The grandmother lives there too but she lives in the living room.  The kitchen and bathroom are all shared by the residents.  Thus, if X and Y live there, they would have to share with four other people. </p>

She has a loving relationship with her mother, with her brother, and her two aunts.  The idea that X would be homeless and destitute should she return to Italy with Y is implausible.  I am completely convinced that this close family wound undoubtedly rally round.  For example, X has had holidays abroad in the past.  Money for the holidays in West Africa, Sweden, and Austria was found.  When she was asked where the money came from, she said she was given that money for her travels by family.  If this is true, it appears, contrary to what she told the court, there is disposable income if needed, or there could be, yet she stated that she had asked her family if they would help financially upon her return and they allegedly said they would not.  The explanation for their refusal to help someone who they love, and Y whom they also love, was that X could work in England and so why would she come back.  </p>

It is entirely possible that W would be required to contribute more than he proposes.  If it were not possible for the accommodation at the grandmother&#8217;s to continue, then the Italian court would without question fully explore other solutions if it is agreed that there should not be separation from X which would be a matter for the Italian court once seized.

I am clear that this court should not seek to interfere with the decisions of the Italian court should return be ordered.  However, what this court must do and, to this extent, Miss Cabeza is correct, is that in these summary proceedings this court must do its best to ensure that the situation on return is a safe and appropriate one, a soft and safe landing.  But once the Italian court is seized, it must be free to make its own decisions about a child who is an Italian citizen and should never have been retained in England in the first place.  However, I am sympathetic to the submission, largely conceded by Ms Renton that this court should deem a lump sum payable sufficient for living and, if necessary, accommodation expenses that X can access until the Italian court makes its decisions.  </p>

As I have indicated, I find that it would be possible, certainly for the first few weeks, for X and Y to live at the grandmother&#8217;s house.  That would not place Y in an intolerable situation with a grave risk of it.  It is submitted on behalf of X that Y has not shared facilities with other people before and there is no desk for studying.  But whilst being sympathetic, one cannot be too precious about these things.  At one point in her evidence, when X was being asked about what would be a reasonable accommodation solution, she stated on oath that she would &#8220;go for&#8221; the two bedroomed option.

I do take her views seriously.  She has expressed them forcibly in the letter to the court outlined at the start of the judgment and also to Ms Dunlop.  Y has been in the United Kingdom for a year now.  She has nearly completed an academic year in England as well as part of the summer term last year.  She has made friends.  She has some wider members of her family here, &#8220;cousins&#8221; as she calls them, and her mother wishes to stay here to have a better life in England for both of them.

As indicated, she has changed her stance.  So it is not going to be an issue of Y having to return to Italy without her mother.  I have indicated that there should not be a separation between mother and daughter until the Italian court decides the issue in either direction.  Thus, any harm from separation does not feature in the discretionary balance and W has given an undertaking not to remove Y from X&#8217;s care.  Of course, it does not stop the father from making any applications he would wish to the Italian court.  Although W has cared for Y and contributed to her care all her life, I accept that he is not the primary caregiver.  Thus, the undertaking he has given not to remove Y from X on an interim basis is an important factor in the discretionary evaluation.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There was the issue of domestic abuse.  This court will never minimise the significance of domestic abuse.  Both X and Y have said that W shouted at the mother.  Although, as Ms Renton points out, Y also says in her letter that she is aware of the parents&#8217; shouting at each other.  While I must take X&#8217;s case at its highest, where possible, that is not where it is inherently weak or implausible.  It must at all times be seen in the context of the other evidence.  As previously noted, there is no suggestion of physical violence in the past.  In the WhatsApp messages, X refers to W at times as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">caro</span>&#8221; or &#8220;dear&#8221;.  It seems hard to understand how that term of endearment would be used if he had been abusive towards her to the extent that she had grounds to fear for her life or from being physically harmed by him, as she claims.  However, as I have emphasised, this court takes domestic abuse seriously and recognises fully that it is a complex matter.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This is not a case where there have been separate allegations of domestic abuse upon which parties have invited the court to make findings.  I have to look at matters in the round and do the best that the court can do.  The critical feature, and I do take into account the wider and more sophisticated understanding that courts fortunately have nowadays about coercion and control, but the critical feature is that until the Italian court is seized, in no circumstances would X be living with W.  Thus, her encounters would be limited to handovers at contact and this significantly reduces the impact of any concern about harm to X.  The managed contact will undoubtedly occur through the Italian courts in due course and that is a factor in favour of return.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is axiomatic that it is better unless the contrary is proved that Y should have the close involvement of both her parents in her life.  Indeed, Ms Dunlop speaks about the importance of that point.  Y speaks about her father being kind.  He has been involved in her life from her birth, being present at the hospital.  He does sometimes help her with her schoolwork, albeit as X puts it on a scale of ten, only at two.  However, he works to support this family.  It is hard to criticise him for financially supporting X and Y through his hard work and thus being less available to help her with homework when she gets back from school because he works until 5.30.  I accept his account that he spends time with Y and takes her to the park and to other places to have fun, as he puts it.  I accept that he used to look after his daughter when her mother was out working as a cleaner.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">What is revealing is how Y communicated with him in the WhatsApp messages.  On p.168 of the bundle, there is an exchange of messages between W and his daughter.  It is dated 14 September, the day after the Italian term should have started.  He tells her how he misses her and how various pets miss her.  She replies, &#8220;I miss you very much&#8221; and then there is a heart emoji.  This does provide insight into the true nature of the relationship between Y and her father.  The need to have a father being part of her life is important and it is important for Y to see him regularly.  That is a factor in favour of return.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I also have concerns that should Y and her father live in different countries in future, there would be difficulties in both his seeing her regularly and also speaking to her.  X was not supportive of Y&#8217;s relationship with her father.  He was forced to seek an interim contact order in this court.  The WhatsApp messaging indicates that he was becoming frustrated with the lack of contact with Y.  This is unfortunate, especially, as the messaging demonstrates, that she told the father that she missed him.  This is a material context to view the strength of her objection to Italy and that is a separate head.  I take into account what Ms Dunlop said about Y&#8217;s maturity and due to Y&#8217;s age, her finding it hard to understand the implications of her wishes to be in England, in particular in respect of her relationship with her father as she grows older.  That diminishes the weight I attach to her wishes.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a father she has lived with all her life prior to the trip to England and retention.  I have re-read Y&#8217;s letter at p.201 of the bundle.  She may speak English at home to her mother but there is certainly an artificiality of the language in the letter.  She says that her life would be &#8220;ruined&#8221; and it is &#8220;glorious and splendid&#8221; in England.  This language is very surprising for a 7-year-old child born in Italy and schooled in Italian, and whose father speaks no English.  One of the factors of Black LJ (as she then was) identifies in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> is whether the child has been influenced or coached by the retaining parent.  I am not satisfied that the language Y uses in the letter is authentic and spontaneous for such a 7-year-old child, but I cannot find that this language has been deliberately coached.  However, it does bear the stamp of an adult&#8217;s influence.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">When she was interviewed, she had been with her mother for some six months and had not seen her father.  She was upset with her father because she was being prevented from going to Africa.  Police had attended the home and had removed documents.  She knew her mother did not want to return to Italy.  This causes me to reduce the weight I place on the objections of Y to some extent, but emphasise that I do not reject them altogether.  They must and do have some weight with this court.  Y said that she would be upset and angry if she had to go back to Italy.  This may be the case, certainly in the short term, but there is no evidence of any lasting serious emotional impact that is likely to accrue to Y should the court order summary return.  Thus, there is no evidence that she would not be able to resume her life which she had experienced exclusively almost eight years before her removal to England.</p>

As I have indicated, there would be limited face-to-face contact and I also harbour concerns about the extent that there would be at other types of contact promoted by X.  The reason I say that is that in the WhatsApp messaging there are a number of complaints by W that X has not facilitated contact between him and Y.</p>

I do not hold W responsible for this.  I find that he complained promptly about retention to the police in September and then to the central authority in October but he was deceived by X for several months.  There have been procedural delays but they are not the fault of W.  In the February hearing, there was an adjournment so that X could be assessed by an intermediary.  W cannot be criticised for that.  However, one must take into account the fact that Y has now grown more accustomed to England and thus it will be a bigger wrench to return to Italy.  However, I find that would not be an insurmountable problem for her.</p>

Racism is always serious and unpleasant, but one has to consider how much confidence one could have about there not being a single racist incident in the United Kingdom in the almost eight years of Y&#8217;s life if she had grown up here.  Further, I cannot accept X&#8217;s claims of isolation in Italy.  She chose to go to Italy to join her mother there.  C is plainly a multicultural city.  As W states, X has family there.  There are people, indeed, in X&#8217;s mother&#8217;s house who are not only from her country of origin but from other African nations.  It is not possible in these family proceedings for the court to conclude that there would be less racism in Britain rather than Italy.  Racism, regrettably, is a real feature of British society also.  One mentions such facts of life with a heavy heart but I place no weight on this objection by X.</p>

Her father is an Italian national and speaks no English and has had to use an interpreter for these hearings.  X came to join her mother in about 2006.  She has an Italian passport.  She worked, albeit part time, from time to time in Italy and she had post office accounts of her own in Italy.  Looking at the network, I consider, first, the paternal family who live in Italy and then X&#8217;s family in Italy which I have already detailed.  This, of course, was the reason she came to Italy from West Africa because her mother has a business in C exporting and importing African goods to Italy.  However, X&#8217;s brother lives in Italy in C.  He has children who are therefore Y&#8217;s first cousins.  There are the aunts in the area who are very close both to X and to Y.</p>

However, it strikes me that in terms of closeness of relationship, it is certainly not as strong as the connections that X had to her direct family in Italy. </p>

Although I have found that the psychological harm exception is not proved, I still proceed to consider the impact on her mental health for the purposes of discretion.  Dr Ratnam could not predict the exact degree of deterioration if she had to return to Italy.  She mentioned important mitigating factors, such as medication.  If it is taken consistently, it would be more effective and it would promote recovery and reduce the risk of mental health deterioration.  There can be an adjustment of the dosage.  It could increase to 30 mg or doubled to 40 and that should result in an improvement of the symptoms of depression, but the doctor said that the normal practice is to adjust it and then to review it judiciously because one does not want to increase medication to levels that are unnecessary.</p>

It is not clear what the cost is but, as I have indicated, I do not regard it as being something that is completely out of the reach of X.  I do not accept that she would be homeless in the sense of being destitute on the streets but I have considered in the intolerability section the prospect of interim accommodation and the impact upon both Y and X.  It strikes me that there is no evidence to speculate about exactly what the Italian court will do.  That is not the purpose of these proceedings.  However, the court must make sure that when Y goes back, if that is the decision, that it is to a situation that is manageable and that it is not intolerable.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">What struck me, as X gave her evidence, was that she showed a different side to herself.  She was feisty and robust, surprisingly self-composed, and confident when she wished to be, and was able to stand her ground and make a point.  All of this was when she was being questioned by very experienced counsel.  It frankly was as though there were two people in the witness box.  The timid and tearful X at the outset of the evidence and then another person who was far more confident and assertive later on.  It strikes me she would be able to make a significant contribution to representing herself in Italy in proceedings in front of the Italian court if that was necessary, but I do not speculate about whether or not funding is going to be possible and, on this, I proceed on the basis of what X says, that she could not afford an Italian lawyer.  That being said, in proceedings in this jurisdiction, frequently parents do represent themselves.  The most important factor that strikes me in terms of the impact of return and discretion is the fact that Y is going to be with her mother until the Italian court makes its own decisions.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I consider lastly the Hague policy considerations.  There is a delay of a year since Y left Italy.  That renders the swift return imperative of the Hague Convention less pressing, although I do not completely ignore the policy.  This is because the court has concluded that X has deliberately retained Y in the United Kingdom and it was wrongful.  She used deception and subterfuge.  The policy of deterring such blatant acts and unlawful interference with the customary rights of another parent must weigh in the court&#8217;s evaluation.  It is not to punish X.  It is to assert the policy and object of this vital convention designed to reduce the harm to children from wrongful abduction and removal. </p>

The risk of deterioration in X&#8217;s mental health upon return is materially and significantly mitigated by having adequate safeguarding arrangements in place.  Her condition is likely to improve with consistent medication.  It is significant that Dr Ratnam did not recommend even any increase in dosage and felt that the regularisation of taking the antidepressants would improve the symptoms of that depression.  That is a very good indicator of the range and level of risk in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">X has moderate depression.  It can be improved by the regular taking of antidepressants.  All of this is important in the exercise of discretion and points in favour of a return rather than refusing return.  That is because the impact of return can be properly managed medically through support networks and through proper arrangements.  What is important is that even when X was depressed and before she took the medication, her condition did not affect her parenting of her daughter.  There will not be a significant or serious impact on X&#8217;s welfare if a return is ordered.  The subjective child will cope; she will adjust; she will return to life in Italy, even though she will be cross and frustrated at first.  However, I am persuaded that this will pass particularly with the support of both parents and her Italian family.  </p>

However, equally, and an inseparable part of that welfare, is the right to have a meaningful relationship with a father she regards as kind and whom she misses.  I conclude that the factors in favour of return very significantly outweigh the factors of Y remaining in the United Kingdom.  Here is a wrongful retention perpetrated through systematic, prolonged, and premeditated deceit.  The court must deter such matters.  There are positive welfare advantages to a return to Italy, particularly the ability for Y to see her father regularly as dictated ultimately by the Italian court.  I find the home court in Italy is in the ideal position to determine these issues.  This is an issue about Italian nationals and the Italian court should have jurisdiction to resolve it.  This is precisely what the policy and objective of the Hague Convention 1980 is directed at. </p>
