The former is an issue which commonly arises in these cases.  The latter is an issue which, so far as I am aware, has not been previously considered in family proceedings hitherto.</span></p>

Then, according to the mother, in the early hours of the morning of 27 May, he woke up crying and became floppy with red fluid coming out of his nose.  The mother called an ambulance and the baby was taken to hospital.</span></p>

H was taken for a CT scan which revealed that he had sustained a significant intracranial bleed, namely a left-sided subdural haematoma with subarachnoid haemorrhage and associated subfalcine herniation with a midline shift to the right, right-sided unilaterally descending transtentorial herniation and partial effacement of the basal cisterns. In the course of the hearing this week, I have had occasion to consider this CT scan during the course of Mr Richards&#8217; evidence which I will turn to later, and it is obvious even to the layman that the injury sustained by the child, as demonstrated on the CT scan, was extremely serious.</span></p>

He became cardiovascularly unstable with pauses in his breathing and was therefore intubated and ventilated and he has remained intubated ever since.</span></p>

A further CT scan revealed further deterioration and it was therefore decided that he should undergo emergency neurosurgery.  He underwent a left craniotomy and evacuation of the subdural haematoma.  During the course of the surgery, however, severe brain swelling ensued and he became haemodynamically unstable with significant brain herniation through the meninges and at the opening of the skull where the surgeon was operating.  He required extensive treatment, particularly blood transfusions and infusions of adrenalin and noradrenaline.  At that point, his pupils became fixed and dilated and he was measured as having very high intracranial pressure.  Following the surgery, he was transferred back to the paediatric intensive care unit, was again intubated and ventilated and has remained in that unit ever since.</span></p>

By this stage, it was the view of the doctors that one explanation was that he had sustained an acceleration/deceleration-type injury.  Brain tissue continued to herniate through the craniotomy site.  Further CT scans revealed ischemia and infarct on both sides with cerebral herniation through the craniotomy. The neurosurgeon responsible for the case, Mr Z, confirmed the extensive nature of the damage.  There was no sign of brainstem function.  The parents were warned of a very poor prognosis and consideration was then given to the prospect of withdrawing treatment.  However, the parents indicated strong opposition to that course. On 1 June, an MRI scan was carried out and it was noted that the left hemispheric craniotomy bone flap, i.e. the flap that had been left following the operation, was lifting and that the brain was herniating through the gap.  There was further damage noted to the lateral ventricle and other signs of severe damage.</span></p>

The injuries sustained by H were thought to be consistent with non-accidental head injury.  The mother, who had been the only person present when the child collapsed, came under suspicion.  She was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, interviewed and then released on bail subject to conditions which included a condition that she should have no contact with any child under the age of 18, save under the supervision of the Local&#160;Authority.</span></p>

H was opening his eyes and moving all four limbs.  At that point, he was also breathing.  However, as has been the position throughout his admission, there was no sign of the cough or gag reflex save for two very faint coughs observed by one member of the nursing staff.  Thus, it seemed at that stage that his position may have stabilised with some small signs of improvement.  Overall, however, the picture remained very bleak. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The doctors considered the possibility of withdrawing treatment but at that point they postponed that course.  Meanwhile, however, the parents, concerned that the doctors might be wanting to withdraw treatment, had instructed solicitors and on 6 June they applied to this Court for an order under the inherent jurisdiction restraining the doctors from taking a course which would result in the withdrawal of treatment and, in particular, extubation.  That application came before me on that day sitting as the urgent applications&#8217; judge on short notice to the hospital Trust.  Prior to the hearing, I telephoned Cafcass Legal and spoke to one of the solicitors there, Mr&#160;Ford.  At the hearing, I made an order making H a ward of the Court and directed the Trust not to withdraw life support or any other sustaining or supporting treatment, including extubation, until the matter had been considered at a full hearing. I made a further direction for a hearing to take place before me on 12 June.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On that date, when the matter came before me, I had the initial evidence from the hospital, including reports from the treating clinicians and a second opinion from another doctor at another hospital trust, the St George&#8217;s University Hospital NHS Trust, namely Mr Gray.  At that stage, as I have said, there was a slight improvement or at least a stabilisation in H&#8217;s position.  I therefore made a further order that the Trust should not withdraw treatment for the time being and I further directed the Trust to remove a &#8216;do not resuscitate notice&#8217; which had been placed in effect. I listed the matter for a further pre-trial review on 29 June and a final hearing for two days on 6 July and 7 July and gave case management directions for those hearings.  In particular, I directed the Trust to file an application setting out the declarations which it sought in the proceedings.  It will be recalled that the proceedings had in fact been started, unusually in my experience, by the parents.  I further directed that the parties should have permission to instruct an independent expert, namely Mr Peter Richards, consultant neurosurgeon, until recently employed at the John&#160;Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, to provide an independent opinion.

The application for a reporting restriction order had indeed been filed but had not been served in time to give the media sufficient notice. At that stage, I therefore adjourned that issue until the start of the final hearing on 6 July.  The hearings up to that point, which had not involved any substantive consideration of the issues, had been held in chambers but it was acknowledged that the final hearing, which would, of course, involve decisions concerning serious medical treatment of a child, should be heard in open court and therefore the issue of the terms of any reporting restriction order would have to be considered, at the latest, at that point.</span></p>

However, the overall neurological prognosis remains extremely poor in terms of function with a significant impairment expected in motor ability, control and co-ordination, the ability to feed, manage his own secretions, cognition, vision and the ability to communicate.  We cannot predict how long H will survive with extubation because of his abnormal neurological function.  However, in the event of a deterioration following extubation, it would not be in his best interests to be placed back on the ventilator as this would not result in any change in his prognosis and would promote continued suffering&#8217;.</span></p>

In addition, he has continued to suffer dystonic episodes increasing in scale under which his body, and in particular his limbs, go rigid for up to a minute.  His blood pressure rises and his heart rate rises, sometimes dramatically.  It is now clear, in a way that it was perhaps not clear last week, that this internal bleeding is indeed intracranial.  The evidence for that is the very large swelling on the left side of his head, around the site of the craniotomy wound, and now extending down the left side of his face.  This is caused by blood oozing from his brain and the subdural space through the surgery wound into a space underneath the skin.  </span></p>

He does not respond to touch or pain.  &#8216;It is not possible&#8217;, said Dr E, &#8216;to say what exactly he feels.  In other words, we cannot exactly analyse how he perceives pain.  We simply don't know&#8217;.  As Dr E explained when cross-examined by Mr Devereux, QC, on behalf of the mother:</span></p>

It is impossible for him to be touched without suffering these dystonic episodes.  Every time he is given basic care, he suffers a dystonic episode.  As he's intubated, the basic care and monitoring tasks have to be undertaken more frequently, so he is being touched more frequently and therefore experiences these dystonic episodes more frequently&#8217;.  </span></p>

If he does not, he will die of suffocation. If he does breathe, he will survive for a little longer but because he has no cough or gag reflex, he will aspirate food or vomit, (and he is being fed nasogastrically as I have said), and/or he will aspirate secretions and he will either choke as a result or suffer infections.</span></p>

If he remains intubated, on the other hand, he will also soon die, in Dr E&#8217;s opinion, as a result of his brain infarction or an infection as a result of the continued episodes of bleeding or raised intracranial pressure.  Ultimately, he would sustain what Dr E called &#8216;a catastrophic brain event&#8217;.  Meanwhile, the swelling in his head and face will continue to enlarge so far as it can, as the liquid finds space to go.  Dr E described this as a grim and grotesque situation.</span></p>

Dr E thought it likely that he would breathe after extubation but that he would, for the reasons explained above, suffer one or more respiratory complications so that he would die within a short period.

Dr E described repeated transfusions of the sort that H has received in the last few days as degrading and intrusive.  Repeated blood transfusions caused a number of further problems.  He therefore recommended the withdrawal of the ventilation tube and the cessation of blood transfusions.  He recommended that H should continue to be given palliative care and medicine by the specialist team.</span></p>

In his oral evidence, he reiterated this observation and said that had he been asked to treat H prior to his retirement, he would have taken exactly the same course as taken by the neurosurgical team in this case and he would have been proud if the patient had received treatment of the standard which H has received in this case. Mr Richards noted that this was a very difficult surgical procedure in which the surgeon was confronted with herniation of the brain through the meninges in the skull.  Mr Richards confirmed the very severe extent of the injuries, in particular the significant hypoxic change and the loss of definition of the basal system, and the lake of cerebral spinal fluid in the base of the brain. Mr Richards observed that, when this feature is seen so early after a head injury, it is usually associated with a very poor prognosis.  Treatment post-surgery had followed the conventional course but, at the time of his own examination, there had been no progress in terms of his brainstem function.  He also noted the absence of any real evidence of a cough or gag reflex.</span></p>

He advised that he had yet to encounter long-term survival from this type of neurological impaired state in circumstances such as in this case.  Mr Richards therefore advised in his report that it was appropriate to minimise the baby&#8217;s suffering by removing the tube and not replacing it.</span></p>

Mr Richards said frankly that it was clear that H is going to die and the question therefore was which course would cause him the least suffering for the rest of his life.  He recommended switching the whole emphasis to ensuring that he is comfortable and passes away in what he described as &#8216;the nicest, kindest way&#8217;, both for H and, he added, for his watching parents. He recommended both extubation and also the cessation of blood transfusions and, importantly, applying appropriate palliative care and treatment in order to meet those aims.  If no blood transfusions are given, he confirmed, when cross-examined by Ms Fottrell, H would eventually become anaemic and die.</span></p>

It is important to stress that the reference is to the views and opinions of the parents. Their own wishes, however understandable in human terms, are wholly irrelevant to consideration of the objective best interests of the child save to the extent in any given case that they may illuminate the quality and value to the child of the child/parent relationship&#8217;.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus, the inevitable outcome in this case is that this poor little boy is going to die.  The question for this court, in effect, is how he should be treated in the days remaining for him, in his best interests.  Since there is, on the medical evidence, no prospect of his survival and since he is, as I am advised, in a minimally conscious state with no awareness of his circumstances, from which he is not going to emerge, there is manifestly no benefit in merely keeping him alive for as long as possible, given the indignity, pain and suffering which he is currently enduring.  His best interests, therefore, manifestly require that he be treated in whatever way provides him with the greatest degree of composure, comfort and dignity in the last few days of his life.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I consider, therefore, the balancing exercise in this case.  On the one hand, all the medical evidence is unanimous.  H is, sadly, tragically, going to die very soon.  If he remains intubated and undergoing blood transfusions, the swelling in his head and face will continue to expand, he will continue to suffer episodes of dystonia, and he will die in due course as a result of a catastrophic event, involving brain haemorrhage or the complications associated with his head injury, the infarction, and/or infection, and raised intracranial pressure.  I accept that by keeping him intubated, he may survive for a little longer, but I also accept Dr. E&#8217;s assessment that such a course would be grim and grotesque.</p>

The right to life is, of course, a vitally important consideration and I bear that in mind at all times.

In a statement filed in support of the application, Mr Boyce, the Trust&#8217;s solicitor, stated that the order had been sought and supported by the Trust because of the very real concerns on the part of the Trust&#8217;s team that any publicity or reporting of the case was likely to add to the considerable distress of H&#8217;s family at this very difficult time.  There is nothing particularly newsworthy about the identity of H or his immediate family.  They are not public figures or celebrities.  He submitted that it was appropriate for the order to be extended to restrict identification of the Trust and the treating clinicians.  He submitted that, if the Trust was identified, this would lead to anyone in the unit being able to identify H as the patient.  Press interest may also impact on the care being given to H and other patients and relatives, and he contended that intense media interest can sometimes create difficult challenges for staff and relatives, causing them to be concerned about patient security and confidentiality when they should be focusing on the well-being of patients.</p>

They suggest that the public might well have the impression that the Charlie Gard case is exceptional when, in fact, it is not.  These cases occur not infrequently.

I also conclude that it is necessary, given the particular sensitivities of this case at this particular time, with the acute pressure on the parents, the great difficulties for the hospital staff and the ongoing possibility of criminal proceedings, for the order to extend at this point to include protecting the identification of the hospital and the doctors involved.</span></p>

I do acknowledge that the publicity of the name of the child may increase the amount of publicity generated in any individual case.  The Charlie Gard case is but one example of that, as is the case of Ashya King, but those were cases in which the parents wanted publicity and the judgment in those cases was that the publicity would not be contrary to the child&#8217;s interest or article 8 rights.  Neither of those factors apply here.  In practice, in most cases of this sort, both in the Family Division and in the Court of Protection, when the Court is considering applications for orders concerning serious medical treatment, the identity of the child in the family jurisdiction, or of the incapacitated adult in proceedings in the Court of Protection, and of his or her relatives is protected.  In my judgement, it is important in this case that the identity of this child, his parents, the Trust and the medical staff are, at this stage, protected and kept confidential, at least during the life of the child.  I consider that to be manifestly a proportionate decision.  </span></p>

If, however, the death has, by this time, been considered suspicious, the SIO must, where possible, be consulted before a parent/carer is allowed to hold the child.  If the carer wishes to hold the child during the process of taking an account, the welfare of the police investigator is to be considered as it can be very distracting and therefore less conducive to a careful and detailed conversation&#8221;.</span></p>

He described the process which usually occurs in the very sad circumstances of the death of a child.  Usually, if a child is extubated, that takes place where the child is either in the mother&#8217;s arms or possibly the father&#8217;s arms or in the cot.  If it happens in the cot, the child is then usually given to the mother or father.  There is always a nurse and doctor present when extubation takes place.  If the child is then passing away, the nurse and doctor are usually present.  At the point when the child passes, the nurse and doctor may leave the child with the parents for a short period and then return before declaring the child has died.  In cases where there is suspicion as to the cause of death or cause of the injuries sustained by the child, the nurse and/or doctor will remain present at all times.</span></p>

No skeletal survey had been carried out because of the serious condition of the child but he anticipated that, in the event of a post-mortem examination, such a skeletal survey would be carried out.  Importantly, he confirmed that such a skeletal survey would provide an indication of whether bone injuries had been sustained by the child.  He confirmed that the survey would demonstrate any injuries and, furthermore, when approximately they were sustained. &#160;In particular, it would be possible from the survey to demonstrate whether a bone injury had been sustained prior to the child&#8217;s admission to hospital or at any later point. In those circumstances, he could not envisage that anything could be done to the child&#8217;s body so as to contaminate the situation by handing the child to the mother after extubation both before and after death provided, of course, that the child and parents were in the presence of a nurse or a member of staff.
