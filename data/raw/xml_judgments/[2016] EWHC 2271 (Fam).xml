	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have before me two cases which raise important cross-border issues as between England and Scotland in relation to the making of secure accommodation orders. Put very shortly there are three questions: (1) Can a judge in England make a secure accommodation order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> if the child is to be placed in a unit in Scotland? (2) If not, can the same outcome be achieved by use of the inherent <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction of the High Court? (3) In either case, will the order made by the English judge be recognised and enforced in Scotland? For the reasons which I now proceed to set out in some detail, the answers to these three questions are, in my judgment, respectively, (1) No, (2) Yes and (3) No. A subsidiary issue arises in relation to paragraph 19 of Schedule 2 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. There are the same three questions. In my judgment the answers are the same.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These particular issues arise because of the shortage of places in secure accommodation units in England, so that local authorities and courts in England, particularly in the north of England, whether on the Northern Circuit or the North-Eastern Circuit, look to making use of available places in secure accommodation units in Scotland. Precise data are not available, but such material (including anecdotal material) as exists suggests that there have been at least five such cases.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I propose in this judgment to be very sparing about the facts. I am concerned with two children, a girl aged 16, who I shall refer to as X, and a boy aged 15, who I shall refer to as Y. They live in the areas of two different local authorities: in the case of X, Cumbria County Council; in the case of Y, Blackpool Borough Council. Both have difficulties; each, in their different ways, met the criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> (see below). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the case of X, Cumbria County Council had begun care proceedings in April 2015. An interim care order was made the same month. Because of their complexity, and because the nature of the proceedings changed mid-course, it proved impossible to comply with the 26-week requirement. By an order dated 9 May 2016 the proceedings were listed for final hearing on 24 August 2016. X&#8217;s behaviour deteriorated. On 18 June 2016 (a Saturday), a secure accommodation order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> was made by Her Honour Judge Forrester, authorising Cumbria County Council to keep X in secure accommodation until 24 June 2016. The only available unit was in Scotland. Judge Forrester was conscious that this raised jurisdictional issues and was aware that Moylan J was due to hear Y&#8217;s case on 22 June 2016 (see below), which is why she time-limited the order and listed the case for hearing on 24 June 2016. On 23 June 2016, following the outcome of the hearing the day before in Y&#8217;s case, Cumbria County Council issued an application seeking authority under the inherent jurisdiction to continue X&#8217;s placement in Scotland. On 24 June 2016 Judge Forrester made an order which, reciting that she was satisfied (a) that the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(1)</ref>(a)(i) and (ii) and (b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> were met and (b) that the criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> were met, gave Cumbria County Council permission to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and ordered that X be placed in secure accommodation at the unit in Scotland until 17:00 on 29 July 2016. Judge Forrester listed the matter for further consideration before me on 28 July 2016. The same day Judge Forrester made an order in the care proceedings, directing that they be listed for further directions as soon as practicable following 29 July 2016. (In the event, the hearing on 24 August 2016 subsequently had to be vacated.)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the case of Y, Blackpool Borough Council had begun care proceedings in February 2016. An interim care order was made the same month. During May 2016, Y&#8217;s behaviour deteriorated. On 16 June 2016, Blackpool Borough Council issued an application seeking authority under the inherent jurisdiction to place Y in secure accommodation in Scotland, there being no available unit in England. His Honour Judge Duggan made an order approving the placement on the basis, as the order recorded, of the court finding that the local authority &#8220;could place [Y] in secure accommodation in Scotland for a period of less than one month pending assessment of his level of understanding under the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/33/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(8)</ref>(a)&#8221; of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. He adjourned the application under the inherent jurisdiction for hearing on 22 June 2016. The matter came before Moylan J on 22 June 2016. He made an order which, reciting that he was satisfied (a) that the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(1)</ref>(a)(i) and (ii) and (b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> were met and (b) that the criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> were met, gave Blackpool Borough Council permission to invoke the inherent jurisdiction and ordered that Y be placed in secure accommodation at a unit in Scotland until 17:00 on 29 July 2016.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both matters came before me on 28 July 2016. Both local authorities were represented by Ms Julia Cheetham QC and Mr Michael Jones. X&#8217;s guardian was represented by Mr Simon Rowbotham. X was also, separately, represented by Ms Susan Grocott QC and Ms Rebecca Gregg. Y&#8217;s guardian was represented by Ms Grocott and Ms Alison Woodward. I had the benefit of detailed skeleton arguments and sustained oral argument addressing the very difficult jurisdictional issues which, it was apparent, arise in such cases. By the end of the hearing I had come to the provisional conclusion that (a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> does not enable the court to make a secure accommodation order in relation to a placement in Scotland but that (b) such a placement could, in an appropriate case, be authorised under the inherent jurisdiction. I made orders under the inherent jurisdiction authorising X and Y to continue to be placed in their respective units in Scotland until 17:00 on 1 September 2016. I directed that both matters were to be listed for further hearing before me on 1 September 2016.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In accordance with that direction the case came back before me on 1 September 2016. The representation was the same as on the previous occasion. By then, preparation of this judgment was far advanced. I informed the parties that I had come to the clear and concluded view that (a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> does not enable the court to make a secure accommodation order in relation to a placement in Scotland, that (b) such a placement could, in an appropriate case, be authorised under the inherent jurisdiction, but that (c) there was, so far as I could see, no mechanism for any such order to be recognised or enforced in Scotland absent some order of the Court of Session, if indeed such an order could in fact be made. So too in relation to paragraph 19 of Schedule 2 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.       </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was clear that X needed to remain in secure accommodation. I therefore extended the order under the inherent jurisdiction I had made on 28 July 2016 until 17:00 on 15 September 2016. It was apparent that Y had done well in secure accommodation and was ready for a &#8216;step-down&#8217; move to suitable residential non-secure accommodation, also in Scotland. I therefore made an order under the inherent jurisdiction authorising Blackpool Borough Council to maintain Y in that placement until a date to be confirmed at the next hearing before me, which I fixed for 15 September 2016. I also re-allocated both sets of care proceedings to me, though directing that they were to remain in the Family Court. </p>

		<p class="FootnoteText"><span/><marker name="tab"/>The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, although held by the Crown, are not part of the United Kingdom and have their own separate jurisdictions. </p>
	      </authorialNote> there are three separate legal jurisdictions, in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Northern Ireland. England and Wales, although one jurisdiction, have separate systems of law in certain areas, including family law. Putting matters very generally, so far as concerns family law, the law in Northern Ireland tends to be very similar to the law in England, while the law in Scotland tends to be rather different. Cross-border family law issues arising between England and its three neighbours within the United Kingdom therefore engage three different types of legal relationship: between England and Northern Ireland the relationship is between separate jurisdictions with very similar systems of law; between England and Scotland the relationship is between separate jurisdictions with rather different systems of law; between England and Wales the relationship is between two different parts of the same jurisdiction with systems of law which differ in certain respects.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As will be appreciated, there are always two aspects to a cross-border issue such as the one I am concerned with here. Can the court in country A (in the present case, England) make an order to take effect in country B (in this case, Scotland)? If so, will such an order be recognised and enforced in country B (Scotland)? The first question is to be determined by the law of country A (England); the second is one to be determined by the law of country B (Scotland). For an English judge, the content of the law of England (including the English law relating to private international law, the conflict of laws) is a matter of law, to be ascertained in the light of legal argument. For an English judge, the content of the law of a foreign country, here Scotland (including the Scottish law relating to private international law) is a matter of fact, to be ascertained in the light of expert evidence.</p>

Let it be assumed that a Scottish court, acting lawfully and within its jurisdiction, makes an order directing a child to be placed in secure accommodation in England. What if the child, having been removed to England, attempts unsuccessfully to escape, and is then detained in England and returned to the secure accommodation by an English police officer? If, in the course of the melee, the child assaults the police officer, is the child guilty of assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty? What return does the manager of the secure accommodation make if the child sues in the Divisional Court for a writ of habeas corpus? Is the order of the Scottish court a good return to the writ? Would it make any difference if the relevant order was of the Supreme Court of Ruritania? And, if so, why?</p>

Nothing in the provisions of section 198 of the 2014 Act or in the 2016 Regulations confines the regulation-making power, or the effect of regulation 86, to Wales, to the exclusion of England. Although Mr Rowbotham comments that there is no clear basis for accepting the proposition that the words &#8220;in England&#8221; should take effect outside Wales, no-one has articulated before me any specific argument that these amendments to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> do not apply in England or as a matter of English, as distinct from Welsh, law.

Secondly, unless dispensed with in accordance with paragraph 19(4), the consent of the child is required, and the child&#8217;s consent cannot be dispensed with unless &#8220;the court is satisfied that the child does not have sufficient understanding to give or withhold his consent,&#8221; and even then only if the child is to live &#8220;with a parent, guardian, special guardian, or other suitable person&#8221; &#8211; wording which, in my judgment, and notwithstanding Mr Rowbotham&#8217;s submissions to the contrary, cannot include being placed in an institution such as a secure accommodation unit. &#8220;Person&#8221; here does not, in my judgment, extend to a corporate or other organisation or body.

I reject Ms Grocott&#8217;s submission that the existence of the statutory regime under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of itself suffices to take the case outside <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100(4)</ref>. The order which the local authority is applying for in a case such as this is an order authorising the placement of a child in secure accommodation outside the jurisdiction, and that is not, within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100(4)</ref>(a), a &#8220;result&#8221; which the local authority is able to achieve by means of an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, nor is it, within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100(5)</ref>(b), an &#8220;order&#8221; which the local authority is &#8220;entitled to apply for&#8221; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref>. Nor, in my judgment, despite Ms Grocott&#8217;s submissions to the contrary, does it make any difference that the local authority would not be seeking to have recourse to the inherent jurisdiction but for the absence of a place in a secure unit within the jurisdiction. The fact is that, for whatever reason, the local authority is seeking a result which cannot be achieved by any means other than the inherent jurisdiction. So, in my judgment, sub-section (4)(a) is no obstacle. And in the nature of things, if a child requires to be placed in secure accommodation or under restraint there is not going to be any difficulty in demonstrating that the requirement in sub-section (4)(b) is satisfied.</p>

He identified these as being (i) that the child must be being looked after by the local authority, (ii) that the proposed accommodation must be provided for the purpose of restricting liberty (ie, must be secure accommodation in the statutory sense) and (iii) that the proposed accommodation, if a children&#8217;s home, must be approved by the Secretary of State. (To these one must presumably now add (iv) that the proposed accommodation must be in England.) I need not follow Laing into the further stages of his analysis. It suffices for present purposes to note his proposition that, if one or more of the gateway criteria cannot be met, use of the inherent jurisdiction is in principle permissible. </p>

In the main proceedings, the child opposed the judicial decision ordering her placement in such an institution because she was, against her will, deprived of her liberty. The referring court states, moreover, that if S.C. were to abscond from the secure care institution where she is placed the assistance of the United Kingdom authorities would be required in order to take her back by force to that institution, for her own protection.</p>

In the circumstances, there was insufficient time for counsel to develop these submissions. The jurisdiction to make mirror orders, whilst well established and in common use in cases of child abduction, has not hitherto been used as a means of recognising foreign orders in respect of medical treatment and in my judgment the ramifications of using it in this context requires careful consideration. Having concluded that this case does fall within Brussels IIA, I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to say anything further about the use of mirror orders as a freestanding remedy for the recognition and enforcement of foreign orders falling outside the regulation. I agree that, in urgent cases, a mirror order can be used &#8211; as in this case &#8211; for the short term recognition and enforcement of an order pending registration under Part 31, but the question whether such orders could be made to provide for indefinite or long term recognition and enforcement of foreign orders falling outside Brussels IIA is an issue to be considered on another occasion.&#8221;</p>

In such an application, orders might be sought which would effectively authorise measures taken on the basis of the orders made in England in these cases, and in particular detention in secure accommodation. This would be a novel use of the remedy and it would be a matter for the Inner House of the Court of Session as to whether it was prepared to declare the detention of English children in Scottish secure accommodation pursuant to orders made under the inherent jurisdiction of the English High Court lawful &#8230; </p>

Once the outcome of that application is known, the matters can be listed again before me to determine what should be done in the light of the Court of Session&#8217;s judgment. One important question which will have to be considered at that stage, in the event that the Court of Session declines to exercise the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span> and does not identify any other basis for recognition and enforcement in Scotland of a secure accommodation order made by the English court under the inherent jurisdiction, is whether it is appropriate for the English court to be making such an order at all in those circumstances. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one further topic which will require consideration both in the High Court and, if I may respectfully suggest, in the Court of Session. Because we are here in an area governed by Article 5 of the Convention, and because Article 5 requires any deprivation of liberty to be subject to regular judicial monitoring and review, there is a potentially difficult question whether in a case such as this that judicial function should be vested in the English court, or in the Scottish court or in some way jointly in both courts. It would be premature for me to express any view on a point which has not yet been argued in front of me and which will benefit from knowing (if possible) what the view is of the Court of Session. I observe merely that, on the one side, there is the argument that the court best suited to this role is the court &#8211; the English court &#8211; which is seised of the on-going care proceedings, and which therefore has responsibility for every aspect of X and Y&#8217;s welfare; on the other side, there is the argument that the court best suited to this role is the court &#8211; the Scottish court &#8211; which, in the final analysis, has the responsibility of enforcing the secure accommodation orders, if need be by the use of coercion: consider the analysis of the CJEU in the passage in the <span style="font-style:italic">HSE case</span>, para 113, set out in paragraph 54 above.</p>

I certainly do not propose to make any definitive pronouncement here on a point which, as Baker J justly observes, has ramifications requiring careful consideration, and which, moreover, has not been the subject of any argument before me. I say only that the idea that the inherent jurisdiction extends to permit the use of mirror orders as what Baker J calls a freestanding remedy for the recognition and enforcement of foreign orders has obvious attraction; and that it is not at all obvious why the only context in which such orders should be made is that where they are already, as Baker J puts it, so well established and in such common use, namely in cases of child abduction. If the court has jurisdiction, as it undoubtedly has, in one context, then why not in others?    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other matter relates to the fact that, as I observed in paragraph 3 above, what now stand revealed are serious lacunae in the law which, I suggested, need urgent attention. If that is so, and I entirely recognise that others may take a different view, then the question rises as to how the problem should be addressed. On one view, it is the kind of problem which is admirably suited for consideration by a Law Commission &#8211; perhaps, given the subject matter, jointly by the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission. That is one possibility. No doubt there are others. But it seems to me that something really does need to be done.</p>
