In the generality of cases the exercise may not need to be a particularly elaborate one, since there will be a history of default from which inferences can properly be drawn. But the exercise is an essential one: the defendant is not required to give evidence or to incriminate himself, and in the absence of a case to answer he is entitled to have the application against him dismissed without more. If the Commission establishes a case to answer, there will be an </span><span class="Emphasis" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">evidential</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> burden on the defendant to answer it, but that is unobjectionable in Art.6 terms. I would add that there is no requirement under article 6 for the Commission to serve evidence in advance of the hearing, but if it chooses to wait for evidence to be given by the presenting officer at the hearing, the court must be astute to ensure that the defendant is not taken by surprise and that the matter can proceed at that hearing without unfairness to him.&#8221;</span></p>

On any view, the arrears of child periodical payments are enforceable under the Debtors Act.  If the order for costs is not capable of being captured by the process, then I suppose that that would perhaps go to what the punishment should be (if it is imprisonment, perhaps as to the length of the sentence).  But what the order for costs does not prevent me from doing is from bringing it into account, if I were to award a suspended sentence, as a term of suspension.  </span></p>

And so the question of whether the costs order is, strictly speaking, captured by the terms of s.5 of the Debtors Act is perhaps to be regarded as slightly academic.  At all events, my primary decision is that I am satisfied that the order for costs is directly enforceable under s.5 of the Debtors Act.</span></p>

Conduct money is to be paid without strings to the respondent and is irrecoverable, in my judgment. The obligation to tender conduct monies so that the debtor can get to court is not recoverable if the debtor comes to court.  If, however, the debtor does not come to court, then in my judgment it would be reasonable for that sum to be recoverable.  Therefore I include as a term of suspension this sum of &#163;500 that has been paid in circumstances where he has not come to court.  </span></p>
