I think on this account alone she has demonstrated a willingness and aptitude that I don&#8217;t think would be matched by anyone else. We have both had to engage, with increasing amounts of involvement, in aiding our parents over the past several years. We consult on major decisions, although we have divided the actual labour between countries. I do the necessary leg-work in Canada, while she does the same in the UK. Since our parents decided they wanted to return full-time to the UK, this has meant the majority of the burden has fallen on her shoulders, and she has done an excellent job.&#8221;</p>

Gillian became incapacitated with dementia when she was only 60. Mainly due to Kate&#8217;s advocacy on her behalf, Gillian is still living in her own flat, and is supported by a team of carers around the clock. Occasionally, the need will arise for an executive decision to be made on her behalf on a personal welfare matter. For example, at the hearing we were told of a recent altercation with Gillian&#8217;s carers when a couple of visitors turned up unannounced at her flat with the intention of taking her out for the afternoon. Portsmouth City Council believes there is a pressing need for a personal welfare deputy in this case and intends to apply itself, if Kate doesn&#8217;t beat the Council to it. By making the appointment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(6)</ref> I consider that I am giving effect to the overriding objective by dealing with the matter expeditiously and proportionately and by saving expense.</p>
