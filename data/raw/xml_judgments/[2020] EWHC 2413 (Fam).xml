The Mother completed a degree in Russian Studies and spent a period of time living in the Czech Republic before moving to Croatia to improve her Croatian and to explore her family and cultural roots.  She applied for and was granted Croatian citizenship in about 2004. </p>

Accordingly, the children have joint Croatian and British nationality.  Although they have lived most of their lives in Croatia, it appears that English is their first language and they appear fluent in English.  There is mixed evidence about their ability to speak Croatian but it appears that at present they both have some, albeit perhaps limited, grasp of the Croatian language. </p>

The Father appealed that decision and the children remained living in Croatia until the result of the appeal was known.  The Mother was the primary carer for the children and she moved with them to a property in a village about 30 miles outside Zagreb. </p>

That re-hearing took place in October 2017.  On this occasion, the Court decided that the children had not been habitually resident in England in the summer of 2016, and it thus refused the Mother&#8217;s application for an order that the children should return to live with her in England. </p>

The Mother attempted to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights but there appears to have been some problem with the documentation and the appeal was dismissed.  No application was made by the Mother to restore the Convention proceedings in the High Court pursuant to the order of Mr Justice Bodey.  Accordingly, from the summer of 2016, the children were living in Croatia and the Croatian courts had determined that they were habitually resident in Croatia.  Both parties before me accepted that this decision was binding on this court and therefore the children are required to be treated for all purposes as being habitually resident in Croatia.</p>

They have also been involved in extensive legal proceedings concerning the arrangements for the children.  In February 2019, the Croatian court ordered that the parents should share care of the children.  The Mother appealed that decision and, on 3 September 2019, the appeal court revoked that order. The Father then applied for an order that the children should live with him, but that application was refused.  The court directed that there should be a report from the Office of Social Welfare.  This report proposed that the children stay with the Father but should have alternative weekends with the Mother and periods with the Mother during the school holidays. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Despite the recommendation, it appears that in practice the children continued to live with the Mother in her flat in the village outside Zagreb.  It appears that at first the Father returned to live at the Mother&#8217;s flat for parts of the week whilst he was seeing the children, and spent the rest of the week working in Zagreb at work.  In about May 2018 the Father terminated this arrangement by renting a property close by.  He then says he had contact with the children on a regular basis in the same village.   One of the features from the evidence in this case is that it is clear that both Mother and Father are devoted to their children and are both determined to provide them with the best parenting possible.  Further, it is commendable that neither parent has sought to disturb or impair the relationship between the children and the other parent.  However, the relationship between the Mother and the Father has been extremely difficult.  The Mother perceived that the Father was only seeking custody of the children as a way to attempt to exert control over her.  In contrast, the Father asserts that he was seeking custody because he felt that this would be the best thing for the children.  She felt, for example, that the Father had set the neighbours up to spy on her.  This is denied by the Father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In February 2019, the Croatian court reached the decision that the Father and the Mother should share the care of the children.  The Mother appealed this decision but, by August 2019, the appeal had not yet been heard.  Complaints are made by the Mother that the Croatian court system takes an excessive amount of time to reach decisions.  Given the large number of hearings that there have been in the Croatian courts over the past three years, I do not accept that any delays are excessive. It is, of course, always better for court hearings to be heard promptly but I am not satisfied that the history of hearings in this case in Croatia indicate any excessive level of delay.  The children arrangements proceedings have taken a number of years to resolve primarily because of appeals made by both parties, and not solely by delays as a result of court listing. </p>

The Mother applied for new UK passports for the children, claiming that their existing passports have been lost.  The Mother knew this was untrue.  The Father had retained the childrens&#8217; passports.  The Mother instructed the children that they were not allowed to tell the Father that they had new passports.  Then, in August 2019, the Mother informed the Father that she was taking children on holiday to the Croatian island of Korcula.  However, instead of travelling to Korcula, the Mother took the children to her parents&#8217; house in England.  It is clear that this was a carefully planned operation because the children started school in England very soon afterwards. </p>

The appeal court directed that the case should be returned to the court of first instance to make a new child arrangements order.  Accordingly, some years after the commencement of the child arrangement proceedings in Croatia, no final decision had been made concerning the arrangements for the children. </p>

There have been three directions hearings within these proceedings, namely directions made by Mrs Justice Judd on the papers on 18 November 2019, a detailed order made by Mr Justice Cobb on 11 December 2019 and an order made by HHJ Richards, sitting as a judge of the High Court, on 8 January 2020 relating to expert psychiatric evidence.  That medical evidence was requested in order to support a case by the mother that she suffers from mental health problems and these would be exacerbated by any return to Croatia.  In the event the expert report from Dr McClintock did not support that case. </p>

Hence, even if this Court makes an order for the children to return to Croatia, the Mother asserts that she will remain in the United Kingdom and therefore will cease to be the primary caregiver for her children.  Although this case was presented to me as her clear and settled intention, counsel for the Father urged me to consider both potential scenarios, namely that the Mother remains in the United Kingdom or returns with the children to Croatia.  Given that the Mother has only reached this position in the days before the court hearing and has previously asserted that she could not contemplate living away from her children, it seems to me that counsel for the Father is correct in saying that I cannot be confident that, if the children are required to return to Croatia, the Mother will carry through her present intention to remain in the United Kingdom.  I do not doubt the genuineness of her present intentions.  However, these intentions were not clear from her extensive witness statement and, as her counsel frankly admitted, her thoughts had only become crystallised in the days leading up to the hearing.  These intentions were also not clear from the psychiatric report prepared for these proceedings by Dr T McLintock dated 22 January 2020.   In those circumstances there must be a real possibility that, if I order the children to return to Croatia, the Mother will change her mind and will resume living in Croatia.  Accordingly, I need to consider both potential scenarios. </p>

She asserted that, because of the Father&#8217;s domestic abuse of her, she was not prepared to return to Croatia and suggested that, given this abuse, her position was entirely understandable.  However, her case was that it would be intolerable for the children to return to Croatia to live with their Father, and therefore the Father&#8217;s application should be refused.  There is no suggestion that, if the children returned to Croatia, they would come to any physical harm.

Ms Demery was frank about the extent to which the children would be likely to suffer distress if they were to lose day-to-day contact with the Mother.  She accepted that would be very difficult for them and that they may have feelings of abandonment.  She also accepted that the distress suffered by the children may be prolonged.  However, she indicated that there was nothing in the extensive file of reports from the Croatian proceedings which suggested that the Father could not adequately parent the children and noted that both children maintain a good relationship with both parents and said they loved them equally.  Despite the potential detriment to the children&#8217;s well-being as a result of the separation from the Mother, Ms Demery&#8217;s clear professional opinion was that it remained a &#8220;realistic option&#8221; for the children to move to live with their Father.  I accept Ms Demery&#8217;s evidence.  It is consistent with a large volume of evidence from the Croatian proceedings that both parents have the capacity to provide a loving home for the children.   In my judgment, whilst it is clear that the children would suffer a measure of distress if they were to return to Croatia without their Mother, in my judgment it does not reach the threshold of intolerability. </p>

Accordingly, on that assumed basis, I consider that the Father has established that that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the children after their return.  It follows that, pursuant to article 11(4) BIIa, the Mother cannot rely upon an article 13(b) Convention defence to avoid the obligation on the court to order the return of the children under article 12. </p>

An analysis by a clinical psychologist appointed by the court in connection with the Croatian Convention proceedings, Prof Jasminka Horvatic, records a detailed assessment of the Mother in May 2017.  A large number of reasons given by the Mother as to why she would prefer to live in the United Kingdom but there is no mention of this any serious allegation of domestic abuse.  The Mother has produced a report by Amnesty International which suggests that the way in which the Croatian authorities deal with domestic abuse has a number of serious deficiencies.  However, the focus of that report is on the approach of the police to the prosecution of men responsible for domestic violence.  It is not primarily focused on the question as to whether or not domestic violence is properly taken into account in matrimonial proceedings. </p>

I am not in a position to make any final decision about the truth of the allegations that the Mother makes about the Father&#8217;s conduct towards her and I make no assumption about the truth or otherwise of her allegations.  I am, however, satisfied those matters which she could raise within the Croatian courts inasmuch as they were relevant to the court&#8217;s determination about whether the children should live with her Father, and the arrangements for any contact. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">However, if the Mother remains in the United Kingdom it seems highly unlikely that she will continue to suffer any form of domestic abuse from the Father in Croatia.  Accordingly, the complaint that she makes about his conduct in the past are unlikely to affect the children in the future.  It is, however, important that the children are able to maintain contact with the Mother.  The Father had understandably not set out detailed protective measures that he was offering in the event that the Mother chose to remain in Croatia.  However, through his counsel he offered to ensure that, if the children were living with him, he would continue to support a full relationship between the children and their Mother.  He offered to facilitate direct contact taking place in Croatia and telephone or video contact when she was in England.  He said </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">that he would be prepared to allow the Mother to take the children on holiday in both England and Croatia, offering her &#8220;extensive holiday contact&#8221;.  I appreciate that these protective measures only emerged at the hearing but, because the Father had not appreciated the Mother&#8217;s clear position that she was not going to return to Croatia, it does not seem to me that she can be criticised for that. </p>

I do not accept that submission.  It seems to me that there is a wealth of evidence in this case that both parents have the capacity to offer a loving home to the twins.  I have no reason to doubt the genuineness of the Father&#8217;s commitment to maintaining his childrens&#8217; relationship with the Mother I note that generally neither parent has sought to speak ill of the other parent to the children. </p>

I therefore conclude that the Father has made out his case under that article and that accordingly the Mother&#8217;s case under article 13(b) must be dismissed.</p>

Those considerations apply to this case because the Mother devised a plan to abduct the children by taking them to the United Kingdom.  As part of that plan, the Mother unlawfully obtained duplicate passports and deceived the Father about her holiday intentions.  It was thus a clear, calculated and deliberate attempt to relocate the children away from the control of the courts in Croatia because she was dissatisfied with court decisions the and her life in Croatia; </p>

The question as to whether it is in the best interest to live with their Mother or the Father and, the degree of contact with the other parent, is a matter that is presently being litigated in the Croatian courts.  Any decision to return the children to Croatia will not inevitably lead to the children spending the rest of their childhood in Croatia.  The question about whether it is in the best interests of the children to live in Croatia or in England is a matter which I consider should be properly determined within the courts in Croatia because that is the country in which the children are habitually resident, and it would be more appropriate to do so if the children are in Croatia; </p>

Nonetheless, they are not strong objections and the children have positive things to say about Croatia.

By way of example, the Mother insisted that the Father meet the children in a contact centre rather than having them on his own.  I do not accept that there was any proper basis for limited contact in this way.  The Father was taking a full part in the London proceedings I do not accept that there was any proper basis for suggesting that he may have abducted the children if he had had contact with them on an unsupervised basis. There is reference in the report of Dr McClintock about the Mother having obsessive fears about the well-being of the children, albeit at an earlier stage.  It seems to me that it is important for the children to maintain full contact with the Father and their wider Croatian family as well as maintaining contact with the British heritage.  In my judgment, based on the limited information available to me, it seems that this is more likely to happen if the children are living in Croatia; </p>

Hence, their Croatian schooling will not be disrupted by a move back to Croatia and this point is of less weight. </p>
