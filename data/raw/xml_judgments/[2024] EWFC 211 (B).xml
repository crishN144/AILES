She is a young child of two-years of age and is too small to tell me what she wants. Her social worker believes her parents cannot give her good enough care into the future and asks me to allow the local authority to place her with a new adoption family. Amy has her own guardian []. She has thought about what is best for Amy and agrees with the social worker. Amy&#8217;s mum, Sally, and her dad, Peter, are not in a relationship together but they disagree with this plan and each of them asks for a new assessment of their ability to look after Amy. There are no other family members who could look after Amy.</span></p>

To make Sally more comfortable we have had a screen in Court so that Sally and Peter do not have to see each other, so they are not too stressed and can keep their mind on the case. I have also given my decision in writing to give both Sally and Peter the chance to consider it at their own speed with the help of their lawyer and others supporting them.</span></p>

Each of the parents have accepted they are not ready to care for Amy at this time. If I decide against further assessment then the remaining options left to consider will be either adoption or long term foster care. I will have to take each of these options and think about the good and bad things of each option.

The Court accepts parents are entitled to generally do things the way they feel is best for their children even if professionals like social workers would like them to do things differently. In general, it is the role and responsibility of parents to decide what is best for their children. The standard I apply in this case is good enough parenting.</span></p>

The Court keeps this in mind and asks whether adoption is needed because &#8216;nothing else will do&#8217; because adoption &#8216;is the last resort&#8217; with the other options being rejected as not being suitable for the child. If the Court sadly reaches this conclusion and a parent cannot agree to the plan for adoption then the Court has to consider whether it can make the order and do so without the parent&#8217;s agreement. This can only be done where the child&#8217;s welfare requires the Court to do so. In considering this the Court thinks about its assessment of what is best for the child and questions whether it is a balanced and reasonable decision to interfere with the family in this very extreme way or whether there remains a lower level of interference that will ensure the child&#8217;s welfare is safeguarded.</span></p>

It is difficult to get a clear picture of her childhood from the various reports as there are some aspects which are confusing. But it seems clear her parents separated when she was young due to domestic abuse and her later relationship with her mother&#8217;s new partner was somewhat difficult. She has had periods during which she has been quite distant from her mother and siblings. During her childhood she experienced two incidents of sexual abuse, one of which was within the family. She is described by her mother as being challenging during childhood with poor behaviour at times. There is a suggestion her secondary schooling was outside a mainstream school but this is not clear. She experienced bullying at school and in particular when a friend revealed what Sally had told her about being sexually abused. Sally has suffered from poor mental health for a number of years. The sexual abuse left her emotionally damaged and she would self-harm by cutting herself. When aged 16 she took an overdose. She received support for anxiety when at school. She has suffered with depression since she was about 18. When aged 18 she left home and lived in a hostel. A recent assessment has described her depression as recurring and being of a moderate nature. I will later set out the effect this may have on Sally. Sally has an older child, Billy, who is aged [  ] and lives with his father. I am told he has quite significant behavioural issues. It appears Sally cared for him until he was about [  ] years of age when it was agreed she could not cope and he moved to live with his father. There is a suggestion that this happened because she had started a relationship with Peter and this caused issues as to safe care of Billy. Since he has lived with his father, she has at times seen him on a weekly basis but it appears there may have been some recent breaks in contact. Sally is now living alone.</span></p>

There is some uncertainty about Peter&#8217;s childhood experiences because he could not remember the detail. He suffered the death of his mother when he was about 11. Peter suggests his life was good up to this point. However, following her death, he left home and entered foster care and was not treated well. Although it is unclear on the information provided, this change would suggest there were difficulties at home. It seems he has lost contact with members of his family. He left foster care at age 16 moving into his own accommodation. It seems his period in foster care was not stable with him having three carers in various locations. This seems to have had an impact on his schooling. I was told that he has used cannabis since about the age of 12 and continues to do so. Peter&#8217;s first real relationship was with Sally. He is now in a relationship with Sam. I will return to this later. I understand Peter was for a long time homeless until he met Sam. He now lives with her and her children. I am told he recently started an apprenticeship.</span></p>

I am less clear when the relationship ended but I note Peter claims to have been in a relationship with Sam for about 17 months (so from about February 2023). Amy was born in [  ] 2022. One of the main concerns in this case is about the nature of the relationship between the parents. The local authority are worried Peter was abusive to Sally and are concerned as to the risks for Amy of being in a home when this has been happening. Sally agrees Peter was violent to her and has provided evidence in support of these claims. Peter mostly denies this behaviour although he accepts some inappropriate behaviour. The local authority have also been concerned that Amy was not receiving the care she needed and was being neglected by her mother. The local authority became involved with the family before Amy was born due to these concerns and there has been a significant amount of work undertaken or offered. The local authority has had concerns as to the parents agreeing to act in a certain manner and keep apart but are worried these agreements have not been kept to. Before starting these proceedings, the local authority made clear to the parents how worried they were. It seemed this might have helped and the local authority then backed away from bringing the case to Court. However, the concerns increased again leading to this case.</span></p>

At the first hearing on 30 October 2023 the Court decided Amy should stay with Sally but there would be an interim supervision order. The Court made Peter a party and fixed a follow-up hearing. By the time of the second hearing on 21 November 2023 concerns had increased for Amy and the local authority asked the Court to remove Amy from Sally&#8217;s care. The Court agreed to fix a further hearing to make this decision but decided until then Amy and Sally would live with an aunt and Sally would be supervised. At the third hearing on 23 November 2023 (all three hearings had been before the same Judge) the Judge agreed Amy should be removed from Sally and placed into foster care. The Judge went on to give directions including (i) parenting assessments for each parent; (ii) an intermediary assessment for Peter; (iii) evidence from the parents as to the things they were saying about each other; (iv) final evidence, and; (v) listed an issue resolution hearing. There was a further non-compliance hearing on 15 March 2024 as a result of Sally not fully engaging with her parenting assessment. That assessment was ended and Sally was told she would need to ask the Court for a further assessment if she wanted one. On 12 April 2024, the Court heard the issue resolution hearing. The Court confirmed this final hearing and decided Sally&#8217;s request for a further assessment would be decided at this hearing. The Judge gave other necessary directions to make this hearing work well.</span></p>

She seemed both emotionally flat and anxious in her presentation. I have to be careful to check whether this was her acting for the Court but concluded this was genuine. I formed the view she is a very vulnerable individual and she appeared to me to have a low level of emotional resilience. She was open in her answers and agreed with a number of points which were not altogether helpful to her case. I do not think this was her being led to give answers that were not true. Rather I think she was feeling stressed and answered directly and in a truthful manner. There were areas in which she stuck to her case and given her other evidence I did find this credible evidence. I have no doubt she cares for Amy very much and regrets her inability to provide her with good consistent care. She was open and honest about this. This must have been extremely hard to accept and she deserves credit for her openness.

There were various points when words were used that I felt would be challenging for him but on nearly every occasion he showed he had a clear understanding of what was being discussed. He was more than willing to engage in a combative manner when questioned. I was at times less impressed with him as a witness. He tended to jump into providing an answer and then provide a subsequent contradictory response. I had the sense he had a case he wished to put and was determined to make that case whatever he was asked. He gave a sense of over optimism as to certain issues combined with a lack of insight into the complications associated with what he was saying. He was a defensive and at times less credible witness. But as with Sally he gave a strong impression of having genuine feelings for his daughter.</span></p>

In her written conclusions she noted positives including his engagement with the assessment; his commitment to contact; his ability with practical tasks and his current relationship with Sam. However, she was concerned about the issues of domestic violence; about Peter struggling in following Amy&#8217;s cues; struggling to separate Amy&#8217;s emotional need from his own; having a lack of understanding of child development and the challenges were Amy to come to live with him, and; a lingering worry as to how he would manage if his relationship with Sam ended. She concluded Peter loved Amy but even with support could not meet her needs now or throughout her childhood. When questioned she accepted there were strengths found within the contact notes but her concerns remained unchanged. A number of suggested positive developments were put to her. She accepted each were positive but could not comment further as they were not evidenced in the papers. She felt the contact notes whilst positive did not help the Court to understand whether Peter had improved his ability to understand Amy&#8217;s cues. She was asked as to whether it would have been helpful to have obtained a more recent report (her report is dated February 2024) and whilst she accepted this point, she was clear that the suggested positives put to her did not outweigh the identified negatives. When asked about concessions made by Peter around domestic abuse and whether this reduced her concerns, she felt this was only a first step and more was required to reduce her concerns. She couldn&#8217;t help as to the period of stopping cannabis that would be helpful but agreed a period of 6 months would be positive. She repeated the areas needing change. These were around an understanding of child development and the emotional needs of the child. It was about those things which are not simply practical. She worried Peter would not be helped by a parenting course given his needs and was concerned there would need to be a continuing presence of support to help him as Amy&#8217;s needs changed as she got older. She considered Peter struggled most with a fast-paced situation and thinking on his feet. A child in his care could not wait for him to go off and seek advice on each issue that arose. He would be expected to deal with thing as they arose on the spot. It was good he had started the domestic violence course but he had not finished it. She didn&#8217;t feel his explanation for failing to complete was a good one. She noted housing was an issue but her concern was more to do with Peter&#8217;s lack of reality about his proposal. She recognised there were positives in Peter and Sam caring as a unit but there were other issues concerning Sam's physical and mental health that complicated things and led her to conclude they could not cope with an additional child. She gave an example of Peter&#8217;s inability to put himself into Amy&#8217;s shoes. In contact Amy was upset but Peter imposed his own views onto her feelings and attributed them to her.</span></p>

He had been the allocated social worker since August 2022 and was able to describe the support and suggestions made to the parents over this period. He accepted it was best, if possible, for Amy to be raised in her family of birth but he had to have regard to her timescales and the issues in the case. He spoke about the previous involvement of the local authority and how the local authority previously stepped back from bringing the matter to the Court but then things deteriorated again. He has supported Sally with a therapist referral; with support with her GP; with proposals to have her assessed for ASD but she consistently failed to engage or maintain engagement. When the therapist came to the house, she didn&#8217;t open the door. He accepted he had a good relationship with Sally but this could not be viewed as good engagement given all these difficulties. She was honest about her mental health challenges. He had helped her with domestic abuse work but she needed to attend group work. A parenting practitioner was appointed (Ms C[  ]) to offer guidance and support previous to proceedings but there was a failure to engage. The previous role was ended given the parents separated and there was suggested support from the wider family. But then the family expressed concern as to Sally&#8217;s care and proceedings started. He had seen the most recent expert psychiatric assessment and hoped Sally would get treatment but this will take time and she has struggled to engage before. He explained the support package that would be needed if Amy was placed with her mother. This is the same package of work the local authority had previously attempted. He had no confidence this would now be successful. He was hopeful but not positive. He accepted there had been an improvement in contact and noted there had always been a good child-parent relationship. This has often required family support. He explained the current foster carers are committed to Amy but are not asking to adopt her and are not approved long term foster carers, although they would consider putting themselves forward if this were the outcome. He explained his changed attitude to post-adoption contact and his suggested transition plan were adoption approved. He did not consider it would be better for Amy to be placed into long term foster care given her age and the need for stability and permanence.</span></p>

He felt he didn&#8217;t need to listen to this (I have heard it) given the other evidence in the case. He explained Peter&#8217;s failure to complete the domestic abuse course and did not accept this was due to any failure on the part of the local authority. It was about Peter being unwilling to travel and issues around him paying for travel and then reclaiming these costs. The local authority paid everything that was expected. Peter disengaged between about October 2022 and the start of proceedings in October 2023. He said he would do a course but only if it was in his local area. He had said it was &#8216;pointless&#8217; attending the course and was denying any abuse. He considered this work would need to be done before Amy could be with her father. He was asked about improvements in contact  and agreed this was the case but commented that these had occurred early on in the contact after it resumed. He was asked about Peter&#8217;s relationship with Sam and felt it was a relatively short-term relationship with various challenges and concerns. He did not feel it was permanent. Adoption was not being recommended because of a non-acceptance of suggested positives in contact. It was more about the other issues. He was asked about various people who might offer support to Peter but commented he was not aware they were offering support and they had not been put forward by Peter for the proposed Family Group Conference. He did not agree there was a need for a further assessment of Peter. As to cannabis use Peter had been dependent on this throughout his life, he had agreed to engage with a substance group but did not engage. He had previously said he had no intention to stop using but was now saying he would. He was concerned as to accommodation as this was not secure for Peter and he had a poor history of engaging with benefits and other agencies. He accepted there was a role in offering support to Peter but felt he should have been able to access support himself in this regard. He was asked about the support Peter offers to Sam&#8217;s children and commented this is said to have been taking place for some time and so should have been reflected in the parenting assessment. Whilst there had been positive changes since February 2024 this did not amount to enough to outweigh the negatives in the case which had been present since Amy&#8217;s birth and which led to local authority involvement.</span></p>

If this breaks down Peter will be back to &#8216;square one.&#8217; He explained that Sam&#8217;s own children were on a child protection plan (now a child in need plan) due to issues in her relationship with one of her children&#8217;s father.</span></p>

She spoke about him not wanting her to see her mother and controlling her by keeping her bank card and passport. She was now more motivated and energised. Previous difficulties had been linked to her low mood and distress at seeing Amy upset in contact. She told me she had been assaulted in January 2020 when a phone was thrown at her causing an injury close to her eye. On the same occasion she was strangled by Peter. She had not supported the prosecution but she had been telling the truth. She confirmed an incident at her residential unit in April 2022 when he had kicked her and tried to snatch Amy from her arms. She felt she was vulnerable and he was manipulating her. She accepted she could not provide good enough care to Amy at this time and had a lot of work to do. This would include therapy and she felt this would take the next year or so to complete. She agreed she had failed to engage with work previously offered as a result of her low mood. She didn&#8217;t agree with the expert as to a need for 18-24 months of support. She was now willing to accept therapy. Sally agreed she had sent hurtful and abusive messages to Peter and would encourage him to have contact with her even when he was on bail conditions not to see her. She sent the messages because she felt she only had him. The allegations she had made were true. She agreed she was sometimes drunk and not in control. She agreed with some of the concerns about her care of Amy. There had been one incident of abuse in her previous relationship. If she were successful, she would expect any contact with Peter to be supervised. She did not support him caring for Amy. If she were unsuccessful, she would support long term foster care as Amy is happy in foster care; could continue to see her family and might return home in the future. She felt she was in a cycle with Peter. He was more aggressive when he was not using cannabis.</span></p>

The evidence of her sending him money was to enable him to make online purchases and he would give her the money back in cash. He said when he resumed contact in November 2023 things were strained but this had improved and it was now &#8216;brilliant&#8217; with Amy running up to him at contact. He spoke of what he brought to contact when he came. He described his relationship with Sam &#8217;s child who has additional needs and does not speak and his role in relation to caring for her children. He described his relationship with Sam which was &#8216;brilliant,&#8217; they had known each other for 4 years and been together for 17 months. When they disagree, they talk things through. He described his current apprenticeship. He confirmed he was not willing to engage with the domestic violence course and was in a position to fund attendance. He was questioned about the allegations made against him. He denied causing the injury to Sally in January 2020 and claimed she had been drunk and out of control. She was trashing his room and banged her head against a mirror breaking it and causing the injury. He had not caused the injury and had wanted her to leave. But he was arrested by the police when they attended. He did not call the ambulance or police. He denied keeping her personal possessions and questioned why her passport would be at his house anyway. He was questioned about an incident at the mother&#8217;s residential unit in April 2022 when it is said he kicked the mother. He denied he had kicked her. He was then shown his response to the allegations in the case in which he was said to have admitted this allegation. He said this was a mistake and that he was admitting the argument which led to the police attending. He accepted taking or attempting to take Amy from the mother&#8217;s arms and agreed her head was unsupported. But he said that she could support her own neck. He blamed Sally for instigating the incident. Separately he commented on a picture of the mother in which she appeared to have the imprint of a shoe sole on her forehead. He told me he was present when this happened and it was caused by the mother hitting herself on the head with a shoe. He also described an occasion when he threw a stool against a wall during an argument but commented that it was in his way and it was his property so he could do this. He later agreed the contents of a note which described him returning the mother&#8217;s passport and bank card to her own mother. In summary he disputed any abuse in the relationship although he agreed there were loud arguments with shouting brought about by the mother drinking to excess, something she was doing every day by the latter part of the relationship. I understood him to say the relationship lasted for 4 years between 2018 and 2022. In about September 2022 he was telling a psychologist that he was not in a  relationship with Sally because the social workers wouldn&#8217;t allow it. On his case he started a relationship with Sam in about February 2023.</span></p>

He described his use of cannabis which he accepted being &#8216;addicted&#8217; to but said he could stop using without need for outside help. He had previously stopped using but started again due to the stress of not seeing Amy. He spent about &#163;60 a week on cannabis and smoked 2-3 joints a day (previously 6-7). He did this outside the house. Sam moaned a little about him stopping and said he needed to stop to focus on Amy if she came to him. He would stop then. He had not engaged with a support service because this had not been organised for him. He was asked about a parenting course which he had said he was about to start (in his statement).

If Amy came, she would have her son, Stephen&#8217;s room which would be okay because he normally pulled his bed into the living room to sleep near to his mother. There would be no issues around this and Amy would be settled within a week or two. Stephen had no issues with sharing with babies but struggled with older children. If anything happened to Sam (she has a debilitating condition) then her mother would have Stephen and he would keep Amy. He later corrected this to say she would help him care for the children. If they separated, they would still be friends and he would stay until he found somewhere for himself and Amy.

He felt his assessment had been done too early, it was at a time when he was restarting contact with Amy and this explains the difficulties. Things were now much improved and he needed to be reassessed. When asked about the conclusions of a psychologist as to his behaviour he commented that this was done a long time ago. He disagreed with the suggestion that when he was not using cannabis his mood was affected and led to raised stress leading to misbehaviour. He told me he had not been smoking cannabis during the final hearing in the morning or at lunch, but only before bed. He told me that him and Sam might in the future have a child together.

She did not oppose an open adoption so long as searching for this did not cause delay or unduly restrict the pool of possible adopters. She did not support the further assessments due to the delay they would cause. In the case of Sally delaying for further assessments would be too great a gamble given the historic evidence of non-engagement. In the case of Peter, a similar concern arose. Both parents accepted they were not currently able to provide good enough care and one could not say with confidence they would be able to do so in the future. She was concerned by Peter&#8217;s evidence around his cannabis use and domestic abuse. There was evidence of erratic behaviour on his part such as the stool incident. His use of cannabis is associated with stress relief but caring for Amy would increase not reduce stress.</span></p>

She accepted transition to adoption could cause emotional harm given the impact of change and loss of relationships. This was why this needed to be undertaken sooner rather than later and whilst Amy would be better able to cope with the change. She agreed Sally had low mood during the assessment period and this would have impacted on her ability to engage. But she felt the Court had to look at the preceding period of 1.5 years during which overall parenting had not been good enough. She accepted there would be challenges for Amy when she came to see her files when older and after an adoption. But the guardian&#8217;s hope was that Amy would then be in a position of emotional strength as a result of the care and support she had received within a settled placement.

There were things that had simply not moved on during the course of the proceedings such as substance misuse and domestic abuse understanding. She had residual concern as to the support that could be taken from Sam given her own health concerns and uncertainty as to the future.

Allegations like this are difficult to decide as they nearly always happen in private with no-one else present. Where they are true there will often be issues of control and vulnerability which means reports are not always made or maintained. Sometimes things are said which are not true but made because someone wants to get back at an ex-partner of punish them for something. As a result, the Court is always helped where there is truly independent evidence which supports one side of the argument or where there are documents which show of suggest an account is true or untrue.

This abuse has included both physical, verbal, and emotional abuse and includes controlling behaviours. I accept the key allegations made by the local authority in its threshold document. Whilst I have considered each point separately on its own merits I have naturally drawn upon my other findings when bringing my conclusions together. I have reached these conclusions having regard to the following points:</span></p>

This was because I found the site of the injury, which was to the side of Sally&#8217;s head in a slightly protected spot unlikely to be caused by her head butting a mirror as initially described by Peter. I note how his physical description of her motion altered when he became aware of the point being made. Secondly, I accept it is surprising the police did not include in their report circumstances which fitted with Peter&#8217;s case. They do not detail the broken mirror for instance or Sally being obviously drunk. Third I do not consider the injury fits very well with an event in which Sally repeatedly headbutted a mirror until it broke. Fourth, I note Peter provided a prepared statement to the police but then provided a no comment interview. On its own this would not prove the allegation but it offers support to the suggestion it was him who had something to hide. I was not assisted by the fact Sally withdraw her allegation or that Peter was not convicted. This does not outweigh the other information. I was also not assisted by Peter&#8217;s reliance on the fact Sally had a history of self-harming. I am also supported by my other findings.</span></p>

Such control included wanting to restrict her access to her mother (who did not appreciate Peter&#8217;s treatment of her daughter); and keeping her shoes, bank card and passport. It is striking that Peter denied this in his evidence and commented there was no reason why Sally&#8217;s passport would be at the house only to later accept that three days later he attended at her mother&#8217;s house to return the bank card and passport. I found Sally more credible and consistent in her account.

I accept on this occasion Peter placed his hand on Sally&#8217;s neck. This is why she documented the event by taking a photo of her neck, even though the image is not particularly clear. But I also find there was an incident when Peter stood on Sally&#8217;s forehead. I have seen the striking image of a clear footprint on her forehead. It is agreed this is a footprint. I found Peter&#8217;s explanation incredible and one I reject. He told me he watched her hit herself with a shoe a number of times causing the injury. I do not believe this for two reasons: (a) Whilst I do not have expert evidence, I consider I do not need it. In my assessment it is most unlikely such a mark would be caused by a person hitting herself with an empty shoe. I accept this would cause bruising but not the striking image seen in the photo. Rather, I consider this is an imprint requiring the shoe to have been forcibly held against the face to cause the injury. In my assessment this would be far more likely to be caused by a foot being pressed down on a face than an empty shoe being smacked against a face. Secondly, the mark is very distinct and fits with a single forceful press rather than a series of unrelated hits. In the second example it is most unlikely one would see such stark linear marking as the point of contact would vary on each occasion to some extent. This conclusion both supports and is supported by my other findings. I note the police attended on this occasion and appear to have arrested Peter suggesting they also formed a view not dissimilar to my own.</span></p>

In simple terms she is likely to want this to continue. She smiles at Peter and runs to him for a cuddle. This suggests she is happy and enjoying herself and will want this to continue. She equally has good contact with Sally. But because I am guessing about what she would want I also do not ignore the fact that she is happy in her current foster care placement. This is likely to be in part because she is happy with the stable and consistent care she is receiving there. Of course, she would not put it that way but it is likely this is part of why she is happy.

She needs a safe home with consistent care that does not keep changing. She needs a home without high levels of dispute and without domestic abuse. She needs a carer who is well enough physically and mentally to be available to meet her needs as they arise. It is important her carer gives predictable care. What I mean by that is that Amy can expect a consistent form of care and get that care when she asks for it from her carer. She needs all her basic needs to be met including food, clothing, and housing. It is important her carers understand her needs including her developmental needs and can keep meeting these as they change over time. But Amy has particular needs which are personal to her and which flow from her history. Given the significant disruption in her life and her change of carers it is important she now has stability into her future care. She really cannot afford future disruption to her home life. It would be very damaging for her were she to return to one of her parents only for that to fail and for her to return into care. This would likely undermine any trust she has in her carers. She also needs a solution to be found sooner rather than later. She is now 2 &#189; years old and she has experienced challenging times throughout her life. There is a danger that delay in her finding a final placement may mean any future placement is not as stable as Amy needs. The older she becomes the harder it may be to find a placement that she can settle into. This is partly because her experiences will become so central to her feelings that she cannot put them to one side and fit into a new home. I have listened to the evidence about medical and other physical needs she may have. I accept these concerns are largely addressed. I accept there is at least a risk that she may have some developmental issues. The evidence suggests these are likely to be a result both of the make-up she takes from her parents but also from the care she has received. She now needs care which removes any environmental impact.</span></p>

The impact of adoption is huge. It has both a legal and emotional impact. Legally Amy would no longer be a member of her birth family. Emotionally her relationship with her parents would be seriously changed if not stopped altogether. I will return to the question of possible contact even if she is adopted but I must take account of the possibility that there will be no contact if she is adopted other than indirect contact through letters. The concern is that Amy would struggle to cope with losing her relationship with her family and this might mean she cannot settle into a new placement. If this turned out to be the case then the very reason for seeking adoption would be undermined. Even if she managed to settle there would be a longer term worry as to how she would cope with what had happened to her when she was old enough to fully understand her history. If this were not managed well, she might very well rebel against her placement or act in a way which would destabilise it. This emotional impact might have significant impact on her own mental health. I would be worried were she to follow a similar route to either of her parents as a result of this. Other worries would be that she might come to blame herself for being separated from her family or blame her new family for her separation. Plainly any or all of these feelings would have a consequential and significant impact on her schooling and likely relationships outside of her family. I appreciate there is a proposal for possible direct contact after adoption. The reason why such contact might be good for Amy is not just because it would allow her to see her family. It might also create the stability that would potentially limit the worries set out above. But such contact would likely be limited in scope and likely limited to what might be called identity contact &#8211; set at perhaps once or twice a year. This would still bring a significant impact on Amy and would not entirely remove the issues above.</span></p>

One can have only limited confidence that these issues will not arise in the future involving one or other of her parents unless the underlying issues are addressed. She has also suffered emotional harm and neglect. Again, this is likely to happen again unless changes are made. It seems to be agreed that at this time a risk will remain until such time as the parents have taken steps to address the issues put before the Court.

I have heard the difficulties in the relationship with Peter and how there were periods when he did not see her. However, since November 2023 contact has improved significantly as noted by the professionals. There is obvious value to Amy in this continuing. A similar point can be made with respect to Sally. She has also had periods during which contact has been inconsistent but more recently it has become more regular. It also has value to Amy. I have heard about the role of the grandmother. I consider this falls into a different category and is secondary to the parents but it has some value for Amy. There is general agreement that the foster carers have provided a settled and consistent home for Amy and that they are attached to her and she to them. In many ways at this time this relationship is the most valuable one for Amy.</span></p>

Such a placement has a much higher level of potential instability. Such instability could arise in a number of ways that would not likely arise in an adoptive setting. These might include the foster carer retiring from providing such care, moving, or taking on other needs. It might alternatively breakdown due to ill health in circumstances that simply would not cause an adoption to end. The issue is that foster carers are in reality employees of the local authority and their continuation is based on regulations and rules which do not apply to adoption; (ii) Foster care leaves a child subject to state parenting. This will mean Amy has regular reviews and medical checks. If her foster carers wished to travel overseas then they would need permission and checks might need to be undertaken before Amy could have a &#8216;sleepover.&#8217; These circumstances mean there is a risk of this creating a level of stigma around the child, with embarrassment around her friends when this becomes known; (iii) Whilst foster care has the benefit of allowing rehabilitation it also brings a risk of levels of instability based on problematic ongoing contact or unmerited applications to discharge the placement; (iv) Whilst foster care relationships can continue into adulthood the relationship is then very different in form and comes with no sense of certainty.</span></p>

She is now consistent with her medication and is feeling better and needs to be re-assessed. She agrees there is a lot of work to do and accepts this will cause at least a 6-month delay to any final outcome. Peter says he has moved on since his assessment and so should be reassessed. He also agrees he has work to do and seems to agree this would mean a delay of around 9 months at least. Both the local authority and the guardian consider this delay is too long and that the evidence suggests the prospects of a successful outcome is too low to make this acceptable.

I am in no doubt any such assessment would be bound to place focus on the medium- and long-term likelihood of consistent and stable care and would require some level of evidence of engagement with therapy and evidence of progress of the same. I do not suggest this would have to be concluded and would therefore need the 18-24 months suggested by the expert. But I do consider an assessor would need to see sustained engagement. I consider this would mean a delay of at least 6 months before a report could be contemplated. Allowing for updated final evidence and a further hearing this would extend the proceedings to around 8 months. If an agreement could not be reached a final hearing would probably be around 10 months away. I consider the timetable for Peter would be similar if not exactly the same. This means in the worst-case scenario one would then be returning to adoption as an outcome in about 10 months with a likely earliest placement 16-20 months away, meaning Amy could be close to 4 &#189; years of age. This is a significant risk for Amy and means the Court will want confidence before agreeing to this possibility.</span></p>

I am often faced by cases in which a local authority is criticised for not offering support to parents to improve themselves. Often parents are left to pursue their own referrals. In this case the local authority has stepped up to the mark and provided a very high level of support. The parents have also benefitted from a consistent social worker over the last two years.

Expert assessments were undertaken both before and within these proceedings. A parenting practitioner was offered to give guidance and support and in proceedings an appropriate assessment offered. The social worker gave direct support with respect to domestic violence work and other work was provided. The difficulty is that Sally was unable to engage with this work and where she did was unable to sustain her engagement. This is not a case in which everything can be seen to have been offered in a short window of court proceedings. In contrast the support here has been offered over a significant period and to no positive effect. Whilst I appreciate Sally is now saying she feels better my sense of her as a witness was of a young woman who remained vulnerable and passive. I did not pick up the sense of someone who has plainly turned a corner. I appreciate from her perspective the assessment was undertaken at a bad time for her and soon after Amy was removed but this is the reality of Court proceedings which attempt to find a secure outcome for a child within 6 months. Yet we are now at 9 months and will be close to two years if her application succeeds. The work she will need to undertake will be challenging and I am concerned that despite her best intentions this will remain beyond her current ability. I have to bear in mind the obvious tendency to be optimistic at the point at which the Court is making its final decisions but the history of this case and the period which preceded it gives very limited ground for hope.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In the case of Peter there are a range of balancing points. He raises the positives of contact in recent times, his relationship with Sam and her children and his new employment post. But against this are some serious ongoing concerns which have been relevant throughout Amy&#8217;s life. I have in mind the domestic abuse, substance abuse and evidence of poor understanding of her needs. Peter has also been offered a lot of support but has failed to take this opportunity. In his evidence he was consistently critical of the professionals who offered these services or those who had failed to inform him of his need to attend or arrange the same. I was not impressed with this evidence. In his statement he identified a course he was starting in June only to tell me in evidence he didn&#8217;t and couldn&#8217;t explain why not but it was someone else&#8217;s fault. He accepts he needs to engage with a domestic abuse programme but falls very short of accepting his behaviour as found by me. He went no further than accepting arguing and throwing a stool and justified the latter in any event. I have expressed reservations as to the audio sent by Sam and this impacts on his case as to this being a foundation for his case. His evidence as to substance use was contradictory and problematic. Ultimately, he accepted a link between stopping use and caring for Amy yet made clear this was only something he would do in the future. It is unclear why he has not used these proceedings as an opportunity to stop. I also found elements of his evidence confirmatory of the concerns as to his lack of ability to understand Amy&#8217;s needs and a tendency to view maters from his perspective with an inability to put himself in her shoes. A key example was the suggestion she would settle into his home within one week. This was widely optimistic. He did not seem to see that her moving into Stephen&#8217;s room might have an emotional impact upon him or that her presence might becoming challenging for Stephen as she became an older child given, he struggles to share with older children. Each of these illustrated the concern identified in his assessment. I was left with the sense that he had a an overly optimistic and unrealistic appreciation of the challenges that would be faced. In my opinion a realistic understanding is important in a case where change if required.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Sadly, and notwithstanding positive elements I have reached the conclusion that a further assessment is not necessary given the information the Court already has. In reality a further assessment will always have some purpose and will always provide more information but in this case the Court has a wealth of information over a sustained period and the grounds for optimism around further assessment are in fact very limited. Further, I do not consider it would be right to extend the proceedings as sought. This would have a profound impact on Amy were such delay to be followed in any event by a search for an adoptive family. In this case there has been a real opportunity to make change or show the foundation for change. Unfortunately, what has been seen has been just the first steps in a long journey. I dismiss the applications for further assessment.</span></p>

I have ended up placing most weight on the history of instability experienced by Amy to date and the very real need for her to have a secure and stable placement as soon as possible. I consider she requires a placement which has as much security as is possible. Whilst I recognise the positives, she has obtained from her current placement I do not consider it is best for her to remain in foster care indefinitely. The downsides of this outweigh the benefits. I consider with the passage of time Amy&#8217;s welfare needs will only be adequately met if she is placed central to a family and one in which she can be confident she will remain. My conclusion is that she requires the permanence that can only be offered by adoption. I have therefore reached the sad conclusion that only a care and placement order will meet her welfare needs. As a result, I consider her welfare requires me to make this order even though her parents disagree. In my assessment her welfare needs this and as such it is a reasonable response to the situation faced. I judge it is a proportionate response despite its significant impact.</span></p>

As such it is reasonable to transition contact over this period to prepare Amy for this change. There is a possibility that this will occur somewhat earlier and if this is possible then it should not be delayed because contact is still in a process of transition. Having regard to this on balance I agree with the proposed transition plan from weekly to fortnightly and then monthly contact.</span></p>

I agree with the planning to include support for consideration of direct contact post-adoption. I do not consider this should restrict the parameters of the search but all candidates should be informed as to the positives of contact. This judgment should and will be shared with them and I would expect my observations to be drawn to their attention. I am cautious about imposing a certain form of wording and would prefer to leave this to the experienced professionals who will be dealing directly with the candidates. But I would expect the professionals to provide a balanced and realistic summary of the benefits of contact. I certainly approve the notion of a meeting between parents and prospective adopters.</span></p>
