	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">So far as material, I can summarise the history (set out in great detail in my previous judgments) quite shortly. Following a hearing in the Guildford County Court, His Honour Judge Nathan found that a little child, X, had suffered a number of serious injuries at the hands of one or other or both &#8211; he could not determine which &#8211; of the birth parents. Subsequently, Judge Nathan made care and placement orders and then in due course an adoption order. None of this was challenged at the time by X&#8217;s birth parents in the Court of Appeal. They were then tried in the Guildford Crown Court on counts of child cruelty contrary to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/12/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/12" uk:canonical="1933 (23 &amp; 24 Geo. 5) c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children and Young Persons Act 1933</ref>. After the close of the expert evidence, the Crown abandoned the prosecution. The birth parents were, on the direction of His Honour Judge Critchlow, acquitted, on the basis that there was no case to answer.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The birth parents then applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal Judge Nathan&#8217;s finding of fact judgment. Permission was given and the case remitted for rehearing, in the event by me, in the Family Division. I decided that there should be a complete re-hearing at which it would be for the local authority to prove its case: <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span></p>

X is entitled, she says, to respect for X&#8217;s right to private life. Both on a micro level &#8211; in the day-today world in which X lives &#8211; and on the macro level of the public at large, X should not be identified or identifiable. [She] recognises the public interest in the court being transparent and open about what is going on in this case. But, she submits, this objective has been properly achieved by the publication of my earlier judgment which, she says, provides sufficient detail to allow for public discussion and debate. Despite the extensive reporting of the criminal proceedings and the amount of material which is, in consequence, in the public domain, there is, she submits, no need for either X or the adoptive parents to be identified and every reason why they should not be. </p>

In the unusual circumstances of this case that impact will fall, albeit indirectly, on the adoptive parents, and therefore X, as well as on the birth parents. There is, as it seems to me, and for the reasons articulated by Mr Dodd and Mr Farmer, no principled basis for protecting the anonymity of the birth parents in their interests or for their sake; the only justification for preserving their anonymity in the short term, and I accept that there is such justification, is the pressing need to protect X, and also the adoptive parents, from the enhanced glare of publicity in the interim.&#8221; </p>

It cannot, they say, be equitable or right that only one of them should have to face the glare of public scrutiny &#8211; &#8220;If [the RRO] cannot be lifted in a way that enables both &#8230; to share equally in their respective fates, it should not be lifted at all.&#8221; They elaborate, that to do so would be a disproportionate interference with the Article 8 rights of one whilst, albeit by circumstance rather than design, protecting those of the other.

That narrative has now been exposed as false: there was no miscarriage of justice. Although much of the material demonstrating the falsity of the birth parents&#8217; narrative is now, of course, in the public domain, as they accept, Ms Morgan and Ms Segal submit that the final piece in that particular jigsaw &#8211; the names of the birth parents, the persons responsible for peddling the false narrative &#8211; should likewise now be put in the public domain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">Ms Fottrell, on behalf of X&#8217;s adoptive parents takes that submission one stage further. The position now arrived at, she submits, is that there are in the public domain two competing narratives: one, the false narrative, in which <span style="font-style:italic">identified</span> birth parents portray themselves as the victims of a miscarriage of justice; the other, the correct narrative, in which <span style="font-style:italic">unidentified </span>birth parents are shown to have wrongly portrayed themselves as the victims of a miscarriage of justice. If the RRO continues in relation to the birth parents, it will not be possible to &#8216;link up&#8217; the two competing narratives and therefore not possible to demonstrate that the false narrative is indeed false. It will remain indefinitely on the internet without anyone being able to counter it and demonstrate its falsity. More specifically, the allegation (now, as we know, false) of the identified birth parents that they &#8211; two named individuals &#8211; were the victims of a miscarriage of justice will remain indefinitely on the internet without the possibility of challenge and refutation. Ms Cover and Ms Rensten seek to meet this argument by submitting that the dragon is sleeping and will not be revived unless the birth parents are now identified. Even assuming that their premise is correct, this does not meet Ms Fottrell&#8217;s point, which is that the false narrative is out there &#8211; readily accessible by anyone with access to the internet. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0in">The Press Association makes much the same points. Its fundamental submission is that at this stage it would be both unnecessary and contrary to principle to make any order banning reporting or requiring that the birth parents remain anonymous: they have already been widely identified in the media, have occupied much court time and cost, and at one stage actively sought publicity for their claim that their child had been unjustly taken from them. It points out that had the birth parents proved to be correct in their allegations, they would have deserved to be exonerated, and exonerated publicly. The reverse, however is the case. Why, in these circumstances, should the findings, for example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (A Child) (No 4)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2018/1815" uk:canonical="[2018] EWHC 1815 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWHC 1815 (Fam)</ref>, paras 121, 123, 125, not likewise be pinned on them?
