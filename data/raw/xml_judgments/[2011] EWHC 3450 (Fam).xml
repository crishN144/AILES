The father now applies to this court for an order for A&#8217;s return to England or, in the alternative, an order determining contact.  That application is made under the provisions of Article 11(6) and (7) of the Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 of 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition of enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility repeating Regulation (EC) No.1347/2000 (commonly known as Brussels II Revised).  For reasons explained below, however, I find that this court had already been seised prior to the non-return order and therefore already has jurisdiction under Brussels II Revised.  </span></p>

His family come from Poland and, when he was about eighteen years old, the family returned to that country.  The mother was born in Poland in 1980 and is therefore now aged thirty-one.  The parties met at university in Poland and started a relationship in around 2002.  They lived together for several years, but have never married.  </span></p>

They found employment, first, in a hotel and later with a company called Tex Plastic Products Limited.  The father continues to work for the same company as a shift supervisor.

The father agreed and flight tickets were purchased for the mother and A to visit Poland for three weeks in September 2009.  </span></p>

There is a dispute between the parties as to the details of this incident.  The father claims that he overheard the mother telling her parents over the telephone that she intended to stay permanently in Poland when she returned at the end of the month.  He says that he made it clear to the mother that he did not agree to her going to Poland in those circumstances, and an incident occurred which led to the police being called.  The mother alleges that in the course of this incident the father assaulted her on the back of the head on a number of occasions.  The father denies any assault took place, and a police computerised record concerning the incident states, inter alia: &#8220;Male has never been violent towards her&#8221;.  Following this incident, the mother and A left the property and went to stay at a refuge.  Although some evidence has been put before me concerning the incident, I have not been asked to make any findings about it.  </span></p>

In addition, however, using a computer, he prepared a document which purported to be a further order by Judge Wildblood requiring the mother to attend the hospital for a &#8220;mental and physical check&#8221;.  The document is a crude and obvious forgery.  The father admits that he fabricated this document and says he did so in a state of mental distress and shock.  </span></p>

In December 2009 the father travelled to Poland and stayed with his own parents, also living in Szczecin, for about three weeks.  During that period he had contact with A, although the parties dispute the details of the contact that took place.  The father also had a number of conversations with the mother during which the possibility of her returning this country was discussed.  On a date unknown but believed to be in December 2009, the father filed an application in the court in Poland under the Hague Convention seeking the return of A to this country.  As a result, the mother&#8217;s application for an order limiting his parental authority was adjourned. Subsequently, the father returned to Poland in January and February 2010 and had contact with A on two occasions.  </span></p>

The mother cross-applied for leave to remove or retain the child permanently in France.  After a fully contested hearing, Singer J. refused to order the child&#8217;s return to England and instead made a residence order in favour of the mother and a contact order in favour of the father.

The courts of the Member State away from which a child has been unlawfully removed or retained continue to have jurisdiction until the Article 10 conditions are met.  Thus the ability of parents (and any institution or body having rights of custody) to seise the home court notwithstanding that the child has in fact acquired habitual residence in another Member State continues (absent acquiescence) for a minimum period of one year after the holder of rights of custody &#8216;has or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child&#8217;, and the child is settled in the new environment.  At what point, if at all, the parents' ability to seise the home court comes to an end depends upon the attainment of one of the conditions in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv), which follow a logical progression.&#8221;</span></p>

Article 11(7) applies in the first category of cases, but not the second.  Singer J. considered some of the consequences of the distinction in the following observations at para.142:  </span></p>

Thus the provisions for notification to the parties of information received from the Hague court and the obligation to invite them to make submissions do not appear to arise.  If this reading is correct this may be an unintended consequence given that the obligation upon the court which made the non-return order to transmit documents is mandatory under Article 11(6).  But it cannot however have been intended that in such a situation the home parent should be precluded from applying for the child's return after an Article 13 Hague non-return order made in another Member State.  That (perhaps obvious) conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Article 11(8) consequence of streamlined enforceability arises in the case of &#8216;any subsequent judgment which requires a return of the child issued by a court having jurisdiction under [BIIR]&#8217;, which is this situation.&#8221;</span></p>

She would be unwilling to move back into the former family home, which has (she says) unhappy memories for her.  She says that she now has no friends in Barnstaple and would feel isolated here.  At present she is working part time as an English teacher in two schools in Szczecin and hopes to work full time in due course.  She says that if she was forced to return to England she would be unable to obtain employment as a teacher and, although she would be able to obtain some work, it would be at a more menial level and lower salary.  On her behalf it is submitted by Mr. Devereux that a forced return to this jurisdiction would have a devastating effect on the mother, which would in turn severely effect A.  The mother says that she is willing to facilitate contact as she has done in the past.  </span></p>

He observed that A appeared very much at home with the maternal grandparents and from his observation it appears that he appears content in the care of his maternal family in the very same way as with the mother.  The Guardian describes A as being happy and secure and said that his outgoing nature and thirst for knowledge, which was particularly noticeable, suggested that his emotional needs are well met in providing him with a firm base to explore the world.  I observe that, as A has spent nearly all of his life in his mother&#8217;s care, his emotional stability, as demonstrated to the Guardian, must be substantially attributable to the quality of her care and the strength of their relationship.  </span></p>

He would, said the Guardian, risk losing the security of his home and routine and relationships, particularly with the maternal grandmother.  If the mother returned with A it would, in the Guardian&#8217;s opinion, be a sad and difficult time for her which would be likely to have an adverse effect on A.  The Guardian reaches this conclusion at para.108 of his report:</span></p>

I accept the Guardian&#8217;s analysis.  In my judgment, it would plainly be against A&#8217;s best interests for the court to order a summary return.  I think it likely that in the long term it will be in A&#8217;s best interests to remain in Poland with his mother, but that is subject to one important proviso, namely that he enjoys regular contact with his father.  It is always important that whenever possible a child grows up with a close relationship with both parents.  I accept the evidence that A has a close and loving relationship with his father.  It is important that this is sustained by regular contact.  </span></p>

In my judgment, however, she has not always demonstrated that commitment in her actions. In particular her actions in retaining A in Poland in 2009 were not conducive to sustaining a close relationship between A and his father.  In her oral evidence she displayed a lack of insight on the adverse impact which the abduction had had on A and, in particular, his relationship with his father.  The court will now look to her to demonstrate that she means what she says and takes active and positive steps to nurture the relationship between A and his father.  I do not think it would be in A&#8217;s best interests to make a final order (in the terms of Brussels II Revised), a final &#8220;judgment on custody&#8221; until it is satisfied that the mother will take all necessary steps to ensure that A has contact with his father.  I therefore refuse the father&#8217;s application for summary return, but make no final order in respect of residence at this stage.  </span></p>

The father will be living and working Barnstaple in Devon, the mother living and working in Szczecin in Poland.  Each told me that it would not be possible for them to take any further holiday before Christmas.  The mother is working four days a week in two schools and there is (I am told) no further holiday or half term holiday in Polish schools before Christmas.  The father states that he has used up all his holiday entitlement in previous visits to Poland and in attending court hearings, both here and in Poland.  Reluctantly, I accept the father&#8217;s evidence on this point.  Any contact before Christmas will therefore have to take place over a weekend.  Initially, I thought it would be possible for the mother (who works Monday to Thursday) to bring A to England on a Friday and return to Poland on a Sunday thereby allowing A to have contact with the father on the Saturday, and perhaps briefly on the other days.  But, on behalf of the Guardian, Mr. Boyd, argued that this course was not in A&#8217;s best interests.  The journey from Szczecin to Barnstaple is not straightforward.  The easiest route is a bus trip to Berlin taking two hours and then a flight either to London or perhaps Bristol.  Once in this country, however, the mother and A would face a further journey by road or rail to Barnstaple.  Mr. Boyd submits that this sort of journey would be very tiring for a little boy aged only two.  It is submitted that this would not be the best circumstances for the next contact visit.  Mr. Boyd submits that it would be much better for a weekend contact to take place in Poland.  The travelling would be less arduous for the father than for the mother and A together, and the contact could take place in surroundings with which A is more familiar.  I agree.  It is reasonable, in my judgment, to expect the father to take a day or so unpaid leave for that purpose.  </span></p>

Since then the mother and the paternal grandfather have arranged one further visit and have had discussions about another.
