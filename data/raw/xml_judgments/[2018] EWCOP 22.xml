It is not an ordinary form of insurance, but operates like a commercial &#8220;first demand&#8221; bond. In other words, the premium buys a promise from a recognised bank or insurance company to pay up to the stated value of the bond upon a demand made in that respect in accordance with its terms, which usually require merely certification by the claimant that the conditions for payment have fallen in. In the case of a bond under this scheme, the promise is to pay the amount of any loss identified by the Public Guardian and certified by the court, up to the amount of the bond.</p>

The money is paid over almost immediately upon a loss being discovered, and without argument. The scheme provides for payment of forfeited bonds within two weeks. Any argument takes place between the bond provider and any party from whom it may have a right of recoupment, such as the defaulting deputy. The expense of taking action and the risk of non-recoupment are borne by the bond provider.&#8221;</p>

It provides an immediate, and straightforward, mechanism by which the court can ensure that an incapacitous person is compensated for losses that have been incurred through the default of his deputy. It avoids the delay and expense which the incapacitous person would otherwise face in bringing proceedings against a defaulting deputy, who may be of questionable solvency, and enforcing any judgment obtained within those proceedings, The defaulting deputy does not get off scot-free, but he is instead likely to face proceedings brought by the bond provider.&#8221;</p>

Furthermore, as will be seen, the practice direction leaves the issue of whether to extend its provisions to not-for-profit organisations at the court&#8217;s discretion.

Rather, he considered that the discretion provision leaves it to the court to decide &#8220;whether and how&#8221; to extend the fixed costs provisions to non-solicitor, non-public authority deputies. Option (e) replicates the wording of the first part of option (d) <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">without</span> restriction to the circumstances set out in parenthesis.

Even if the Public Guardian&#8217;s contention that the court may not order assessment alongside fixed costs at the lower rate was correct (which I have decided it is not), that same approach must apply. &#8220;Simply otiose&#8221; is simply not tenable.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in">Clearly the court is not obliged to provide for authorisation of a deputy by reference to the fixed fees of the Practice Direction. Rule 19.13 expressly sets out alternative options of remuneration at a &#8220;fixed amount&#8221; or a &#8220;specified rate.&#8221; However, each of these alternatives may be perceived as having some practical disadvantages. Authorisation of remuneration of a &#8220;fixed amount&#8221; means it is more likely that there will need to be future applications to court (with attendant cost to P) because in a particular year the vicissitudes of life present more demands on the deputyship than usual, or simply to update the amount to reflect rising costs over time. To some extent these difficulties can be addressed by index-linking (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re AR</span>) but the orders, and the steps necessary to quantify authorised fee, necessarily become more complex.  Authorisation of a &#8220;specified rate&#8221; on the other hand does not inherently carry any limit on how much of that specified rate would be reasonable. These disadvantages are mitigated if remuneration is by reference to the Practice Direction fixed rates, which are updated periodically.</p>

He points out that the assessment of a bill by a costs officer does not mean that the fee is legitimate &#8211; the costs officer deals in quantum, not liability; and the certification of an amount does not amount to authorisation to take that sum from P&#8217;s funds.  </p>

The Public Guardian does not accept that, and neither do I. The absence of a challenge to an account filed for supervisory purposes is not the same as a court authorisation to charge the fee. At best, the deputy may point to the absence of prompt challenge in support of a claim for relief from liability. </p>

In that context, it is in my judgment plain from paragraph 11 of the Practice Direction that if &#8220;detailed assessment in relation to an estate with net assets of a value of less than &#163;16000&#8221; is to be an available option, there must be &#8220;a specific order&#8221; for such. The &#8220;However&#8221; indicates that the threshold of &#163;16 000 net worth marks a threshold at which a different approach is expected.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in">There is an obvious logic to this approach in the protection for P of a basic level of funds. When funds are reduced to &#163;16 000, in the ordinary run of events the demands of deputyship, and therefore the reasonableness of seeking costs higher than the stipulated percentage rate, are likely to be few. It is a sensible protective measure to require that any deputy who does seek assessment in those circumstances, with the attendant costs of the procedure and the aim of higher charges, should be obliged to explain to the court why.</p>

I acknowledge that the provisions of the Practice Direction relating to the lower, public authority rate do not include an equivalent provision to paragraph 11. In my judgment, that absence of provision should be seen in the wider context of the binary conception of the Practice Direction ie in the context of public authorities a different approach to assessment at all, rather than a different approach to estates of less than &#163;16 000. Once the court has determined that, for a non-solicitor non-public authority it is appropriate in a particular case to include the option for assessment, it must follow on grounds of consistency that the same approach as provided in paragraph 11 is to be applied.       </p>
