Mrs A is aged 25 years and was born and raised in Leeds.  Her husband arrived from Pakistan to the UK in May 2006.  Mr A was 14 years of age, at that stage.  In 2006 Mr A obtained indefinite leave to remain from the Home Office.  The couple are first cousins; they were married in August 2015.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings commenced in consequence of a referral received by Leeds City Council from the West Yorkshire Police, following allegations of sexual assault and rape made against Mr A by his 14 year old niece EF.  EF had complained to a teacher that she had been sexually abused and raped by her uncle (Mr A) over a period of approximately 9 years.  Thus, it was alleged, the abuse began when she was only 4 years old.   Following these allegations a referral was made to the Social Services at Bradford Metropolitan District Council (BMDC).  EF had been interviewed by the Police, pursuant to the Achieving Best Evidence Guidance (ABE) on the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2016. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">EF&#8217;s allegations became known to her Head of Year in consequence of his being told by another student what EF had been saying.  EF participated in an ABE interview which took place on the 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2016, as I have mentioned, at around 6 O&#8217;clock in the evening.  The interview lasted for 1 hour and 10 minutes.  It has been transcribed, in full, and filed within these proceedings.  EF also undertook an intimate medical examination the following day at around 2pm in the afternoon.  The Consultant Paediatrician described EF as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;understandably nervous and quite tense&#8217;</span>.  The short report records that it required a couple of attempts for EF to be comfortable enough to be able to cooperate with colposcopic examination. </p>

There were no abnormalities of the anus and no evidence of reflex anal dilatation when examined in the left lateral position.  Swabs were obtained for microbiology, STD investigation and there was also a urine sample taken.  None of these tests revealed anything of clinical significance.  The pregnancy test was negative.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The colposcopic video recording was viewed by a second designated doctor whose responsibility is for safeguarding.   That second doctor agreed that there were apparent defects to the hymen (as I have set out above) but concluded that, without the use of a swab to see if the defect opens more clearly, it would be difficult accurately to conclude that there was a defect present.  Consideration was given to a further examination which was not ultimately pursued.  It is perhaps important to record that despite her discomfort it is noted that EF was &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">happy to be liaised with for this arrangement to be made&#8217;</span>.  The ultimate conclusion of the two doctors was that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the colposcopic examination of the hymen findings was not clear&#8230;examination can be repeated but should be borne in mind that the examination findings on colposcopy can be normal despite sexual abuse&#8217;.</span>  The medical evidence was disclosed into these proceedings by the Police and, in accordance with practice, had been redacted.  The names of the doctors have been deleted, they remain unknown these proceedings otherwise it is likely they would have been identified in this judgment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016 EF signed a statement in which she confirmed that she did not wish to proceed with a prosecution.  That led to a decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to pursue a case.  It is notable, as the Local Authority emphasises, that EF did not retract her allegations.  She stated simply that she did not want to give evidence at a criminal trial.  For the avoidance of doubt EF has never retracted her complaint. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The allegations faced by Mr A are profoundly serious.  To be clear they involve allegations of rape and buggery over a period of 7 to 9 years, commencing when the alleged victim was still of primary school age.  It is also alleged that these violations took place with great frequency, approximately every month.  With this in mind, concerns quickly arose in relation to the children within the wider family as well as in relation to Mr A&#8217;s own child when she was born in June 2016.  What is described as &#8216;a Contract of Expectations&#8217; was drawn up, which had the objective of preventing Mr A residing in any property where children under the age of 18 were living.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The range of the enquiry in this case has not extended to any detailed scrutiny of the safeguards put in place for the children in this extensive family.  However, it is clear that Mr A has had wide and effectively unmonitored contact with a significant number of children during the course of these proceedings, all of which has been known to the Applicant.  A senior representative of the relevant Local Authority attempted, in a somewhat perfunctory manner, to justify the approach.  There is, in my judgement, no cogent rationalisation or extenuation here. I was told that the Local Authority had taken the view that maintaining the stability of this wide and seemingly cohesive family was considered to be important.  No doubt it is, but it provides no coherent explanation for exposing these children to risk of harm of the gravity contemplated here.  It is a clear example of woolly and confused thinking.  It falls far short of what these children, in particular and society more generally, is entitled to expect from the agencies charged with child protection.  It is an extremely serious safeguarding failure.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Proceedings commenced by this Local Authority were predicated on the allegations made by EF.  Accordingly, those allegations were set down to be heard before me at a discrete fact finding hearing.  In October the parents, through their counsel, made an application that EF should be required by the Court to give oral evidence, in order that Mr A&#8217;s case could be put to her.  The parties agreed between themselves that this was a &#8216;single issue case&#8217; in which the veracity of the complaint was crucial, both to the findings the Court might make and the reach of the subsequent orders if such findings were made.  </p>

This, I have concluded, is based not in their inability to help her but in their resolve not to, directly in consequence of the allegations themselves and their impact on the wider family.  This serves to reinforce my earlier conclusion, which no party has sought to revisit.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Garnham, on behalf of the father, has made a number of insinuations to the effect that EF&#8217;s interview fell short of the standards set by the guidelines.  However, as Ms Anning rightly emphasises, none of those has crystallised into any actual criticism.  There was, she effectively contends, a war cry but, on this point, no actual battle.  I agree.  This does not absolve me from evaluating the quality of the ABE interview.  I considered that it was strikingly direct in both content and tone.  Unlike many interviews of this kind the questioner eschewed offers of support or displays of reassurance to the Complainant.  Many interviewers, I have noticed, find this difficult when confronted with a distressed child.  Here however, the approach was, in my judgement, both professional and effective.  In addition the interview, without being forced or becoming stilted, followed the graduated approach advised by the ABE guidance.  In particular, there was an easy but un-patronising rapport building stage, open questioning and leading questions asked only at the end and for clarification (which, perhaps predictably, were unproductive).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I say at once that I found EF&#8217;s complaints to be entirely compelling.  Indeed, I am bound to say that rarely have I seen a more coherent and self evidently reliable interview of this kind.  EF gave her account without anger, self pity or bitterness.  She responded to direct, sometimes blunt questions in an equally direct manner.  Conspicuously, her account was fretted with spontaneous detail e.g.  her abuse first took place when she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">was watching Scooby Doo&#8221;</span> on the sofa <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I was just lying down, I was like four, five&#8221;. </span> When asked how she knew how old she was at the time she responded <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I just remember being really little&#8230; Ms S in year one or my reception teacher, Ms K.  </span> On another occasion she recalled playing in her room with a Bratz doll which had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a wig.. where you do the hair&#8217;</span>.  She describes how this particular incident began: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;and then he said what you doing , I help you, said no its ok I can do it by myself and he goes like oh like, let me help you and I says no I can do it by myself, I was like no I can do it and he was like let me help you and then he just, I said ok then and he said ok I wont help you and he just grabbed me and put me on the bed and just&#8230;&#8221;.  </span>By this stage<span style="font-style:italic"/>EF was physically stronger, a little older and beginning to resist.  The significance of her recall is that this was the first occasion when Mr A was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;more like aggressive&#8230;I was kicking and he was just holding me down like and pinning me down&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Anning and Ms Aldred, the child&#8217;s solicitor, both point to what they describe as a fluency in EF&#8217;s narrative.  They are right to do so, but what is also striking is the progression that she outlines from touching her when she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;didn&#8217;t know what he was doing&#8217; </span>to undressing her and eventually raping her.  This follows a pattern which is recognised as &#8216;grooming&#8217; and would have been, manifestly, beyond EF&#8217;s knowledge.  Similarly, she describes how Mr A told her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it&#8217;s nothing, its nothing, everyone does it&#8221;.  </span>Again<span style="font-style:italic"/>this reinforces, to my mind, her account of a dominant and persuasive adult in terms which are characteristic of the techniques of a predatory abuser.  In similar vein, EF described how <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;his time he likes finishes, he used to get up and goes you cant tell anyone about this or you&#8217;ll get in trouble&#8221;.</span> This is a recognisable strategy by which abusers control their victims and would not be known to EF.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">EF&#8217;s use of language was straightforward and spontaneous in her interview but when addressing issues in the sexual sphere, her vocabulary was limited but, in my assessment, in a way that was consistent with her age and, from what I have heard, her otherwise sheltered childhood.  For example, she did not understand the word &#8216;erection&#8217; or &#8216;hard on&#8221;, as the Police Officer put it to her.  However she described Mr A&#8217;s penis as &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;dry&#8221;.  She continued <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;when it was wet it just went in and you could feel that it was wet&#8217; </span>causing him to go to the bathroom to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;make it wet&#8217;</span> as she put it.   When Mr A&#8217;s attention was drawn to this passage, during the course of his evidence, he agreed that his description was so clear and graphic as strongly to indicate an actual experience.  Even he could not contemplate that EF might have fabricated this description.  This led the Mr A to accede to the hypothesis that if it was not with him EF must have had sexual experiences with somebody else.  I make it clear there is no other person with whom EF has that kind of trusted and unmonitored contact.</p>

They did not file statements as ordered, only finally complying under judicial pressure and late in the day.   The statements were themselves entirely superficial.

I was told the father wished to return to work in his taxi.   That struck me as an odd priority at a hearing where his daughter&#8217;s allegations of sexual abuse made against her uncle (his brother) were finally to be determined.  Though, at least initially, no counsel had required them to give evidence.  I indicated that I would like to hear from them, if only better to understand why EF, who began her complaint confidently had subsequently recoiled from both the criminal and family law process.   In order that they were not disadvantaged in the witness box I encouraged them to watch their daughter&#8217;s interview in court with me.  In her evidence Mrs B told me that having watched the interview she <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;still had questions&#8221;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;was still not sure&#8221;</span>.

In this she has woefully failed, albeit with the apparent acquiescence of the relevant Local Authority whose intervention has been supine to the point of irresponsibility.  I should clarify that whilst it is not this applicant Local Authority, they too have been aware of the situation, which extends to children in their own area, and have done absolutely nothing to address it.</p>
