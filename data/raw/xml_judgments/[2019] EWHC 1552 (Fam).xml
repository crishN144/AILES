	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The background to this matter can be stated shortly.  Mr Lennard&#8217;s son, who I shall call Y, was made the subject of a care order in favour of the London Borough of Wandsworth in 2016.  A care order was made in respect of his daughter at the same time.  Within the context of the local authority sharing parental responsibility for Y, in early January 2019 an issue is said to have arisen regarding the commencement of ADHD medication for Y.  A meeting was held between Mr Lennard, the local authority and a doctor in January to consider the issue of parental consent.  Mr Lennard contends that that meeting ended in acrimony.  He considered that he had been overloaded with information. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 13 February 2019 Mr Lennard contends that he received a text message from the social worker informing him that &#8220;senior management&#8221; had given authorisation for Y to commence his ADHD medication.  In his first statement, Mr Lennard states that he felt this decision did not sufficiently involve him in circumstances where he continued to share parental responsibility for Y. </p>

That case concerned two Customs and Excise officers, accompanied by a bailiff, who attended the defendant's farm to recover outstanding value added tax.  Whilst two Customs officers conducted their business inside the farmhouse the bailiff waited outside in the car. The car was parked in the farmyard where the bailiff was unable to hear any of the conversation in the farmhouse.  When the Customs officers ascertained from the defendant that he was unable to pay the VAT due they informed him that the bailiff would have to enter the farmhouse to distrain on his goods. The defendant replied that, &#8220;If the bailiff gets out of the car he's a dead un.&#8221; No threats were made to the two officers.  The bailiff did not hear the words spoken by the defendant.  The defendant was convicted by the magistrates of using threatening words towards the bailiff and appealed by way of case stated.   </p>

We have not found those citations particularly helpful as they were both concerned with an earlier Act, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Edw8and1Geo6/1/6" uk:canonical="1936 (1 Edw. 8 &amp; 1 Geo. 6) c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Public Order Act 1936</ref>. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/64" uk:canonical="1986 c. 64" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 1986 Act</ref> in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/64/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 4</ref> and 5 supersedes <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Edw8and1Geo6/1/6/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Edw8and1Geo6/1/6" uk:canonical="1936 (1 Edw. 8 &amp; 1 Geo. 6) c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1936 Act</ref>. The wording in the new Act is quite different. The phrase &#8216;uses towards another person&#8217; is entirely new and the construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/64/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref> is therefore not assisted, in my judgment, by considering decisions of this Court in regard to the construction of an earlier statute. This statute has, we are told, not been construed by any court and the phrase &#8220;uses towards another person&#8221; has not been found by counsel in any other statutory provision which would give any helpful indication as to its true meaning in this context. So the exercise is one of purely looking at the wording of the section and deciding what the plain and natural meaning of the words is, bearing in mind that if there were any doubt that doubt would have to be resolved, since this is a penal provision, in favour of the appellant.  In my judgment the submissions made by Mr. Murray are correct. The phrase &#8220;uses towards another person&#8221; means, in the context of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/64/section/4/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4(1)</ref>(a) &#8216;uses in the presence of and in the direction of another person directly.&#8217; I do not think, looking at the section as a whole, the words can bear the meaning </p>

My task is to decide whether there has been a breach of the order of 6 July 2018 having regard to the terms of the order and the evidence before the court.  Having considered the helpful submissions of counsel and the documentary evidence available to the court, I am satisfied that Mr Wauchope has made good his submission that there has not been a breach in this case having regard to the plain terms of the order. </p>

It is not disputed that at the time (as he accepts) Mr Lennard used words that were at least &#8220;foul&#8221;, Grace Okoro-Anyaeche was not present.  In those circumstances, was the spoken foul language directed by Mr Lennard &#8220;towards&#8221; the social worker for the purposes of the protective injunction from which she benefited?  I am satisfied that the answer is no.  </p>

However, using the word &#8220;towards&#8221; in its narrower, and in my judgment, plain sense, the words spoken by Mr Lennard could not have been used towards Grace Okoro-Anyaeche because she was not present at the time and the statements made were verbal in nature.  It might, I suppose, be said that the words spoken by Mr Lennard could be taken to have been used towards Grace Okoro-Anyaeche in that, whilst she was not present to hear them, what was said was passed on to her by others.   </p>

Conduct such as, for example, Mr Lennard publishing his abuse on social media and Grace Okoro-Anyaeche thereafter reading the same, or posting a letter to her with the same result, would be caught in these circumstances.  However, verbal abuse by Mr Lennard direct at Grace Okoro-Anyaeche when she is not present will not.  On the local authority&#8217;s single pleaded allegation, the court here is concerned here with words <span style="font-style:italic">spoken</span> about, but in the absence of, Grace OkoroAnyaeche. </p>

On the one hand, I must, of course, be conscious of the protective function of injunction, and that that protective function argues for a broad, purposive application of its terms.  The court grants an injunction to provide protection and relief in circumstances where it is satisfied that such protection and relief is merited.  However, against this, the injunction carries with it very serious penal consequences and can, within the current context, result in the imprisonment of the person bound by the injunction for a period of up to two years.  The long list of procedural requirements that I set out at the beginning of this judgment further illuminates the strict approach the court takes to the examination of breaches that can result in a term of incarceration.  </p>

Once again, it is the meaning of a provision with penal consequences with which the court is here concerned, namely the order of Parker J dated 6 July 2018 with its attached penal notice. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Within this context and having regard to the terms of the order made by Parker J, it seems to me that given the type of conduct alleged in the single allegation of contempt, namely <span style="font-style:italic">verbal</span> abuse, in order to find a breach, the conduct in question needs to have occurred in the presence of, and to have been directed at the person protected by the injunction. I accept this is a narrow interpretation rather a broad, purposive interpretation of the word &#8220;towards&#8221; and that this construction may be said to reduce the protective efficacy of the injunction.  However, I am also clear that the penal consequences of the injunction argue against extending the effect of the injunction to words that were not spoken in the presence of the person protected by that order.   </p>

Whilst it may be the case that spoken words will be passed on, once again given the penal consequences of the order there would be obvious difficulties in committing a person to prison on the basis of words that they had spoken being passed on by a third party to the person protected by the injunction who was not themselves present.  </p>

In circumstances where that is the only breach alleged, I must conclude that the application of the local authority is not proved to the requisite standard and that application must stand dismissed. </p>
