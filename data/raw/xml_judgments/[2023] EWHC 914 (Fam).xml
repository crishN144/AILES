The purpose of that trip and the circumstances in which it was undertaken were the focus of much of the evidence given before me. The mother&#8217;s case is that on arrival the father took both the children&#8217;s passports and hers. The family stayed with the paternal family for about a week and there was then an argument and the mother said she was thrown out of the family home. She remained away from the family home, and she says separated from the children, until she moved back in on what both she and the father have described as a reconciliation between the parties in or about the end of November or December 2018.</span></p>

He denies taking and keeping the passports in Iraq. They were, he says, always freely available to the mother and she knew where they were. He denies that he threw the mother out of the house after about a week of arrival in Iraq. He says what happened was that the mother left in either July or August of her own accord. There had been what he describes as some difficulties. He says, and the mother agrees, that the parties were reconciled at the end of 2018, in about December, and that they remained living together with the children as a family until the mother again left of her own volition in February 2021, after the parties once again had problems in their relationship. She, on that occasion, left the children with him. In his statement filed defending these proceedings, he flatly denies all allegations made by the mother.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s solicitors, following the move of the children to their maternal family in Iraq, returned the matter back to court on 2 August 2022, when the matter came before Roberts J. The children were made wards of court, a return order was made and a request on the face of a separate order that the British Consulate in Erbil should issue emergency travel documents for the two girls so that they could both return to England in the care of their mother. That order was one which the mother informed the court she would facilitate by travelling to Iraq to return the children and, accordingly, the earlier port alerts made in respect of the children were lifted.</span></p>

Pursuant to the directions of Judd J, she identified the four questions to be determined before me: (1) on what factual basis the children travelled to Iraq in 2018; (2) whilst in Iraq, why the children remained there until 2022; (3) what were the circumstances that caused the mother to be separated from the children; and (4) who retains their travel documents and passports.</span></p>

Whilst I am aware that there are, in the wider welfare context, as is obvious from the fact there has been an interim CAFCASS report, allegations of domestic abuse and welfare decisions to be made for the children, those have not formed part of that which I have heard at this hearing. There is agreement between counsel that following on from any determinations of fact at this hearing, welfare decisions should be made at the Family Court local to the family home and that those decisions should not form part of this hearing and I entirely agree with that. The evidence that I have heard has been confined to questions identified following the PHR before Judd J.</span></p>

In a most effective passage of cross-examination, he was asked when it was that the mother told him she would like to stay longer. The answer to that was &#8220;At the time when we were reconciled and came back together&#8221;. So that exact date, he said, he could not remember, but was sometime in November or December.</span></p>

The father&#8217;s answer was that she did not want to see the children during that time and, therefore, she did not. When it was pointed out to him that he had, in essence, just admitted that for those months she could not have said that she wanted to stay in Iraq and remain there longer, that could not be true, the father said he could not remember. He accepted that during those four months with the children he remained in his property with his parents and he said he could not now remember whether it was the case that the mother was expressing a wish to see them, although he had to accept that his earlier evidence was that before travelling she had been their primary carer.</span></p>

I found that piece of evidence difficult to fit with the fact that elsewhere in his evidence he had accepted that he was not used to caring for the children and required help and support to do it when he was on his own. Either way, that piece of evidence did not help me with what happened in the overall picture, nor did I believe it.</span></p>

He did not contact the nursery or the school to say that the children were staying longer in Iraq, nor was he able to give the answer to why he did not do that. What he said when he was asked by Mr Basi was &#8220;It has been a long time and I can&#8217;t remember why I didn&#8217;t tell them&#8221;. I did not find that a helpful or believable answer. He said he had to travel here for business to deal with the rent on his flat and for his shop. He said he did not, in his second answer, when he was asked why he did not go to the school to tell them that the mother had arranged for the children to stay on in Iraq, was that because &#8220;All the time I was wanting to return with the children so they would not miss out on any time here at school&#8221;. That answer, I regret to say, makes no sense at all, because during the whole of this time the children were with the father and he knew perfectly well how to achieve the best outcome for them.</span></p>

During the time he was in England, he was spoken to by the police to ask where the children were. In the course of this hearing, I have had produced to me text communications between the police and the mother on 23 November 2018, when the police were plainly worried about where the children were and whether they were safe.</span></p>

I find that the children travelled to Iraq in 2018, so far as the mother was concerned, for the purposes of a holiday. It was intended and understood by her that they would be there probably for about the school holiday period. I find that more likely than not the father did not intend that they should return to England at the conclusion of that trip.</span></p>

The father, who made return trips to the United Kingdom and who, by the time that the school holidays were over, had, on his own case, been left by their mother, did not then either bring the children back to start school or take steps to renew that passport.</span></p>

The father, on balance, more likely than not never intended that the children should return and that, to the extent that there was a wish to see the mother&#8217;s father, that was as part of the intended holiday. In that respect, I reject the father&#8217;s case that there came a time when the mother said to him she wished to stay longer in Iraq, because even on his case, as exposed by Mr Basi&#8217;s skillful question of him, the time at which he suggests the mother said that could not possibly have been the case, because she had already been separated from him and the children for some time until the reconciliation in November/December, when he says that took place.</span></p>

I simply do not accept that this mother was able to leave and had access to her passport before February 2021. Accordingly, I take the view that the father did indeed strand the children and the mother and the reason, in answer to the second question, that they were there until 2022 is that they were only retrieved from Iraq when they were within the mother&#8217;s family and she, having sought the assistance of the English courts and had legal advice here, was able to take steps to retrieve them.</span></p>

First of all, between July and December or November 2018, I find the circumstances were that there was, as she asserts, a row following which she was not able to see the children and only on reconciliation was she able to see them. Accordingly, I find that she was kept from them by the father and his family and that, following February 2021, which is the other period of separation, that she was not able to see them again until they were back within the maternal family in or about June 2022. It follows that I prefer the mother&#8217;s account to the father in relation to the separation of the children. I expressly reject the father&#8217;s case that the mother had said she wanted nothing to do with the children and deliberately abandoned them.</span></p>

They are, in any event, expired. I note that the father, in giving evidence, as I touched on earlier, to Mr Basi&#8217;s questions, had said at first that he appreciated it was important for the mother to get new passports for the children and agreed that he would bring them back, having been asked explicitly if he still had the expired passports. Although the father later went on to say that he had not understood that question and did not mean to say that he would bring them back, I do not agree that he misunderstood. I think he caught himself out with his own answer.</span></p>

Whether the father still has them or has disposed of them, may not matter much, because they are expired. It may ultimately be that they have to be replaced by reason of having been lost, as well as expired, but I find that certainly they are not with the mother and that they are likely, until the very recent past, to have been in the father&#8217;s possession and certainly were in the father&#8217;s possession during the time that the parties were in Iraq.</span></p>
