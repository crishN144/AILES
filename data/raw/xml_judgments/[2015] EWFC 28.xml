I am satisfied that she and D and their families participated in a customary marriage ceremony on 4 January 2005 in N&#8217;s tribal village in Enugu State and that, to use the words of the statute, this was at its inception a valid marriage.  I find that N&#8217;s account and that of her witnesses is fundamentally truthful and I reject the accounts given by D and his witnesses where they conflict on any decisive matter.</span></p>

His report is thorough and helpful.  It was not challenged by the parties and I accept his opinions.  Speaking of introductions, he describes an event that is a common but not compulsory part of customary marriage and which can vary very widely in the degree of formality involved.  There are no hard and fast rules.  It involves the prospective groom in a prearranged visit to the family of the bride in the company of prominent members of his own family.  They are received and welcomed in a reasonably formal way and a kola nut will be produced and shared: this fruit is revered in the Igbo community.  However, the manner of the introduction will not affect the validity of the marriage.</span></p>

In the Nigerian and Christian traditions that these families respect, the expectation (but not the rule) is that children will be born into a marriage.  The visit in November 2002 constituted an introduction between the two families that clothed the situation of the young people and the expected child with acceptance and respectability.  Although introductions can be far more formal, this event was within the range of possibilities.  It signalled that marriage was on the cards.  The fact that it occurred over two years later is not significant: in the case of D&#8217;s sister S (who did not attend her own introduction in Lagos) the period between the two events was four or five years.</span></p>

This would not prevent the event from being regarded as an introduction, given the degree of latitude that exists.  If I am wrong about this, the event was nevertheless one of equivalent significance to both families and the precise formulation does not affect the validity of the subsequent marriage.</span></p>

He is not the only young man to have felt pressure to marry from a pregnant partner and the older generation.  He is not the only young man to have done the decent thing.</span></p>

While there was nothing particularly improbable in N&#8217;s account, the issue was not mentioned in her written evidence and it arose for the first time when she was in the witness box.  There is simply not enough information to allow a reliable conclusion to be reached.  As I am clear that the prospect of a marriage had been in the air from 2002 onwards, the timing of a proposal and the gift of a ring does not significantly alter the overall picture.  These are traditions associated with a "white" wedding and it is clear that that route was not under active consideration until much later.</span></p>

This is particularly so when the family of the bride occupy a position of prominence in the village or in the locality.  There will be a distinctive "family uniform" for the bride's family and all those associated with her (this was typically a Yoruba tradition).  The ceremony will usually begin with music and entertainment which is continued through the arrival of the groom and his entourage.  The bride's family and close relations will receive them often dancing towards them singing or issuing words of greeting and welcome.  This is usually led by prominent women and their helpers on the bride&#8217;s side.  At this point, the bride will not be present, as she is kept out of sight for the time being.  The groom's family will present their gifts and dowry which are checked and accepted.  An appropriate time the bride will make her entrance, dancing towards the assembled families with her &#8220;asoebi&#8221; girls or ladies (similar to bridesmaids).  She will greet everyone as she dances before taking her place seated with her family.  She will be colourfully but simply dressed and often is adorned with jewellery consisting of necklaces, beads and even anklets.</span></p>

The couple will then greet their families together effectively now as man and wife.  Further pressure and blessings will be offered up for them and they will dance to the appreciation of the families who may demonstrate their approval by "spraying" the couple with money.  The couple are now married and may proceed to other formalities such as the cutting of the wedding cake and so on.&#8221;</span></p>

N says, and I accept, that this stood on a shelf in the living room of the family home.  It contains 30 photographs, one of which is stuck to the outer front cover, and a copy of the wedding invitation.  It shows signs of wear and tear and has clearly not been created for this litigation.</span></p>

Again, the album is clearly not a recent creation.  N could not remember when or by whom it was created, but it came to her attention when she saw the children looking through it.  The evidence now shows that these photographs were taken by D&#8217;s brother-in-law L or on his camera.  The album comes from the family home, but it may not have been kept with the other album in the living room.</span></p>

This was not just a party or an introduction.  It was a formal and joyful celebration.  Taken individually, the photographs contain details that are without exception highly suggestive</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">of the form of customary marriage described by Professor Nsugbe and many of the photographs are inexplicable in any other way.  Taken as a set, the collection is exactly what one would expect as the record of a wedding.  The assiduous way in which different family groups are posed and photographed speaks of nothing less.  The fact that the photographs found their way into the family home in two albums, one conspicuously labelled, speaks for itself.</span></p>

Instead, there were good relations between the two families, both of whom knew what they were doing.  There was no need for D or his family to visit to see his father, as they had met before in London.  There is no such thing as a "respect ceremony": the only two recognised events are introductions and traditional marriages.  </span></p>

On the other hand, it is entirely appropriate, and consistent with the December e-mails, that D should have paid so that the requirements of the dowry would be met.    </span></p>

When seeking an order to remove D from the family home, she made more than one sworn statement saying that she had nowhere else to go with the children.  In fact, in 2009 she had obtained a social housing flat to which she was not entitled and which she surrendered in 2014 to avoid the consequences.  She may have had her reasons for lying to get the flat and for lying to the court, but that does not excuse her.  However, having considered the matter, I do not find that it discredits her evidence about the events with which I am concerned.  On those issues, I found N to be a fairly straightforward, somewhat flat, witness whose evidence showed no sign of malice or exaggeration.  Likewise, her mother gave evidence more in sorrow than in anger, saying that up to a year ago she had had a really good relationship with D and had a lot of respect for him.  I was also satisfied that brother A and cousin J were essentially telling me the truth.  The tone of their evidence was one of weary resignation that D should challenge something that had so obviously occurred.</span></p>

Sister R was reluctant even to say that she had been invited to the event.  Brother-in-law L made a point of saying that he only attended because he was in Nigeria at the time with his wife.

This provision would be brought into play by the cohabitation of these parties, but there is abundant actual evidence relating to this marriage and I do not find it necessary to rely on any presumption in reaching my conclusions.</span></p>
