	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.01in">The defence is raised that the child was not habitually resident in Malta at the material time and/or underArticle 13(b) of the Convention. This of course is a summary process but I have allowed limited oral evidence from the parents on the factual issue of the child's habitual residence. Both counsel, Miss Renton for the father and Mr Gration for the mother, claimed that the documents spoke for themselves and that they entirely support their respective and opposite cases. Obviously, I needed to hear from the parents to provide the much needed context of those documents and I have been greatly assisted by it. Indeed, in many respects it has been key to my decision.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.01in">I am concerned with a little girl aged just 21 months old, Z, who was born on [a date in] 2017. She is thebeloved daughter of her parents, AB, the applicant father and XY, the respondent mother. The father hails from Malta, the mother from England. They met on an Internet matching site in August 2015 in England and married in England via civil ceremony on [a date in] 2017, 13 days before Z was born. By November 2018, they had effectively separated and the mother had started English divorce proceedings, issued on 2 November 2018 and served on the father in Thailand on 24 November 2018. By anyone's reckoning, this has been a relatively short whirlwind romance. The reality for young Z is that she will grow up with her parents not living together. I sincerely hope and expect that she will be spending a great deal of time in each of her parent's care during her childhood.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in;margin-right:0.01in">I caution myself at the outset, Z is very young; to say that she has integrated because of an appointment hereor there, for example dentist in Malta, when she only had one tooth, a paediatrician's appointment in Malta, when she was six months old (the paediatrician advising the parents that she should then start to socialise), to my mind would be placing, from her perspective, too much weight on factors which would have had a far more important bearing on my thinking had she been older. It is the overall picture of her integration with which I am concerned.</p>

She has remained here since, now around about six months. The father arrived on 27 October in England but then left from London on a pre-booked family trip to Thailand on 4 November, which was due to return on 24 February 2019. The mother and child were booked on that flight but did not go. No further flight to Malta from London had been booked to take place, but it is the father's case that Z was a habitually resident in Malta at the time and that the mother retained the child in England and then declared her decision not to go on with the relationship by issuing English proceedings for divorce on 2 November 2018.</p>

		  <p style="margin-left:1.26in;margin-right:0.83in">"One of the well-judged submissions of Mr Tyler QC on behalf of the respondent is that, were it minded to remove any gloss from the domestic concept of habitual residence (such as, I interpolate, Lord Brandon's third preliminary point in the <span style="font-style:italic">J</span> case <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 2 AC 562" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 2 AC 562</ref> ), the court should strive not to introduce others. A gloss is a purported sub-rule which distorts application of the rule. The identification of a child's habitual residence is overarchingly a question of fact. In making the following three suggestions about the point at which habitual residence might be lost and gained, I offer not sub-rules but expectations which the fact-finder may well find to be unfulfilled in the case before him: (a) the deeper the child's integration in the old state, probably the less fast his achievement of the requisite degree of integration in the new state; (b) the greater the amount of adult pre-planning of the move, including pre-arrangements for the child's day-to-day life in the new state, probably the faster his achievement of that requisite degree; and (c) were all the central members of the child's life in the old state to have moved with him, probably the faster his achievement of it and, conversely, were any of them to have remained behind and thus to represent for him a continuing link with the old state, probably the less fast his achievement of it."</p>

This will involve a real and detailed consideration of (inter alia): the child's day to day life and experiences; family environment; interests and hobbies; friends etc. and an appreciation of which adults are most important to the child. The approach must always be child driven. I emphasise this because all too frequently and this case is no exception, the statements filed focus predominantly on the adult parties. It is all too common for the Court to have to drill deep for information about the child's life and routine. This should have been mined to the surface in the preparation of the case and regarded as the primary objective of the statements. I am bound to say that if the lawyers follow this approach more assiduously, I consider that the very discipline of the preparation is most likely to clarify where the child is habitually resident. I must also say that this exercise, if properly engaged with, should lead to a reduction in these enquiries in the courtroom. Habitual residence is essentially a factual issue, it ought therefore, in the overwhelming majority of cases, to be readily capable of identification by the parties'.</p>

However, in that case, the mother's primary position was that she never lost her initial habitual residence during the five years that she lived in the USA, during which she had become married and lived with the father &#8211; see paragraph 19 in that judgment. Of course, the child remained continuously American throughout that period, before being brought to England. Thus, on the facts of it, I find this authority of little use.</p>

However, the Regulation does not lay down any minimum duration. Before habitual residence can be transferred to the host State, it is of paramount importance that the person concerned has it in mind to establish there the permanent or habitual centre of his interests, with the intention that it should be of a lasting character. Accordingly, the duration of a stay can serve only as an indicator in the assessment of the permanence of the residence, and that assessment must be carried out in the light of all the circumstances of fact specific to the individual case.</p>

If there is any doubt about that, he would say that by the time Z came back to Malta in June 2018 and again in August 2018, for a month each time, she gained her Maltese habitual residence then, even if she had lost it before then, which he does not accept.</p>

I found him on occasions to be very frank in his description of how matters developed from his perspective but as I shall explain later, I found his approach to be quite egocentric or self-centred. He said in his oral evidence that his life had changed in a way, in the autumn of 2013 when he ended a seven-year relationship because his then partner did not want any children and wanted marriage and his focus had always been to have a child and so consequently he recalibrated his work environment and started working remotely. He confirmed that he was a Maltese taxpayer and that his net income was approximately &#8364;4,700 a month and he pays approximately 36.5% tax.

She had been working for about 10 years and the understanding, as he said in oral evidence, was that at any point in time if she felt uncomfortable then she also had a possibility of leaving and as a gesture he paid her &#8364;1,000 in cash when she arrived at the airport to enable her to leave if she ever wanted to'.</p>

However, I did not see the letter as supportive of the move, when I read it in full and knowing about the &#8364;1,000, which came up in oral evidence from the father, as I did.

As far as he was concerned, in his oral evidence, all the antenatal care being in England was merely a low key administrative decision. He said in his oral evidence that there is just a good public funded health care system in Malta and that in between January to March 2017, the couple stopped considering Malta as a venue for the birth, simply because the weather was a bit too hot plus the maternal grandmother would not be there and plus a civil marriage would still be in England.

The property is as I said earlier on, in Malta, a delightful property, 2000 square feet, two bedrooms, plus a third one which they use as a dressing room and he confirmed that for the mother to gain Maltese residence, which she had applied for, she had to confirm that she had a Maltese home and she took down the address, the father's address, whereas the father, when he applied for English residence, which he has applied for and been granted, conversely, he said he put down his hotel in London, his family hotel. The father hails from a family based business. His family has a business based in Malta and the most successful strand of that was, as he put it, hotel and mixed used developments, and international hotels, which is why he is able to avail himself of preferential rates to stay at those family hotels, not only in England but elsewhere in the world.</p>

At C-134, the father's evidence at paragraph 9, refers to him deciding; obviously this was before Z was born in March 2016, to return to live in Malta because of the 'social exclusion' that he was facing. In other words, he was having difficulties with the mother's family. He said in evidence, it was not a difficulty he was having with them, it was a difficulty they were having with him, which I am afraid illustrates, as I say, his self-centred approach.</p>

I may have those dates wrong but it was a long period that was spent there. C-56, he accepted that he had put down the Hungerford property, that is to say 42 Ramsbury Drive, Hungerford, RG17 OSG, as the property that he was staying at when he was looking at buying a a skiing chalet in the Alps. That was in 2016. He was obviously putting out the fact that that was his permanent residence at that stage and his evidence to me of deciding in March 2016 to <span style="font-style:italic">move back</span> to Malta shows me that he was really not considering himself even at that stage to be living full time in Malta. Yes, 23 October 2016 through to 4 October 2017, is only a 'snapshot' in time and I was cautioned rightly, by Miss Renton. Actually, what I am focussing on, as I remind myself and the parties, is the habitual residence of Z and what she herself experienced during her early months and years and obviously that is linked to her carers, because of her young age. What the parents themselves were doing about their own habitual residence in the months and years leading up to L's arrival in their lives is relevant context for her own habitual residence.</p>

I could understand him saying that. However, as I have said I have to concern myself with L's habitual residence. I can easily see that in the same way that the father is saying Malta is his base, the mother would say that England was hers. Yes, she had rented her property in Hungerford to pay, she said, the mortgage and she gave up her job, she said, to have the freedom of travel with her new partner, which I entirely accept, having seen the type of travelling that they have done, she could not hold down a job at the same time. However her own mother's property, which is where she is now staying, and which is the address that she put down on the divorce petition, has always been available to her and she did not buy a property later, she did not get a job in Malta. Therefore, these issues really shed a limited amount of light on the habitual residence as far as she is concerned.</p>

The main person, as I said, the only person that really comes to mind as having seen Z whilst in Malta, of the family is the father's sister and on the mother's evidence it was every two weeks or so. Conversely, by comparison, the familial environment in England from L's perspective is greater and deeper and more involved. As the father said, I touched on earlier on, <span style="font-style:italic">'I didn't have issues with the mother's family. They have issues with me'.</span> I do not know whether one can read into that, an inability for the father to accept other people's perspectives and to understand what this particular young lady that he married was thinking, when she decided to give birth in England. It was obviously not simply a low-key administrative decision but rather something that she had thought carefully through and she wanted to be surrounded by her nearest and dearest.</p>

Our only concern is that right now, we are uncertain, whether we will be here or in the UK, when Z is at enrolment age. Due to this, we are wondering if the school could reserve a place for Z by registering her, while at the same time considering postponing collection of the contribution enrolment fees until a later date.

Malta in the contemporaneous correspondence between the parents is simply not mentioned. The first time Malta is actually mentioned is when the father goes back to Malta unbeknownst to the mother and completes (on 14 December 2018) an affidavit in support of his Hague Convention application and then flies out, , on 24 or so of December 2018 without trying to see his daughter or making any communications direct about returning to Malta.

She is the primary carer but I ask myself, what does that mean, when one looks at habitual residence? I am guided, of course, by the cases that I mentioned earlier on. Surely a first-time mother who has availed herself of antenatal and postnatal care in England and lives close to her own mother, these all provide the building blocks for the child's habitual residence being in England and integrated in this environment, and if that is to be uprooted, using the seesaw analogy, then there has to be something very similar to be in place in Malta, and I find it was not.</p>

A six-week trip to Italy, right at the end shows that really there was no integration in Malta at any stage really, to the extent that one can be satisfied to say the child became a habitual resident in Malta and lost her English habitual residence that she had gained in her first few months of her life. In many respects the father's honesty on those factual points such as well, 'Mum is the main carer', has assisted me greatly in this finding of habitual residence decision and the jurisdiction decision.</p>

There are two points I have to say about that. One is that how does a low-cost arrangement in October 2018 reflect on the situation in Malta in January 2018, when the family then went back to England for an appreciable period of time? Secondly, of course, it speaks volumes that the mother's social and familial environment, in England, in which she did not need to reserve any nursery place. She does not need one in England, she has two sisters, she has a mother and she has the ability to no doubt have that extra care without needing to resort to nurseries.</p>

This shows to me that the arrival on 17 December 2017 with Z until they went back to England on 17 February was a trip as part of the peripatetic lifestyle that the mother more latterly had enjoyed and one should not read into it any more than that. She confirmed in her oral evidence that she has always been very close to her family and I accept that and as a mother of a young child, he is not the main carer of the child, I can imagine and I have read and I have heard that she has had support from her family especially her mother. That leads one into the English habitual residence having not been disturbed, in which her English habitual residence not having being disturbed. She confirmed she is in England from L's perspective, she has got her grandparents there, her two maternal aunts and her mother has lots of friends and that she spends a lot of time with these people.</p>

The mother said during her oral evidence that she wanted to settle down. I find that obviously the parents were arguing about buying a property and if that is accepted by both of them, the question is, if the mother had moved finally to Malta in 2016 and all that was clear, why on earth would they be arguing two years later about buying a property in England. The reason is probably because they were coming at it from two completely different angles, Father thinking he was based in Malta, Mother believing that she is based in England. From L's perspective, her habitual residence is in England because of the factors I have already mentioned in the legal approach that has to be adopted in this case.</p>

In those circumstances, just as it may be appropriate to order a richer parent who has behaved reasonably in the litigation to pay the costs of the poorer parent with whom the child is to live, it may also be appropriate to order the local authority to pay the costs of the parent with whom the child is to live, if otherwise the child's welfare would be put at risk.
