With regard to a general opinion about the EPA, the client was fully aware that his sons were jointly responsible and said he was very happy with the arrangement. He said they were &#8216;good lads&#8217;. It was evident the client considers his estranged wife to be the problem and says she is taking his money. He was knowledgeable about his income but complained that it was going into her pocket. He believes his sons to be in a difficult position because she is their &#8216;Mum&#8217;.

He was well dressed with clean clothes. He was kempt. The staff left him with me and, as I introduced myself, he understood the purpose of my visit and immediately shouted, &#8220;I wanted my sons to have the power of attorney, I don&#8217;t want my wife to be involved.&#8221; I then asked him what he meant by the power of attorney and he became extremely hostile and shouted again reasserting that his wife should not be involved. I distracted him by talking about his interest in films. He then talked at length about film actors from the 1960s to the 1980s, often repeating the same statement over and over again. After diverting his attention I thought I could proceed with the mental state examination, but as soon as I started assessing his mental state, he would scream at me, shouting loudly to the point that staff came into the room to make certain that I was alright. After the staff left I once again distracted him by talking about his various interests, and when I recommenced the mental examination, he once again started screaming and shouted repeatedly that he had had &#8216;enough&#8217; and wanted me to leave. The staff arrived and I suggested that they could take him out, as he was demanding cigarettes, and that I would see him after he had smoked his cigarette.</p>

When I asked him what he understood about the power of attorney, he once again became very angry, but later I was able to elicit that he wished to convey that all his finances should be managed by his sons. He stated that he trusted them implicitly and did not wish anyone else to be involved. He stated clearly &#8220;of course I am happy for my sons to have the power of attorney. My wife does not have the power of attorney.&#8221; When I asked him how much money he has, he shouted &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. The boys have the money and give me whatever money I need. I don&#8217;t have to go out anywhere.&#8221; As he screamed, ordering me out of the room, I had to terminate the assessment.</p>

Though I could not conduct a mini-mental state examination, as he became angry, I am certain that he does present with cognitive deficits which add to his frustration when he finds it difficult to answer simple questions. His long term memory was, however, very good when he detailed the private lives of film stars from films he has seen in the past.</p>

There is evidence of vascular cause as well as brain damage following a head injury and it is likely that chronic alcoholism has contributed towards the cognitive defects. The brain scan had shown evidence of brain damage with particular focus on the frontal lobe which is involved in behaviour and aggression. It is likely that his impulsive aggressive behaviour is due to the damage to the frontal lobe.</p>

Our mother has only limited income in her own right and our father&#8217;s pension income would have maintained both of them. Consequently, we the attorneys have tried to balance the needs of both of our parents. Our mother needed to move to Essex so that we, the attorneys, could provide her with a support mechanism, as she was so low and depressed by the events involving our father&#8217;s illness. The family are satisfied that DT is quite clear that he wishes his three sons to have full control of his finances. They consider that DT&#8217;s views in this matter should be paramount.&#8221;</p>

The Council&#8217;s finance team, which deals with the transactional aspects of estates for which the director is deputy, has advised that the contentious history of DT&#8217;s property ownership and the complexity of his estate are such that they lack the expertise to deal with the matter. If a deputy is appointed, it would appear to be in DT&#8217;s best interests for this to be an appointment from the panel. Regrettably, the social worker with whom the OPG investigator liaised was not aware that the Council does not accept an invitation to become deputy for all referrals and indicated that Suffolk County Council would accept the appointment, which is not the case.&#8221;</p>
