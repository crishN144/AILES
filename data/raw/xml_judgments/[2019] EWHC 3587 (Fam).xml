	      <p style="margin-left:0.6in;margin-right:0.01in">This is my judgment in an application by Dr Rohit Bhayana for the committal of Dr Tanveer Bhayana.  The application arises out of orders that have been made by this court for the return of a child "EB" who is now 10 years of age; who was taken to India in March of 2018 and subsequently has been retained there by his mother, the respondent, Dr Tanveer Bhayana. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.6in;margin-right:0.01in">This application is in open court.  The applicant, Dr Rohit Bhayana, is here in person representing himself.  The respondent, Dr Tanveer Bhayana, is neither present nor represented.  When the case commenced this morning and was called on there was no response from Dr Tanveer Bhayana, and prior to commencing giving this judgment at quarter-past-two the case has been called on again outside Court 34 and again there has been no response from Dr Tanveer Bhayana.  As I shall come to shortly, her absence does not really come as a surprise, given that she has not attended in person any of the hearings in this case since it commenced. </p>

At that point the applicant was representing himself; he is a general practitioner I believe, and is articulate.  The respondent at that point was represented by solicitors and counsel, and although I don't believe that she attended in person she was represented and I believe gave evidence by video conferencing before Mr Gupta. </p>

That, in due course, converted into the terms of an order which I shall turn to in a moment. </p>

On that occasion he adjourned the application for the respondent's committal in order to make further provision for the service on the respondent of the application, and to make provision for an amended notice of committal to be drafted and served.  He made a direction that the matter be listed for today for committal with a time estimate of half a day, and also directed that the issue of sequestration of the mother's assets, in particular a property  she owns in Glasgow and the continuation of a freezing injunction, be listed to be determined as well. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.6in;margin-right:0.01in">As I will turn to shortly, it seems to me that the respondent has been served with the relevant documents in sufficient time to prepare for this hearing.  No communication as far as I can ascertain from the court file has been received from the respondent explaining her non-attendance.  Events over the period since Mr Gupta gave his judgment suggest that she has disengaged from these proceedings and, thus, it is unlikely that an adjournment would secure her attendance at any future hearing.  Clearly, as she is not represented it is some disadvantage to her, but on the other hand the applicant would be prejudiced by an adjournment, particularly an adjournment which would be unlikely to result in the respondent's attendance.  So, I am satisfied that it is just to consider this committal application in the absence of the respondent. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in;text-indent:0.5in">To have penal consequences, an order needs to be clear on its face as to precisely what it means and precisely what it prohibits or requires to be done. Contempt will not be established where the breach is of an order which is ambiguous, or which does not require or forbid the performance of a particular act within a specified timeframe. The person or persons affected must know with complete precision what it is that they are required to do or abstain from doing. It is not possible to imply terms into an injunction. The first task for the judge hearing an application for committal for alleged breach of a mandatory (positive) order is to identify, by reference to the express language of the order, precisely what it is that the order required the defendant to do. That is a question of construction and, thus, a question of   law. Ideally the order should be contained in one document but where a subsequent order extends time for compliance it may be acceptable for the obligation to be contained in two orders; the obligation must be clear.  </p>

If it be the case that the accused cannot comply with order then he is not in contempt of court. It is not enough to suspect recalcitrance. It is for the applicant to establish that it was within the power of the defendant to do what the order required. It is not for the defendant to establish that it was not within his power to do it. That burden remains on the applicant throughout but it does not require the applicant to adduce evidence of a particular means of compliance which was available to the accused provided the applicant can satisfy the judge so that he is sure that compliance was possible.  </p>

The documents which I have seen since record that a sealed copy of the order was sent to the respondent on 6 June 2019 by the father, and thus the obligation contained within para.18 of that order to return the child within 14 days of receipt of the order required a return by 20 June. </p>
