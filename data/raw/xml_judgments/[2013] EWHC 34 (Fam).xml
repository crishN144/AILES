	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">I have been dealing with two applications dated 17th and 19th December 2012 by the Petitioner, Mrs Michelle Young.  The first, dated 17th December, is to commit the Respondent, Mr Scot Young, to prison for contempt of court of my order made on 12th November 2012.   The second, dated 19th December, is to activate a suspended committal order made by Parker J on 29th June 2009. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">I have decided that the correct approach is to deal solely with the committal summons dated 17th December and to decide whether or not the Respondent is in breach of the order I made on 12th November.  If he is in breach of that order, it is not necessary to deal with the breach of the earlier order. The earlier breach does, however, remain relevant as to sentence if I find the recent contempt proved.  It is also relevant in relation to applications to adjourn the matter further, given the length of time which the Respondent has already had to cure any deficiencies that remain.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">I will call the parties respectively the wife and the husband.  The wife has been represented in these applications by Mr Edward Fitzgerald QC and Mr Joe Middleton, with Mr James Bailey representing her in relation to the bankruptcy side of the case. The husband has appeared as a self-represented  litigant. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">My first task is to decide whether or not the husband is in contempt of court.  I remind myself that the burden of proof is on the wife as applicant for the committal.  The standard of proof is the criminal standard.  I have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. This means that I have to be sure.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">The matter has had a very long history.  In essence, the husband says he is penniless and bankrupt. The wife, on the other hand, contends that he is a very wealthy man worth up to &#163;400 million. She says he has hidden his entire resources to avoid his legitimate obligations towards her and the children.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">I make it clear that I am not deciding that dispute today.  It is, however, equally clear that, to be able to decide where the truth lies, it is vitally important that the husband provides full and frank disclosure of his financial circumstances, to include the relevant documentation to support his contentions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">On 24th June 2008, Moylan J gave the wife permission to serve a further questionnaire on the husband to obtain that evidence.  She served the questionnaire on 25th July 2008. There was no response.  On 24th October 2008, Pauffley J ordered the husband to respond by 7th November 2008 and attached a penal notice.   </p>

The husband provided some answers on 1st May 2009, including a significant number of letters of authority to various third parties.  The wife was not satisfied either with the answers or the letters of authority and, on 18th May 2009, she issued a committal summons.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">Charles J adjourned the summons on 20th May 2009 on the basis that the husband should do his utmost to provide the answers.  A further questionnaire was served by the wife on 3rd June 2009. It included a question as to how the husband was maintaining himself and, in particular, seeking documentary evidence of all payments alleged to have been made for his benefit by third parties.  This is extremely important as it is alleged by the wife that the husband has been making these payments himself from undisclosed financial resources and that it is simply untrue that he is being funded by third parties.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">On 29th June 2009, Parker J committed the husband to prison for six months for contempt of both the orders of Pauffley J and Coleridge J but she suspended the term of imprisonment for 92 days on terms that the husband provide the answers and documents sought by 7th September.  It follows that there has already been a finding to the criminal standard of proof that the husband was in contempt of court in failing to answer the earlier questionnaires. </p>

The husband then instructed solicitors, namely Mr Philip McGurk of Payne Hicks Beach. He served replies two days late on 11th November 2009 along with 50/51 lever arch files of documents. He also served an Affidavit setting out his business dealings.  The wife&#8217;s case is that the replies did not purge the contempt and that there remained numerous questions where the answers were either inadequate or insufficient.  Indeed, on </p>

On 19th November 2009, the wife sent a letter setting out the alleged deficiencies in the replies.  On 16th December 2009, the husband responded that he would &#8220;&#8230;<span style="font-style:italic">use his best endeavours to answer</span>&#8230;&#8221; but nothing was received. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.74in;margin-right:0.03in">In December 2009, Black J heard an application for maintenance pending suit.  She ordered that the husband should pay the wife&#8217;s rent, the children&#8217;s school fees and the sum of &#163;27,500 pm.  The husband did not appeal but he has paid nothing or next to nothing and the arrears are now close to &#163;1 million. I do however remind myself that there has not been a Judgment Summons.  There is therefore no finding of fact to the criminal standard that the husband has had the means to pay and has deliberately refused or neglected to do so.  It follows that I should not take this default into account in relation to this application.   </p>

It was agreed on the last occasion that this was not as a result of the alleged illhealth of the husband but rather because Mostyn J took the view that the case should be heard on the basis of the evidence before the court and, if appropriate, adverse inferences then be drawn as to the husband&#8217;s financial position. </p>

Despite my considerable reluctance, I agreed that the case had to be adjourned as it simply was not ready for trial and the time estimate was quite inadequate.  As a result, the wife applied to  me in November 2012 for permission to activate the committal.  I granted her permission.  I also made a detailed order dated 12th November 2012.  It provided at Paragraph 5 that the husband shall produce by 4pm on 10th December 2012:-  </p>

It follows that there is therefore no question other than that he was in contempt of court.  However, he did purport to answer both paragraphs on the afternoon of 14th January, namely the day before the committal application.  I take the view that, if in doing so, he has remedied entirely all the deficiencies in his disclosure, it would not be appropriate to commit him to prison now for being late as the main objective, namely to prove his current financial position, would have been satisfied.  I therefore take the view that I must examine his answers to see whether or not he remains in contempt.  </p>

This was over three weeks after I made my order. Moreover, the meeting took place only four days before he was due to comply.  The wife says, and I accept, that this was exactly what had happened in 2009, when he finally went to see solicitors at the very last moment when he came to realise the seriousness of the situation he faced.   </p>

I will not therefore do so although he said in his oral submissions that he had been an inpatient in hospital from 21st December 2012 to 10th January 2013. The wife reminds me that the day he sought medical treatment was the day after her enquiry agent attempted to serve him with the application for his committal.  I am satisfied that he knew the nature of the application the enquiry agent was attempting to serve upon him. </p>

I agree but in this regard I am not prepared to find that this is contrived. It may be that the imminent threat of prison has made him unwell. That is, however, no excuse for contempt of court.  There would not have been a threat of imprisonment if he had complied fully with the court orders. </p>

In his answer, he produces a table of gifts he has received since then for rent, living expenses and the like. The total is approximately &#163;315,000.  The vital issue, however, is the documentation to show where this money came from.  He produced nothing.  He says he does not have any documents in his possession, power or control as he does not have the bank statements of his friends.  He adds that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">due to the negative press generated by this case, none of these third parties will provide the Respondent with any details of the payments they made</span>.&#8221; </p>

There is no evidence whatsoever that he has tried to obtain such information from them.  He knew what was required.  I conclude that he has deliberately failed to comply.

The completion statement shows the money being transferred to the First Curacao International Bank.  The husband was asked to provide documentation to show where this money had gone.
