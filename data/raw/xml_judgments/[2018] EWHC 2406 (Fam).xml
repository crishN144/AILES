Only if there were such a concluded agreement could it be said that there was clear and unequivocal conduct such as to fall within the exception&#8230;.it would be most unfortunate if parents in this situation were deterred from seeking to make sensible arrangements, in consequence of what is usually an acknowledged breakdown in the relationship between them, for fear that the mere fact that they are able to contemplate that the child should remain where he has been taken will count against them in these proceedings.  Such negotiations are, if anything, to be encouraged.  They should not therefore necessarily fall within the exception or necessarily lead to the conclusion as a matter of fact that there was a subjective state of mind that was wholly content for the child to remain here.&#8221; </p>

Miss Lindfield submits that I should not accept the evidence of Miss Ionescu concerning K&#8217;s views, as she conducted an incomplete investigation.  It was submitted that she should have spoken to a school staff member who had discussed K&#8217;s views with him when he became inconsolable at school (which is referred to at D5, para.15).  It&#8217;s an event that is not given a date, but the school recalled K saying that his parents were separated, his mum calls every night and he doesn&#8217;t want to talk to her as she always talks about him going to live there, and he wants to be here, with Dad. </p>

These are summary proceedings and Ms Ionescu had a fixed and short timescale for providing her report. She is an experienced officer, from a specialist team, who is used to interviewing children in these circumstances. </p>

Miss Lindfield argues that it may be a reason why K does not want to return to Turkey because care by his mother alone would be a new experience for him.  If that was a reason, I would have expected K to have raised this with Miss Ionescu.  He did tell her that the mother worked long hours but it was Miss Ionescu&#8217;s very clear evidence that he raised this when he was asked to describe his mother, and not when asked to describe why he did not want to return to Turkey. </p>

She said that these were matters that were likely to have come from K being influenced by his father.  I accept Ms Ionescu&#8217;s reasoning on these matters as being persuasive. However, the influence of father would be something for me to assess should I be persuaded that K has expressed objections to a return within the meaning of <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>.  In my judgment, K&#8217;s presentation of his wishes amounts to no more than a preference or a wish, and does not reach the threshold of an objection. </p>

I read that email as the mother wanting to satisfy herself, by speaking to K, that he really wanted to stay.  It was not a consent to him staying of itself in the absence of M speaking to K. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In my judgment, I must take into account the context within which that message was sent.   K had not been returned.  The mother had been repeatedly sending messages requesting to speak to her son on the telephone.  Those messages were all responded to by negativity and a refusal to ensure that she had telephone contact with her child.  She then faced, bizarrely in my judgment, criticism for not making contact with K when that contact had been blocked by the father and the father&#8217;s girlfriend.  Does that one sentence then amount to an expression of the mother&#8217;s consent to the child remaining in the United Kingdom?  I remind myself of the words of Hale J (as she then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">P v P</span>. Only if there were a concluded agreement could it be said that there was a clear and unequivocal conduct such as to fall within the exception as described by Lord Browne-Wilkinson. </p>

I&#8217;ve already read her offer for K to return to Turkey and then to return to the UK in school holidays and her offer of paying for flights. These were a number of different strategies that were attempted by this mother to get some contact with her son.  In my judgment there was never a concluded agreement because there was never any contact.  She was never able to speak to K to satisfy herself that he wanted to stay.  In my judgment, the exception certainly does not apply in the circumstances of this case. </p>

The conduct of the wronged parent has to be looked at in the context of the wronged parent knowing his or her rights.  This mother, in my finding, did not know of her rights.
