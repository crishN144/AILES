	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 3 April 2014 Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) the publishers of the <span style="font-style:italic">Daily Mail </span>applied to the court for an order permitting the identification of JM in reports of the case. At my direction the application was listed before me. On 30 May 2014 I gave directions. My order contained a recital that there was no need for DP to be joined as a party &#8220;so long as her interests are represented as provided for below.&#8221; Paragraph 2 of the order invited the deputy &#8220;to make such representations on behalf of DP in relation to the application as may be appropriate in her best interests.&#8221; The application came on for hearing on 18 June 2014. ANL was represented by Ms Victoria Jolliffe. DP&#8217;s deputy did not appear, but Ms Grainne Feeney of her firm was in court with a watching brief. JM appeared in person. He made clear that, despite having only very recently received some of the papers, he did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>want an adjournment and wished the hearing to proceed. Both the OPG and the deputy had confirmed to the court in writing that they took a neutral stance, the deputy&#8217;s neutral position being confirmed to me by Ms Feeney.</p>

Second, that &#8220;Comment and criticism may be ill-informed and based, it may be, on misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the facts [but the] fear of such criticism, however justified that fear may be, and however unjustified the criticism, is &#8230; not of itself a justification for prior restraint by injunction of the kind being sought here, even if the criticism is expressed in vigorous, trenchant or outspoken terms &#8230; or even in language which is crude, insulting and vulgar&#8221;. Third, that &#8220;It is no part of the function of the court exercising the jurisdiction I am being asked to apply to prevent the dissemination of material because it is defamatory &#8230; If what is published is defamatory, the remedy is an action for defamation, not an application in the Family Division for an injunction.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">What&#8217;s in a name? &#8220;A lot&#8221;, the press would answer. This is because stories about particular individuals are simply much more attractive to readers than stories about unidentified people. It is just human nature. And this is why, of course, even when reporting major disasters, journalists usually look for a story about how particular individuals are affected. Writing stories which capture the attention of readers is a matter of reporting technique, and the European court holds that article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed &#8230; This is not just a matter of deference to editorial independence. The judges are recognising that editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb the information. A requirement to report it in some austere, abstract form, devoid of much of its human interest, could well mean that the report would not be read and the information would not be passed on. Ultimately, such an approach could threaten the viability of newspapers and magazines, which can only inform the public if they attract enough readers and make enough money to survive. </p>

DP&#8217;s Article 8 rights &#8211; her interests and her welfare &#8211; are plainly of great importance.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns the impact on DP if JM is identified, Ms Jolliffe submits that it is likely to be minimal. In his judgment the Senior Judge quotes the Visitor&#8217;s report dated 28 March 2013 as saying that DP has a diagnosis of dementia with confusion and as reporting that, when given JM&#8217;s name, DP replied, &#8220;It sounds familiar &#8211; but I don&#8217;t know who he is.&#8221; Moreover, Ms Jolliffe submits, identifying JM would identify DP only to the limited number of people who already know her <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>who already know that JM was either her gardener or her attorney. Put another way, she submits that the number of people, over and above those who can already identify DP from the anonymised judgment, who will be able to identify her if JM&#8217;s name is published, is likely to be minimal. JM disputes this. He says that readers would link him with DP. Revealingly he also says that everyone locally, everyone in his community, knows about him and DP. But far from blunting her point that seems to me to support Ms Jolliffe&#8217;s basic submission.</p>

Almost all, in my assessment, are already &#8216;in the know&#8217;, either because they were already aware of what was happening or because, having read the <span style="font-style:italic">Daily Mail </span>articles, they have been able to make the link.</p>

Why, she asks rhetorically, should a wrongdoer like JM, guilty she says of serious misconduct, have any reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of his wrongdoing. Even if his Article 8 rights are engaged in these circumstances, which she questions, they can, she says, carry very little weight. His misconduct should be exposed. There is, she submits, a very strong public interest in identifying an individual who has acted, as JM has, in serious breach of his duties as attorney to someone as vulnerable as DP. </p>

For the unintended consequence of what has happened thus far is, she says, a perception that the court is protecting JM as opposed to DP. Identifying JM will in fact, she says, further the objectives of the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Guidance</span>, improving public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system. She points to paragraph 11, which says that use of the rubric which conventionally protects the identity of P and members of P&#8217;s family &#8220;may be inappropriate in cases where findings have been made against a person and someone else contends and/or the court concludes that it is in the public interest for that person to be identified in any published version of the judgment.&#8221; All the more so, where, as here, JM is not a member of DP&#8217;s family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with the thrust of Ms Jolliffe&#8217;s submissions. At the end of the day the issue is really very simple. Why should JM be protected from the normal consequence of a judicial finding of misconduct, namely the identification of the wrongdoer in a published judgment? Nothing JM has said, or which could sensibly be put forward on his behalf, provides any reason why, looked at from his perspective, he should be spared the consequences of his misbehaviour. If publication of his identity and re-publication of the Senior Judge&#8217;s findings, lowers JM in the estimation of right-thinking readers of the <span style="font-style:italic">Daily Mail </span>or other organs of the media, then so be it. He has only himself to blame. Why should JM be any more entitled to anonymity, just because the only judicial finding thus far has been made by the Court of Protection, than he would be if his self-same conduct was being considered in the Chancery Division or the Crown Court? </p>
