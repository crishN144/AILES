The father explains that he was not able to afford legal advice and had only limited education. The father did contact the Central Authority again in 2023 and was allocated a new case worker, which resulted in the application being made in this court in July 2023. The father states in his statement <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;My education was limited in Kenya and I am a refugee having come to the US when I was 14 years old. I do not know the procedures and protocols that need to be followed, I really have tried over the last 4 years, to access the correct support and help to go down the correct channels but it really has taken me a very long time finally to get the right help and assistance&#8217;.</span></p>

She recognised the difficulties in maintaining contact between the father and the children if they remained living here and, at present, the children have no right to remain living here. In her view, from the children&#8217;s perspective, they were not aware of them having no right to live here. She considered it would be very disruptive for the children to return to the US as they would experience further disruption, including to their education and would need to adjust to a different education system. Her view is the children regard the UK as their home, this is the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;centre of their life&#8217;,</span> they have friends and some relatives here, and take part in local activities (such as W&#8217;s football club). Whilst she acknowledged the difference between a return overseen by this court, when compared to deportation, she said she hoped the father would offer the same protective measures in the event of the latter and there is no certainty about the outcome of the asylum appeal.</p>

He recognises  the fact that the asylum claim was refused, the children have no legal status here, means they are at risk of deportation, depending on the outcome of any appeal, but it is not certain. He submits the court should be cautious in anticipating any outcome. He submits the issue of settlement needs to be considered from the child&#8217;s perspective, based on their own understanding. There is no evidence they fear deportation, the picture painted by Ms Demery is of children settled and engaged in their environment in every sense. Mr Niven-Phillips weighed in the balance the impact of the loss of relationship between the father and the children and the need to take steps for the reintroduction of the father to the children, however that is a reality for the children if they were to return to the US or remain here and only one aspect of the balancing exercise the court is required to undertake.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Marnham takes issue with all the defences raised. He accepts there has been some delay in making this application and relies on the explanation for that delay in the father&#8217;s statement and the difficulties he experienced in navigating what needed to be done.  In relation to settlement he submits the evidence of Ms Demery needs to be balanced with a number of matters. First, the evidence that the general situation of the children has been unsettled in terms of a stable home, involvement with child protection services and the concerns raised about poor school attendance. In addition, the court needs to weigh in the balance the impact of the asylum application and the loss of the relationship between the children and their father. He submits the current position is the children have no right to remain here and are at risk of deportation, which is likely to be a less managed return to the US than under any order overseen by this court. Such a situation does not amount to stability for the children when looking to the future, it is an uncertainty the court should not ignore. The lack of an ongoing relationship with their father results in the children being more isolated here and the mother cannot be relied upon to support that relationship being re-established. The children&#8217;s resistance to contact with their father is demonstrated by Ms Demery and that situation is likely to remain if the children remain here, rather than return to the US, even to a different State. He accepts there is some cross over between these matters in responding to the settlement defence and, if established, the discretion the court has to consider as to whether to order a return.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Marnham does not accept that the threshold of the Article 13b) defence is established in this case. There is an inconsistency between the allegations made in this application and those alleged within the asylum application and there is no corroborative evidence to support what the mother alleges. The father has produced photographs of the mother and father at the time of the allegations which undermine what the mother alleges both in terms of his behaviour and involvement with the children. In addition he has produced negative drug test results that cover a number of years, undermining the mother&#8217;s allegations about the father&#8217;s drug abuse. In any event, he submits even if the threshold is met the comprehensive package of protective measures offered by the father will ensure that any risk of grave harm or an intolerable situation for the children will be ameliorated. Mr Marnham&#8217;s submissions, in relation to the protective measures, are supported by Mr Niven-Phillips on behalf of the children.</p>

That is supported by Mr Niven-Phillips. Mr Marnhan disagrees and submits that the policy considerations that underpin the 1980 Hague Convention, the impact of the loss of the relationship between the children and their father and the inherent risks in the lack of any right of the children to remain living here all point towards the father&#8217;s application being granted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue about habitual residence was raised for the first time on behalf of the mother at this hearing. There is no dispute between the parties that the children were wrongfully removed from the US in 2019, the father says in July/August 2019 and the mother accepts in September 2019. Even taking the latter date as the date of the wrongful removal, Ms Lewis accepts that the children&#8217;s habitual residence was in the US at that time. In the light of that and the requirement for habitual residence to be considered at the date of the wrongful removal or retention (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span>ibid) it is difficult to see on what basis this remains a live issue in this case and I reject Ms Lewis&#8217; submissions that habitual residence should be considered at any later time than September 2019.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the Article 13b) defence I am not satisfied that is established. I accept the threshold is met as the allegations made by the mother of physical and emotional abuse are extremely serious and would inevitably have a serious impact on her ability to care for the children expose them to the grave risk of harm or place them in an intolerable situation, although it is of note some of these allegations are not included within her asylum claim, without any explanation as to why that is so. The mother&#8217;s account of the parents separating in 2017 is supported by the father&#8217;s decree of judicial separation, which undermines his account that they separated and then reconciled and the photographs relied upon by the father do not undermine the account given by the mother. She accepts they remained in contact, albeit she alleges she continued to be abused and controlled by the father. I have also factored in the series of negative drug test produced by the father required for his job that undermine the mother&#8217;s allegations about drug abuse. The risks of harm then need to be considered in the light of the protective measures put forward by the father. They can be summarised as follows: (i) to pay the mother and children&#8217;s return travel costs; (ii) to support the mother and children to return to accommodation separate from the father for 3 months or until the first inter parties court hearing in the US, the father estimates this would cost about $2,500 pm, or the mother could return to stay with her own wider family in the US; (iii) the father is confident the children could return to their old school; (iv) the father offers financial support of about $300 pm for a period of three months; (v) not to attend at the airport upon return; (vi) not to separate the children from the mother&#8217;s care without the mother&#8217;s prior agreement or order of the US court; and (vii) not to institute any criminal proceedings against the mother arising from her wrongful removal of the children.  The mother has not taken issue with any of these protective measures or sought any further measures, save to respond more generally that protectives measures would not be sufficient to protect her or the children from the relevant risks. Mr Marnham and Mr Niven-Phillips rely on the measures proposed and on the wider information the court has about the available protective measures available in the US from the asylum proceedings and for the documents filed in these proceedings to be disclosed to the relevant agencies and the court in the US. I accept those submissions. Ms Lewis submits the mother suffered the harm alleged when those protective measures were available however there is no evidence of the mother seeking help from the police or any child protection service which would be available on her return. This coupled with the arrangements and financial support offered by the father which would enable the mother and children to live independently with the relevant agencies being informed would, in my judgment, result in the Article 13 b) defence not being established.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As regards child objections I consider, on balance, in relation to W that defence is not established in this case. W&#8217;s focus is on a wish to remain here rather than being able to articulate any reasons that amount to an objection to return to the US save for that which relates to the father and his lack of memory of the US. At its highest W says he can&#8217;t remember much about the US, which is not surprising bearing in mind the amount of time he has spent here and his age when he left the US. There is also some evidence that supports W&#8217;s views being influenced by his mother&#8217;s views. Whilst this is not surprising, it undermines the weight the court can attach to W&#8217;s views being his own. This is particularly so when his level of understanding and maturity is below that of his chronological age. The younger children have no memory of the US, they wish to remain in the UK and there is no evidential basis to support they are of an age and maturity where their views should be considered.</p>
