	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 3 December 2018 an interim care order was made on the application of M County Council. At that time AE remained critically ill in hospital where he underwent major surgery on 4 December 2018. His father is the second respondent in these proceedings.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">A was 2 years and 2 months old when he was admitted to hospital on 29 November 2018. Investigations revealed healing fractures to his ribs and scapula, but more worryingly they revealed abdominal injuries including a laceration to his liver. Without treatment he would have died. The presence of numerous bruises together with the healing fractures and the abdominal injuries and the lack of explanation led the treating clinicians very quickly to suspected non-accidental injury. His stepfather, initially an intervenor and now the third respondent in these proceedings, was arrested on suspicion of GBH that night. The first respondent, A&#8217;s mother, first respondent was arrested the following day.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 18 December the first respondent gave birth to a daughter, B. The first respondent gave consent to her being accommodated in local authority foster care pending a further hearing and on 21 December 2018, the local authority issued care proceedings so that on 9 January 2019 B also was made subject to an interim care order. Although it does not appear that her paternity was in dispute it was confirmed by DNA testing that the third respondent was her father. A and B are now the fourth and fifth respondents to these proceedings represented through their Guardian. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Although this hearing was initially listed as a final hearing to determine both the threshold criteria and the appropriate welfare orders that should be made in respect of A and B, by the time the matter came before me for an IRH in April it was clear that the position in respect of B would not be capable of resolution at this hearing. Further assessments in relation to possible family placements needed to be concluded before any view could be reached on the realistic options for her future.  </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In addition, it emerged that the only realistic option in respect of A was placement with his father. In respect of the second respondent no criticism is made of his parenting of A. Even the first respondent accepts that she is not currently in a position to offer care to him and that he should go to live with his father. That is the case even if she is wholly exonerated of responsibility for causing his injuries and for failing to protect him from those injuries. In part that derives from the fact that she concedes </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">that she failed to protect him from emotional abuse linked to the assaults that she says she suffered at the hands of the third respondent and that she did not seek medical treatment sufficiently swiftly but also from the fact that she is currently homeless and unable to provide any sort of home for him. A plan has been agreed between the local authority, the second respondent and the Guardian which provides for a staged transition for A from foster care to the care of his father.  </p>

Within those issues I have also had to consider a number of other factual issues bearing upon the extent to which the local authority has satisfied the threshold criteria for public authority intervention in the lives of this family. </p>

Was it accidental or inflicted? If the latter, was it the first respondent or the third respondent who had done it? If the latter, had the first respondent failed to protect him and to what extent?  </p>

The court must be careful to ensure that each expert keeps within the bounds of their own expertise and defers, where appropriate, to the expertise of others.

However, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together, and no doubt comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. However, in the end the court must still ask itself the right question, which is not "who is the more likely?" but "does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?" In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, there are clear dangers in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this could lead to an identification on evidence that fell short of a probability. Although the danger does not arise in this form where there are only two possible perpetrators, the correct question is the same, if only to avoid the risk of an incorrect identification being made by a linear process of exclusion. </span></p>

The court can infer from her lies that they corroborate guilt having regard also to the number of opportunities available to the first respondent to seek help or report the third respondent&#8217;s abusive behaviour, her detached demeanour at hospital and in the witness box and A&#8217;s response to her at hospital and in contact.</p>

Given that it occurred after the first recorded incident of violence from the third respondent to the first respondent it is more probable that this was not an accidental injury but rather an inflicted injury. The evidence does not sufficiently identify who caused it but only the first respondent and the third respondent are in reality possible perpetrators.

She refers at C56 to her concern at the instances of A reappearing with an injury after having been alone with the third respondent elsewhere in the house and finding bloodied wet wipes under his bed. She failed to take protective action in respect of the violence A was experiencing from the third respondent which she knew or ought to have known of. In addition she failed to seek appropriate medical attention at various stages including after being informed of the alleged fall on 26 November his condition was such that she ought to have taken him for medical attention. Her continuation of a relationship of sorts with the third respondent into 2019 demonstrates a continuing failure to act protectively. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There are some gaps in the evidence. The evidence relating to the genital injuries in July is itself limited. The medical records are very spartan. The accounts are given relatively late in the day; the first respondent&#8217;s account emerges from a discussion with the social worker during the parenting assessment it not having formed part of the Threshold when originally drafted. No one else who was present, or allegedly present has been spoken to. Others who might have provided statements have not done so. The third respondent&#8217;s father and his partner who were present in the house on the evening of 26 November do not appear to have been approached either by the police or the local authority or the father to give evidence. The downloads from the parents&#8217; phones are limited. They do not cover the i-messaging which the first respondent suggested was the parties&#8217; primary vehicle for communication as opposed to texts. The evidence in relation to the photographs which have been downloaded from the phones is not entirely satisfactory in respect of the dating of the pictures, albeit ultimately both parties gave evidence which suggested that the photographs in broad terms were consistent with the dates which appeared on them. For reasons which were not entirely clear, Dr Mecrow had not had the opportunity to comment on the photographs of A and thus the interpretation of what they showed was more limited than it might have been. Dr C was invited to comment on them and did so albeit she identified the relatively poor quality of the photos as a limitation in any event. Thus some caution has to be deployed in relation to the use of the photographs. I do not consider that it is possible to draw some of the inferences that Ms Kaur on behalf of the Guardian invited me to make; for instance that the injuries seen were only consistent with a non-accidental infliction. However, the photographs and the text messages with their limitations have to be fitted into the overall canvas of evidence and play their part within it.  The videos of A were also made available to me. I did not have a transcript of the comments that the third respondent was making whilst A was in the shower. Again I am cautious about what one can infer from the videos but on the other hand one cannot ignore them. They do have some evidential value. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The first respondent gave evidence over about a day and a half. She gave evidence through an interpreter although I got the impression that she understood quite a lot of English as she answered questions before they had been interpreted for her. She herself says that her English has improved significantly over the last months so it is difficult to know with any certainty what her level of English was in November of last year. Her witness statements were provided in English and without interpreter&#8217;s certificates. Dr C appeared to be satisfied that the first respondent understood in large measure what was being said to her and she was able to relay a history which Dr E and Dr C were able to take down without interpreters. The first respondent was generally polite and cooperative during her evidence; there were only very rare moments where she was argumentative &#8211; they coming at the end of a long day. She did not come across as aggressive but as a rather passive individual. Someone who is reactive rather than proactive. At times she appeared to give up or be resigned. She did not appear to be a person who is likely to be capable of losing her temper in a way that would cause her to inflict violence upon another. There is nothing in her history which points at that as being a likely facet of her character. There were occasional moments when her body language changed. Whilst reading presentation and body language is tricky I thought it perhaps significant that when she denied ever having smacked A she appeared to become somewhat flustered, rapidly blinking. This perhaps was an indication of her knowingly lying during her evidence. This was an isolated incident though. The first respondent demonstrated little emotion throughout her evidence. There were occasions when her aura of detachment slipped and she appeared tearful. Such flashes appeared to occur when she was talking about her son.  I did not get the impression that she did not care and that her detachment was a reflection of that. The evidence of her caring for A prior to July 2018 together with her attachment to A and B as seen during contact and the evidence of her distress at times at the hospital and her attempts to comfort A by holding his hand, smiling at him and speaking to him all appear to support the conclusion that she does care for her children and is engaged with her emotions. It seems to me more likely that her apparent detachment during her evidence is a protective response to prevent her being overwhelmed by events and the emotions they would provoke. She is currently homeless and without work and facing the loss of her children whilst also coping (if I so find) with the aftermath of the infliction of serious violence upon her and upon A. Whilst there were moments during her evidence where she sought to avoid responsibility, there were more where she accepted that she had let her son down. </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">There are clearly some very major issues to do with her reliability as a historian. The difference between her police interview in which she maintained she had a good relationship with the third respondent and that he had a good relationship with A are in startling contrast to her statements in the family proceedings and to the police and indeed to her oral evidence. Even between her statements in which she gives an account of domestic abuse there are significant discrepancies. There are some significant differences between her police witness statement given on 8 January and her family court witness statement given on 15 January. The account of the train of events on 9 July is significantly different. Her account of 26 November in her family court statement does not identify the force-feeding incident and the assault upon her as having taken place that night but rather on an unspecified date in November. It is clear that her recall of dates and the sequence of events is poor. What is the explanation for these differences? It could be an indicator of dishonesty but could also be a product of an unreliable memory. The overall picture which emerges from all of her evidence is a broadly consistent account of incidents of violence being inflicted upon her. I agree with Mr Roche&#8217;s submission made on behalf of the second respondent that there is a sense that she has not told the full story. Again that may be because she is dishonest or it may be because she is not yet emotionally able to come to terms with some of what has happened. During robust cross examination, her core account remained intact. Some of her responses seemed to be spontaneous and to demonstrate a degree of indignance which lent credibility to her answer; for instance, when it was suggested that the third respondent had not tried to strangle her and had not smacked A on 26 November. Likewise when it was floated to her that she had herself caused the injuries she sustained in March 2019. Small details provided an authentic feel to her account. Her recall of the conversation in which she reminded the third respondent of the bruise he had inflicted on her in August and how it had made it </p>

Her account of having made up a story that social services and the police were taking an interest and had visited the home is in itself corroborated by the third respondent&#8217;s police interview. She said this was because A&#8217;s had become unhappy in his presence and she suspected he was doing something. In addition her evidence that she considered leaving the third respondent and returning to her home country was corroborated to some extent by the third respondent&#8217;s own evidence of her having said she wished to go to her home country. Given the difficulties in her pregnancy and her lack of finances seems improbable that she would have been referring to this as a holiday. She gave appropriate explanations for not having disclosed what was happening earlier in particular when she was challenged about why she had not given an account of domestic abuse and suspicion of child abuse to the police. Whilst at the police station, I&#8217;m satisfied that she did believe that she may be returning to the home she shared with the third respondent and that this would have been sufficient to make her fearful as to his response. In any event given the circumstances in which she was interviewed with A critically ill in hospital and she having been arrested on suspicion of GBH, I do not consider that her failure to give a full account to police is a matter which within &#8216;Lucas&#8217; terms provides corroboration for her being a perpetrator of abuse or even a fabricator of an account of domestic abuse. Far more probable an explanation for that account is fear of the third respondent, fear of the situation she was in, and shame about her inaction. The existence of the abusive text messages from the third respondent together with matters such as his acceptance of his loss of temper on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>July and his disregard for the law, as demonstrated by his driving record and his breach of bail, all tend to support the first respondent&#8217;s general narrative.  </p>

His attitude was rather insouciant or cocky, occasionally rather condescending. He repeatedly questioned the relevance of his driving convictions asserting that he had been punished and they were now forgotten. At times he appeared surprisingly candid for instance fully accepting that he had smashed the car up and had lost his temper and was shouting and swearing. At other times after appearing to be candid he would seek to alter or minimise a concession he had made. He rapidly changed an argument on 10 July into a &#8216;discussion&#8217;; seemingly realising that an argument was more consistent with a subsequent alleged assault. He was assertive throughout and at times he came across as argumentative often taking issue with questions which had been put to him or confidently asserting that that question had already been asked and answered. He remained calm even under considerable pressure although his combativeness indicated at times he was probably quite wound up. There were flashes of irritation. He also seemed very detached from events. When questioned about the rib and scapula fractures he showed no interest in seeking to understand how they might have happened. He said he had no thoughts in his head about it and that he was hardly seeing the child and so had no explanation. </p>

On one account in his statement in these proceedings he was at work when it occurred, on another in his police interview at K376, K378, and K382 he was at home. Many of his explanations seem highly implausible. His assertion that his response to the receipt by the first respondent of a sexually suggestive message was one of sadness was completely irreconcilable with his jealousy and aggressiveness demonstrated by his text messaging. His suggestion that a text message that he appears to accept sending which made reference to injecting A with water was a joke stretches incredulity. If it was a joke it was a joke which illustrates a worrying sense of humour. In cross examination in relation to the alleged assault in March he accepted that there was no one else in the property, that no one had any motive to assault him or the first respondent and could offer no explanation for how the first respondent came by the extensive injuries that she sustained on that occasion and which were immediately witnessed by the kebab shop and the police within minutes of her leaving his property.  In the police interview having earlier said that A had no problems with his mobility, he later asserted that he was a clumsy child who was always falling over and walking into things and that was how he received his injuries. His assertion that the video of A in the shower amounts to a reassuring picture shows either dishonesty or a complete lack of empathy with a little boy&#8217;s emotions. His account of leaving A upstairs on 26 November whilst he went to retrieve the buggy from the car made little sense in terms of why he took him upstairs and left him in his room. Even more significantly his account of not having heard anything as A fell down the stairs or of A crying afterwards or of the fact that neither his father or his partner heard or saw anything or came to A&#8217;s assistance all sounded highly implausible. His assertion that A had been terribly cold and wet when he picked him up from the hospital and that he then sustained a significant fall down a set of stairs but he then considered it appropriate to walk to the shops in the rain shortly afterwards also appeared improbable. </p>

The third respondent is clearly a more dominant and assertive character, someone who does what he wishes regardless of the consequences for others. I conclude he is a man who has a brittle temper, is capable of highly abusive indeed offensive language and who whether in drink or otherwise would be capable of losing his temper.</p>

This was, in all probability, an inflicted non-accidental injury. It is more likely that A was standing at the time but it is possible that he was lying down. There may have been two blows, but one blow provides a sufficient mechanism to cause all the injuries. The injury was most likely inflicted between Monday, 26 November 2018 and Wednesday 28</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> November. The perpetrator would have been aware that he or she had inflicted suffering and pain and that serious damage was likely to have been caused by the blunt injury. The injury lacerated the liver and it was life-threatening. The fact that the liver itself has needed no surgery does not detract from the seriousness of the injury. It is only by good fortune that the liver injury was no worse since had the laceration been a fraction more extensive it could have been fatal. The initial blow also compressed the mesentery of the small intestine against the spine, damaging the mesentery and the blood supply to 40 cm of jejunum. The pancreas was injured but has probably recovered. A was taken to the GP and then hospital. He lost a quantity of blood into the abdominal cavity and became quite unwell as a result. He went into pre-renal failure and needed a lot of intravenous fluid to keep his circulation going. He had an acute kidney injury but this was because of blood loss and not trauma and his kidneys recovered. A was fortunate that his liver injury was manageable without an emergency operation. Unfortunately, the devascularised jejunum died over the next few days and an abscess and inflammatory mass developed around it.

Indeed I do not consider that she would deliberately cause any injury to A, although I conclude it is more likely than not that she has on occasions smacked A as a form of chastisement. Her denial of this was an example of dishonesty arising through fear or shame. However, all of the other evidence about the first respondent points away from the likelihood of her as a perpetrator of violence upon her son. The evidence is that she provided appropriate care to A prior to July 2018. This emerges both from the medical records which show a child being presented appropriately for inoculations or minor problems and developmental checks but also from the acceptance that she provided appropriate care by both the second and third respondents. Having seen her give evidence and having heard something about her interaction with her children, there is no sign of her having a personality which would be consistent with the infliction of a high level of violence upon a child. Her general meekness or passivity and the absence of evidence of a temper support this conclusion. The fact that she was experiencing a fragile pregnancy would also point away from the likelihood of her using highly physical violent behaviour. Nor is she a drinker or consumer of drugs which might render her emotionally unstable. I do not consider that the lies she has demonstrably told can be deployed to corroborate any evidence which might identify her as a perpetrator of violence. However she has clearly failed to protect A in a variety of ways. Those failures to act however are qualitatively different to the infliction of violence upon him. I do not consider that her failure to protect him adds any support to an argument that she was the perpetrator.  </p>

Although both Dr Mecrow and Dr Oates could not entirely rule out the possibility that a fall down stairs could have caused the abdominal injury, even that remote possibility only comes into play if A landed on some blunt boot or fistshaped object at the foot of the stairs with the equivalent force of a kick or a punch. There is no suggestion that this was the nature of the fall that occurred. In respect of the rib and scapula fractures the falls described by the first respondent and the Third Respondent are simply inconsistent with the injuries A sustained at that time. The medical evidence as to the relatively low-level injuries sustained by young children through falls downstairs based as it is on some research provides a firm evidential foundation for the opinions expressed by the doctors based on their own clinical experience.

A fall down a few stairs as described by the third respondent might cause some minor grazes or bruising. However they do not get close to explaining how this little boy sustained 6 left-sided rib fractures and a most unusual fracture to his left scapula. They are however consistent with a forceful blow delivered to A&#8217;s chest while he was backed up against a wall or perhaps a stamp or punch whilst he was lying on the floor. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The medical evidence in relation to the genital injuries observed in July 2018 is less clear and satisfactory. Dr Mecrow himself noted that he would have been reluctant to offer any opinion had there not been the subsequent injuries which can be deployed to support the conclusion that those injuries were more likely to be inflicted than accidental. Dr Mecrow considers that the injuries could be accidental but only by the unusual mechanism of A having fallen with legs akimbo on to a hard surface. This could have occurred on the metal edge of a trampoline. I do not think Dr Mecrow offered an opinion in respect of the degree of protection that a nappy might have afforded in such a situation but as a matter of common sense it seems likely to have cushioned any impact to some degree. The first respondent&#8217;s account of the alleged accident is far from full or satisfactory. She did not see it happen but says she became aware of A on the ground outside the trampoline crying. Both the first respondent and the third respondent say that initially redness was observed around his groin which developed into bruising and swelling by the following day. The fact that they are in many ways highly unreliable witnesses is far from a conclusion that they never tell the truth. The medical records in respect of the visit to the GP the following day do not illuminate matters much. A reference to an abdominal injury, no description of the history, a reference to A&amp;E. No referral on to social services suggests the GP was either satisfied with the explanation given. The alternative is laziness or incompetence; both of which seem less likely. The circumstances in which the explanation came out about this injury namely in the course of discussions between the first respondent and the social worker in the course of the parenting assessment do not suggest fabrication on the hoof. Although this is the least serious of the injuries it is one which has caused me considerable deliberation. Had the bruising to A&#8217;s groin which was noted in November 2018 been considered to be a product of deliberate infliction rather than blood tracking that may have added support to the conclusion that the injury in July 2018 was deliberate but that is not so. Nor is there any evidence to suggest any sexual or element of sadism in the other injuries inflicted which would probably be required if this injury was deliberately inflicted by pulling or twisting of the genitals. Taking all of the evidence together I do not conclude on the balance of probabilities that this injury was inflicted by deliberate assault upon A. </p>

The photographs at K423 to 425 taken in the aftermath of the &#8216;big slipper&#8217; accident show a variety of injuries. They appear to show grazes which would be consistent with a carpet burn. However they also show a significant bruise on the right jaw line and two bruises to the centre-left chest area. They are sufficiently different in appearance that they cannot be in my view of the same nature. The darker marks which appear to be bruising do not appear to be carpet burn grazes.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The timing of the rib and scapula fractures is placed by the experts in the window of 30 October to 22 November. Dr Oates in his report [E67-8] emphasises this is an approximation and that the two studies he refers to would place it in the 8-35 days or 1 - 5 weeks old categories. In oral evidence he said they could be up to 2 months old although he thought it unlikely.     Five weeks or 35 days before 29 November is 25 October. The dating of the photographs taken by the first respondent and third respondent of A is not established with certainty but their evidence together with that of the dates themselves puts some of them in the period 26 October to 5 November. It appears likely that the photographs at K450 dated 27 October are taken shortly after an incident in which he was injured and that those at K409, 411 and 412 show the bruising having developed by 29 October. Those at K413 and 415 appear to show the bruising slowly reducing such that by the time A visited the hospital on 6 November the bruising was no longer very obvious. Given the extensive nature of the bruises which are visible at that period it seems likely that they were sustained during the same incident that caused the rib and scapula fractures. The difference of 3 days between the photos of 27 October and the opening of the window identified by the experts for the causing of the fractures seems to me to be reconcilable given the experts accept that there is a degree of imprecision in the dating of the fractures. There was thus some very significant event which not only fractured A&#8217;s ribs and scapula but also caused significant bruising to his face and probably an injury to his frenulum. The experts agree that the most likely cause of the fractures was a direct blow to the chest by punching, kicking or being pushed very hard onto a hard object. It seems probable that in the course of the delivery of that punch, kick or push that A also banged his head so as to cause those injuries. That was a very significant and violent assault which the perpetrator would have known was likely to cause very serious injury. As Dr Oates noted it was more chance that no internal injuries were also caused given the severity of the blow. A must have been in considerable distress immediately afterwards and considerable pain. At his age and with his limited language he may well have been unable to communicate what had happened to a nonperpetrator. The experts agree that the symptoms he would have displayed thereafter would not have put a non-perpetrator carer on alert to the fact that he had sustained fractures to his ribs and scapula. </p>

Having regard to the photographs and the parents&#8217; accounts it appears that that account was wrong. In fact, he had sustained the injuries more like 10 days before. Thus the photographic evidence and the medical evidence and the parents&#8217; accounts of the dating of the photographs broadly align. It is in the aftermath of this visit to the hospital that the first respondent told the third respondent that police and social services had been contacted and were visiting the house. She herself says that she told him that because she had become concerned that A was fearful of him. He confirms he was told this and that he understood social services and/or police had visited the home. The combination of the evidence that A had sustained very serious fracture injuries together with obvious facial bruising and the first respondent&#8217;s evidence that she was sufficiently concerned to fabricate a tale of social services involvement point to the likelihood not just that she was suspicious but that she believed that the third respondent had seriously assaulted A. She describes how on occasions A would return from another part of the house sporting an injury which the third respondent attributed to an accident. I conclude on the balance of probabilities that on an occasion in late October she observed A with the serious facial bruising that is seen from the 27 to 29 October and that she was given an explanation that this was the result of an accident, but that she by that stage at the latest had come to believe that the third respondent was the cause of the injuries rather than an accident. Only that level of belief is consistent with her fabricating the social services story. I do not conclude that the first respondent had directly witnessed an assault of the nature which caused the fractures and facial bruising because I do not believe that even she would have tolerated that and nor do I believe that the third respondent would have committed such an act in her presence. Perhaps the explanation of the fabricated social services story is that the first respondent and the third respondent did indeed delay taking A for medical attention because they were aware of and discussed the possibility of social services involvement given the severity of the facial injuries. Whether the delay was the result of a joint decision, or the third respondent placing the first respondent under pressure not to seek medical attention I am unable to discern. However I am satisfied that there was a delay in seeking medical attention that was linked to a fear of social services intervention and that the first respondent then played that card after she had taken A to the hospital in, as Ms Kaur described it, a feeble attempt to provide some protection to A.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Taking all of the evidence together leads me to conclude that the third respondent is a man who is capable of serious violence. His loss of control and undisputed use of physical violence to the car on 9 July illustrate how for him the relatively modest event of a car breakdown could translate into a serious loss of control. That he was under the influence of alcohol only to a modest extent is a more rather than less worrying feature. It suggests that only relatively minor frustrating events or minor changes to his physiology can lead to loss of control. The text messages display a threatening attitude towards S and her partner. I accept that the third respondent also sent offensive texts to the first respondent and that there is evidence that he was jealous and suspicious. I accept the first respondent&#8217;s evidence (corroborated in part by the third respondent&#8217;s own response) that she accused him of causing trauma to A, and that he responded with a further threatening text referring to injecting A with water. The evidence in respect of his propensity to use violence is graphically illustrated by the photographs of the first respondent&#8217;s injuries taken by the police after the incident on 20 March 2019. The evidence of the first respondent together with the contemporaneous or near contemporaneous evidence from the police and the kebab shop and his implausible account show that on that occasion he subjected the first respondent to a vicious beating using implements such as a tablet and a rolling </p>

It is inconceivable that the first respondent would have inflicted the injuries shown in those photographs upon herself and why on earth would she, within moments of an assault by a stranger, run into a kebab shop and complained that the third respondent had assaulted her. Her evidence of the assault upon her on the 9 or 10 July is consistent with the father&#8217;s behaviour on that occasion. I also accept her evidence in relation to the August and 26 November assaults upon her. All of these strands of evidence weave together to point to the conclusion that the third respondent is capable of serious violence with relatively little prompting. He has little respect for the law; within 6 weeks of being banned for 12 months he was again arrested for driving whilst disqualified, he has been in breach of bail conditions on at least two occasions that we know of. He was working long hours, he was under financial pressure, he was suspicious of the first respondent&#8217;s fidelity, he was about to become a new father, he was looking after and financially supporting a 2-year-old. He has a quick temper. I conclude that this toxic combination led him to inflict serious violence not only upon the first respondent but also upon A. </p>

However I conclude that her failure to protect A goes beyond this. She was aware of the third respondent&#8217;s propensity to violence, she having experienced it herself. By late October I am satisfied that she believed that he was inflicting injuries upon A as well as upon her. Whilst she cannot have been aware of the severity of the injuries that A had sustained in the form of the fractures the other injuries which she was aware of were sufficiently worrying to require her to immediately take steps to protect A. Her fictitious reference to social services and the police of itself is a sufficient demonstration of her awareness of the risk the third respondent posed to her son. By any objective measure she failed to act as a reasonable parent would. Subjectively she may be able to rely on her own fear of the third respondent and his likely reaction to her seeking to remove herself and A. Subjectively her lack of action may be explicable by her own vulnerability in terms of housing, finance and the imminent arrival of her second child. Even up until the morning of 29 November she continued to expose her son to the risk that the third respondent posed. Thereafter she did not disclose to police and social services the truth of his violence to her and her suspicions until early January. She failed to give a full account to the treating team at the hospital or the QMC; this could have had consequences. When interviewed by police she shielded the third respondent by failing to disclose his domestic violence to her and her concerns about his being violent to A.  Whilst I accept that she may have been fearful that upon her release from the police station she may have been returning to a home she shared with the third respondent and that he may have discovered what she had told the police it was still an example of her putting her own interests before those of her critically ill son. She continued to conduct a liaison of sorts with the third respondent up until March. I understand to some extent the predicament she by then was in, being homeless and with limited resources she could call upon to sustain her. However as a consequence of her failure to protect A from the third respondent he suffered injuries which could have killed him. When Mr Roche submitted that the second respondent believed the full story was still not being told I believe he is right. Perhaps the guilt that the first respondent carries arising out of her failure to take steps to protect A has prevented her so far from fully recognising her failings.</p>

In his statement he says they had a disagreement but it was only verbal. He denies hitting his friend.  In that he said M came out into the parking lot where he was and that he then pushed the car to a point where the police arrived. He denied driving the car at any stage. In his statement he makes no mention of having lost his temper and damaged the car. However in his oral evidence he also gave a different account. He told me that there was an initial disagreement and that he then drove his friend home and as he drove back he saw M and A. He stopped and asked her to get in. The car would not start. He says that R1 came out with A and she was helping him push the car when the police arrived. He agrees he kicked car and broke the windscreen whilst shouting and swearing. He also acknowledged that the following day upon his release from police custody he returned home and the there was an exchange about whose fault it was that he had been arrested. He initially described it as an argument but later said it was a discussion in which he simply acknowledged that it was his own fault and that was an end to it. </span><span style="font-weight:bold"/></p>

He plainly was under the influence of alcohol although not much over the limit.  He was trying to sell the car and it may be that the breakdown and the consequent financial loss was the cause of his loss of temper. This </span></p>

Given that both M and R3 agree that there was a discussion about whose fault it was he had been arrested it seems more likely that R3 somehow sought to blame the first respondent for his arrest rather than meekly accepting that he was at fault. That does not seem to me to be in his nature.

The first respondent&#8217;s evidence of the bruise and the covering up for it with the health visitor together with her evidence of the discussion in November as to how she had been unable to wash her hair appear to me to be authentic recollections which are consistent with an assault which caused a painful injury. Although the R3 may not have been under the influence of alcohol at this point I do not consider that this is inconsistent with the possibility of him assaulting M. The impression that emerges from the evidence together with his demeanour in the witness box leads me to conclude that he has a quick temper which he is capable of losing in the absence of alcohol. The presence of alcohol may make it more likely but is not a precondition. A was present in the car when R3 was smashing it up whilst swearing and shouting. The force used to smash the windscreen whether with his bare hands or an implement must have been considerable and A must have been scared and confused. The evidence as to whether R3 forced M to help push the car was not sufficiently clear to enable me to draw that conclusion. </span></p>

She said when the first respondent was told she appeared to smirk (the language used by nurse Hill in the notes). She recalled nurse Hill turning back to the first respondent and saying &#8217;do you understand what Dr C is saying&#8217; and the first respondent nodded her head. She said she saw A turn towards his mother and hold out his hand and saw the first respondent hold his hand. She did not recall him crying. Overall her impression was that the first respondent was more detached than she would have expected. She thought A was wary of anybody. The effect of Dr C&#8217;s evidence was that at no stage during either the earlier discussion of the history or the later discussion did the first respondent offer an explanation as to how A had sustained any of his injuries. </p>
