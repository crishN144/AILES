	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This matter was first listed before me on 9 November 2012 following a hearing in the Court of Appeal on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>November 2012.  It was listed before me for the purposes of enforcement of the order made by Mr Justice Hedley on 9 October 2012 for the return of two children, Jessica born 1 January 1998, now 15 years, and Tomas born 10 October 2000, now 13 years, to Spain, where they have effectively lived all their lives. The matter has returned back to me six times since that hearing.</p>

This is not the first time this has happened. In 2009 there were contested proceedings under the Hague Convention that went to the Court of Appeal. Those proceedings meant the children remained in a state of some uncertainty until their mother finally complied with court orders and returned them to Spain, some 6 months after she should have done.</p>

In August 2007 the family travelled to Wales so the mother and children could spend a year in Wales whilst the parties&#8217; house in Spain was being renovated, under the supervision of the father. In June 2008 the father travelled to Wales and returned to Spain with the children in August 2008. The mother followed shortly afterwards and the children were placed in Spanish schools.</p>

Once in Wales with the children the mother commenced proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. On 26 November 2008 the father issued an originating summons seeking a return order, pursuant to the provisions of the 1980 Hague Convention and Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (Brussels IIR). Following contested proceedings by order dated 27 March 2009 the President ordered the children to return to Spain forthwith. The mother appealed, the Court of Appeal granted permission but dismissed the appeal. The children returned to Spain with the mother in April 2009.</p>

That court ordered the children were to be in the sole custody of the father with contact to the mother. The Spanish court, in its judgment, drew attention to what it considered to be the mother&#8217;s influence on the children and her inability to be positive about the father.</p>

There was no contact at Christmas 2010 or Easter 2011. By June 2011 the mother had moved permanently to Wales.</p>

Thereafter there was contact in Wales at Christmas 2011 and Easter 2012. During the Easter holidays the children were visited by Marek Ganther of Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB), he contacted Carmarthenshire CC (LA), they decided to take no further action as the Spanish Social Services had already investigated the allegations made by the mother.</p>

The mother was represented. She filed a notice on 11 September 2012 that she intended to act in person. The matter came before Miss D Eaton Q.C. (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) on 13 September 2012. Sara was joined as a party and permitted to return to Spain accompanied by her paternal aunts.

He ordered the mother to hand over the children to the father at 4pm on 12 October 2012 at Cardiff Railway Station and the children were to be returned to Spain by midnight that day. Those orders were supported by a penal notice directed to the mother.</p>

Mr Justice Roderic Wood rejected all those applications, he made return orders requiring the children to be immediately returned to the jurisdiction of Spain, requested the local social services department and police force to assist in bringing about a return and made a collection order.</p>

The mother was taken in custody to London where she appeared before Mr Justice Roderic Wood at 2pm. Mr Justice Roderic Wood discharged her from custody and gave a short judgment indicating that he was disclosing the papers to the Attorney General for him to decide whether proceedings for contempt should be instigated. The court then sat in private. The hearing continued into the next day and judgment was given on 19 October 2012. In relation to the various applications before him he refused the application to join Jessica and Tomas as parties, refused permission to appeal such refusal, directed the LA to accommodate Jessica and Tomas pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>. He stayed the return orders until 29 October 2012 and made consequential orders in anticipation that the mother and/or Jessica and Tomas would appeal. Jessica and Tomas were placed with foster carers where they remained for six weeks until 1 December 2012.</p>

Directions were made with a view to the matter returning the following week to enable Jessica and Tomas to come and see me. After hearing submissions on the morning on the 15 November I saw Jessica and Tomas with two social workers from the LA. A note of that meeting is in the papers. They expressed their views about returning to Spain and I explained to them the orders that were in place and the need for them to be complied with. One matter that became clearer at that meeting was that they were in regular telephone contact with their siblings, in particular Eva and David and it was obvious they had a warm and close relationship with them and missed them.</p>

The plan following that hearing was that the father would come over to see Jessica and Tomas and spend some time with them and the matter was restored back to court the following Thursday. The father and Sara arrived on the Monday and had contact for the next three days. The contact notes report a growing warmth in the relationship between Jessica and Tomas and their father. It became less and less supervised; the contact on the Wednesday went very well with the children agreeing to extend it. The notes were particularly striking in describing the growing warmth between Tomas and his father. He said to the social worker on the way home from the Wednesday contact that the contact was fun and that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;he was very confused&#8217;.</span> Jessica said she had enjoyed the contact, she felt bad that she didn&#8217;t want to hurt her father but it had not changed her mind and she will not return to Spain.

Jessica is reported as saying instantly that she did not want to go to London and did not want to spend the weekend with her father. When the social worker explained the arrangements Tomas asked what they would be doing in London. She noted that Tomas did not initially refuse to go, however after Jessica stated that she would definitely not go Tomas said he did not want to go. When they got back to the foster carers Jessica remained resolute in her position that she did not want to go whereas Tomas asked what they would do in London. It appeared that Tomas was considering going but then followed Jessica after she re-stated her refusal to go. The social worker raised the question of contact with the father in Wales; Tomas said yes but later changed his mind when Jessica informed him that he would not be able to change his mind once he had decided. It was agreed that they would see their father with an interpreter that afternoon for a meal. The social worker dropped the children at the restaurant at 1.30. One of the social workers was contacted by the interpreter just after 2 and they returned to the restaurant. Jessica, Tomas and the interpreter were waiting in the car park. The father was about 40 metres away. The children were upset and wanted to leave. The interpreter reported that the situation in the restaurant had escalated when the children said they did not want to go to London. The father became angry and started shouting and Sara and Jessica were crying. The children reported that the father had said that he was giving up on them and &#8216;throwing the towel in&#8217;. On their way back to the foster carers Jessica remembered she had a toy she wanted Sara to give Eva. They returned to the car park and went to give the toy to Sara. The father was shouting at the children and appeared very angry. The children reported that the father had said he was returning to Spain that night. The father and Sara returned to Spain. That was the last time Jessica and Tomas saw their father and older sister.</p>

I decided it should be the former. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/31" uk:canonical="2004 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 2004</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/31" uk:canonical="2004 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 2004</ref>) established the Welsh Assembly (CAFCASS CYMRU) as a separate body which took over the principal functions of Cafcass (as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/43/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/43" uk:canonical="2000 c. 43" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/43" uk:canonical="2000 c. 43" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CJCSA 2000</ref>) as amended by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/31" uk:canonical="2004 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 2004</ref>) in Wales. According to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/31/section/35" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 35</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/31" uk:canonical="2004 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 2004</ref> this was only in relation to children <span style="color:#000000">&#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">ordinarily resident in Wales&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000">which it was agreed Jessica and Tomas were not. For the hearing on 16 January 2013 </span>Mr Hinchliffe helpfully submitted an agreed document setting out the position. It is common ground now that there is a difficulty with the current practice on allocation as between Cafcass and CAFCASS CYMRU of 1980 Hague cases. Up to now this has been governed by the Practice Note issued jointly in 2006, with the approval of the President, by Cafcass and the National Assembly for Wales (CAFCASS CYMRU). Para 9 states that 1980 Hague cases where the child is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;usually resident&#8221;</span> in Wales will be referred to CAFCASS CYMRU.<span style="color:#000000"> Mr Hinchliffe submits those drafting the legislation and the Practice Note were under the impression that children </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">&#8220;ordinarily resident&#8221;</span><span style="color:#000000"> in Wales included children the subject of 1980 Hague proceedings who had been abducted to, or retained in, Wales. He submits it now appears this was a misapprehension and that such children are not ordinarily resident in Wales and so cannot come within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/31" uk:canonical="2004 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 2004</ref>, but do come within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/43" uk:canonical="2000 c. 43" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CJCSA 2000</ref>. In other words, 1980 Hague cases in Wales ought properly to be referred to Cafcass, in the person of the service manager of the High Court Team,&#160; when a report on child&#8217;s objections or on settlement,&#160; or representation by a children&#8217;s guardian or some similar function, is required by the court. None of this affects the other functions set out in the Practice Note, which is currently under review. I agree with that analysis.</span></p>

He had seen Jessica and Tomas separately and together, he had spent over 2 1/2 hours with them. What he described in his evidence as the &#8216;headlines&#8217; were that both of them said there was no way they are going [to Spain] and that no one is going to prevail upon them to return on any of the scenarios that are available. He described them as being insistent and that they will resist to the utmost. They agree that if it were possible to participate in the Spanish proceedings from this country they would do so. He reported that both were anxious for things to be sorted out <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;but on their terms&#8217;.</span> Mr Mellor set out his view that however they have come to think and feel the way they do he saw<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8216;no prospect of anyone prevailing upon them at this stage, in their current frame of mind, to comply with the orders made for their return&#8217;.</span> He described the resistance shown as being <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;exceptional&#8217;</span> in his experience. In answer to questions from Mr Setright Q.C. he confirmed his view that he could see some benefits in Jessica and Tomas being returned to the care of their mother, as he could see no purpose in them continuing to be placed with the foster carers. Following that evidence I determined the mother&#8217;s application for Jessica and Tomas to be returned to her care. That application was supported by the LA and not actively opposed by the father who saw the force of Mr Mellor&#8217;s rationale for his opinion. I discharged the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> order and Jessica and Tomas returned to their mother&#8217;s care the following day.</p>

Having considered the criteria set out in paragraph 7.2 PD16A Family Procedure Rules 2010 I concluded that Jessica and Tomas should be joined as parties. The most persuasive factor for me was that Mr Mellor&#8217;s opinion, which I accepted, was that they should be parties so they could fully articulate their case. Other features I considered relevant were that due to the position of the parents I considered the court would benefit in having separate representations made on behalf of Jessica and Tomas and it was clear they were opposed to the course of action proposed by the father.</p>

In my judgment the harsh reality is that both Jessica and Tomas have been fundamentally let down by their mother by her refusal to comply with the court order requiring them to return to Spain. She has put them in an impossible situation which has resulted in them being physically separated from their siblings, with whom they have always lived and clearly have a close relationship with. Her actions have, in my judgment, fractured those significant relationships to the long term detriment of all the children. Despite the orders in place in the Spanish courts and the attempts by this court and the Court of Appeal, together with undertakings offered by the father to ensure the return would take place with no risk to the mother of further proceedings on her return to Spain she has, wholly unreasonably in my view, refused to exercise her parental responsibility in relation to Jessica and Tomas in such a way that would assist and support them to return to Spain and be re-united with their father and siblings. </p>

On behalf of the father he invites the court to make an order requiring the mother to return the children to Spain. He accepts it would not be an immediate return and in the order he submitted to the court during the hearing he sought an order that the mother return the children to Spain by 15 February 2013 and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;shall take all practicable and reasonable steps to encourage, persuade and facilitate the children to return to the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Spain</span>&#8217; and the current restriction on the mother speaking to the children about these proceedings be lifted to the extent necessary for her to comply with the proposed injunction.<span style="font-weight:bold"/> He said the objective is not to commit the mother for contempt, he said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;it is not an order that requires an unacceptable level of coercion&#8217;</span> but places the obligation on the mother to persuade the children to go back. He accepts in the situation that exists it is not easy but, he submits, over time she is likely to have influence on these children and the aim of the order sought is to require her to take those steps. The intention behind the order is to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;secure the return not to commit but if the order is not complied with committal must be in the court&#8217;s armoury&#8217;</span>. He described this as a soft approach with a hard edge. He said if the court declined to make such an order further negotiation and the softer approach can continue.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Hames submits there should be a stay on the enforcement of the return order. He does not seek a limit of time, referring to what he seeks in his submissions as an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;indefinite&#8217;</span> stay rather than a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;permanent&#8217;</span> stay.  He submits rule 4.1 (3) (g) Family Procedure Rules 2010 clothes the court with a general power to order a stay.  He relies on the editors note in <span style="font-style:italic">TB v JB (Abduction Grave Risk of harm) [2001] 2 FLR</span> 515 and the transcript record of that hearing which states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;In the light of the circumstances which have occurred since the date of the orders of 19</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> December 2000 and 25</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span><span style="font-style:italic"> April 2001, it is impractical to return the two children to New Zealand at present and we grant a stay of execution of the two orders on terms that the mother complies [with contact]&#8217;</span>. There is no authoritative guidance on the test to be applied to an application for the stay of a return order. Mr Hames submits that the starting point is that the court will try to enforce its own orders. There are cases where the children would simply refuse to board a plane or would create such a disturbance on the plane that the captain would refuse to take them (by way of illustration <span style="font-style:italic">Re HB (Abduction Children&#8217;s Objections) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 1 FLR 422" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 1 FLR 422</ref>)</span><span style="font-weight:bold">. </span>He submits the previous attempts at enforcement by this court have not worked. The collection order and subsequent attempts thereafter have failed. In those circumstances, he submits, a stay is a proportionate, realistic and justifiable order. This would acknowledge what the children are saying about the reality and practicality of enforcement (the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;well is dry&#8217;</span>) and prevent any <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;disorderly&#8217;</span> implementation of the order and would recognise that enforcement at the moment is not <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;practical or realistic&#8217;</span>.

He submits that such an order would practically be impossible to implement at the moment. Since the return order was made there have been at least 10 hearings where the court, as the central authority, has undertaken intensive measures including the children being placed in the care of the Local Authority, having contact with their father, being seen by me and interviewed twice by Mr Mellor in an effort to persuade them to return. Despite those intensive measures Jessica and Tomas have remained unswerving in their views that they do not wish to return to Spain. Both parents have remained resolute in their respective positions and whilst there may be concern regarding the conduct of both parents during this process he submits <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;we are where we are&#8217;</span>. The court should not make a further order to achieve what is currently on the evidence impossible. This submission is made in the context where the Guardian would be very pleased if Jessica and Tomas were re-united with their siblings in Spain where it is agreed issues concerning their welfare should be determined. In giving effect to the duty and obligations that arise under The Hague Convention there can be an end point when the court has done all that it can in the circumstances of the case; he submits that has been reached in this case.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Setright Q.C. in response to the stay argument makes a number of points. First, <span style="font-style:italic">TB v TJ (ibid)</span> can be distinguished as it was against a different legal background. It pre-dates Brussels IIR. Brussels IIR now takes precedence over the Hague Convention as regards applications concerning Member States of the Regulation. He submits the whole scheme of the Regulation, in particular Article 11 and the enforcement provisions are incompatible with the notion that any court can circumvent the procedures of the Regulation by granting an indefinite stay.   <span style="font-style:italic"/>Second, the Spanish court has heard this case in great depth and has ordered a return. There is very limited room for manoeuvre in this jurisdiction whilst that regime remains in place. Comity obliges this court to honour decisions of the Spanish court. A stay would send the wrong message in this case, that this court had given up on its&#8217; obligations, in particular under Article 8. In effect the court would be making a welfare decision when it is agreed that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of Spain. Third what is the need for a stay? It is not being suggested that this father is a risk to the children who would take some outlandish direct action that would be damaging to the children. There is no evidence to support such a suggestion from which the children need protection. He submitted that perhaps what lay behind the application is that tactically the mother might want a stay to take the heat off compliance with the orders and by granting a stay that would send the wrong message to the mother and the children. If a stay was being sought pending a specific event, for example the outcome of any appeal process in Spain that application should be made to the Spanish court. Fourthly, any stay is, in effect, a stay on the operation of the Spanish order. To grant such an application would give a wrong message; it would give an indication by this court that the Spanish orders and the order under the Hague Convention that supports it should not be enforced, which is not the function of this court. Fifthly, any suggestion on behalf of the Guardian that Jessica is only a year away from being outside the Hague regime is manipulative and welfare driven, is wrong in principle and is not a basis or justification for a stay. Sixthly the suggestion that a stay will provide a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;breathing space&#8217;</span> ignores the Article 39 procedure and applications to lift the stay. It is therefore equally likely to encourage more litigation.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although Sara does not remain a party I have read the written submissions filed on her behalf by Mr Harrison Q.C. and Ms Wilkins. In relation to the stay Mr Harrison Q.C. submits that this court has no jurisdiction to grant a permanent stay; there is a residual power in the CA to grant a temporary stay. The stay in <span style="font-style:italic">TB v JB (ibid)</span> was given on the third occasion the matter was dealt with by the CA, there was no full judgment, it was done after hearing a wholly unprecedented account of the Tipstaff&#8217;s attempt to enforce the order of the CA and the court concluded that it could not be implemented. In the second judgment of the CA in the TB case the President observed that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the Court of Appeal has the right to revisit its own order for the purpose of enforcement or implementation&#8217;</span> and a little later observes <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;There remains a residual power, it seems to me, in the Court of Appeal to deal with some exceptional change of circumstances which might render the order impracticable to enforce, or putting it another way, the implementation impossible of fulfilment.&#8217;</span> He submits that the limited and exceptional power not to implement a return order, which was identified in <span style="font-style:italic">TB</span> was one which vested solely in the CA and not in a Court at first instance.

Accordingly, this court&#8217;s role is very limited, particularly against the backdrop of the Art 39 procedure for enforcement. All first instance welfare decisions in Spain relating to where the children should live and contact are extant.

That would mean there would very likely be the prospect of a committal application on the horizon which would, in my judgment, further polarise this fractured family with little or no prospect of the underlying purpose of the order being achieved. Both Jessica and Tomas have made their position clear to Mr Mellor (in particular at paragraph 9 of his report dated 10 January 2013) leading him to conclude that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">....in their present frame of mind, it is extremely unlikely that Jessica and Tomas can be prevailed upon to return to Spain&#8217;</span>. The mother is to be deprecated for the position she takes. She has, in my judgment, abdicated her parental responsibility for these children and she will have to answer to them and their siblings in due course. I do not see her position now in isolation, it has been part of a concerted campaign by her over a number of years to thwart and undermine the legitimate orders made regarding the welfare of these children in Spain. The decision I have reached is in no way determined by her wholly unjustified position, but I cannot ignore it when I consider all the circumstances.</p>

However that obligation needs to be considered against the backdrop of the steps that have already been taken and the evaluation the court has undertaken of the further steps proposed in each case.
