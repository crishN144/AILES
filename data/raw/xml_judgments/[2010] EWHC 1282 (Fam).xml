It arises out of private law residence and contact proceedings relating to three children Kab, born 21 October 2003 (6 years 7 months); Kar, born 5 September 2004 (5 years 4 months); and Qad, born 22 October 2006 (3 years 7 months).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The finding of fact hearing was originally listed for 5 days. In fact it took no less than 17 days in four tranches over 9 months. The hearing spanned 5 days in April 2009, 4 days in July 2009, 5 days in October 2009, and the evidence finished after a further 3 days in November 2009. In addition to the parents the District Judge heard evidence from no less than 13 other witnesses. He made over 300 pages of handwritten notes of the evidence. The transcript of the evidence runs to over 1600 pages.  In the proceedings the children were separately represented by a guardian, solicitors and counsel. F&#8217;s costs were over &#163;120,000; they were privately funded. I have not been told the costs of M and the Guardian; I doubt they were much less. They were publicly funded. Judgment was provided in draft on 18 January 2010; an amended draft judgment was provided on 20 January 2010; and a finalised judgment containing yet further amendments was provided on 22 January 2010 (although it is formally dated 20 January 2010).</p>

In fact the court considered many more allegations than those in the Scott Schedules.</p>

		  <intro>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The jurisdiction in such cases is one of great difficulty, as every judge who has had to exercise it must be aware. The main reason is that in most of these cases there is no right answer. All practicable answers are to some extent unsatisfactory and therefore to some extent wrong, and the best that can be done is to find an answer that is reasonably satisfactory. It is comparatively seldom that the Court of Appeal, even if it would itself have preferred a different answer, can say that the judge's decision was wrong, and unless it can say so, it will leave his decision undisturbed. The limited role of the Court of Appeal in such cases was explained by Cumming-Bruce LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Clarke-Hunt v Newcombe</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1983) 4 FLR 482" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">(1983) 4 FLR 482</ref>, where he said, at p. 486: </p>

		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">'There was not really a right solution; there were two alternative wrong solutions. The problem of the judge was to appreciate the factors pointing in each direction and to decide which of the two bad solutions was the least dangerous, having regard to the long-term interests of the children, and so he decided the matter. Whether I would have decided it the same way if I had been in the position of the trial judge I do not know. I might have taken the same course as the judge and I might not, but I was never in that situation. I am sitting in the Court of Appeal deciding a quite different question: has it been shown that the judge to whom Parliament has confided the exercise of discretion, plainly got the wrong answer? I emphasize the word "Plainly". In spite of the efforts of [counsel] the answer to that question clearly must be that the judge has not been shown plainly to have got it wrong.'</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">If there is indeed a discretion in which various factors are relevant, the evaluation and balancing of those factors is also a matter for the trial judge. Only if his decision is so plainly wrong that he must have given far too much weight to a particular factor is the appellate court entitled to interfere: see <span style="font-style:italic">G v G </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] 1 WLR 647" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] 1 WLR 647</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] FLR 894" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] FLR 894</ref>. Too ready an interference by the appellate court, particularly if it always seems to be in the direction of one result rather than the other, risks robbing the trial judge of the discretion entrusted to him by the law. In short, if trial judges are led to believe that, even if they direct themselves impeccably on the law, make findings of fact which are open to them on the evidence, and are careful, as this judge undoubtedly was, in their evaluation and weighing of the relevant factors, their decisions are liable to be overturned unless they reach a particular conclusion, they will come to believe that they do not in fact have any choice or discretion in the matter. On that ground alone, and even assuming that the principles applied by the judge were indeed correct, I would allow this appeal.</p>

As Mrs Talbot Rice rightly reminded us, an appellate court is severely handicapped in judging the credibility of oral evidence, even though transcripts are provided, because it has not heard and seen the witnesses giving evidence nor observed their demeanour. She has referred us to statements in <span style="font-style:italic">Benmax v Austin Motor Co Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1955] 1 All ER 326" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1955">[1955] 1 All ER 326</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1955] AC 370" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1955">[1955] AC 370</ref><span style="font-family:Verdana"/>which made it clear how very difficult it is for an appellate court to interfere with a finding of primary fact founded on the credibility of a witness. Although that case suggests that it may be easier for an appellate court to interfere with an inference drawn from primary facts, that must now be read subject to the cautionary words of Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Biogen Inc v Medeva plc</span> (1997) 38 BMLR 149 that specific findings of fact are inherently an incomplete statement of the impression made on the trial judge by the primary evidence and that such findings are always surrounded by a penumbra of imprecision as to emphasis, relative weight, minor qualification and nuance. It is accordingly necessary for this court to treat the judge's findings with appropriate respect. It must be very slow indeed to interfere with any such findings. That, however, does not mean that an appeal on fact can never succeed. If this court is convinced that the judge was plainly wrong, then it is its duty to interfere.</p>

There is a parallel with allegations of conduct in ancillary relief proceedings. Even though there is a statutory imperative to take into account conduct where it would be inequitable to disregard it, the court will strike out allegations of conduct where it can be satisfied that even if proved it would make no material difference to the result: see <span style="font-style:italic">McCartney v Mills-McCartney </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1508" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1508</ref>. </p>

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.</p>

If you have a double headed penny then the probability (P) of tossing a head is absolute certainty. This is expressed as P = 1. The probability of not tossing a head is zero. This is expressed as P = 0 or  Q = 1. For a normal penny the probability is tossing a head is P = 0.5, and the probability of not tossing a head is Q = 0.5. The probability of rolling a six on a die is one in 6: P = 0.1666 and Q = 0.8333. </p>

The various judicial statements that a more serious charge requires more clear evidence is not an elevation of P &gt; 0.5. The requirement of evidential clarity is quite distinct from an elevation of the probability standard. Were it otherwise, and, say, an allegation of rape or murder of a child made in civil proceedings required P to be set at &gt; 0.6 then one could end up in the position where a court considered that P in such a case was, say 0.51 but still had to find that it did not happen; when, as a matter of probability, is was more likely that not that it did. This would be absurd and perverse. P must always be set at &gt; 0.5 in civil proceedings, but subject to the proviso that the more serious the allegation so the evidence must be clearer.</p>

In addition a total of 49 allegations were made against M by members of F&#8217;s wider family and other third parties. In her Scott schedule M raised 9 allegations against F.  Thus there were a total of 89 allegations in issue. The District Judge found in favour of M on all 89 allegations. In F&#8217;s favour he found none at all.  Many of the allegations are of an extremely trivial nature; some less so; and some do amount to serious allegations of domestic violence capable of constituting crimes. </p>

On first reading the judgment my impression was of a case that had acquired an unstoppable momentum of its own, where the scope and scale of the inquiry, and the investigation of collateral issues, was wholly disproportionate to the allegations in play. Above all, there does not seem to have been any process of pausing for thought as the case ground on throughout 2009 and of asking whether in fact the exercise had any ulterior purpose. If M won on all 89 allegations (as she did) was this going to make any difference to issues of residence and contact? If she won on only half of them would the result be different?    </p>

I am at a loss to comprehend what is going to be argued about over the 10 days or how the factual findings are going to assist in informing a materially different outcome to that which has been agreed for the interim. I inquired of Mr Metaxa whether M would be seeking at final disposal unequal shared care in her favour. He replied affirmatively and explained that the reason for doing so was twofold namely to coerce F into (a) cooperating more fully with professionals and (b) presenting a more positive image of her to the children. I wondered how an unequal shared care of say 60/40 as opposed to 50/50 would in fact achieve those objectives. Later, I was told that M would agree equal shared care provided that F provided her by way of ancillary relief with an unencumbered home.    </p>

All that has been achieved is that M now has in her hands a damning series of findings against F which I suspect may well come to haunt their future dealings as co-parents of these children. Mr Metaxa would argue that the exercise has not been futile; that the protracted and highly adversarial forensic process has been instrumental in making F behave reasonably towards her, to stop demonising her in the eyes of the children and to engage in responsible co-parenting. There may be some truth in this but as I remarked, if accurate, it represents a prodigious expenditure of public resources simply to give F a stern reality check about his responsibilities. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 18 January 2010 the District Judge provided his judgment in draft, and asked the parties to supply suggested corrections. It is highly significant that at that stage the District Judge did not append his findings on the individual 89 allegations contained in the Scott Schedule. The text of the draft judgment was overwhelmingly favourable to M and conversely unfavourable to F; and so F could probably infer that he would receive an unfavourable verdict on the majority of the allegations at large. That said, it is a remarkable and highly unsatisfactory state of affairs that F was not able to know from the terms of the draft judgment whether, for example, it had been found proven that he did beat his then pregnant wife within a few months of her arrival here. </p>

After charting the background and some details of the litigation history, and after setting out the law on the burden and standard of proof, the District Judge embarked on a lengthy account of the oral evidence. This account, which occupied paras 49 - 195, does not form part of the court&#8217;s findings but is intended to be a neutral summary of the relevant evidence necessary for the judgmental phase to follow.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In para 196 &#8211; 239 the District Judge sets out his assessment of the parties, their witnesses and his findings. It is a damning indictment of F and all members of his family. They are all found to have given false testimony. F is found to have been guilty of gross litigation misconduct, including making unwarranted allegations of perjury against the independent social worker Ms Khan, and in preventing important third party witnesses (his own) from coming to court to face the music. Although some specific factual finding were made in the body of the judgment (see paras 219, 225, and 234) the great majority of the 89 allegations featuring in the Scott Schedules are not dealt with. To discover those findings one has to turn to the District Judge&#8217;s indorsements on the Scott schedules. These only arrived at the aborted hearing on 20 January 2009 when a second draft judgment was provided. Here we find what I described in argument as &#8220;jury verdicts&#8221;. For each of M&#8217;s nine allegations the verdict was simply &#8220;Allegation is true on a balance of probability&#8221;. For the overwhelming majority of F&#8217;s 80 allegations the verdict was merely &#8220;Allegation is false&#8221;. There was no expressed rationalisation for each verdict. The reader is not to know why M&#8217;s case has been preferred to F&#8217;s in each instance. </p>

This issue acquired a life of its own and appears to have got completely out of control. It occupied a wholly disproportionate amount of the court&#8217;s time.  Swathes of the judgment (14 pages) are devoted to it.  Essentially the issue boiled down to an allegation that F, having procured statements from these witnesses, made a plot with members of his family to prevent them coming to give live evidence. Quite why F would want to do this, given that the consequence would be the attribution of negligible weight to the statements, eludes me. At all events the findings were as follows (para 225):</p>

The main issue for the District Judge was, as it should have been, the parties&#8217; credibility in the light of all the available evidence. Having been able to make clear adverse findings about the Father&#8217;s credibility on a number of matters &#8211; all of the greatest relevance to the case &#8211; and having also assessed the Mother&#8217;s credibility, and that of other relevant witnesses, he was then able to make the findings he did. It is accepted by the Mother that the findings made against the Father on these matters were indeed &#8220;extremely serious and damaging&#8221;. The District Judge had little option on what had had transpired before him on these issues but to make the findings he did and place considerable reliance on them when assessing the overall credibility of the parents and when making all the determinations he was asked to make. To describe this as &#8220;smoke and mirrors&#8221; appears to suggest that Father does not think the adverse findings as to his credibility were of relevance to the court&#8217;s overall determination on contested matters. Doubtless the Father would have liked the court to consider his allegations against the Mother in the absence of these &#8220;extremely damaging&#8221; findings: his own misconduct made this impossible.</p>

The question is whether he was right to do so. After all, at its highest, it was a misguided piece of litigation misconduct designed to prevent two witnesses who F thought might not come up to proof attending to give live evidence.

Domestic Violence is nowadays rightly regarded as the great taboo, so when it is alleged in a private law case there is an immediate instinct that it should be the subject of a preliminary fact finding hearing. The seriousness of the allegations for the alleged perpetrator must mean that the allegations are carefully pleaded and are the subject of clear evidence. In making factual findings the court must examine carefully any inconsistencies made by the complainant, and where inconsistencies are exposed these must be clearly analysed and rationalised in the verdict. If someone is to be found guilty of domestic violence then fairness demands that it is clearly explained to him why his defence has been rejected and why the case advanced by the complainant accepted.</p>

The Applicant accepts that in the letter she had set out to her mother how unhappy she was and the extent to which her mother-in-law was making complaint about her and complaint about her to the Respondent.  The Applicant felt very isolated.  The Applicant did not post the letter however the letter was discovered by the Applicant&#8217;s sister-in-law.  The letter was written in Bengali and the Respondent was unable to read it however he had his mother read the content.  The Respondent became angry as to the matters referred to by the Applicant to her own mother of the Respondent&#8217;s mother.  The Respondent hit the Applicant about her face about 6 or 7 times.  After the incident of violence the Applicant was then cursed by the Respondent&#8217;s mother and by her sister-in-law and brother-in-law.</p>

The M confirmed she had written letters to her own mother in the past which had been posted by the F but there was one particular letter the M said she had written to her mother which she had not asked the F to post. It was contained within her diary as a loose letter. Jo told her brother that she saw the M writing something which she hid. She and Da then searched in all the drawers and found a diary and a letter. The F gave the letter to his mother to read as it was written in Bengali. The M told me in the letter she had referred to her mother in law as &#8220;betty&#8221; which I am told translates to mean &#8220;lady&#8221; and is taken to be disrespectful in the context in which it was written when referring to someone as such. The M said she had written the letter some 2 or 3 weeks before it was found and her reason for writing was to get her &#8220;inner feelings&#8221; out to her own mother.</p>

However the F did not believe her and she said he continued to slap her. She told me she knows her mother in law still has the letter because she had shown her the same on many occasions. In any event neither the letter nor the M diary has been produced. The F denied the events as described by the M in this allegation as ever happening and said there is no diary. The paternal grandmother told me this incident never happened in her house and therefore asked how she could remember it. Further if the incident never happened she did not curse any one. </p>

To the Guardian M described the incident as occurring when she wrote things in her diary. In this account her mother-in-law finds the diary and F slapped her on the cheek and punches her on the shoulder. Obviously there are significant inconsistencies namely as to where M wrote down her concerns; who found the document; and how F assaulted her. When these inconsistencies were put to M in cross examination, she changed her story yet again and said for the first time that the letter had been placed in the diary, and the diary had contained love songs written by her.</p>

The Respondent, his mother, his brother and sister-in-law went out from the hotel early each morning returning very late at night and leaving the Applicant alone with the care of the two children Kab and Kar.  After four days the family moved from the hotel into the new villa.  The Applicant and the two children had to sleep downstairs on the floor.  Again the Applicant remained with the children all day.  Towards the end of the holiday the Applicant asked whether it would be possible for the Respondent to spend a day with her and the children and to take them to the seaside.  The Respondent became very angry and shouted at the Applicant as to her position within the family.  Later that evening the Respondent became very, very angry with the Applicant shouting, cursing and swearing.  The Applicant was feeding Kab.  A further argument ensued, the Applicant accepts that she became very upset and was crying.  The Respondent dragged the Applicant physically to the bedroom and held a hand over her face.  The Respondent then slapped the Applicant across the face.  The Applicant accepts she slapped the Respondent back.  Immediately the Respondent&#8217;s mother said &#8220;Did you see that?  She raised her hand to her husband?&#8221;  The Respondent stood in front of the Applicant and tried to slap the Applicant right and left across her face, the Respondent&#8217;s mother picked up used nappies from the bathroom and threw them at the Applicant and spat at her.</p>

She would not put the clothes back into the wardrobe when he told her to do so and it was then he hit her with a coat hanger.

She also states that F assaulted her at the same time with his hands (this is not stated elsewhere). There is no mention of the incident to the police. In the account to the Guardian there is no mention of any injury whatsoever, rather &#8220;she put cold water on her arm and it was fine&#8221;.

The Respondent&#8217;s sister sprayed water in the Applicant&#8217;s face.  The Applicant asked the Respondent&#8217;s sister why she had done this who responded by saying &#8220;If I had fire I would put fire in your face&#8221; (Zo).  The Applicant&#8217;s sister-in-law then goaded her and wanted her to come near to her so that she could hit the Applicant.  The Applicant&#8217;s mother-in-law grabbed hold of the Applicant, the Respondent&#8217;s sister then threw a shoe at the Applicant (Zo) and at this point the Respondent came into the area (the Respondent having been upstairs), the Respondent got angry with the Applicant for having talked back to his family.  The Respondent&#8217;s mother told the Applicant to get out of the house.  The Applicant said that she would go and went upstairs.  The Applicant called the police, the Respondent snatched the phone from the Applicant.  The Respondent&#8217;s mother spoke to the Applicant saying &#8220;What makes you think you are allowed to use the phone, nothing in this house belongs to you&#8221;.  The police wanted to speak to the Applicant and she spoke to them.  Subsequently police officers attended.  Later that day the Respondent&#8217;s sister, Ma, spoke to the Applicant saying &#8220;Why did you not go to the dads&#8221;. The Applicant took this to mean the police but this actual expression is very insulting in the Bengali language.  The Respondent&#8217;s sister then began pushing and prodding the Applicant in her shoulder (Ma).  The Respondent came in to the room and spoke to the Applicant saying &#8220;You are a shameless person, why are you still in my house?  He went on to say &#8220;You see I&#8217;ll kick you out in a while&#8221;.  The Applicant came downstairs to get some food for the children.  Comments were made by other family members &#8220;Is that shameless thing still in our house&#8221;.  The Applicant was feeding Qad, the Respondent came in and told the Applicant to get out of the property.  The Respondent&#8217;s sister started shoving and pushing the Applicant again.  The Respondent&#8217;s sister simply asked the Applicant &#8220;Why not just go?&#8221;  The Respondent&#8217;s sister suggested the Applicant go to her aunt&#8217;s home.  The Applicant was pushed and shoved by various members of the Respondent&#8217;s family.  The Respondent then punched the Applicant and one of the Respondent&#8217;s sisters also did.  Once pushed out of the house the Applicant was restrained by the Respondent&#8217;s sisters from getting in and was pulled back by her hair the whole incident being witnessed by the parties&#8217; children.</p>

The M told me she was asked by the police officer if she wished to leave the property to which she said no because she had nowhere to go, her aunt&#8217;s home in Whitechapel being too small and because it was Ramadan. The officer said he would give the family a warning. The M told me after the police officers left Ma verbally abused her and also punched her on her shoulder. The F came in to her bedroom and Kab she said was nearby. When the M told the F to tell his sister not to hit her she [Ma] denied she had done so and told the F to leave. Kab she said told his F that she had been hit by Ma and she was shown a text she had sent to Naveen a boy she had known in Bangladesh. The paternal grandmother then started accusing her of having <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;many men&#8221;</span> which the M said she denied.</p>

Qad had fallen asleep and a little while later the M said she went downstairs where she made noodles to feed the children. The rest of the family were in the living room and she told me she could hear them talking about her. She believes the family were planning how to get her out of the house. The M told me when she subsequently came down the stairs the paternal grandmother and Jo said to her &#8220;haven&#8217;t you gone yet&#8221; again denied by them. Ja arrived home around 6.00/6.30 pm. The paternal grandmother told me she saw the M had a suitcase and asked her where she was going with it.</p>

When my youngest son came inside, I made a split second decision and instinctively shut the door on her; I was petrified that she would take my children to Bangladesh and that I would never see them again&#8221; Ja and Ma refer to the M having a bag or bags in their police statements but nothing is said about what happened to either the suitcase, the bag or the bags or the contents. The F told me it suddenly dawned upon him as the M had a suitcase and the children&#8217;s passports he decided to keep the children because of his fear the M would take the children to Bangladesh.</p>

The F having taken hold of Qad from Ja shut the door and the F put the chain on. She was then hit by Ja and held her by one of her hands. With the other hand the M said she was banging on the door to be let in and then called to Kab through the letter box. She told me Ja pulled her from her hair away from the door saying at the same time if she continued banging on the door the police would be called and they would make a case against her. The M said she was punched by Ja in the shoulder, pushed into her car and then driven to her aunt&#8217;s in Whitechapel. The M denied she had any suitcase with her. When giving her evidence on this incident I observed the F to be emotionless whereas upon recalling the same was clearly very painful for the M who cried throughout.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The last incident concerns mother&#8217;s leaving of the FMH on the 3rd September 2008. In her Scott Schedule the mother refers to an argument with F during which Jo sprays water at her and states:  &#8220;if I had fire I would put it in your face&#8221;. This is in complete contrast with what she told the Contact Supervisor on the 29.9.08 that Jo has said she was spraying mother to cool her down. Both accounts cannot be right. Again it is suggested that the mother is deliberately setting out to exaggerate and mislead in her account to the Court.  The Scott Schedule continues that Jo was goading the mother to hit her. The mother in law then grabbed the mother and Jo threw a shoe at her. This account of grabbing and throwing a shoe is not in the mother&#8217;s FLA statement at para 7 pE16. Neither is it in the account given to Matthew Pilkington by the mother. In the Scott Schedule F now comes downstairs and drags the mother into the kitchen. No mention is made of this to Dr Whittle (internal page 5 at F44). The Scott Schedule then records that the mother in law told the mother to leave the house. The mother said she would go. However, to Matthew Pilkington the mother stated that she decided she wanted to leave the house and take Kab with her (para 32 F7). To Dr Whittle the mother said that she said she would leave and told Kab to get his things (internal p5 F44). Her mother in law said she could leave but without the children. Mother then called the police and F is alleged to have  snatched the phone from her. This is not referred to in the mother FLA statement. The police then attended and offered to escort the mother from the premises but she refused. The Scott Schedule then alleges that Ma asked her why not go to her &#8220;dad&#8217;s&#8221; and then assaulted her by pushing and prodding her in the shoulder. In her FLA statement the mother simply states that her sister in law (unspecified) was &#8220;pushing her&#8221;. In her Contact of the 27.09.08 the mother tells the supervisor that her sister in law took her phone from her and hit her with it. The mother in oral evidence denied telling the supervisor this. In her police statement at H54 the mother states that Ma punched her on the right shoulder as soon as the police left. In oral evidence, the mother stated that she makes no distinction between a push and a punch, which is nonsensical. To Mathew Pilkington the mother stated that after the policed left the situation had calmed (para 34 F7). No mention is made of an assault by Ma. In the Scott Schedule the mother was threatened by F to kick her out, but to Mathew Pilkington, the mother stated that F had had a calming influence, trying to diffuse the argument (para 31 F7). Mother told Mr Pilkington that it was her mother in law and Ja who were complaining and suggesting that she leave. The Scott Schedule alleges that a sister in law started shoving and pushing her and asked he why not go to her aunt&#8217;s home. She was then pushed and shoved by various members of the family, whereupon she was punched by F and one of his sisters. M was then pushed out of the house and restrained by Ma and Ja from getting back into the house, her hair was pulled and this was witnessed by the children. This account is very different to that given by the mother in her police statement at H54 where having taken Qad from her, F then proceeds to punch her on the back, shoulder and hand near the wrist. In her police statement, once outside the property, Ja grabbed the mother and pushed her into the car.  In this account, the mother is assaulted downstairs by F alone, not as stated in the Scott Schedule. In her FLA statement, at paragraph 9, the mother is assaulted by F and a sister in law (in oral evidence she stated this was Ja. The mother&#8217;s FLA statement contained a number of amendments in relation to the role&#8217;s of the sister-in-laws, notably at paragraph 10, when one sister in law becomes two. In oral evidence the mother said she was punched by Ja outside of the house but neither her Scott Schedule not her FLA or police statements make that assertion. The mother&#8217;s account to Dr Whittle, at internal page 6 F45 gives a completely different account as to any force used upon her. Here, her sister in law pulled her by the hand out of the house. Her other sister in law pulled her into the car. It is strongly suggested that in the light of the mother&#8217;s injuries observed by the police, consistent with smashing the window of the front door, and her inconsistent and contradictory accounts of the use of force against her, her evidence is unreliable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is well-established that a judge may revise his draft judgment at any time up to hand-down. Within reason he can change it any way he wants. But I would have thought that a change as important as this needed to be accompanied by a clear explanation. The judgment has moved from a tacit acquittal of F of mistreating the children to an explicit finding that F has mistreated them by striking them, not only on their backs and legs but on their faces. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the parties attended before the District Judge on 22 January 2010 this matter was raised and the District Judge apparently stated that this addition was not a serious criticism as he was satisfied that any such treatment of the children amounted to reasonable chastisement. But no alteration to the judgment was made. The District Judge certainly gave the benefit of such an exoneration to M in para 221, where he said &#8220;Whilst I do not find the chastisement by the M of the children has been anything other than reasonable chastisement&#8230;.&#8221;. If he felt the same about F why was an equivalent exoneration not specified for him?</p>

In its present expression it convicts F of serious mistreatment of his children. The means by which such a finding were obtained are insupportable.</p>

Mr Metaxa submits that these erroneous aspects can safely be severed from the rest of the findings and that the findings as to (a) M&#8217;s very late entrants and (b) F&#8217;s 80 allegations are basically sound and can be left intact. He even submitted that the subject matter of these findings was the really important stuff, and that the seven allegations of assault were basically peripheral and unimportant. I do not see it that way at all. To accuse someone of Domestic Violence is an allegation of the utmost seriousness. M saw it that way too. They dominate her Scott Schedule. The late entrants seem to be little more than an afterthought. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of my conclusion as to the non-severability of the rest of the allegations I do not need to undertake a further evidential analysis of them.  There are two points that I need to make, however. The order setting up the fact-finding inquiry required the parties to set out their cases in Scott Schedules. M duly did so, and, as I have said, her case against F was dominated by her allegations of domestic violence. A mere 13 days before the hearing a throng of further allegations was made via the medium of Ms Khan&#8217;s report. No application was made to amend the Scott Schedule. In fact, no attempt was made to reduce the allegations to a list until Mr Metaxa did so in his final written submissions. These were exchanged and there were no oral submissions.  So neither F nor the court ever had a clear list of the further charges presented during the hearing. How this was managed forensically is beyond me. I am clear that if Scott Schedules have been ordered and that if a party wishes to allege further acts then the Schedule should be formally amended. A fair trial surely requires no less.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second point relates to the 80 allegations made by, or on behalf of, F against M. Many of these were wholly trivial, unkind and unnecessary and were designed to destabilise her. They were all found to be false, by which the District Judge surely meant that they had not been proved to the requisite standard.  For none of these was P &gt; 0.5. It might be said that there is no difference between setting them aside and leaving the findings intact as in each case the charges simply remain unproven. But given the binary system of fact-finding explained by Lord Hoffmann the effect of the judgment is to return for each of these allegations a value of zero, and a finding that they did not happen. That would amount to res judicata for the future. Given the errors in the judgment that would not be appropriate.</p>

That hearing will be vacated. I propose to direct that the equal shared care order of 23 February 2010 should run for a further 12 months with a review before a High Court Judge at the end of that period with a time estimate of 2 hours. With a fair wind it should be possible to discharge the Guardian at that time. By running the present order for a further 12 months it should be possible to test the good faith of F both vis-&#224;-vis M and his co-operation with professionals.  </p>
