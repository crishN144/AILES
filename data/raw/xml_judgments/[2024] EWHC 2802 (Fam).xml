This is not a harm-neutral exercise. J and B have stressed that for L&#8217;s sake, to a large extent they are currently coping on a surface level, which belies the deep distress and turbulence they are experiencing and if I have understood them correctly, they feel their coping exterior has been misinterpreted and served against them. They struggled with my early recommendation in support of interim arrangements, with Dr Pettle&#8217;s assessment findings and as outlined earlier in this report, they continue to struggle with the prospect of arrangements not taking place in line with their proposals. I consider that there is a real risk that their ability to parent L to the best of their ability may be compromised if they are required to make him available for the extensive periods of time proposed by F, which would be to L&#8217;s detriment. I consider (with mind to Dr Pettle&#8217;s conclusions) that that risk is likely to reduce if the burden on them of promoting direct arrangements is reduced through a lower frequency of spending time visits.  </span></p>

[Note here that at the time the report was written the proposal from J and B was for less contact. They increased what they proposed on receipt of the report, to align with the report.]  I recognise that all three parties will find my position emotionally difficult and upsetting. In holding my position, I necessarily seek to prioritise L&#8217;s immediate-to-longer term welfare needs. These include him having the opportunity to develop a relationship with F during his minority, as distinct from such opportunity being pushed into the distant future; but also mitigating the risk that, requiring J and B to promote arrangements will compromise their ability to parent L  to the best of their ability.</span></p>

Mr Powell&#8217;s argument fails because I need to balance L&#8217;s memory with J and B&#8217;s resilience.

I do this because I prefer the rock of caution to the sand of risk on this narrow point, as well as because 48 weeks as 6 sessions will in fact be is probably going to be about 11 calendar months &#8211; pretty close to midrange.  The second is to consider whether contact should increase to 6 or 8 hours when L is 3 &#189;.

I note that the amount of contact is not large here, although it will be increasing.  I note that specific issue orders are offered to keep F informed as to what is happening to L.  I note that J&#8217;s fears are that (1) F will take L away from her, and (2) that there will be constant negotiations or arguments with F.  I see that Ms Baker has considered that I should not grant F parental responsibility for that reason. I conclude on the facts of this case, in particular where J needs to feel secure, and notice is being offered of significant developments in L&#8217;s life, it would not be in L&#8217;s interest to grant F parental responsibility.  That runs the risk of de-stabilising J. I do make clear that I want the notice clauses to be made as orders rather than undertakings.</span></p>
