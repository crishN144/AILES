		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">By order made by me at the Pre-Trial Review, the parties&#8217; s25 statements were limited to 20 pages of narrative.  Para 5.2 of PD27A mandates that narrative statements, among other documents, shall be typed in &#8220;a font no smaller than 12 point and with 1 &#189; or double spacing&#8221;. H complied. W&#8217;s statement purported to comply in that it consisted of 20 pages, but because it used smaller font and spacing it was, in fact, about 27 pages compressed within the 20 page limit provided for by me. The consequence is that her statement was about 33% longer than H&#8217;s.  This is completely unacceptable, and W&#8217;s legal team should not have permitted it to happen. Court Orders, Practice Directions and Statements of Efficient Conduct are there to be complied with, not ignored. The purpose of the restriction on statement length is partly to focus the parties&#8217; minds on relevant evidence, and partly to ensure a level playing field. Why is it fair for one party to follow the rules, but the other party to ignore them?  Why is it fair for the complying party to be left with the feeling that the non-complying party has been able to adduce more evidence to his/her apparent advantage? </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">By para 11 of the High Court Statement of Efficient Conduct of Financial Remedy Proceedings, s25 statements must only contain evidence, and &#8220;on no account should contain argument or other rhetoric&#8221;. In this case, W&#8217;s over long statement crossed the line and descended into a number of personal, and prejudicial matters, directed at H which, in my view, were irrelevant to the matters at hand. Parties, and their legal advisers, may be under the impression that to describe the other party in pejorative terms, and seek to paint an unfavourable picture, will assist their case. It is high time that parties and their lawyers disabuse themselves of this erroneous notion. Judges will deal with relevant evidence, and will not base decisions on alleged moral turpitude or what Coleridge J once famously described disapprovingly (albeit in a slightly different context) as a &#8220;rummage through the attic&#8221; of the marriage in <span style="font-weight:bold">G v G [2002] EWHC (Fam) 1339.</span></p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Approximately 1 week before the trial, I was notified of a bundle issue. W, in putting together the first draft of the bundle index, included a 102 page section of narrative comments by W and fresh property particulars, directed towards the issue of her housing needs. No notice had been given to H, who objected. I was asked to rule on paper. I largely acceded to H&#8217;s objections, concluding that this was an attempt to introduce fresh evidence, although I allowed the inclusion of W&#8217;s comments on properties already produced in evidence.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The working day before the hearing, H served on W a financial analysis of matrimonial expenditure through the parties&#8217; joint account in 2018 and 2019. The itemised schedule consisted of thousands of entries. W&#8217;s legal team unsurprisingly objected to late receipt of this analysis. Commendably, in short order, they responded with a schedule of their own in respect of sole accounts so as to give a more complete picture. I deprecate the practice, which appears to be prevalent, of lawyers producing at the eleventh hour spreadsheet analysis of expenditure during the marriage (and/or since separation) based on primary documents such as bank and credit card statements which have been in their possession for many months. If an exercise such as this is to be relied upon, it must be provided well in advance of the final hearing (I suggest before the PTR or final directions hearing) so that the issues, and evidence, can be properly identified and case managed. </p>

Pursuant to the agreement, upon marriage H transferred into joint names his pre-owned property at &#8216;X&#8217; Street, SW5, and transferred into a joint account &#163;1.3m of his own resources. The Pre-Marital Agreement made sliding scale provision for W in the event of divorce up to 1 September 2014, but was silent as to provision thereafter. It provided for a review &#8220;if requested by either party on ten years elapsing from the date of the marriage&#8221;. In the event, no such review was sought. There was some debate about whether the Pre-Marital Agreement had thereby lapsed or not, but it seems to me that on any view it has been overtaken by subsequent events and I do not need to grapple with that legal nicety. I will, however, need to consider the circumstances in which it was reached as (i) W says she signed it as a result of undue pressure, which H disputes and (ii) the contents of the Pre-Marital Agreement may inform later issues which I must examine. Of note, H&#8217;s wealth at that time (all non-marital in nature) was put at &#163;4,317,754 which, with RPI, is over &#163;6m in today&#8217;s terms.</p>

They have had the benefit of access to a fine property in the U area owned by H&#8217;s father, as well as their own properties in London, Y town and Z town. But their expenditure was not of the eye-watering variety often seen at High Court level, and they did not enjoy expensive trappings such as high-end cars or valuable chattels. Their homes in London and Y town are comfortable, and in sought after areas, but not vastly expensive. The competing expenditure schedules demonstrated, broadly, that in 2019 the total family budget on everything (in England, Switzerland and elsewhere, and including all children&#8217;s costs) exceeded &#163;600,000 which, in my judgment, gives a helpful guide to the standard of living. </p>

Difficult questions can arise as to whether and to what extent property which starts out as non-marital acquires a marital character requiring it to be divided under the sharing principle. It will all depend on the circumstances, and the court will look at when the property was acquired, how it has been used, whether it has been mingled with the family finances and what the parties intended.</p>

On the contrary, I thought he was candid and frank, for example in acknowledging the pressure which W was under in respect of the Post-Marital Agreement.

Both parties had the benefit of English and Swiss legal advice; in W&#8217;s case her English lawyers were Macfarlanes. It is dated 12 August 2004, about 3 weeks before the marriage, and signed by the parties. The marriage had been delayed to enable a 3 week cooling off period after signing. Equivalent Swiss documents were entered into. It is clear that the impetus for the agreement, as with so many pre-marital agreements, came from extended family, in this case H&#8217;s father, who required its execution and made it plain that he would &#8220;take measures&#8221; if it was not signed.  Both parties&#8217; evidence was that had they not signed, the marriage would not have taken place.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am confident that both H and W were under pressure from H&#8217;s father. That is hardly surprising given that H&#8217;s father was a man of immense wealth who saw it as his duty to ensure that the family wealth passed through the generations in a dynastic manner. Moreover, coming from a Swiss and B background, where such agreements were commonplace, it is likely that H&#8217;s father was more comfortable with the notion of a pre-marital agreement than W, from an English background where, certainly at the time, such agreements were rare indeed. I am equally confident that W felt under stress and was uncomfortable with the process. The intended agreement was a source of tension for both W and H. However, in my judgment, none of the vitiating factors set out in <span style="font-weight:bold">Radmacher</span> apply and I see no reason to discard, or ignore ab initio, the Pre-Marital Agreement:</p>

In almost every Pre or Post Marital Agreement one or other, or both, parties are under a degree of pressure, and emotions may run high. The collision of the excitement engendered by prospective marriage, and the hard realities of negotiating for the breakdown of such a marriage, can be acutely difficult for parties. Tension and disagreement may ensue. If, as here, one side of the family is applying pressure, the difficulties are accentuated. But in the end, each party has to make a choice and unless undue pressure can be demonstrated, the court will ordinarily uphold the agreement. In my judgment, W cannot so demonstrate here. </p>

Nevertheless, of relevance is the exposition within the agreement of why the parties were entering into a Pre-Marital Agreement. It expressly recorded at Clause I that all dynastic property already acquired by H or acquired during the marriage should be free of claims by W save as necessary to implement the agreement, and that each should retain their own separate property. The section &#8220;Genesis of the Agreement&#8221; at Clause K(i) specifically refers to the past receipt by H of family monies, and the anticipated future receipt of dynastic assets which are intended to be excluded. Self-evidently, the agreement had one eye on the future wealth which was expected to cascade down to H. </p>

I regard these communications from W as being secondary, rather than primary material. They are indicative of her state of mind but do not really add to that which is apparent from what I have read, and W&#8217;s own oral evidence, that (a) she wanted to leave Switzerland with the children, (b) she felt under real pressure to sign the agreement to achieve her aim, (c) she was anxious, and (d) relations between her and H were low. </p>

H raised the need for a Post-Marital Agreement only after the plans had been laid, and school places secured; W did not want to let the children down. For H, there were concerns about W and the children leaving their home in Switzerland, the impact on their relationship as a couple and the possible impact on the family as a whole.

The parties were in communication, through their lawyers, about the Post-Marital Agreement for some two months.

The principle of autonomy, articulated by Mostyn J in <span style="font-weight:bold">BN v MA [2014] EWHC 2450 </span>when emphasising the importance of a party signing (and, I suggest, by corollary, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not </span>signing) is relevant. I would not want, however, to lay down an immutable law. Each case is fact specific. It may be, for example, that parties agree in correspondence that agreement has been reached, and signatures are not required. It may be that parties do not sign, but clearly consider themselves bound and act accordingly. But in this case, it seems to me to be unreasonable for an agreement to be formally binding upon W in the absence of her signature when that very same agreement expressly, and in terms, only takes effect upon both parties signing. The purpose of such agreements is to achieve as much certainty as possible, and it strikes me as unfair for W to be strictly held to a document which was carefully drawn up to require, as an express clause of the agreement, both parties&#8217; signatures.</p>

Even though W did not sign it, in my judgment I am entitled to take it into account and attach such weight to it as I think fit. It is one of the factors, to be considered in the mix. The terms agreed in 2017 are relevant, albeit not determinative. </p>

His father has formed a relationship with a woman who is 38 years younger, to whom he has given about &#163;8m. H says that he and his sisters are now barely on speaking terms with his father, and told me about a very difficult conversation between them all in January this year when they told their father they were contemplating taking proceedings against their father and his partner. They had also commissioned a Private Investigator report which angered their father. H and his siblings believe that their father is incapacitous when with his partner, manipulated and controlled by her. They believe that he might jeopardise the family wealth and their future inheritances. Since that conversation, they have now instituted legal proceedings in France and Switzerland; the claim against their father is akin to a Court of Protection action. Having heard the evidence, I accept that there is a major family breakdown underway between H, his sisters and his father. H&#8217;s father has ceased any support for H&#8217;s sisters as well as for H. H told me, and I accept, that his father sees them as the enemy. </p>

The ongoing Swiss litigation suggests to me that any such payments are some way off, and, if made, could well be at a lower level than before. I doubt whether H&#8217;s father will, as W suggests, immediately replace in the dynastic trust the sums previously removed, or anything like it. I am not satisfied that I can or should take this prospective resource (i.e ongoing support provided by H&#8217;s father) into account in any meaningful way, save that I doubt he would want to see his son destitute; in other words, I view the father, in the background, as a safety net in the event of calamity rather than in the foreground as a foreseeable ongoing resource.  I remind myself that this is entirely in the gift of H&#8217;s father. It is not for me to try and encourage him to restore the inter vivos payments; to do so would be to trespass on his autonomy. I make it clear, however, that even had I concluded that monies of up to c&#163;600,000pa will shortly be made over to H once again, my conclusions on the appropriate order would be the same.</p>

H in his Form E said that &#8220;I anticipate I will benefit at some point in the future (whether outright or as a beneficiary of trusts, or otherwise) from his estate or inter vivos gifts. I do not know the exact amount by which I may benefit although I anticipate it will be substantial wealth in excess of &#8364;100m. There is an expectation I will preserve this wealth for future generations just as my father and ancestors have done. If my father dies in Switzerland then forced heirship provisions will apply. However my father is not Swiss and he may well move to another country before his death&#8221;.  Unlike in <span style="font-weight:bold">Alireza</span> there is some evidence here that H&#8217;s father may seek to disestablish himself from forced heirship. The current family dispute, and his severance of funds for any of his children, no doubt causes them disquiet. The general proposition of law, per <span style="font-weight:bold">Michael,</span> is that the fact and timing of inheritance are ordinarily so uncertain that it cannot be viewed as a resource. The dicta in <span style="font-weight:bold">Alireza</span> move the dial a little in the direction of greater certainty as to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">fact</span> although not as to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">timing</span>, in cases of forced heirship. It seems to me, on the facts of this case, that although I cannot ignore the possibility that a family meltdown of such magnitude will take place that H&#8217;s father will take active steps to avoid forced heirship and disentitle his children, it is, on balance, more likely that at some point H will indeed receive a significant inheritance.

She does not want to start all over again, and move to SW6 where she would have to re-settle herself and the family. She told me that she prefers the location of SW3, as do the children, although I am confident that the children would adapt well to any reasonable area in a nice house with the love and support of their mother.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On balance, having listened very carefully to W, and having considered the various property particulars, I have reached the conclusion that G area/F area are appropriate areas. In my judgment, greater space would be of benefit to the children, and these are comfortable areas near to the schools. I conclude that an appropriate housing sum for W is &#163;3.5m. To that should be added stamp duty which I calculate at &#163;333,750. W needs funds to complete the purchase, move and renovate a new property. I will therefore round up this sum to <span style="font-weight:bold">&#163;4m. </span>That said, W will be able to spend more on a property if she so chooses, whether in SW3 or elsewhere, but would have to tailor her income fund accordingly.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject W&#8217;s case that she reasonably requires a second home in Switzerland costing &#163;1.8m-&#163;2m. True, she and the children are used to spending time in London and Switzerland, although it was only between 2017 and 2019 that they spent substantial time during the marriage in both countries. But the children will be able to see H in Switzerland at his home (which is also their home), and in any event their needs do not as a matter of law extend for more than perhaps another 10 years. I was told that when the children go to stay with H, W also travels to Switzerland in case of an emergency; I sincerely hope and expect that she will not need to make these trips for much longer, and do not regard this aspect of the case as supporting W&#8217;s request for a second home. W will have ample funds to travel there, stay in hotels and/or rent if she chooses. Given that the children are based in London, one is only talking about holiday time (18 weeks a year), of which about half is likely to spent by the children with H; the time spent by W, and particularly the children, in a second home would be limited. Provision for a second home in Switzerland was not included in the Post-Marital Agreement and, in my judgment, would be an unreasonable need. W would, as it happens, have enough funds to purchase a second property if she wishes, particularly if she scales back her London aspirations, but that must be a matter of choice for her rather than an expense attributable solely to H. Further, on my findings, I am unconvinced that H has liquidity to pay for a second home as sought by W and, moreover, were he to do so his ability to meet his own needs would be severely affected.</p>

As a comparison H&#8217;s budget (similarly excluding costs directly referable to the children) is &#163;233,215pa, albeit including &#163;43,225pa of mortgage costs on the Y town property; excluding mortgage costs brings his budget down to &#163;189,990pa, although H told me he will have to reconsider certain items depending on affordability, such as retaining a boat and membership fees for a club in the U area.  </p>

	    <intro>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the Post-Marital Agreement, and indeed referenced in her earlier open proposals, the budget deemed appropriate for W was &#163;110,000pa (uprated for inflation). In her most recent proposal, W seeks a Duxbury of &#163;3.4m which equates to about &#163;155,000pa. It does seem to me that &#163;110,000pa (uprated with inflation), would be inadequate in the light of the standard of living, the historic expenditure by the parties, and H&#8217;s own budget. It seems to me that an appropriate sum is &#163;150,000 per year which, in accordance with the Duxbury tables, is capitalised at <span style="font-weight:bold">&#163;3,319,000 </span>(UK state pension, for which W has minimal provision, is ignored for the purpose of the calculation). True, at times W&#8217;s budget may be higher, but at other times it may be lower and in the long term she will have a valuable property which she can trade down to release money if she so chooses. She will not, however, have to do so. In reaching this conclusion, I have also taken into account that such a sum would be referable to W&#8217;s personal costs alone, and H will, in addition, be paying a very high level of agreed expenditure for the children. </p>

It approximates to that which was contained within the Post-Marital Agreement, but goes beyond it so as to meet what I consider to be W&#8217;s needs judged against all the relevant factors.
