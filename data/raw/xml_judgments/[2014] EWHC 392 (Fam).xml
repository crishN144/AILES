	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This ought to have been a simple case to resolve. It was an 18 year marriage. The husband is Dutch and is now aged 50 and the wife is English and is aged 48. They have four children aged 19, 17, 15 and 13. The present divisible non-pension assets are, as I will explain below, about &#163;3.8m of which the net value of the matrimonial home is &#163;2.2m. The husband is a successful solicitor in a magic circle firm earning net &#163;600,000 annually. I consider that he will have to retire in 5 years&#8217; time. The net value I will attribute to his pension arrangements is &#163;1.14m.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reason why the case was not settled at the FDR, or tried swiftly and economically by a District Judge, but rather fought out over 3 days before me, is because it has been bedevilled by two legal complications. First, the husband lays considerable emphasis on a Dutch pre-marital agreement signed the day before the marriage (which took place in Amsterdam). Second, the wife claims that her periodical payments award should be significantly enhanced by reference to the principle of compensation as explained by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane v McFarlane</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2006/24" uk:canonical="[2006] UKHL 24" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] UKHL 24</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 2 AC 618" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 2 AC 618</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These two factors have driven up the costs. The husband has incurred costs of &#163;163,880 and the wife of &#163;203,430, a total of &#163;367,310, or just under 10% of the divisible non-pension assets.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife proposes that she should be awarded the matrimonial home outright, a lump sum of &#163;110,000 to pay her debts, a joint lives periodical payments order of &#163;200,000, together with child support on the basis that the husband pays school fees and university costs. As a quid pro quo for the undeniable fact that the husband is entitled to argue that some of the assets are non-matrimonial property she says that she will not seek a share of the husband&#8217;s pensions, and would agree that the final order should contain a recital recording an agreement that those pensions should be ring-fenced and ignored if (or more likely when) periodical payments came to be varied. </p>

He proposes a lump sum of &#163;250,000 to clear the wife&#8217;s debts and to give her a significant buffer. He proposes periodical payments for the wife of &#163;150,000 annually for five years when the award would be extinguished. The term of maintenance would be non-extendable. In addition he offers child support, school fees and university costs.</p>

Rather, the question is whether in the individual case there is a material lack of disclosure, information or advice. Each party must have all the information that is material to his or her decision that the agreement should govern the financial consequences of the marriage coming to an end. An absolute rule would only be necessary if the agreement were to be contractually binding, but this is not the case as there is a safety-net of (un)fairness (para 69).</p>

Further, unconscionable conduct such as undue pressure (falling short of duress) will likely eliminate the weight to be attached to the agreement (ibid). Other unworthy conduct, such as exploitation of a dominant position to secure an unfair advantage, will reduce or eliminate the weight to be attached to the agreement (ibid). The court may take into account a party's emotional state, and what pressures he or she was under to agree, as well as their age and maturity, and whether either or both had been married or been in long-term relationships before (para 72). The court may take into account foreign elements to determine whether or not the parties intended their agreement to be effective (para 74).</p>

This is likely to be so where the agreement seeks to protect pre-marital property (para 79). By contrast it is less likely to be so where the agreement leaves in the hands of one spouse rather than the other the most part of a fortune which each spouse has played an equal role in their different ways in creating (para 80). If the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned (para 81).</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:0.32in">Is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement which leaves one spouse in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more (para 81). However, need may be interpreted as being that minimum amount required to keep a spouse from destitution. For example, if the claimant spouse had been incapacitated in the course of the marriage, so that he or she was incapable of earning a living, this might well justify, in the interests of fairness, not holding him or her to the full rigours of the ante-nuptial agreement (para 119).</p>

Otherwise every agreement made at a time when England and Wales was not on the horizon would be discarded.

It must surely mean that the parties intended the agreement to have effect wherever they might be divorced <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and most particularly</span> were they to be divorced in a jurisdiction that operated a system of discretionary equitable distribution.

Thus it might (as is the case with the agreement here) address how existing capital might be shared, but leave the question of maintenance entirely at large; alternatively it might address only some, but not all of the parties&#8217; capital assets and how those should be shared.  In <span style="font-style:italic">L v C</span> [2007] 3 HKLRD 819 the Hong Kong Court of Appeal was concerned with two agreements made after separation which dealt with some of the parties&#8217; assets.

This is aimed at redressing any significant prospective economic disparity between the parties arising from the way they conducted their marriage. For instance, the parties may have arranged their affairs in a way which has greatly advantaged the husband in terms of his earning capacity but left the wife severely handicapped so far as her own earning capacity is concerned. Then the wife suffers a double loss: a diminution in her earning capacity and the loss of a share in her husband's enhanced income. This is often the case. Although less marked than in the past, women may still suffer a disproportionate financial loss on the breakdown of a marriage because of their traditional role as home-maker and child-carer.</p>

This was not enough to provide for needs or compensate for disadvantage. The main family asset is the husband's very substantial earning power, generated over a lengthy marriage in which the couple deliberately chose that the wife should devote herself to home and family and the husband to work and career. The wife is undoubtedly entitled to generous income provision for herself and for the sake of their children, including sums which will enable her to provide for her own old age and insure the husband's life. She is also entitled to a share in the very large surplus, on the principles both of sharing the fruits of the matrimonial partnership and of compensation for the comparable position which she might have been in had she not compromised her own career for the sake of them all. The fact that she might have wanted to do this is neither here nor there. Most breadwinners want to go on breadwinning. The fact that they enjoy their work does not disentitle them to a proper share in the fruits of their labours.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">When they began to cohabit in 1982, the Appellant [Mrs McFarlane] was about to commence work as a solicitor's articled clerk working at Clifford Turner, a well-known City firm of solicitors. The Respondent [Mr McFarlane] was a trainee chartered accountant working for Touche Ross. Prior to their marriage, the parties purchased the first of four homes that they bought together during the course of their relationship and marriage. By about the time that they married in 1984, they had both qualified in their respective professions. In 1985, the Appellant moved to 3i, a large venture capital company, which provided the parties with the benefit of a reduced rate mortgage. After the birth of J she returned to work for 3i. In 1990, the Respondent became a partner in Touche Ross. Until this time, the Appellant earned as much as and, for a period, more than the Respondent. In 1991, just before S's birth, the parties agreed that the Appellant should give up work. They agreed to concentrate on the husband's career in order to provide the funding of the family's lifestyle. The Appellant has not since returned to work as a solicitor, but has on two occasions begun to re-train. &#8230; The District Judge imposed a joint lives order of &#163;250,000 per annum. This was reduced to &#163;180,000 per annum by Bennett J. on appeal. The Court of Appeal restored the quantum of &#163;250,000 but imposed a term of five years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, I put aside the American usage of compensation as a synonym for remuneration or earnings. Over here compensation almost invariably denotes a payment made by a wrongdoer to a victim to make amends for harm caused by the wrongdoer to the victim.  The language of the House of Lords appears to reflect this concept in that they speak of &#8220;handicap&#8221; or &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; of &#8220;suffering a loss&#8221; or &#8220;economic disadvantage&#8221;. But in any usual situation where compensation is claimed the victim is not an active enthusiastic voluntary participant in the events that give rise to the claim. True, in a negligence claim contributory negligence can reduce the damages, but even there it can hardly be said that the victim was an active volunteer. Lady Hale recognises this strange aspect of this type of compensation claim in para 138 where she said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;all couples throughout their lives together have to make choices about who will do what &#8230; sometimes freely made in the interests of them both. The needs generated by such choices are a perfectly sound rationale for adjusting the parties' respective resources in compensation&#8221;</span> and in para 154 where she said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the fact that she might have wanted to do this is neither here nor there&#8221;</span>. I entirely accept that such freely made choices may supply a &#8220;sound rationale&#8221; for a needs-based periodical payments award but I do not understand how it supplies a rationale for a periodical payments award that supplies a &#8220;premium&#8221; above need (see para 140) or for an &#8220;element of her claim not directly affected by the use she makes of her resources&#8221; (see para 99).  I would have thought the free choice made by the claimant to give up work was the dominant consideration. While it was true that her decision was agreed with Mr McFarlane, the reason Mrs McFarlane gave up work was because she decided to give up work. No-one forced her to give up work. She was not browbeaten by Mr McFarlane to give up work. Her motives for giving up work seem to me to be irrelevant. Perhaps she was driven by an intense maternal instinct. Perhaps she was bored with her high-flying job and saw a life being supported by Mr McFarlane bringing up her children as more comfortable. Perhaps she wanted to do something else. At the end of the day, however, what cannot be disputed is that the reason Mrs McFarlane gave up work was because she, an intelligent liberated autonomous adult woman, decided to give up work. I cannot see how that can be characterised as a loss &#8220;suffered&#8221; by her entitling her to an award in excess of her reasonable needs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, determining a compensation claim of this nature requires the court to make extraordinary counter-factual findings.

Or if they had decided to have children but decided to employ nannies? Whichever basis is adopted it involves making an award in hard money based on a guess founded on a vision that events that did happen, did not happen, and events that did not happen, did. This is extremely difficult and dangerous territory which is not based on any kind of hard evidence but usually on hunch, guesswork and speculation. It has been said that resolution of personal injury cases require the faculties of a prophet, but at least the prophetic exercise there looks, unavoidably, into the future rather than in this type of case where the exercise requires a complete re-writing of history.</p>

Whatever the income or earning capacity that is given up, the choice and the support given to the family, and the husband's career, success and earning capacity would effectively be the same.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">On the basis (as the judge recognised elsewhere) that there are indeed implicit in the provisions of s. 25 the strands or rationales adumbrated by the House of Lords, there is little to disagree with in the passages quoted in the context of that case. I share and endorse the concerns expressed. The judge was dealing with a case where it was accepted there were before the court just sufficient capital assets to achieve a clean break in a situation where the wife, because her own earning capacity remained essentially intact, would not be left in a position of continuing reliance for her needs upon the husband's future earning capacity. Thus, on the facts, the case for compensation, whether viewed simply as a matter of fairness, or as itself adding some "premium" element, was weak if not non-existent. Further, I would endorse the warning sounded by the judge against the introduction of an approach which seeks to separate out and quantify the element of compensation, rather than treating it as one of the strands in the overall requirement of fairness in the assessment of the parties' joint contribution to the marriage, where the wife, as a result of joint marital decision has sacrificed her own earning capacity in the interests of the bringing up the family. Attempts under the rubric of Compensation to isolate and quantify the level of income or earning capacity sacrificed by a wife years after the event for the purpose of calculating a premium element on the award, constitutes a search for precision which is to be discouraged both on the grounds of policy and practicality, and which goes beyond what is required or generally appropriate in the exercise required of the court under s.25.</p>

The ultimate award to Mrs McFarlane was no more than a conventional needs based exercise.  I will return to this decision later.</p>

The wife had performed excellently at University and obtained articles at a magic circle firm. Later she moved to a leading US-based international firm. The husband had qualified as a lawyer and had obtained a position at a leading US firm. They met and began a relationship in 1992 when they were both working in Brussels. In 1993 they began to cohabit. The wife became pregnant in early 1994, by which time they were already engaged to be married. The marriage was fixed to take place in Amsterdam in the English Church there on Saturday, 21 May 1994, to be preceded by a civil ceremony the previous day, Friday, 20 May 1994 in the Amsterdam town hall. About 100 guests were invited to the religious service and there was to be a big reception afterwards in the husband's parents&#8217; home in Aerdenhout, near Haarlem.</p>

In paragraph 69 it was stated that there is no rule at all that full disclosure, or full legal advice, is a necessary pre-condition for the satisfaction of this criterion. On the contrary, the question is in the individual case whether there has been a material lack of disclosure, or a material lack of information, or a material lack of legal advice. I venture the opinion that usually -- and that is in the usual run of cases and not a case when one is dealing with such a highly intelligent sophisticate as Mr. Granatino -- a full appreciation of the implications will normally carry with it a requirement of having at least enough legal advice to appreciate what one is giving up&#8230;</p>

In my judgment this is non-matrimonial property par excellence, which is to be completely excluded under the agreement, and which is more aptly to be compared to a future inheritance. Both parties have inheritance prospects but I do not take them into account in my decision.</p>

None of these were kept separately and they were all merged into the joint assets or spent. Of the bigger gifts made in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 I do not categorise the latter two as separate property under the agreement as they were used either to buy or to pay for building works on the family home, which was placed in joint names. The former two, plus their growth, I accept should be categorised as separate property as they have been kept separate by the husband in accounts in his name. I accept his calculation that with growth they should be taken at &#8364;443,205.</p>

As will be seen, he has studiously avoided for many years bringing taxable assets onshore, and there is no likelihood he will now do so. He says he intends to buy a house in the UK, but W considers this entirely unlikely. His centre of gravity has always been the Netherlands, and that is only increasing now as he spends more and more time there. Given his income he is much more likely to continue to rent in England and buy in the Netherlands.&#8221;</p>

In this case, the evidence from KPMG is clear. These taxes cannot be avoided if the funds are brought here, or if they are used indirectly to purchase property under some back-to-back agreement.  At present the husband lives a bipolar life between London and Amsterdam. In my judgment it would not be unreasonable for him to buy a home here in which to live with his children when with him. Therefore, it is reasonable in this case to include the liability to tax as a deduction. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The annuity is in familiar form. It is not a true pension, but is a contractual annuity arrangement for the partners. In order to qualify he has to remain a partner until 2016, at which point he qualifies for the minimum 85 units (explained below). He can increase his units over a further 5 years at the rate of 6 a year, so that by 2021 he is entitled to 115 units, which is the maximum. The total units are paid out over 5 or 8 years, at the election of the payee. Each unit varies in value according to the firm&#8217;s profits, but is around &#163;12,000. So 115 units would be around &#163;1.4m. Spread over 5 years that would be &#163;280,000 per annum (subject to tax).&#8221;</p>

I assess her annual earning capacity for the next 5 years as being modest - &#163;20,000 gross, or &#163;16,400 net. At the end of the 5 year period I do not bring into consideration the earning capacity of either party. If either of them can work and supplement his or her economy then all well and good, but I do not factor that aspect into my workings. </p>

I have assumed that the mortgage of &#163;600,000 could now be placed on an interest only basis at a rate of 4%, costing &#163;24,000 annually. I take the view that in 5 years&#8217; time it is reasonable for the wife to sell the property and to downsize thus releasing the husband&#8217;s 22.5% notional share in the property to contribute to her Duxbury fund. I take the view that in 5 years time it is reasonable for the wife to live for her autumn years in a property presently costing (inclusive of stamp duty) &#163;1.7m. I further take the view that it is reasonable for the wife at that point to reduce her budget from &#163;76,000 odd to &#163;65,000. After all, it is an almost universal prescription that people live on a lower disposable income when in retirement. </p>
