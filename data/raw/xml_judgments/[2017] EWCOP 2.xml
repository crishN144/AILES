	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> RY is 81 years of age.  He suffered a cardiac arrest in June 2016, most probably as a consequence of cardiac rhythm disturbance.  It seems likely that he experienced a prolonged delay before CPR commenced.  However CPR did eventually result in return of heart function.  Several ribs were fractured in consequence of the CPR.  When he arrived at the Moriston Hospital, Swansea, RY had a coronary angiogram which indicated no intervention was required by the cardiology team.  The CT scan which was undertaken to exclude any pathology that could have caused his collapse revealed an almost total loss of grey white differentiation in brain matter and features consistent with global hypoxic brain injury.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Though RY had been sedated since admission this was discontinued on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016 in order to make an assessment of his neurological status.  RY did not achieve consciousness.  A second CT scan was performed revealing global ischaemic damage throughout the brain parenchyma involving both the superficial cortical and the deep grey matter (supra tentorially).  Dr David Hope, a Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine, considered the prognosis was futile based on the clinical history and the CT findings.  He advised RY&#8217;s adult children AY and CP, that the patient&#8217;s best interests would be served by withdrawing active organ support; specifically the removing of the ventilator tube.  The consequence of this was explained to the family i.e. that RY might die within hours or within a few days.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CP was clear throughout these conversations in July 2016 that her father <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;would want everything done&#8217;</span> in order to preserve his life.  She maintained then, as she has done throughout, that he would have taken the view that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;any life is better than no life&#8217;</span>.  On the 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> November 2016 I gave a short extempore judgment reported at <span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/3256" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 3256 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 3256 (Fam)</ref></span>.  Whilst I acceded to the parties&#8217; consensus I was also concerned that the clinicians had very strong reservations.  I questioned the consensus, in order to test it with counsel and recorded in my judgment two important paragraphs from the case papers.  The first was the Health Board&#8217;s Position Statement:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;In terms of </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">best interests</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt"> and the issue of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt">tracheostomy</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">, the Applicant contends that this is on a very fine balance. While a tracheostomy would permit RY to leave the ITU for the ward and potentially thereafter a nursing home, the suctioning which will still be required via the tracheostomy will be highly invasive and uncomfortable for RY and will have to be performed regularly (day and night) depending upon his secretion load. The operation itself carries risks, including at least a 1-3% chance of mortality, bleeding, infection and scarring alongside anaesthetic risks. If the Court is willing to sanction the procedure with that in mind, the Applicant is willing to undertake it. The Court may be assisted by hearing brief evidence from Dr Gorst on that point.&#8221; </span></p>

However any chance of life does not mean any chance of life no matter what the pain, indignity and burden it entails and no matter what the chances of recovery are. Few people have had the first-hand experience of receiving or delivering the interventions that are necessary to support life during Intensive Care treatment for short periods never mind many months. It is difficult to imagine how anyone, without either previously receiving or delivering critical care interventions, can predict the distressing nature of such interventions and balance them against &#8216;any chance of life&#8217;.&#8221;</span></p>

I was concerned that the &#8216;neutral stance&#8217; at paragraph 69 above was not at all easy, at least on the papers filed, to reconcile with the medical evidence.  At the hearing on the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January Mr Chisholm&#8217;s request, on behalf of the Health Board, was to withdraw the application.  I indicated that I was not prepared to accede to that request because the available information was ambivalent and the Court itself was now seized of the responsibility.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the case returned for hearing the Health Board had once again changed its stance.   It is important that I state clearly that I make absolutely no criticism of this.  The full clinical picture has been difficult to distil and initially, as I have recorded above, the Health Board had considered the insertion of the tracheostomy to be indicated only on &#8216;a very fine balance&#8217;.   At this hearing the Health Board sought a declaration that withdrawal of the tracheostomy and the termination of deep suctioning was in RY&#8217;s best interest.   Though Mr Chisholm has characterised the case as a &#8216;difficult&#8217; one, he has not contended that the evidence is delicately balanced.  The real difficulty, as he properly identified, is that much of the key information has come before the Court late in the day and has caused various doctors to revise or moderate their opinions.  Again, I make no criticism of anybody involved.  It is the situation itself which has been dynamic.  The care with which each of the doctors has responded to the evolving picture has been impressive, most notably because they have all engaged in a constructive professional dialectic.</p>

Mr Badwan first settled on that view at a very early stage in this case.  He has not seen anything that causes him to review his decision on this point.  Dr Mughal readily agreed;</p>

This is consistent with the documented clinical history of out of hospital cardiac arrest, in an older person with a prolonged time without spontaneous circulation, as the brain is extremely vulnerable in those circumstances. Unfortunately irreversible brain damage can occur within a matter of minutes as the brain is entirely dependent on the circulation in order for oxygen and glucose to be provided and has no intrinsic energy stores. In the context of a hypoxic brain injury, if there is no recovery in six months, further improvement becomes extremely unlikely and PDOC is considered permanent. &#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Badwan was rather more optimistic.  It is his views that have changed most significantly.  Again, I regard this as a strength rather than a weakness.  By the conclusion of his evidence he had departed from the opinion in his report, dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016, in which he was prepared to contemplate the possibility of RY continuing a trajectory of recovery that might permit him to &#8216;sit outside and watch wildlife&#8217; and &#8216;to be able to watch television&#8217;.  These had been identified as features that RY would be likely to gain pleasure from.  Mr Badwan also accepted that the extent of the hypoxic damage to the brain, particularly obvious in the cortical region, makes the possibility of vision highly unlikely.  With characteristic optimism Mr Badwan emphasises on this last point that &#8216;one can never be sure!&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In so far as I can identify RY experiencing any pleasure in life at all, it is limited to possible awareness, from time to time of the presence of CP and AY at his bedside holding his hand.  In expressing it in this way I do not seek in anyway to minimise the enormity of the pleasure that this simple act is able to give.  My hesitation reflects only my anxiety that this, for the reasons that I will set out below, may be a projection on the part of CP and AY.  The only evidential basis I can root it in is the assumption that where the capacity for pain exists the logical corollary must be that the potential for pleasure coexists.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I entirely accept that there has been a trajectory of improvement in the realm of awareness, it is wrong to overemphasise the gradient of the trajectory or exaggerate its potential.  Ultimately, as the evidence evolved, I found there to be only shades of difference between the views of Dr. Lowman, Mr Badwan or Dr Elliott, who conducted the SMART assessment process.  Each displayed an entirely proper preparedness to yield to the views of the others.  There is here, the potential for a continued trajectory of improvement which must be recognised to have limited scope.  Of course any improvement in this context will have its own significance and always weigh heavily when evaluating RY&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Gorst is a Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at the Moriston Hospital in Swansea.  He has been directly involved with RY during his time in ITU. Following RY&#8217;s release to the general ward, Dr Gorst has continued to consult with the medical team.  I have been impressed with his commitment to his patient, his determination to assist this Court and his instinctive respect for the contribution of colleagues from other disciplines.  I have found his evidence to be reflective and measured.  He has emphasised that any evaluation of &#8216;best interests&#8217; for a patient in these circumstances, must involve considering the broad clinical picture and not become overly focused on the single issue of consciousness or awareness.   I agree with that approach.  Similarly, assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of deep suctioning, in RY&#8217;s particular circumstances, cannot be considered as an isolated issue but require to be assessed in the context of the patient&#8217;s overall medical situation and prognosis, the &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">holistic approach</span>&#8217; as Dr Gorst calls it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Gorst told me that prior to RY&#8217;s collapse, aged 81 years, he was &#8216;unremarkable medically&#8217;.  By this he explained that RY was neither particularly fit nor in strikingly poor condition for his age.  In his present condition Dr Gorst told me that RY has limited physiological reserve.  In ITU a patient has one to one care.  On the general ward this is simply not possible.  Sadly, but inevitably, RY has declined. His physical condition is now very poor.  Dr Gorst told me that in the latter stages of life muscle mass begins to decline.  Nobody, he said, truly knows why this is.  It is already very visible in RY including in his facial muscles which are described as &#8216;sunken&#8217;.  This deterioration bears its own significance.  As muscle declines and bone becomes less protected there is &#8216;increasing pain and discomfort for a bed bound patient&#8217; who needs to be frequently turned.  We simply do not know, on the available evidence, whether this will cause RY pain at present, whether he may feel it intermittently or, should consciousness further improve, whether he will experience pain from this source in the future.  In my judgement, the more &#8216;optimistic&#8217; evaluation of consciousness advanced by Mr Badwan requires an openness to each of these possibilities.  I am instinctively uncomfortable in making the assumption that RY&#8217;s capacity to experience pain is limited to the undoubted pain caused by deep suctioning or his response to Mr Badwan pinching him on the upper limb.  This is the pain that we <span style="font-weight:bold">can be sure</span> is experienced by RY.  </p>

Dr Gorst emphasises that both the pain of pressure sores and their potential for infection should not be underestimated.  Moreover, he considers that notwithstanding the best endeavours of all concerned it is likely that further pressure sores may develop.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Perhaps the most significant issue for RY is the accumulation of secretions which are a consequence of his incomplete cough function.  As the evidence unfolded, as I have set out above, it became clear that RY is experiencing pain on deep suctioning, inserted through the tracheostomy.   The real difficulty in evaluating consciousness and therefore pain in situations of this kind is, for me, illustrated by the fact that Mr Jones, an experienced ward manager, with much experience of patients with tracheostomies, had not himself appreciated that RY was experiencing pain in deep suctioning.  Mr Chisholm suggests that Mr Badwan&#8217;s earlier conclusion that RY was in a Vegetative State (and therefore unable to experience pain) had understandably caused Mr Jones to be less alert to the signs of it.  Mr Jones, very much to his credit, was prepared to accept this.  </p>

He reminded me however, that it was in the nature of the MCS condition, that awareness is intermittent and thus pain would not be experienced on every occasion where deep suctioning was deployed.  In addition, Mr Badwan conducted a physical examination in which he exerted pain on RY&#8217;s upper limb which provoked &#8216;a clear facial reaction of pain&#8217;, which he described as &#8216;an actual expression of painful experience&#8217;, &#8216;not a simple grimace&#8217;.  Whilst this provided helpful information I confess that the impact of it was also to remind me how extremely intrusive assessments of consciousness are and how cautious the Courts should be when sanctioning the repeat tests that are far too frequently requested.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Baker, a Consultant in Palliative Medicine, suggested that a synergistic combination of drugs could be prescribed in order to ameliorate the pain caused by the deep suctioning process.  He contemplated a range of applications of which intravenous appeared to be his preferred option.  It is not necessary for me to determine this, nor therefore further to burden this judgment with the alternatives.  However, what is significant is that the administration of opiate medication would serve to suppress consciousness (thus compromising capacity for pleasure by reducing pain) and further to depress respiratory capacity.  This caused Dr Baker, from the perspective of his own specialism, to be entirely unsure whether deep suctioning via the tracheostomy can now be said to be in RY&#8217;s best interest.  </p>

The National Clinical Guidelines: Prolong Disorders of Consciousness, 2013, emphasise the role of family and close friends in the assessment of consciousness.  They are, as this case illustrates, often present over prolong periods.  Additionally, their very familiarity with the patient may stimulate a response that a stranger can not.  More generally, family members and friends are the only route by which an MCS patient&#8217;s wishes and feelings may be communicated in the absence of an advance directive.</p>

I am left in no doubt at all that TH would wish to determine what remains of his life in his own way not least because that is the strategy he has always both expressed and adopted. I have no doubt that he would wish to leave the hospital and go to the home of his ex-wife and his mate's Spud and end his days quietly there and with dignity as he sees it. Privacy, personal autonomy and dignity have not only been features of TH's life, they have been the creed by which he has lived it. He may not have prepared a document that complies with the criteria of section 24, giving advance directions to refuse treatment but he has in so many oblique and tangential ways over so many years communicated his views so uncompromisingly and indeed bluntly that none of his friends are left in any doubt what he would want in his present situation.</span></p>

It is necessary to include them as they form part of my reasoning but I intend to do so perfunctorily so as to minimise her distress at a difficult time for her, conscious that this will be a public judgment.  CP has behaved in a manner on the ward which has been alarming to both patients and staff, she has been voluble and offensive in her criticisms of medical staff and she has, now by her own admission, told lies.  She has given an account of her family life which has not always been consistent, indeed it has been, at times, contradictory.  She has also asserted that her family would say to this Court <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;whatever she told them to&#8217;</span>.  During the course of her evidence I sensed vulnerability in CP and asked her whether she had ever suffered mental health problems.   She told me, guilelessly, that she had suffered mental health problems as a girl and was currently taking anti-depressant medication.  I propose to say nothing further as to the facts of these matters other than to identify that CP is an unreliable chronicler of events.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Badwan had assumed that RY&#8217;s wishes and feelings were clear and accurately asserted by his family.  At an earlier hearing, I had made the same assumption. For the reasons I have just outlined we were both wrong.  Mr Badwan told me that if it was the case that RY would not have wanted the proposed medical course he would regard that as so significant as to be determinative.  Dr Gorst told me exactly the same, though on a different premise.  He considered that if I was satisfied that for religious beliefs or otherwise RY would prefer to endure the pain of deep suctioning with limited, if any, long term medical benefit, then he too would consider that to be determinative in this case.  It is therefore particularly sad that, despite the efforts made, it has not been possible to identify RY&#8217;s own wishes. I have arrived at the general conclusion that RY was a private, decent man who was not given to discussing his emotions and beliefs and had never allowed himself to contemplate, or at least discuss with others, the parlous situation in which he now finds himself.  Perhaps this is no more (or less) than the &#8216;sang froid&#8217; of an older generation.</p>

This powerful and important consideration will always weigh heavily in the balance but it must not be permitted to quash all other considerations.

The question is not whether the doctor should take a course which will kill his patient, or even take a course which has the effect of accelerating his death. The question is whether the doctor should or should not continue to provide his patient with medical treatment or care which, if continued, will prolong his patient's life. The question is sometimes put in striking or emotional terms, which can be misleading. For example, in the case of a life support system, it is sometimes asked: should a doctor be entitled to switch it off, or to pull the plug? and then it is asked: can it be in the best interests of the patient that a doctor should be able to switch the life support system off, when this will inevitably result in the patient's death? Such an approach has rightly been criticised as misleading, for example by Professor Ian Kennedy in his paper in Treat Me Right, Essays in Medical Law and Ethics and by Thomas J. in Auckland Area Health Board v. Attorney-General [1993] 1 N.Z.L.R. 235, 247. This is because the question is not whether it is in the best interests of the patient that he should die. The question is whether it is in the best interests of the patient that his life should be prolonged by the continuance of this form of medical treatment or care&#8221;</span></p>

It is reasonable also that account should be taken of the invasiveness of the treatment and of the indignity to which, as the present case shows, a person has to be subjected if his life is prolonged by artificial means, which must cause considerable distress to his family - a distress which reflects not only their own feelings but their perception of the situation of their relative who is being kept alive. But in the end, in a case such as the present, it is the futility of the treatment which justifies its termination. I do not consider that, in circumstances such as these, a doctor is required to initiate or to continue life-prolonging treatment or care in the best interests of his patient. It follows that no such duty rests upon the respondents, or upon Dr. Howe, in the case of Anthony Bland, whose condition is in reality no more than a living death, and for whom such treatment or care would, in medical terms, be futile&#8221;</span></p>

There has been some debate as to how this &#8220;burden&#8221; should be characterised.  Ms Gollop, referred to it as &#8220;distress&#8221;.  To my mind that will not do.  Dr Gorst, relying on his experience of patients who are able to proffer a description, relates that it has been said to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;like a hot poker being inserted into the airways&#8221;</span>.  Dr. Baker said it was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;akin to the trachea being poked with a stick&#8221;</span>.  Because it entails a choking sensation, Dr Gorst settled upon the phrase <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;primal panic pain&#8221;</span> which resonates with descriptions that I have been given in other cases in similar circumstances.  It also seems consistent with simple anatomy as it involves, for its duration, an obstruction of the airways.</p>

That is to say, whether it can be rationalised as a proportionate intervention in the context of RY&#8217;s medical welfare, having regard to his overall clinical situation.

At the time the decision was made none of the doctors had appreciated that RY had developed the capacity to experience pain, either to the extent that it is now realised or at all.  Had Dr Gorst had the benefit of the newly emerged consensus, he told me that he would not have supported the application to seek a declaration that the insertion of the tracheostomy was in RY&#8217;s best interest.  Dr Gorst may very well be correct, indeed I strongly suspect he is.  There have been times, in recent weeks, when suctioning has been required very frequently during the course of a 24-hour period.  For a patient with a reasonable prognosis that might well have been a proportionate interference but RY&#8217;s prognosis is a bleak one.</p>

There is subtle but clinically significant evidence of what Mr Badwan has described as an &#8220;upward trajectory&#8221; in RY&#8217;s level of awareness. This requires to be acknowledged, as I have said, without being overemphasised or exaggerated.  By contrast, RY&#8217;s general physical condition is deteriorating.  Here Ms. Gollop speculates that this may involve a period of &#8220;plateauing&#8221;, with a more rapid deceleration towards the end of life.  My own evaluation of the evidence of Dr Gorst is that he considered that &#8216;decline&#8217; is likely to be rather more progressive, illustrated by increased thinning of the skin (which has a susceptibility to tear) and consistent muscle wastage (which raises the prospect of pain on turning). </p>

Thus, for RY, the pain involved in deep suctioning may be experienced on some occasions and not others.  Mr Badwan, with this Court&#8217;s authorisation, has conducted an intensive &#8220;awareness assessment&#8221;.  As I believe is his frequent practice, he encouraged videos to be filmed of RY.  It is, at least in part, from these videos that Mr Badwan has reviewed his initial position i.e. that RY was in a Vegetative State and now concluded that he is in a Minimally Conscious State.</p>

As videoing took place over several days, a selection of 20 minutes or so (which is what it was suggested I might see) runs the risk that I might gain a distorted impression of RY&#8217;s overall situation.  Similarly, I may, as a lay person, struggle to identify what Mr Badwan sees in the videos, informed by his own professional expertise.  In both situations and more widely there is the risk that I might substitute my untutored impression for those of the expert.  My task, as I see it, is to evaluate Mr Badwan&#8217;s assessment of the core material, in the context of his evidence as a whole. Some judges, I am aware, have taken a different approach and I can entirely see how there is room for differing views.</p>

Though Mr Badwan has found them useful here, I do not consider that video recordings should ever be regarded as a routine investigative tool.  Both the videoing and their distribution will require strong and well-reasoned justification.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have come to the clear conclusion that deep suctioning via RY&#8217;s tracheostomy causes him pain, which may at times be considerable and at others less so.  The tracheostomy serves its immediate function in the sense that it can, when required, substitute for RY&#8217;s compromised cough reflex and clear secretions.  In this sense the tracheostomy cannot be described as futile.  The real question is whether, in the context of RY&#8217;s poor prognosis and declining physiological circumstances, the deep suctioning can be said to contribute either to the quality or expectation of his life.  Were it to do so it might justify the pain undoubtedly involved.  I am satisfied on the evidence that it does not.  Society cannot ask those in the medical profession to cause harm without purpose.  To do so compromises both their integrity and, inevitably, the dignity of their patient.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, I have concluded that it would not, at this stage, be right to grant the Health Board&#8217;s application.  I draw back from doing so for two reasons only.  Firstly, as Mr Chisholm has properly identified, there was, in the days leading to this application, and indeed at the hearing, much repositioning and changing of views by the doctors involved in this case.  As I have emphasised above I consider this to reflect the quality and experience of the experts and clinicians before me and their readiness to yield, where appropriate to the opinions of others, recognising that no one discipline will be predominant in matters of this kind.  Whilst I am entirely satisfied that I have been presented with evidence which has now allowed me to come to a clear conclusion, I also consider that it is appropriate to allow a short period for all the professionals and the family involved to reflect on my judgment.  The realisation that deep suctioning causes pain, however it is characterised, has come late in the day.  CP may wish to reflect that this pain comes not &#8216;by act of God&#8217;(as she might see it) but through the intervention of reasonable and well intentioned medical treatment.  I believe that CP is entitled to the opportunity to reflect on the ramifications of this information.  It will, in my judgement, be very much in RY&#8217;s best interests if his daughter and the experts can ultimately agree and therefore plan together the circumstances in which he should live whatever time remains to him.</p>

To this must be added a perceptible decline in the need for the procedure in the course of the last 2 weeks.  In my judgement, deep suctioning has become, for the moment, delicately poised between what can properly be described as &#8216;burdensome&#8217; and that which is &#8216;overly burdensome&#8217;.  In the absence of understanding RY&#8217;s own views I believe the balance tips, for now, in favour of supporting life.</p>

I do not want the Health Board to regard my refusal to grant the declaration they seek as indicating that deep suctioning is in RY&#8217;s best interest.  Whilst I have much sympathy with Mr Chisholm&#8217;s submission that the pain caused by this procedure can never be justified and militates in favour of the immediate removal of the tracheostomy, I feel instinctively reluctant to endorse the Health Board&#8217;s plan at a time when there has been no deep suctioning at all for 4 days.  If this procedure becomes necessary as a regular and daily part of RY&#8217;s life it will not be in his best interests and the Health Board must return to this Court for their plan to be endorsed.  If the Health Board and CP are able to agree that deep suctioning be discontinued it will not be necessary for there to be a return to Court at all.  I am satisfied that the palliative regime outlined by Dr Baker will ensure that whilst RY&#8217;s life will be much shortened it will be free from pain and dignified.  </p>
