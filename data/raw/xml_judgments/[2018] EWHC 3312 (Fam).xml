In the event that I do not terminate the father&#8217;s parental responsibility, the mother also asks for an order that she may apply for a passport for B without the father&#8217;s consent.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.03in">B&#8217;s father is D. He has parental responsibility for B by virtue of being registered on the birth certificate. He has not attended today although I am satisfied that he has been made aware of the hearing. He was served by email on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2018 by the process server, who also posted the documents through the post box at his address.  I note that various attempts were made to contact him by John Power, the Guardian, as set out in his report. This included sending a hard copy which was posted to him on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2018 which was signed as received on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2018.  Mr. Power told me he had emailed D as well but that he had had a receipt from that address saying that it did not accept emails from an unknown individual.  It is clear to me that the father has taken a conscious decision not to engage with these proceedings, as is apparent from his email to the court dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2018 which he sent again on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2018.  He opposes the applications to terminate his parental responsibility and to change B&#8217;s surname, but agrees to the passport application.  As there has been no formal application to extend the nonmolestation order, the father has not responded to this.   </p>

Despite the difficulties as set out in the first Cafcass report, the mother and father appeared to have agreed that B should spend time (unsupervised) with the father and the case was closed in 2013.  In July 2016 the mother applied for specific issue and prohibited steps orders to enable her to take B for assessments with respect to his autism, and also for him to be immunised.  Orders were made permitting these in December 2016. The father did not attend that hearing or any others. During the currency of those proceedings he wrote a number of emails to various professionals.  </p>

The report was sent to the father. Following this he sent a number of deeply unpleasant emails to various people, the details of which I will come to later.  He also attended B&#8217;s school and posted written material through the letterboxes of the mother&#8217;s neighbours about B.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother&#8217;s case as set out in her statements and in the submissions made on her behalf is that the father has repeatedly obstructed her efforts to ensure B receives the medical and educational support he requires and is likely to continue to do so. The father is extremely difficult to deal with, not only for her but for the professionals involved in B&#8217;s care.  The father is angry and intimidating. He makes decisions and then changes his mind.  In 2016 specific issue orders were made which allowed B to be assessed and to receive his immunisations, but as soon as the father received the assessment reports he began the course of behaviour summarised.  It is apparent from the assessments that B is going to require a lot of professional support, and for decisions to be made about his treatment and welfare on occasions and in ways that are not always possible to predict.  If the father has parental responsibility, he will be able to use it in a way that is detrimental to B&#8217;s welfare, by refusing to agree to things, causing delay, being impossible to speak to about matters in B rational fashion, by reacting in an angry, unfocused and intimidating way to all those engaged in trying to help B, and generally creating a great deal of stress for the mother, her parents, and then B.  This is what he has done to date, and, as B gets older, this will affect him and the family more and more.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.03in">In her brief oral evidence the mother said that B returned unsettled after having contact with his father and it took several days to calm him down. She gave an account of the last time that the father had visited B. He had arrived unannounced on the doorstep in about June 2016 with a rock that he had obtained when he was on holiday. When he had arrived, he had wanted to give it to B personally and so she had called him downstairs. When B appeared the father gave him the rock and asked him if he had sent him a card for father&#8217;s day (which he had not).  The mother then told me that the father had not sent B Christmas or birthday presents or cards for a considerable period of time.  She said that the original idea of changing B&#8217;s surname had come from the father and that he had subsequently changed his mind. She found that the father to be difficult and intimidating and she felt that his name was well known in her area </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.03in">The father sent (and then recently resent) two long emails, both dated 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2018, setting out his response to the mother&#8217;s applications. In it, he strongly opposes the application to remove his parental responsibility, pointing out that such orders have only been made a few times in the past, and in circumstances where there are the most serious child protection issues. He says that should he (and he does not) withhold consent for autism treatment or support, this can be dealt with by specific issue orders as happened in 2016. He agrees to B receiving support for his autism and points out that it is a condition not an illness.  Additionally, he says removing his parental responsibility is not in B&#8217;s best interests generally.  So far as the application to change B&#8217;s surname is concerned, he says his previous agreement to change it was given under duress as the mother threatened to make new domestic abuse allegations, and he now opposes it.  Finally, he agrees to B having a passport.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.38in;margin-right:0.03in">The rest of the email sent by the father is wide ranging and includes a number of complaints. It is clear from what he says that he sees himself as a victim and that he harbours great resentment, not only against the mother, but also against numerous professionals, including NHS staff and the mother&#8217;s solicitors for the way he perceives that he has been treated.  He justifies distributing a publication (which I take to be an email written by him dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November) to parents at B&#8217;s school because he felt it was pointless making complaints or further complaints about the NHS staff who had assessed B. </p>

He needs (like all children) constancy, security, validation and love.  Access to the resources that B will need on an ongoing basis is slow, somewhat bureaucratic and still at an early stage.

Mr. Power says also that B needs &#8220;a happy confident mum, free from the anxiety, uncertainty and worry that she fears she will suffer if the father retains his parental responsibility&#8221;.  Mr. Power believes that the father has not behaved responsibly towards his son and that, if the mother&#8217;s case is accepted by the court, the father&#8217;s involvement in his son&#8217;s life is more about his need to coercively control her than to be a co-parent to their son.  </p>

By section 1(4) there is no requirement on the court to consider the factors set out in the welfare checklist but the court may find it helpful to use this as an analytical framework.  The court must also consider whether making such an order is better for the child than making no order at all.  Under section 1(2A) the court is to presume, unless the contrary is shown, that involvement of that parent in the life of the child concerned will further the child&#8217;s welfare. </p>

The mother agreed to remain living with her parents which was considered to be a protective factor, even though she appeared unwilling to end her relationship with the father.  At another case conference in January 2013 it was recorded that the father had failed to cooperate to facilitate a risk assessment.  In 2013 it appeared that the father was having unsupervised contact with B despite local authority misgivings, but that he looked well cared for.  </p>

His responses are repeatedly belligerent, and nowhere does he appear to enter into a constructive discussion about what is best for his son. At some points he has agreed to treatment, testing or assessments and at others he has not. The mother had to resort to applying to the court to allow B to be immunised and assessed for the support he needs, and then the father declined to attend, or even to talk to the Cafcass Officer.  There does not seem to be any prospect of a change in the father&#8217;s attitude. Ms Greensmith of Cafcass said in 2016 that if the father was able to acknowledge some responsibility for his conduct, he could be referred to a suitable programme.  She said that it would give him the opportunity to reflect on and modify his behaviour in the hope of seeing B if he completed it.  It is instructive that he has not done so.    </p>

Mr. Power is right to say that B needs a happy confident mum, free from the anxiety, uncertainty and worry that she fears she will suffer if the father retains his parental responsibility. She will need energy and resources to devote to his care, which would I consider would be undermined by further verbal abuse and criticism from the father, whether it is expressed directly to her or to others.  The same applies to members of the wider family, such as B&#8217;s grandparents. He lives with them, and they are an important part of his life and his support network. The father has not shown that he is capable of meeting B&#8217;s needs.  </p>

Given B&#8217;s age and circumstances the question of attachment is difficult to gauge, but I accept the mother&#8217;s evidence that B came back from contact with his father distressed, and that he has seen him only rarely since about 2015.  I cannot see any attachment developing either, for the father is so bound up in himself and his own anger that he has been prepared to write about his son in dreadful terms, terms that will be deeply distressing to B if he ever comes to know about it, and this is likely to happen again.  The father&#8217;s interventions in and responses to decision making about B have led to conflict, delay and stress, without his seeming to offer anything at all constructive to the issues. If this was an application for parental responsibility the conclusion I would come to is that his reasons for wanting the order to be made (and in this case continued) are so that he can object and by doing so control the mother and others.  </p>

Mr. Power confirmed that the area where the mother lives (which he knows) is a close knit one, and that people are inclined to remember names. B was registered in his father&#8217;s name but the link with his father has caused, and is likely to cause, significant problems for him. B&#8217;s identity is very much bound up with his mother and maternal family, and I think that for him recognition of this is most significant.   </p>

The email of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2017, which was one of a number of emails sent that day to the mother&#8217;s solicitor, makes this clear.
