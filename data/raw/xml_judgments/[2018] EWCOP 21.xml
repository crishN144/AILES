The Applicant says that Focus complies with the OPG&#8217;s professional standards requirements; is audited by N.

Notwithstanding the acknowledged separation from NELC, the Applicant considers that Focus &#8220;should be treated as part of the public authority.&#8221; [<span style="font-weight:bold">34</span>] It is said that, at one point, Focus was being monitored by the OPG&#8217;s public authority supervision team, and it continues to be supervised by the OPG as a public authority in terms of fees that can be charged. </p>

Historically, judges have said that the division of an Act into sections is arbitrary, and ought not to be treated as furnishing a guide to its construction. This is no longer the cases, as drafters take great care to design a section so that it deals with a single point; and the way the sections are organised and arranged is to be taken as a reliable guide to legislative intention.&#8221;  </span></p>

Subsection (2) provides for a particular method of meeting the requirement of subsection (1). An order made under subsection (2) should only specify the office or position, and not the individual holding that office at the date of the order. An order which identifies an individual is effectively made under subsection (1). Any requirement to name the individual holding the office at the date of the appointment would render subsection (2) futile. </p>

I agree with Mr. Parkhill&#8217;s submission that nothing in the Mental Capacity Act evinces an intention contrary to that set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/30/section/12/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12(2)</ref> of the Interpretation Act. In my judgment, the correct interpretation of subsection (2) must be that an order appointing an office holder operates to appoint the holder of the office from time to time, and will remain effective when the office holder at the date of the appointment is replaced. </p>

For the protection of P, it is appropriate that any change in the identity of the office holder is monitored. In my judgment, the proportionate way to do this is as part of the Public Guardian&#8217;s ongoing supervision of deputyship appointments. An order appointing an office holder as deputy should therefore include a requirement that that the holder at the date of appointment notifies the Public Guardian if they cease to hold that office. The Public Guardian will then be in a position to refer the matter to the court if he considers that appropriate. A single application could be made in respect of one P, and in the light of the conclusion in that application, the court may be invited &#8216;of its own motion&#8217; to review all other deputyships held by the office in question.   </p>

How is the Court to be satisfied that it is within the vires of a company for its office or post holder to act as deputy? In my judgment, the only feasible and proportionate way for the Court to satisfy itself of this basic requirement is to require self-reporting, with a declaration of truth, in the same way that other kinds of deputy are required to self-report their own appropriateness to act as deputy.

The Applicant has not expressed its position in the light of this advice. However, in his oral submissions Mr Parkhill accepted that, if there is not sufficient insurance cover, &#8220;the answer is to appoint as a lay deputy&#8221; ie the higher risk would suggest a higher security requirement.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">The Court of Protection is no more equipped to determine the meaning of insurance policies than it is to determine issues of company law. Its interest in the insurance cover of a proposed deputy is to inform its assessment of risk to the assets of the protected person. On the information available, I am not satisfied that Focus&#8217; professional indemnity insurance is sufficient to cover the potential loss to protected persons attributable to the exercise of the functions of deputyship by its appointed office holder; and therefore, if such appointment is to be made, it is appropriate for the court to require security on the same basis as other non-insured (lay) deputies.  </p>
