	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these financial remedy proceedings the assets are, as I find, about &#163;48 million. The Wife (&#8220;W&#8221;) seeks 50% thereof, c&#163;24m each. The Husband (&#8220;H&#8221;) seeks a 60/40 split in his favour, such that he would receive about &#163;29m and W about &#163;19m. The difference between their respective positions is about &#163;5m. The parties&#8217; combined costs are just over &#163;3 million (W &#163;1,327,081<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and H &#163;1,761,488) which is 60% of the disputed sum. How, then, is it that they have been unable to reach settlement? The main answer is the extraordinary facts of the case which have thrown up innumerable computational and conduct issues. There have been no fewer than 11 court hearings, and the parties have produced a total of 21 sworn statements. No stone was left unturned; the detail placed before me was at times mind boggling. Accordingly it is, regrettably, necessary for me to narrate the background in much more detail than would normally be required. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for W pointed out that H was found to be untruthful in other proceedings in 2022 between himself and a former business associate, Ernest Magdeev (&#8220;EM&#8221;). That is indeed the case. On the other hand, he was found to be generally truthful (if not faultless) in commercial court proceedings before Cockerill J between himself and the father of EM, Rustem Magdeev (&#8220;RM&#8221;) in 2020. In the end, I consider that I should judge H as I find him, untainted by what was said both for and against him by other tribunals. On the whole, I thought he was, generally, truthful to me.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W started her evidence from an unpromising position as it has long been obvious that during these proceedings she has repeatedly lied to H and to the court. Her Form E, that critical foundation of any case, contained numerous material omissions. Thereafter she uttered repeated falsehoods about the whereabouts of valuable jewellery which required a variety of freezing orders, and a search order, before the truth emerged. To be fair, in oral evidence she frankly acknowledged to me that she had lied, and apologised. Despite that admission, overall I did not find her persuasive on the major factual issues which I have to determine, and on balance I preferred H&#8217;s evidence.</p>

Unbeknown to H, in August 2020 she had transferred Cypriot properties into her mother&#8217;s name which I regard as an obvious attempt to place assets beyond the reach of H (I do not accept, as W claimed, that H told her to do this). She blocked H&#8217;s operational involvement in Stirakia. She secured sole access to the safety deposit box at Harrods so as to take control of the valuable jewellery therein, intended to be used by H for trading purposes. She retained the rental income, from which the mortgages had to be met. The consequence of all this was that H was shut out of the family assets, with almost nothing in his sole name. He no longer had access to family bank accounts for his personal or business use. In 2021 he accordingly set up a Dubai company, the shares of which were held for him by a trusted associate, Mr D, pursuant to a formal nominee agreement, and banking arrangements were established. The facility was abruptly withdrawn by the bank in June 2022 for reasons to which I will return. Since then, H has had no means of accessing bank accounts or facilities provided by other financial institutions. The Russia/Ukraine conflict has exacerbated the situation and prevented him from doing any meaningful business anywhere in the world. Since late 2022, he has only been able to meet his financial requirements by (i) sale of assets pursuant to agreement and/or court order in these proceedings and (ii) borrowing from Mr D. Probably as a result of these steps carried out by W, H made no contribution to the mortgages<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>from his income, nor did he pay school fees, or any child maintenance for a lengthy period of time, or pay debts referable to the Surrey property.</p>

The authorities clearly indicate that such conduct would only be reflected where there is a financial consequence to its impact. In one case the husband had stabbed the wife and the wound had impaired her earning capacity. The impact of such conduct was properly reflected in the discretionary disposition made in the wife&#8217;s favour. Mrs Miller alleged that Mr Miller had unjustifiably ended the marriage discarding her in favour of another woman. Therefore, she argued that Mr Miller should not be permitted to argue that their marriage was short. This argument was rejected by the House of Lords which held that the conduct in question, although greatly distressing to Mrs Miller, should not find independent reflection in the court&#8217;s decision.</span></p>

In that latter case Moylan LJ confirmed that while the court should strive to quantify the scale of undisclosed assets it is not obliged to pluck a figure from the air where even a ballpark figure is in fact evidentially impossible to establish. Plainly, it will only be in a very rare case that the court would be unable even to hazard a ballpark figure for the scale of undisclosed assets. Normally, the court would be able to make the necessary assessment of the approximate scale of the non-visible assets, which is, of course, an indispensable datum when computing the matrimonial property and applying to it the equal sharing principle.&#8221;</span></p>

I see no reason why I should believe what she told me on this subject given the numerous lies which she has told the court. Mr R denies he holds them, and has not been required to attend court. It is notable that as part of her open proposal, W seeks a hand over of the GIA certificates to her, which would be unnecessary if she did not have possession or control of the diamonds. She has not brought legal action against Mr R. I agree that it is proper to add back the value of these items on W&#8217;s side, but I do so on the basis that she either has possession of the items somewhere or that she can obtain them, not on the basis that she must bear responsibility for items which she can no longer recover. </p>

In other words, I have reached a conclusion which is not based on a <span style="font-weight:bold">Vaughan v Vaughan <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1108" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1108</ref> </span>addback, but rather is a finding that W continues to hold the items in her possession or control. The former is a technique of adding back monies which have been dissipated through the reckless behaviour of one party, but no longer exist. The latter is a finding of fact about ownership of items which are in existence. The <span style="font-weight:bold">Vaughan </span>addback does not create money as such; it penalises the delinquent party by notionally adding back the dissipated funds so as not to prejudice the innocent party. Here, the assets have not been dissipated in the sense, for example, that they have been extravagantly spent. They have been spirited away, but remain an available resource for distribution. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will also add back in the value of the watch (item H). It was sold for &#163;358,000 by Mr R to a watch dealer in July 2021 without the box and documents which remain in H&#8217;s possession. It was almost immediately sold it on for $570,000 (about &#163;440,000). H tells me it was bought for &#163;579,020 in 2018 (&#163;514,000 on today&#8217;s exchange rates). I accept that it could have sold at a higher figure than &#163;358,000 had the box and documents been included; it is well known that these are a necessary part of achieving the optimum value for watches. In my judgment, this was wanton and reckless on W&#8217;s part, who stole the watch, handed it over to Mr R without H&#8217;s knowledge, and allowed it to be sold without its box and documents. I asked during the hearing for the SJE to do a valuation of the watch, with its box and certificate; they replied in cautious terms, not having been able to view it, and said that a similar watch sold in 2020 for &#163;415,000, but since then values of such watches have gone up by 60% (which might suggest a current value of &#163;664,000). This was not a formal valuation, and I treat it with some circumspection; as the valuer says, there are a number of unknown variables. Moreover, there is some evidence that from Mr R that he paid some monies to or on behalf of M. Doing the best I can, I propose to add back the value of the watch at &#163;550,000. This is not entirely a <span style="font-weight:bold">Vaughan</span> addback, for W tells me that Mr R owes her &#163;400,000; thus, she should be able to recover the bulk of the monies. </p>

Sensibly, in my view, he did not pursue that argument; in his evidence, H accepted that this was an &#8220;extreme&#8221; suggestion. There is no SJE evidence of the value in 2021, no evidence of formal offers to purchase, nor indeed any cogent evidence that he was contemplating a sale of these items at that time. </p>

H was unable to meet expenses out of his Dubai bank account. On his case, he had to engage in a fire sale of assets, specifically two paintings sold in July 2022 for &#163;1.2m when they were worth, according to his Form E, &#163;1.35m. Thus, he says, the financial impact upon him was a loss of &#163;150,000. I regard this all as somewhat speculative. Even if W&#8217;s conduct led to the closure of the accounts, I am not persuaded of a causative link with the sale of paintings. H accepted that many of his Form E figures for other items of jewellery and art were too high, in the light of subsequent valuations, so it seems possible to me that his estimate for the value of the two paintings was on the high side. There is no SJE evidence to assist me. H relies in part on hearsay evidence, in that he was told by the purchaser (a friend of his) that he intended to sell one of the paintings for &#163;150,000 more than he had paid H. I conclude that H has not satisfied me of any demonstrable loss caused by W&#8217;s appalling actions, although, as with many aspects of W&#8217;s behaviour, it may sound in costs. </span></p>

There is nothing to satisfy me (i) that W did indeed block the sale and (ii) that her actions were causative of the failed sale; for example, I cannot discount the possibility that the sale did not go through for other, unrelated reasons such as the purchaser or other shareholders getting cold feet, or legal difficulties. At no point did H&#8217;s solicitors, instructed on the divorce, say in correspondence that W had blocked the sale, or cost the family a large sum of money, and that her conduct would fall to be taken into account. For example, a letter from his solicitors dated 22 January 2021 simply says that &#8220;the sale did not go through&#8221; with no criticism of W&#8217;s actions. H&#8217;s reaction to all this seems to have been curiously muted.

It is frequently the case during divorce and financial remedy proceedings that interim arrangements are disputatious, with issues about financial support, interim sale of assets, cashflow and the like. In this case, I was met with repeated allegations and counter allegations at almost every direction hearing in respect of interim matters. To try and unpick them all now would be problematic, and not proportionate. The breakdown of marriage regularly leads to the dismantling of the financial edifice underpinning it. The court will not usually at trial embark upon an audit of the interim arrangements from the date of issue to the date of final hearing. Sometimes, a particular aspect of the arrangements, or one or other party&#8217;s acts or omissions, will leap off the page as being relevant to the overall disposition. That might (albeit rarely) lead to a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Vaughan </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">addback or, perhaps more commonly, might impact upon costs. The court will acknowledge the realities of life, that marital breakdown is painful and expensive.

It is of note that W clandestinely gained access to the Harrods Safety Deposit Box on 21 October 2020 (about the time of H allegedly removing the items from the London safe) without informing H. And of course, she has been shown to have lied to H and the court on multiple times about the Preserved Jewellery, including making the identical (but false) assertion that it was H who stole the Preserved Items.  Curiously, although W alleged in correspondence that H had removed items, she initiated no steps at court and did not even provide a list of what had allegedly been removed by H. It was only when H sued her in 2021 in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division (as it then was) for delivery up of his passport that W counterclaimed for conversion, alleging wrongful interference by H with chattels and jewellery. There was some confusion in the evidence about the combination number of the safe, but overall I am amply satisfied that H is to be preferred on this issue. </span></p>

Thereafter, Mr D met H&#8217;s financial needs personally, either by direct cash payments or giving him access to credit cards. This had been an arrangement in place for a few years but at a relatively low level. Over the course of the past year or so, Mr D has, on H&#8217;s case, met just under &#163;1.1m of expenses on behalf of H. Mr D has confirmed this in two letters, with a supporting schedule. It is an unconventional arrangement, but the reason for it is plausible. I generally believed H in the witness box, and the sum owed, although high, is not inconsistent with the general level of expenditure of these parties. I ask myself the question; where else did H meet his expenses from in that year if not from Mr D? There is nothing to point to another resource available to him, nor was one suggested on behalf of W.</p>

The way the argument was put was inconsistent. It was suggested that (i) the combined value of the items was or should have been broadly equivalent to the loan, and were set against it such that no loan is owing or (ii) the items are in H&#8217;s possession and should feature on his side of the balance sheet; these are mutually contradictory.

Mr D sold it for $220,000, as recorded in his schedule. H acknowledged the enormous loss of value, but told me that because he could not travel, he was in no position to sell it abroad at anything close to purchase price, and that he has become used during these proceedings to swallowing losses. In any event, in respect of items 29-53, the parties were content to take values at 25% of purchase costs which is supportive of the sale price of this necklace. Mr D confirmed the arrangement in his letters which carries some weight even though he did not give oral evidence. </p>

The watch was sold by the new owner for $130,000. W disputed this account of events, but I accept H&#8217;s evidence which was supported by a contemporaneous 2018 letter from the new owner. </p>

That untruth was repeated in correspondence on 22 May 2023. It is now known that there are on any view over 150 in her possession. Moreover, at hearings before me, W downplayed the bags, saying it would be disproportionate to have them valued.

W submits, however, that the total value to be adopted should be &#163;797,500, on the basis that about 100 of the bags are individually worth less than &#163;5,000. She points out that other valuations, including chattels, were undertaken on the basis of excluding items under &#163;5,000, which favours H who will retain the bulk of the chattels at the Surrey home.

The benefit and burden to W will fall away after 5 years from the date of final order. It seems to me that it would be unconscionable for H to carry all the risk, particularly in respect of the Magdeevs&#8217; counterclaim valued at $20m. All the litigation arises out of events which occurred during the marriage. W has benefited from H&#8217;s skills and success, and cannot now relinquish what amounts to marital obligations. She is a named party to two of the sets of litigation. The fact that W has actively worked against H in this litigation strengthens my view that she must share the risk. They will both have to cooperate in the litigation, and there needs to be full visibility of how the proceedings are being conducted. They have a mutual interest in achieving the best possible results. </p>

In answer to questions from me, W said that wanted above all else to be free of any financial ties to H.

I see no justification for adjourning W&#8217;s claims until the potential tax liability is known.

I consider that sum to be one which broadly meets her needs. Of course, it would be rather less than she says she needs but, for example, she would have (on current figures) the flat and &#163;2.5m. The children&#8217;s costs will be met in any event. She could sell the flat and purchase a cheaper property.

Nevertheless, the judgments of Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P and Thorpe LJ comprehensively considered the broader issue of publicity in family proceedings including financial remedy proceedings. And <span style="font-weight:bold">Lykiardopulo</span>, also heard in the Court of Appeal, was not obiter; the appeal concerned ancillary relief proceedings (as they were then termed) and the same conclusion was reached as to the non-reportability of financial remedy proceedings absent court order. </p>

In my tentative opinion, it is for a higher court than mine to decide this issue, certainly unless and until I hear full and detailed argument which addresses the hugely important thesis of Mostyn J. I have had no meaningful submissions on this topic, either in this case or in any other case in front of me, since Mostyn J first set out his considered position. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Farquhar Group published a report on this very issue in April 2023. It is, if I may say so, extremely well researched and comprehensive. It makes suggestions as to how (whatever the default staring point) the interests of transparency can be served in financial remedy proceedings while at the same time preserving the confidentiality of the parties and their sensitive financial information; essentially striking what the group considers to be a fair balance between Article 8 and 10. The group did not opine on whether Mostyn J&#8217;s analysis is correct, nor do its recommendations carry the weight of law.  It may be that in due course Presidential guidance will be issued. But at the risk of repetition, my view is that a higher court will at some point probably need to cast a fresh eye on this issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the case before me, in my judgment all of these categories apply to a lesser or greater extent. The litigation misconduct of W is of the utmost gravity. It is in the public interest to be aware that one party has abused the system, and repeatedly lied, eating up valuable court time and resources in the process. Much is already known about the circumstances of this family from the detailed judgment of Cockerill J in 2020. Proceedings about the parties&#8217; chattels found their way to the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division in 2021 and attracted some publicity. Similarly, a court dispute with a garden installation company was reported in the national press in 2022, including some of the more lurid features of this case (for example, H was described as &#8220;on the Kremlin&#8217;s most-wanted hit list&#8221;, and the reporting included the details and photographs of the Surrey house). The fact that there have been three attempts on H&#8217;s life in this country is, in my view, a matter of public interest. H gave revealing interviews to the Daily Telegraph in 2020 and the Daily Mail in March 2022 about his business dealings, Russian litigation and general wealth. I also take the view that the public is entitled to know that H has not paid a penny of UK tax, nor even filed UK tax returns since his return to this country in January 2018; this is despite the parties being citizens of this country and resident here, having children who are educated here and owning multiple properties here. Finally, it is, in my view, hard to see how any attempt at anonymisation can realistically work. </p>
