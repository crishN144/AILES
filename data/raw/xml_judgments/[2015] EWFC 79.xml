	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2007, the local authority started care proceedings in relation to a child who I shall refer to as C. During the course of those proceedings, the court directed that C and C&#8217;s mother should be assessed at the Clinic. In due course, Dr X produced a report for the court. It is important to note that Dr X was not merely instructed as an expert witness; he was also, while she was at the Clinic, the mother&#8217;s treating physician, prescribing her drugs from time to time. For the purpose of the care proceedings the court also obtained an expert report from another psychiatrist, who I shall refer to as Dr Z.</p>

In due course &#8211; apparently more than five years later &#8211; the case was heard by a Fitness to Practise Panel of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. Dr X faced seven allegations. Two were withdrawn by the GMC; each of the other five was found not proved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Initially, their case was set out, and at considerable length, in a statement by Dr X dated 27 June 2014 and in skeleton arguments by their counsel, Miss Claire Wills-Goldingham QC, dated 25 June 2014 and 4 September 2014. A Scott Schedule dated 21 August 2014 listed the documents of which they sought disclosure: 278 documents from the care proceedings (not all of which had been included in the care proceedings bundle), which I shall refer to as the family court documents, and a further 10 documents (not filed in the care proceedings) from the hearing before the Fitness to Practise Panel. The latter documents were referred to before me, and I shall refer to them, as the Bundle J documents. The Scott Schedule was prefaced by the words:</p>

Documents 234-263 included in the list of family court documents under the heading &#8216;Additional medical records relevant to the Care Proceedings, not in the Bundle&#8217;, comprised nurses notes, doctors notes and other medical records, relating to the period <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>the mother had left the Clinic and when she was being treated elsewhere by other clinicians. These documents, listed also in an annex to the skeleton of the GMC&#8217;s counsel, Miss Heather Emmerson, were referred to before me, and I shall refer to them as, the Bundle H documents (they are to be distinguished from the documents listed under the heading &#8216;Bundle H: Records of assessment at [the Clinic]&#8217; which are entirely different).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At that stage, the disclosure sought from the GMC was of the Bundle H documents and the Bundle J documents. The Bundle H documents comprised documents obtained by the GMC as part of its investigation and disclosed to Dr X. Some, but not all, were deployed before the Fitness to Practise Panel. The Bundle J documents comprised various witness statements relied on by the GMC or Dr X before the Fitness to Practise Panel. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his statement, Dr X referred to what he called &#8220;a need for transparency for experts in the Family Court.&#8221; He said that &#8220;reputable journalists&#8221;, whom he identified, wished to &#8220;have access to the documents in order to write articles on the role of the expert in the Family Court and the functioning of the General Medical Council when regulating doctors acting as experts.&#8221; He said that &#8220;misinformed press reporting has severely damaged my reputation and my ability to work in child protection or within the court arena&#8221; and that he been &#8220;unable to respond due to the confidentiality of the family court.&#8221; The mother, in contrast, he said, had not merely spoken to the media, making what he said were &#8220;false allegations&#8221; about him, but had also made documents available on the internet, notwithstanding an injunction prohibiting her from doing so. He said that he had received a number of invitations to speak at professional conferences &#8220;but cannot make these presentations without disclosure being allowed.&#8221; In Miss Wills-Goldingham&#8217;s skeleton arguments it is said that Dr X&#8217;s &#8220;otherwise unblemished reputation &#8230; has been cataclysmically damaged &#8230; through inaccurate reporting and internet postings&#8221; and that he has been &#8220;unfairly and unjustly pilloried by the mother and, through her, by the press.&#8221;</p>

The response was in a further skeleton argument. This made clear that disclosure was now sought of only some (46) of the family court documents listed in the Scott Schedule. The reduced list still included a number of psychological and psychiatric reports on the mother, including those by Dr Z, the records of the assessment at the Clinic and the first eleven (Scott Schedule documents 234-244) of the Bundle H documents. It was also made clear that disclosure was no longer sought of the Bundle J documents. </p>

Because certain professional or commercial relationships &#8211; for example, the relationship of doctor and patient, lawyer and client and banker and customer &#8211; are, of their very nature, confidential, the knowledge or information acquired in the course of such a relationship is confidential. So, the doctor, lawyer or banker, as the case may be, is under a legally enforceable duty to preserve the confidence of his patient, client or customer and a legally enforceable duty not to disclose the information. It is well recognised that, in principle, the duty extends beyond the termination of the professional relationship and survives even the death of the patient, client or customer.</p>

The example Bankes LJ gave was where a bank issues a writ claiming payment of an overdraft stating on the face of the writ the amount of the overdraft. Familiar examples in the case of lawyers and doctors are where the client or patient brings an action for professional negligence, or makes allegations of professional misconduct before a professional disciplinary tribunal, or seeks to defend a claim for unpaid fees by raising an allegation of negligence or professional misconduct. In principle, the same would apply if, in response to defamatory statements, the lawyer or doctor sued his client or patient in libel, slander or malicious falsehood.</p>

Scrutton LJ (page 481) described it as being &#8220;to an extent reasonable and proper for its own protection&#8221;, Atkin LJ (page 486) referred to the &#8220;right to disclose such information when, and to the extent to which it is reasonably necessary for the protection of the bank&#8217;s interests.&#8221; Nowadays, this principle, as we will see, is modulated by the usual Convention criteria of &#8216;necessity&#8217; and &#8216;proportionality&#8217;. Thus where, for example, the issue arises in the context of the kind of litigation referred to above, disclosure will in principle be controlled in at least two ways. First, disclosure is likely to be confined to what is necessary for enabling the proceedings to be disposed of justly and fairly. Secondly, the court, in an appropriate case, may impose safeguards and limitations on the wider use or more general dissemination of what has been disclosed for the purpose of the proceedings.</p>

Often, as where disclosure is to the police, the Crown Prosecution Service or a professional regulator, the justification is some public interest.

At a fact-finding hearing the allegations were found to be entirely false and to have been a creation of the mother&#8217;s; she had coached the girl to make the disclosures. The mother refused to accept the findings and posted allegations that the father was a paedophile and a rapist on the internet, circulating information to parents at the girl&#8217;s school and to the father&#8217;s work colleagues.

They point out that, in contrast to <span style="font-style:italic">Re X, Y and Z</span>, the reports here are not in the &#8216;hard&#8217; sciences, but rather psychological and psychiatric reports, containing, as do the other documents of which disclosure is sought, deeply personal and intimate information about C and C&#8217;s mother and the relationship between them. The nature and extent of the disclosure sought constitutes, they say, a disproportionate level of intrusion and public attention which will cause disproportionate damage to C&#8217;s psychological integrity and personal development and, indeed, put them at grave risk, thereby potentially adding to the harm which led to the care proceedings; thus undermining the whole purpose of the care proceedings and cutting across the outcome they were supposed to ensure. That last contention is elaborated in a passage in their skeleton argument which I bear very much in mind but which there is no need for me even to summarise.</p>

What the applicants propose, they complain, is a systematic breach of the confidential relationships between the mother and those doctors, including Dr X, and medical professionals with whom she came into contact. Whatever Dr X may say, the consequence of the application, if granted, will, it is submitted, be the publication to the world at large of the mother&#8217;s medical records and reports. The material is confidential, both of its nature, by reason of its subject matter, and as having been generated in the context of a doctor/patient relationship. It is, they assert, referring to <span style="font-style:italic">Z v Finland</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>sensitive personal data, in many cases the most sensitive and personal imaginable, protected both by the law of confidence and also by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/29" uk:canonical="1998 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Data Protection Act 1998</ref>.

So far as concerns Y, they submit that her interest (if any) can only be commercial. If Dr X has been defamed, his remedy is an action for libel.

There has to be a proper balance between the competing claims of the patient and doctor. The invasion of the patient&#8217;s confidentiality must, as in the case of an invasion of the confidentiality which attaches to the family court documents, be proportionate to the legitimate demands of the doctor. Here the remedy being sought by Dr X &#8211; permission to put the mother&#8217;s medical records and related documents into the public domain, at a time and in circumstances of his own choosing and without any of the safeguards usually imposed &#8211; is wholly disproportionate to anything which he can legitimately or reasonably demand.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the first, I agree with Miss Emmerson that this court, exercising the only jurisdiction I am being invited to exercise, simply lacks the jurisdiction to grant relief against the GMC in relation to documents that were never deployed in the care proceedings. This, in my judgment, is so plainly so that it hardly needs reference to authority. It is however supported by authority: see the discussion in <span style="font-style:italic">A Health Authority v X (Discovery: Medical Conduct) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 673" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 673</ref>, paras 64-65, of <span style="font-style:italic">Re D (Minors) (Wardship: Disclosure)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 FLR 346" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 FLR 346</ref>. </p>
