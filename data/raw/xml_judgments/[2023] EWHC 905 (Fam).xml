It is on the basis of that schedule that the local Authority contends that the threshold in respect of the children who are the subject of the application is made out.  The trigger for local authority intervention is that C has made allegations that she has been sexually abused by her two brothers A and B. The allegations made along with other matters flowing from them are reflected in the schedule. The Local Authority also relies on and seeks to prove allegations of ill treatment of C by her parents.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It has been a difficult hearing and one at which it has been entirely appropriate for Leading counsel to be instructed at the earliest possible stage for the key participants. That this was done has been reflected in the quality of representation from which the parties, and I, have benefitted at this hearing.  I have been very much assisted by the detailed written closing submissions from each party without which it would not have been possible to complete the hearing. The conduct of the hearing, has had none of the rancour which occasionally features in this sort of case and has been made far smoother by the deployment of the practice more often observed at the criminal bar of adopting and building on the cross examination which has gone before.  The parents required the services of interpreters, difficulties with whom might have at points derailed irretrievably the hearing. I am grateful to all of those concerned who ensured that the difficulties were overcome for their efforts. </p>

That his leading and junior counsel continued notwithstanding and that became known only at the conclusion of the hearing should not pass without acknowledgment. Nor should the observation that it was vital that he should have been so represented and I cannot see how even lip service could have been paid to his Article 6 rights had he not been.</p>

I agree. There are many cases when for all sorts of different reasons, a complainant cannot be cross examined about their allegations and it is well recognised by those who practice in the field that allegation may be established by other means. It is important to have regard to the other evidence. To the evidence of what has been said or done outside the court room and to the integrity and quality of that evidence.  To the wider canvas and the contextual circumstances of the case. It is perhaps one reason why, in relation to the ABE guidance, what is contemplated is a wider process of achieving that best evidence than simply the interviewing of a complainant in the formal setting of the interview.  Mr Momtaz is quite right that it is open to this court, as it so often is, to find that the allegations made are more likely than not to be true on the basis of the totality of the evidence and without a single question being asked of C by any counsel. </p>

She says she was 7 or 8. She was not. She was 4 or 5 but the Local Authority says that is exactly the sort of mistake which can properly be ignored as it is not her age but her account of what was done to her which was important.  I agree with the Local Authority on that point. It is. What will matter is the authenticity of the account and the experiential detail of it. A was 8 perhaps 9. The account is that he rubbed her vagina (touching her over her clothes) and then told her to keep it a secret.</p>

I don&#8217;t agree that it assists to think about the motivation for sexual touching of his sister or for that matter that it is helped by the point about secrecy. It is well known that some children, even young children, are for want of a better word perpetrators of peer-on-peer abuse. Furthermore, children who have a sense of something being wrong are well versed in the importance of secret keeping - &#8216;don't tell&#8217; is part of the language of childhood. Mr Vater&#8217;s far better points are however the improbability of a precocious sexual abuser stopping and then only starting again years later with no other indication of risk attaching to him in the real world or when examined in the virtual world of his digital downloads and second the further improbability that he could have so abused his sister when the family were all living as refugees in a single room.  </p>

She no longer works in the school and left for reasons unconnected quite soon after the events with which her evidence is concerned. From her oral evidence it emerged that she did not know particularly well either C or H. It is her habit to get to know the children and young people for whom she has overall responsibility but it so happened that there had been only about a term between C joining the school and the school designated safeguarding lead having a period of maternity leave and then  a further interruption to normal school life because of the pandemic meant she did not know those who had been in year 7 when her maternity leave started as well as she might by the middle of 2021</p>

It was H who asked to speak to her and who spoke to her throughout the conversation at the door and there was nothing said by C at all; it was apparent from H (rather than C&#8217;s) demeanour that this was not something trivial and the school designated safeguarding lead told the girls they should go and get their mark in the register.  When the school designated safeguarding lead came to her office at about 830 after entrance duty H was already there waiting. C was not. Her evidence was that H said that  C had told her something personal and that  the way in which H said it coupled with  what she knew of the girl i.e. she was a quiet girl not someone who came to staff, not someone to speak out and put her head up was sufficient for the school designated safeguarding lead to go without more, to get C from her classroom asking her form teacher if she could &#8216;borrow&#8217; her. </p>

The school designated safeguarding lead was not able to tell me what she had said to C on the way back to the office but had made a remark or two so that it was not as she put it <span style="font-style:italic"> a silent walk </span> and whatever it was she gave C to understand that H was there at the office but she could not say now (and had not recorded) what conversation there was about H at that stage.  Once the 3 were in the office the school designated safeguarding lead asked C the question <span style="font-style:italic"> how can I help</span>  which produced from C not a response but a request that H should relay the information.  In her evidence the school designated safeguarding lead said that <span style="font-style:italic">C asked H to tell me because she couldn&#8217;t say it</span>. That last detail that she couldn&#8217;t say it, is not something she recorded and at this distance I cannot safely know if it was the school&#8217;s designated safeguarding lead&#8217;s impression that C couldn&#8217;t say it, or it was part of C&#8217;s request to her friend to speak for her. It was also the school&#8217;s designated safeguarding lead&#8217;s oral evidence that C had asked for H to be present.  From that it is obvious that from the outset there was conversation taking place and in particular things said by C which are not recorded either contemporaneously or as part of the school&#8217;s designated safeguarding lead&#8217;s statement made very soon afterwards. The school designated safeguarding lead was asked in cross examination why it was that she spoke to C not by herself or with another member of staff but with another child.  In her evidence she said that she had at one stage said that H should leave but C had been &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">adamant</span>&#8217; that H should be there. She could not now say why that wasn&#8217;t included in her statement There was no recording of that aspect which appeared from her oral evidence to be an adamant wish expressed by C more than once. When asked to expand the school designated safeguarding lead gave an account of C expressing distress including appearing by her body language to be stressed, at the prospect of H leaving. Of course, I recognise that her oral evidence given now 18 months on from the events means she is doing her best to recall but that is not what caused me disquiet about it. It is that there were self-evidently conversations with C &#8211; things said by the school designated safeguarding lead; things said by C (and for all I know H) which are simply not recorded so I don&#8217;t know and can't assess the significance of them, if any, on the receipt of the allegations about B and A on which reliance is placed before me. </p>

Although she told me that she had had the appropriate training she also told me that this was the first time she had taken so serious an allegation from a child in her role as safeguarding lead.  She was on that day without her deputy who was away on long term sick. She also agreed that her training to make a note of questions asked and answers given did not &#8216;kick in&#8217;. As with all things it is harder doing it for real and unexpectedly than to do the training exercise.  As always it is easier for those at a later hearing to pick over the bones and offer a counsel of perfection.

I am troubled by the early contamination (which in the circumstances of this case I use in the sense of confusion rather than anything more sinister such as might be suggested as procuring an allegation or an account from a child) by the fact that the report comes not from the chid herself at all; that there are no contemporaneous recordings; there is (very significantly) no way of knowing what the questions were asked which produced the answers. The evidence from this witness in the particular circumstances of this case is the closest thing I have to a first report. It follows that it warrants close scrutiny.</p>

He spent about an hour taking the statement in a side room but did not have any contact with or speak to C who was seen by his colleague the first attending officer (female).

She was with another teacher (because the school&#8217;s designated safeguarding lead was with him). He didn&#8217;t know who. He did recall when asked by Ms Hendry that C had a friend with her.

She readily accepted that the time entered in the RASSO booklet as commencing at 1250  must be in error. Whilst I regarded her willingness to concede that she must have made an error as fair, she could not at this distance help with what would have been the right time and seemed to me to be hazarding a guess when she said it <span style="font-style:italic">could have been 1150 or something. </span> It is of course an error which added to the lack of clarity about how and for how long the child was spoken to at school. It made it difficult to square with the evidence of the first attending officer (male), which I accept, of sitting waiting in the corridor having completed the statement of the school designated safeguarding lead.  As her evidence developed, she became surer that she must have started in the Rasso with notes about the more recent allegations and then gone on to her note about the wider allegations C expanded to making once she spoke to her.  But the fact that she the officer had made no note of what questions had been asked eliciting the answers or narrative given makes it difficult to be able confidently to rely on what is recorded.  That there must have been questions asked is evident from some of the information recorded. For example, the information that mum was in the shower can only sensibly be understood as a response to being asked. That is but one example of how the words recorded are not always those said by C, other examples of where that is apparent from what is written, were accepted by this officer when she was taken to them in cross examination. I do regard it as unsatisfactory that she did not keep a verbatim note but bear in mind that her role was to attend not to conduct an interview. </p>

She did not attend the school on the morning when the allegations were made but she took over from the officers who had attended at C&#8217;s school once called by the school designated safeguarding lead.  She conducted the ABE interviews. It is to say the least unfortunate that notwithstanding clear directions for disclosure of all relevant police material into these proceedings during the lifetime of the case notebooks containing relevant working materials were not so disclosed. This officer had been aware of the directions.  It was, said the OIC, a misunderstanding or an oversight on her part that they were not necessary as what those books contained were only really names and numbers and dates when things needed to be done and suchlike.  Even leaving aside that it is not for the officer to decide what is or isn&#8217;t relevant in the face of a direction for the production of all, it is not the case that that was all that was contained in those notebooks. They contained for example the plan for the interview intended to be carried out with the mother.  So it was that the whole of a morning was lost when the documents in question were made available.  Shortly into the first period of cross examination of the officer it became clear that she had not taken the opportunity to view again the recordings of the ABE interview she had conducted with C, and it hadn&#8217;t crossed her mind to do so. I thought that surprising. A little further into the cross examination it emerged that neither had she taken the opportunity (or the local authority reminded her to take it) to read the transcripts of those interviews before coming into the witness box. That was beyond surprising. It also meant that having lost the morning a significant part of the afternoon was lost whilst she re-read that on which it was inevitable she would be cross examined the moment she set foot in the witness box. </p>

She was not now able to tell Ms Meyer &#8211; or me - what interview plan had been in her head since so much time had now passed.

Having a plan is not the same as having a script and an ABE interview is to elicit information not to tick boxes. Very often the submission is made for good reason that what is important is a core uncontaminated account running through the case notwithstanding the existence of breaches of this or that part of the Achieving Best Evidence Guidance. What has given me particular pause for thought here in the circumstances of this case is that the discussions which preceded the OIC&#8217;s interview with C were already problematic. Illustrative of the extent to which they were problematic is the fact that at this fact-finding hearing, I did not in fact have an account of a first complaint made by the complainant. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I found the officer&#8217;s evidence in relation to what might have been that first complaint especially troubling. The evidence which emerges from the bundle here is that  there is a suggestion that probably about a month before C&#8217;s friend H approached her schoolteacher, C had first made an allegation to her.   There is no statement from H. There is no interview with her or note of anyone speaking to H, it was not until December, some months later that the OIC on re-reading, so she told me in evidence, the case file realised either than no one had spoken to H or the significance of  H&#8217;s evidence. I found it profoundly disturbing that the officer in the case had not appreciated the importance of getting at the earliest possible stage the evidence of the person to whom the first complaint is said to have been made and furthermore that she had not appreciated it as soon as she took over the case. It is not complicated nuanced thinking that is required, it is basic investigative good practice. My impression of the officer&#8217;s evidence from her answers was that when she talked of not appreciating the significance of H until she re read the case file was that she had not registered that the approach to the school designated safeguarding lead and the complaint to her came not from C herself but from her friend, or that there had been an earlier complaint to that friend. As it turned out, by the time attempts were made, there was it seems an unwillingness on the part of the child&#8217;s parents to permit her to be spoken to and further involved. Whether that would have been so earlier cannot now be known. What remains is that the friend to whom apparently C had said something, who it is suggested had encouraged, so I heard from her foster carer, C to tell a teacher; who had in fact been the person who went herself first to tell a teacher is not someone from whom I have any direct evidence. </p>

Or as the officer expressed it things that would undermine her evidence.  This was in the context of other allegations which C had made &#8211; about a patient in a hospital at which she had been treated; about a peer at school and about a cousin which had been seemingly false.  The officer's evidence to me was that she could not recall which social worker it was with whom she had had that conversation. Or when it had been. She had not made a note of the discussion or any note on her workings of the case of the ways in which she had wondered whether the other allegations undermined those which C had made about her brothers. In one part of her evidence, the OIC said that she had not made a note on the system because it would be something that would have to be disclosed and the doubts were anyway only her own thoughts. I was very troubled by that answer. Sufficiently so that I gave the officer at the end of her evidence the opportunity to comment on the impression hearing her answer had made on me which was that a motivation in not recording the doubts about C&#8217;s reliability was that the fact that that recording would be disclosed would make a prosecution or charge less likely.  She said that she could see that it might have sounded like that but assured me that that wasn&#8217;t so. Everything C said - both in support of and against the allegations made - would have to go into her report for the CPS at the end and it was then up to them what happened.   Rather in the way of the interview plan that was not written down, I was left uneasy as to how without making a note of discussions about the emerging doubts as to reliability, this aspect would find its way into a later review of all the material.  I was left uneasy also as to the unsatisfactory answer about why this witness had not made a note of such an important discussion about an emerging thought. </p>

I do however form the view from all of her evidence that this officer was not investigating in the sense of looking in an open-minded way to see what evidence supported and corroborated and what ran counter to and pointed away from the allegations she had received but looking only for that which supported it. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That view was reinforced when I heard the approach she had taken to the digital material when available. Her evidence was that she had not examined the digital material by reading it or by reading the salient parts of it. There is of course an enormous amount of material disclosed and trawling through it is a time-consuming and tedious exercise and there are not limitless hours in the working day. I accept all of that although I observe in passing that it is an exercise which has been undertaken by Counsel in this case.  Instead, what this officer had done was to rely on key stroke searches and searches of the material for key words. A consequence of that is that because only that which supported the allegation is searched for, the investigation of the digital material is characterised by something akin to confirmatory bias. This was amply demonstrated by the short passage of extremely effective cross examination in which Ms Hendry invited the officer to consider other information which emerged from the digital material as to Cs knowledge of and active interest in matters sexual which were available to be found on a reading of that material. The officer's incurious approach to the question of what knowledge of or interest C might have of matters sexual was perplexing but entirely in keeping with what I am driven to find is her lack of interest in any consideration of the possibility that the allegations might not be true. By way of example only Ms Hendry returning to a point Ms Meyer had touched on asked the officer what she had made of C&#8217;s answer when asked if her brother had ever ejaculated and she responded that it felt like when he was close he would stop. It seemed that nowhere in her mind had been the question <span style="font-style:italic">what does that tell me about what C knows or has experienced and where does that come from?</span></p>

I did not detect in her evidence that there had been any sense in which she was evaluating what she heard or that her mind was open.  The local authority in closing submissions does not address in detail the evidence given by its social worker but makes the overarching submission in the following terms: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the court will make its own assessment of each of [the social work] professionals.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority submission does not survive the passage of cross examination in which Ms Meyer KC asked Ms. JB about whether she had ever considered an alternative to the allegations made by C in respect of her family being true. Ms. JB said that in discussion with CAMHS, about C&#8217;s emotionally dysregulated behaviour (in care after removal) and complex presentation it was felt it was that of a child who had suffered trauma. Asked by Ms Meyer what was the trauma, Ms JB responded &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I understood the trauma to be that she had been sexually abused&#8217; </span>and expanded to say &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I was believing the truth of the allegations yes. As her social worker I reassured her that I was there to support her and yes the message she got from me was that what she said I believed. I regarded her as a child who had been sexually abused. </span> I had wondered in listening to the social worker&#8217;s evidence whether she might have been meaning (although it was not what she was saying) that she regarded C as a child who had been sexually abused but that she retained an open mind about the allegations on the basis of which the local authority brings the case i.e., that it was her brothers who sexually abused her. However, from her evidence given during Ms Hendry&#8217;s later cross examination it was crystal clear that could not be so.  Ms JB had said to Ms Hendry that when she first came into the case she wanted to have an open mind and so formed no view as to belief though she came to believe the allegations over time and accepted that C would have picked up that she believed her.  Within this context I did not understand what she had meant by wanting to keep an open mind since in her working of the case as exposed by the able cross examination of her at this hearing there did not seem ever to have been as a component any consideration of what might be an alternative to the allegations being true. Be that as it may, it was  Mr Hadley who pressed her on whether she had ever volunteered to C that she believed her and elicited from Ms JB the following response: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">After a few months I did say I support and I believe you and that was in the context of her saying how she felt on that day and she was saying .. I remember that conversation yes and yes it was the case that I was saying I believe what you have said about your brothers and what they did to you&#8217;.</span></p>

At least in the sense that is of the criminal investigation. That does not however as I see it obviate the need for a social worker working in child protection to have properly an open mind in the sense that I would expect that to be understood.  I have also reflected carefully on Mr Momtaz&#8217;s stark submission that it doesn&#8217;t matter what this witness believed because the only thing that matters is what I find. The superficial attraction of that however is that it overlooks the fact that what this witness believes has affected her working of the case.  Ms Hendry&#8217;s questions of the social worker illustrated neatly an example of the effect. Ms JB agreed she had reviewed the placement notes and agreed that different professionals had told C that they believed her.  Ms Hendry suggested to the social worker that one consequence of this was that in so doing they are validating her account reinforcing it?  Ms JB saw it as <span style="font-style:italic">continuing to offer her support.</span></p>

Ms JB agreed that if that were the case then that is possible. Listening to her give that answer I had the strong impression that it was the first time she had considered the possibility or anything like it. I found that troubling. She had to accept Ms Hendry&#8217;s next point which follows that it doesn&#8217;t give the child the opportunity to say it wasn&#8217;t true.  </p>

Elsewhere I have considered the grave reservations I hold about the OIC&#8217;s evidence on and approach to this aspect of the case. Those reservations were in no way diminished by hearing Ms JB&#8217;s response that it was possible that C&#8217;s later allegation may &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">weaken&#8217;</span>  her allegation about her brothers. As with the officer it had the flavour not of one who in an open-minded way wanted to get to the truth of the allegation made but of one who wanted to uphold or look to confirm the allegation.  The working together practice of the police and the local authority in cases of suspected or alleged sexual abuse has real value.  In the circumstances of this case however the fact that two key professionals from each of those public bodies took the same flawed approach importing at best a lack of open-mindedness and at worst a confirmatory bias to their thinking means that neither acted as a check or balance or a critical thinker for the other.</p>

From a starting point that he hadn&#8217;t watched any to having found it and watched some heterosexual pornography; man and woman having sexual intercourse is how he put it. He appeared to me to be mortified to be admitting to this and it was my impression that he had thought about -and gone one or two answers along the route of - not admitting it. He was however also clear about the various circumstances in which he had seen pornography. By search on one maybe 2 occasions or by being sent links. The links were he said to homosexual porn, because it was a way of trolling someone there would be no point trolling with straight porn. The point is that it&#8217;s gay (my word not his) pornography. I observe in passing that in 2022 in this young man's life the dismal fact that it&#8217;s gay porn is what makes it the trolling. </p>

I reflected on the fact that he was a young man being trolled by his peers with gay pornography when he explained that he felt out of the crowd with his friends because he had no girlfriend. To convince his peers that he had a girl he saved C&#8217;s number in his phone under the name &#8216;Helene&#8217;. This is something about which he was asked for obvious reasons, careful questions by the local authority. I have considered the possibility that the explanation for this odd behaviour with his sister&#8217;s phone details could be more sinister than that which he gives. What does not fit with that however is that what C alleges is that B assaulted her, not that there was something akin to a blurring of the boundaries of a sibling relationship or grooming which in earlier times might wrongly have been called an incestuous relationship. She alleges a number forced abusive physical assaults.   I have accordingly not found the issue of Helene is one which assists the local authority in proving its case.  </p>

He had little to contribute about his eldest brother&#8217;s role in the family in earlier times or his absence from it now.

There was I thought little if any forensic purpose to the exercise and certainly not forensic purpose that justified the evident distress it caused him. To be clear I do not interpret that distress as indicative of innocence or culpability in relation to the allegations he has abused his sister for not only is there the well-recognised danger in demeanour for that purpose but as it happens the distress could be consistent with either.  To the extent that the fact that he was so upset by seeing those images of the family told me anything it underscored for me that whether his removal from it has been for good reason or not this is a young person whose removal from his family is something which he feels keenly.  It has marked the latter years of his childhood and will mark his life.</p>

His mother he described as kind and caring his father hard working and someone who made him comfortable to be around.  He said flatly that he couldn&#8217;t really remember when he had last seen his mum really it was before he had moved to London.  From his evidence a picture emerged of a household in which his mother was broadly &#8216;in charge&#8217; of matters domestic within the home whilst his father dealt with things outside the home including shopping for groceries. The overall impression I had was that this was in part driven by cultural considerations and in part by the fact that his father had the better command of English.</p>

This extended to C who both when giving his evidence in chief and when cross examined he said had an energy was jumping and dancing in the house and with whom he had thought he got on well. She mostly seemed happy sometimes he thought there might have been times when she came home from school and seemed as though something might have upset her but he had never asked her about it. He had not been especially close, not in the sense that they didn&#8217;t get on, but that B was in more than he was so she would probably be more likely to talk to him. He had not known her to tell what Mr Momtaz described as &#8216;a big lie&#8217; before this.  He said to me that the allegation she had made about him made him feel sad, angry and disappointed. My observation was that he found it hard to put into words what he wanted to say but he explained it in this way: <span style="font-style:italic"> she is my little sister and when I see her say it and do it, it makes me think about it very deep, start crying, question myself and think why is she doing this. </span>By angry he explained that he meant <span style="font-style:italic">not as in I want to shout at her but as in I am disappointed and shocked.

Elsewhere in his evidence he accepted and, in a sense, seemed to regard as normal, the fact that C would be expected to housework and chores with her mother which were not expected of her brothers. when he was asked about the relationship between C and her mother he said that from what he had seen he had thought they had a good relationship and denied seeing any occasion of physical violence like hair pulling. He had however heard his mother what he agreed was &#8216;yelling&#8217; at C he was not sure what it was about as he was upstairs, and he could not remember what the words were, it was just shouting. His evidence was also illuminating as to the extent of the restrictions on her going out which were greater than I had understood from the written evidence. She was allowed to go to school but otherwise if she left the house, it would be in the company of one or both parents. Sometimes she would ask permission to go to the shop alone, but permission was never forthcoming. Rather as with the question of domestic chores, A&#8217;s natural acceptance of what was permitted for C as distinct from her brothers, even allowing for age, was telling. </p>

He denied and was unshaken in cross examination any suggestion that he had touched his sister sexually. Much of the time his denials were given politely and flatly without any noticeable emotion. In two instances however there was a departure from this. The first came when he was asked about a time when suspicions were raised about a contact he had had with his other sisters (during the lifetime of the proceedings)  and with more obvious feeling he responded that when he heard people were suspicious that had been the moment that most made him angry because as far as he was concerned he was just with his little sister and the fact that someone could think that normal things were suspicious made him angry. The second occasion came when Mr Momtaz was asking him fairly and appropriately about the specific ways in which it was alleged by C that he had abused her sexually in another country when he was 9 or 10 and then when he was older and living in the UK.  When he was asked if there had ever been an occasion when he had placed or tried to place his penis in his sister&#8217;s mouth and whether he had said to her <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;i&#8217;m going to come in your mouth&#8217; his</span> emphatic denial was accompanied by a visceral and obvious expression of disgust. </p>

He denied that he had shown pornography to C or that he had been shown pornography by her. He did not in fact know much about her activities on digital media though he did know that she was not allowed snap chat and had on one occasion arrived home when there was what sounds like a row going on about her use of it. He knew that B had deleted, and he knew of at least one occasion when her phone had been confiscated by her mother as a punishment. He agreed with Mr Momtaz that there was little if any communication by text between he and his sister and said they would mostly speak face to face. </p>

He hadn't spoken of the situation with C and when asked by the local authority what he knew if he had regular phone contact with his parents, he said   with a palpable air of sadness that he didn&#8217;t live with them anymore, so he didn&#8217;t know.

On more than one occasion it became obvious that something had been quite literally lost in translation. I recognise that there may have been other occasions when something was lost but not obviously so.  Mostly, though not in respect of the eldest child, I had the impression that they were trying to answer the questions that were put to them. Sometimes the answers where concrete and literal and could not always tell whether this was because of language, or cultural understanding or something else. I was able to observe them listening attentively to the translated evidence of others. They were each mostly contained and reserved as they listened and watched.  I noted that there was obviously distress and anxiety when witnesses spoke of C expressing thoughts of suicide and the mother became markedly upset when listening to a witness relay that C had expressed a sexual attraction to a 19-year-old girl whilst in foster care.  </p>

C&#8217;s diary has been produced and is relied on by the Local Authority to give an insight into C&#8217;s unhappiness. The parents were each asked about those parts in which she had written  out song lyrics seeming to reflect unhappiness or even despair. In particular they were asked about a page on which she had written that she just wanted a life. Neither agreed they had felt she had been unhappy at home. I noted in passing that on the page adjacent to one of those which the parents were being asked about was one on which in listing her preferred parts of the (school) day, C had identified &#8216;hometime&#8217; as the best. This for me reduced somewhat the force of what was being suggested to the parents about C&#8217;s obvious unhappiness. I did however detect in both mother and father a sense that their expectations of C were just that and that the issue of whether she was or was not happy about them was not something that really came up for discussion. </p>

There was a disagreement within the court room about the translation of the word &#8216;forgive&#8217; which was unfortunate. My overall impression is that the father was not being straightforward in his evidence about why he contacted C. Nothing he said in his evidence oral or written makes me think that he has ever thought the allegations she makes about her brothers are true. I do however think that he had hoped that it might be possible to persuade her not to maintain the making of those allegations and to find a way to return the family to the way things had been before they were made. I think it is more likely than not that this lay behind him making contact with C. I am reinforced in that by his unconvincing explanations when asked why he made the calls from outside the home. </p>

Within the written evidence provided to me for reading in advance of this hearing there was relatively scant information about him.  He appeared as a shadowy figure in the lives of his siblings, barely remembered by the older children, unknown to the younger.   At or around the time his parents fled Syria they took steps to get him out of the country and sent him to America. He was aged about 17. It is not surprising that his family in the time preceding the declaration of the Caliphate took steps to distance their near adult son from Syria. Many families did similar. What was curious was that in the years that followed he seems almost to have disappeared from the family despite the fact that in the age of communication over various digital platforms even those who find themselves separated by distance and geopolitical events are able to retain links.  He has been absent in any meaningful sense from his family since about 2011.</p>

In the course of the oral evidence, however, my impression was that it was a far less straightforward issue. </p>

It was from C during these proceedings that those working with the family came to know of the eldest brother&#8217;s existence and only after that did the social worker, understandably, speak to the parents about him in January 2022. What the mother is recorded as saying is that the eldest brother lives in New York, and that she had not seen him for fifteen years, in her written statement she said 14. It is recorded that she told the social worker that he was married with children. What the mother had also said in her statement to the court was that she had no way of contacting him now. The father in his written evidence had given a similar impression of physical and emotional distance saying in his statement that his eldest son had started a new life which was very different to theirs.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I found the Father&#8217;s account of the telephone conversation he had had with his eldest son out of the blue unsatisfactory. On one level his account of the phone call and the way in which he surprised his wife by appearing with the telephone and passing it to her giving her the opportunity to speak to her first-born child for the first time in years seemed authentic accompanied by seemingly congruent emotional affect. The Father described the way that on realising it was the eldest brother his wife started crying, they were both so happy. Yet it was to me wholly incredible when the father told me that his son told him that he had a child &#8211; a first grandchild for these parents &#8211; who had been given her grandmother&#8217;s name and yet he did not mention this to her. Pressed about this by Mr Momtaz he said he had never at any stage told his wife of the existence of a granddaughter who bore her name. By way of explanation, he said he had forgotten to tell her of it. I did not believe him. Since I did not believe him, I thought it fair to tell him as much and to give him the chance to reflect on what he was telling me.  He did not alter or amend what he said. He said to me that it was something that was very affecting at the beginning but that he didn&#8217;t tell his wife and maintained that probably he forgot to tell her about the grandchild. When the mother gave evidence, she too was asked about the eldest brother and said that she did not know if he had any children.  Her evidence cast no light on how or why it was that the eldest brother had come to be so distanced from the family. Nor did she make any clearer what if anything had happened to resume such limited contact with him as had happened in the recent past. She, as well as the father, I did not feel was giving me a frank account about this.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So what am I to make of this? I formed the clear impression that I was not being told the truth, certainly not the whole truth by either parent about the eldest brother. It is not a trivial matter.  This is their first-born son. They are a traditional family. The steps they took to keep him safe and place him beyond the reach of the events following the outbreak of civil war and what followed in Syria speak for themselves as to what he meant to them. Yet still I am given from them explanations for his absence which are nonsense.  There were in relation to the father significant difficulties with the court appointed interpreter who, for reasons it is unnecessary to go into, was not at all a helpful part of the process and had to be replaced. I am however satisfied that whatever else I might have regarded as being lost in translation in his evidence, here the issue was not want of understanding but want of truth.  It was perplexing to me that the seemingly genuine emotion with which each parent told me of the telephone conversation with him did not fit with the impression of distance given by their other evidence.  Mr Momtaz for the Local Authority says that it is relevant because the eldest brother is a sibling who has become ostracised by the family for living a life that the parents disapprove of and that is something that mirrors their current approach to C.  Ms Lakin for the Guardian submits that this aspect of the evidence (as to which she submits the parents were not telling the truth) impacts overall on their credibility and whether they are prepared to tell the truth as to what was truly occurring within the family home with regard to C. She goes on to acknowledge that this does not prove the allegations in and of itself. </p>

Such evidence as I have is just as consistent with the eldest brother choosing to remove himself from close contact with his family.

I have been careful not impermissibly to speculate myself, but I note of course that when I look at the application of the Lucas direction, the motivation for the lies the parents have told me about the eldest brother that too is as consistent with his distancing himself as it is with his parents ostracising him.

Remaining with the inconsistent accounts of penetration whether by fingers or hand: neither account is one which in the way that she describes it gives any sort of experiential detail to accompany it.

Adding then the fact that what is described is not accompanied by experiential detail of pain, or taste, or smell, or sound or discomfort or mess, or bleeding or for that matter pleasure but most significantly of anything that you can&#8217;t get from seeing it or talking about it online rather than experiencing it diminishes yet further.  </p>

I suspect it is still to be expected that she might have if it happened, but I do not ultimately rely on the fact that she did not as a factor  which has helped me to form a view of the allegations.  I have not overlooked that if the submission made by Ms Lakin i.e., that as to credibility here is a mother prepared to lie on oath is taken to its logical conclusion it is just possible that she might not say even if she saw something. So it is that in assessing the mother I must factor in that this might be a mother who knew that her sons were sexually abusing her daughter and is covering up for them. I did not assess her as lying about that in her evidence, the more so when I reflect on that evidence, I heard from her about the eldest brother when I did think she was lying.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have  heard evidence and received submissions at this hearing about what might motivate C to make allegations which are not true. In a sense it is territory into which it is unnecessary to tread far since my task is to determine whether the local authority has satisfied me that the allegations are made out on the balance of probabilities. A component of that determination is however to consider what might be that motivation  as part of my overall assessment of the evidence. To that extent therefore it is territory into which I step.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is more likely than not that C felt restricted by the rules imposed by her parents on her and that she wanted more freedom. I accept the evidence from the foster carer that C told her she had done her research on foster care and as she expressed it knew what it was all about.  I accept also the foster carer&#8217;s own impression that she liked going to parks after school and hanging out with friends which was something she said her parents would not allow.   Linked to this  there is at least some evidence that C was interested in and saw some opportunities for material gain &#8211; a striking example being the very expensive gift of an Anime book which she wanted and the foster carer gave her as a farewell present and there are indications in the papers that she yearned for a wealthier life but I am not convinced that this aspect was operating on her mind before she left the family home in the same way as the desire for freedom. Material gain it seems to me was an opportunity once she was in care rather than a likely motivation to make allegations. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence of her desire for more freedom is wider and more nuanced as it emerged than simply not being allowed out alone. Although I have been careful not to speculate impermissibly I note that there are indications in the digital media and from her expression of a same sex attraction to the foster carers  19 year old daughter of  at least the possibility that C is experiencing a development in her own sexuality. The strength of her mothers distress which I observed in court when this aspect featured in the evidence gave me at least an insight into how C might have anticipated that to be received within her home.  More prosaically there is ample evidence of the way in which it is more likely than not that she felt unfairly treated in comparison with her brothers. It is of note that even and although the receipt of the complaints from the morning of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> is something which gives cause for concern, one of the very first things that H is reported as saying is that the parents treat C differently to her brothers. Which may give a sense of its prominence in what C complained of.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Underpinning all of this, whilst not  properly to be described as a motivation for the allegations is the fact that C is on any view a young person with complex mental health and emotional functioning profile. I  bear in mind the picture that emerged of her from the unit manager.  Ultimately it is likely that the expertise to know, if it can be known, why C has made allegations which I have not found proven, lies outside the courtroom.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The findings in relation to the treatment of C within the home are less straightforward. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that she was treated differently from her brothers within the home and that she perceived herself to be differently treated in a way which felt to her unfair. One must tread carefully through the cultural  landscape of others and I have reflected with some care on the fact that this aspect of the case is one in which the cultural mores of the family provide the context within which C, as the eldest girl, is treated in a way which may be unremarkable in an observant Muslim family with its roots elsewhere whereas it would be a cause for real criticism were she a girl in a white British secular family. I have found in this respect that the evidence of her brothers has weighed more heavily than other evidence. Each of them appeared to recognise that she was indeed given less freedom and expected to undertake more domestically than they were. Each of them seemed interestingly to think that there was nothing remarkable about that. I have reached the conclusion that C was treated differently from her brothers, and that as part of that she was allowed much less freedom &#8211; by way of example only A who albeit older was out of the house playing sport and could come and go pretty much as he pleased whereas she was not allowed even to go to the shop unaccompanied.  This I accept she felt keenly.  The material which has been produced at this hearing of C&#8217;s digital life online reinforces my view that the restrictions and the traditional values within which she was expected to live at home are likely to have been experienced by her as oppressive. To the extent that I make that finding however, it is therefore within the context of the culture within which the family lived. Findings are not sought for no purpose. They are sought in satisfaction of the threshold. I am not on the evidence before me persuaded that this finding which I make is one which satisfied me that by reason of it C has suffered or was at risk of suffering significant harm attributable in the way the statute requires to the care afforded to her by her parents. Nor has the local authority satisfied me that this finding establishes the risk in relation to her other siblings. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence of physical abuse at the hands of her mother at this hearing has been scant. I do not accept that the local authority has discharged the burden of proof and that it is more likely than not that the allegations of hair pulling and hitting are true. I do not repeat the observations I have already made in respect of the unsatisfactory approach to the interviews by the police but note that amongst the more egregious examples of leading and contaminating questioning already considered are those which relate to these allegations. The corroboration such as it was to be found in A&#8217;s evidence as to &#8216;yelling&#8217; was of a  pretty low level one off occasion.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I take a different view about the emotional abuse which flows from C&#8217;s exposure to toxic, corrosive, and harmful material in the digital world.  In her otherwise persuasive submissions Ms Meyer KC asks rhetorically this: <span style="font-style:italic"> is a parent's inability to follow or keep up with internet or social media use of their children a parental failing warranting statutory intervention. </span>Later comes this <span style="font-style:italic">the court will need to exercise caution that it is not exacting an unachievable standard of perfection that many if not most parents may fall below or requiring a level of control and scrutiny that may itself verge on inappropriate parenting. </span> I do not accept what is implicit in those questions that these parents could not and should not have been expended to in their parenting afford to C care which would have prevented her, as I find that she has, suffering emotional harm from that which she experienced online. She was not a late teenager otherwise living an independent life out and about. She was 12 or 13. Furthermore these were parents who, as I have observed, were not at all reticent about imposing on her restrictions which they felt were appropriate to her age her gender and the cultural expectations of her. The Mother was as I accept from the evidence at least to a degree anxious to restrict her daughter's use of the phone because as became clear from her oral evidence she thought it had the potential to be dangerous to her. She is right about that. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Meyer&#8217;s superficially more attractive submission is whether the social work and police lack of awareness or naivete in respect of for example Anime and its nature and content should give me pause for thought in considering whether C&#8217;s parents should have protected her. That the police and social work evidence on this was woeful does not as I see it mean that I should not make the finding in respect of the parents. I find that in this respect C suffered emotional harm in the care of her parents. It is not a makeweight finding. For what follows from it is this. C has suffered in this respect emotional harm in the care of her parents. Her younger sisters &#8211; as to whom there is no evidence of such exposure to digital material &#8211; are at risk of harm if the parents do not take a different approach. </p>

In respect of him however first and most importantly the evidence I have heard of what he saw and had access to online is of a wholly different character than that which I have seen  in relation to C. Furthermore he is and was older and far less under the control and supervision of his parents at the time. Additionally the submission which is made by Ms Meyer and supported by Ms Hendry that it is not clear what evidence is relied on by the local authority to assert that he had developed inappropriate sexual knowledge is one I accept.</p>
