He sought asylum on arrival.  Rachelle came here in November 1997 having previously lived with her mother and her maternal family.  Both she and Mr N had been granted exceptional leave to remain in the UK.  This expired on 23 September 2005.</p>

He originally said that she had died.  He produced a death certificate dated 26 April 1994 in the name of Mrs Charlotte Batuna.  He had previously told the Home Office that Rachelle&#8217;s mother had died on 26 June 1997.</p>

At that time her teachers reported to the local authority, the Luton Borough Council, the marks that they had seen on her.  Mr N made certain admissions and was cautioned by the police.  Care proceedings were begun.  Rachelle went into foster care.  She has remained there and does not wish to return to Mr N&#8217;s care.</p>

The issue was whether I should give the local authority leave to discontinue their application for a care order.  On that occasion I adjourned the application and directed that Mr N was to submit to DNA testing to establish his paternity or otherwise.  I continued &#8211;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Bailey appeared on behalf of the local authority, Miss Graves on behalf of Mr N, and Mr Braithwaite on behalf of the Guardian.  In the event I was asked to decide firstly whether Rachelle was 13 years of age as Mr N claimed or whether she was 17 years of age.  This was the case on behalf of the local authority and the Guardian based on the report of Dr Colin Michie of September 2005.  He is a Paediatric Consultant and a senior lecturer in paediatrics.  He concluded that her date of birth was not 1992 but 1988.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There had by this time been 2 letters from Mrs Penelombe, Head of Urban and Social Affairs in the Congo.  She had made investigations there.  She says that she met Rachelle&#8217;s mother who said that Mr N is not her father but her maternal uncle.  She has another daughter Rachelle so it would seem unlikely that Rachelle, the subject of these proceedings, is called by her correct name.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appalling position in which Rachelle is placed at the present time has left Mr N wholly unmoved.  For the first time she learns that there is evidence that she is not 13 years of age but 17.  The person whom she treated as her father may well not be her father and her name may not be that she was originally given by her family.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The most that Mr N has been able to say about the plight in which his conduct has placed Rachelle is this.  To have his word challenged about her age or for him to have to undergo DNA testing is disrespectful to him.  He is wholly indifferent to her wishes not to live with him because he regards it as his responsibility and the court should not listen to what a child wants.</p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Braithwaite for the Guardian said at the conclusion of the hearing that Mr N&#8217;s approach was so unremittingly selfish that it beggared belief.  He should be ashamed of himself.  I find it difficult to disagree with those sentiments, especially when he had heard Rachelle describing with affection living with her foster mother and her daughter.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the event having read the report of Dr Michie which the father did not wish to contest by way of cross-examination, I pronounced that I was satisfied that Rachelle was 17 years of age.  That meant the local authority had to apply for the care order in respect of her to be discharged.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">They were however helpfully prepared for that application to be adjourned last July so that the Guardian could seek to obtain more details about Rachelle&#8217;s background in the Democratic Republic of Congo which would otherwise not have been possible.  Furthermore the local authority and the Guardian had considered the support that Rachelle would need in the event that I made such a finding about her age.  A valuable series of agreements were made and recorded in writing covering the support that she will need.</p>

The first time he hit her was for banging doors.  He hit her across the face with his hands causing her nose to bleed.  His former partner Solange was there.

Mr N stopped showing any interest in her or her homework.  She had felt like a prisoner because she spent most of the time in the living room.

They set out good reasons why they were concerned that Rachelle should be found to be older that she presently believes herself to be.  I am satisfied that, important though these grounds are, there is a greater importance to Rachelle in discovering the truth about some of her background.  It is, as I have said, an appalling reflection on Mr N that she is now in doubt about her age, her name, and who her mother and father are.</p>

As far as I can see these injuries represent at least 18 separate blows.  Rachelle&#8217;s version of how these events occurred is entirely compatible with a clinical findings.  I am unable to think of any way in which these injuries can be accounted for by accidental means and I am therefore forced to the conclusion that they were inflicted by a third party.&#8221;</p>
