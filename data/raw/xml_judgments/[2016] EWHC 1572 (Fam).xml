I have now given final judgment in eleven cases (Cases A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and N). This is Case M. Three further cases (Cases K, L and O) are currently awaiting final hearing. There are at least five others (Cases P, Q, R, S and T) pending. There are probably others, for the HFEA has identified no fewer than 90 cases where there are &#8220;anomalies&#8221;.  </p>

Although in some of the previous cases I have dealt with there has been a report of the child&#8217;s guardian, I decided that in this case, given the nature of the issues (see below) and given that the principles are now well established, there was no need either to join the child or to appoint a guardian.  </p>

The second is whether, assuming it is, the Form IC has that effect notwithstanding the subsequent coming into force of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>.

For present purposes, there are two things to be noted. The first (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>) is that X signed a declaration in the following terms:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I am not married to [Y], but acknowledge that she and I are being treated together, and that I will become the legal father of any resulting child.&#8221;</p>

	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(1)</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>) is that nowhere in the Form IC did Y state in terms that she consented to X being treated as the father of the child. I can take the matter very shortly. For the reasons I set out in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, paras 52-53, I am satisfied that the Form IC signed by X and Y is, as a matter of content and construction, apt to operate both as a Form PP and as a Form WP, complying with the requirements of both <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(1)</ref>(a) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(1)</ref>(b).</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Case I</span>, paras 17-20, I concluded that it makes no difference for this purpose that the Form IC was completed and signed before <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> came into effect, or that the objective at the time it was signed was to comply with the requirements of the regime under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>, rather than the new regime under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. It follows, in my judgment, that the Form IC completed and signed in March 2009 continued to operate as valid and effective consent for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>, notwithstanding the change in the statutory regime which occurred on 6 April 2009.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When told by the clinic of the mistake which had been made, X and Y were very hurt and bewildered, very worried. It took them some time to understand the full implications of what they had been told. But in contrast to the clinics in some of the other cases, the clinic here has behaved throughout in an appropriately supportive and responsible manner. X and Y were first told about the problem in February 2015. Following my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A </span>in September 2015, the clinic contacted X and Y again, telling them about the judgment, advising them to obtain legal advice and, crucially, telling them that the clinic would fund their legal fees. As X says, &#8220;This was a huge relief for us as we simply do not have the money to pay the costs ourselves.&#8221; In her position statement, Ms Grogan stated that &#8220;The Trust apologises again for the mistakes made by the clinic and the distress and anguish that this has caused.&#8221; Very properly, Ms Grogan repeated that apology in X&#8217;s presence and hearing as she began her oral submissions. She reiterated the clinic&#8217;s agreement to pay X&#8217;s costs.</p>
