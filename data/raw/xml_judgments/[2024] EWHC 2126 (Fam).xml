	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This application has been determined on the papers as there is no opposition to the order sought. I have read a position statement and case summary on behalf of the Applicants as well as a chronology and draft order. I have also considered other assorted documents including a witness statement from S as well as one from Ms Campbell from The Evewell Harley Street, a gynaecology and fertility clinic in London (&#8220;the Clinic&#8221;).</p>

I observe that the Clinic has apologised to S and T and agreed to pay the legal costs of this application. That is, if I may say so, entirely right and proper given the factual background. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> S and T met in 2012 and have lived together since September 2015. They always intended to have a family together and decided to start the process in 2019. S and T hoped to have more than one child, each having treatment and carrying a child if possible. After discussing treatment with their GP and visiting a number of different IVF clinics, they decided to pursue treatment at the Clinic.  The couple purchased six vials of donor sperm with the intention that this would be sufficient for both of them to have treatment and for their children to be genetically related.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">S and T first attended the Clinic in December 2019 and spoke with a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist. It was agreed that S would undergo a natural cycle of intrauterine insemination using donor sperm. The doctor&#8217;s note indicated that she discussed counselling and consent forms which needed to be signed. A follow-up letter sent to the couple also made reference to the need to sign consent forms. They were also sent information leaflets on the process, all of which included sections on legal parenthood to a greater or lesser extent. About a fortnight after the first appointment, S and T attended a nurse consultation at the Clinic, during which they each completed a number of pro forma consent forms published by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (&#8220;the HFEA&#8221;) and internal forms produced by the Clinic.  S provided her consent to undergo fertility treatment using donor sperm, naming T as her partner. T similarly completed consent forms, naming S as the patient and consenting to the proposed treatment. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notably for the purpose of this application, the couple completed pro forma HFEA consent to legal parenthood forms for this first treatment cycle. Thus, S completed a pro forma HFEA WP form called <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Your consent to your partner being the legal parent&#8221;</span>, naming T as her partner and consenting to T being the legal parent of any child born as a result of her treatment. T completed a pro forma HFEA PP form called <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Your consent to being the legal parent&#8221;</span>, naming S as her partner and consenting to being the legal parent of any child born from S's treatment and consenting to being posthumously registered as legal parent. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The couple attended an online counselling appointment with a counsellor in mid-January 2020. The report of that session confirmed that its purpose was to discuss the ethical, legal and social implications of using donor sperm in treatment and that it specifically included a discussion of the legal implications of treatment and legal parenthood. Happily, S&#8217;s treatment was successful and she gave birth to a baby girl in March 2021.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2022, the couple contacted the Clinic via email to enquire about having a second treatment cycle. In July 2022, they attended for a consultation with a consultant gynaecologist and fertility expert who understood that the couple were seeking treatment together. There were no notes of the consultation but there was a follow-up letter. It was agreed that T would have treatment with sibling sperm as both she and S had intended and this was recorded in the treatment plan.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A nurse consultation took place in early September 2022 prior to which S and T had been provided with an updated version of the General Patient Information sheet and a Patient Information leaflet. Following the consultation, the nurse wrote to S and T to confirm their discussion. The letter stated that the couple had been sent the necessary consents via an electronic platform and were advised to check their junk mail in case these documents had gone into the spam folder. T was told to complete the consent first and then this would be sent to S to complete. T was also spoken to by an embryologist on the same day as the nurse consultation and the note of the discussion included discussion of the intrauterine insemination process.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The couple completed and signed a number of additional consent forms prior to the second cycle, including pro forma HFEA forms and internal Clinic forms. These included consent to treatment forms naming T as the patient and S as her partner.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">T underwent an intrauterine insemination cycle using door sperm in mid-October 2022. This was successful and a baby boy, K, was born in June 2023. His birth was registered and both S and T were registered as his parents on the birth certificate. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In January 2023, the Clinic conducted a routine audit of legal parenthood consent forms and identified that, although the couple had correctly completed pro forma HFEA WP and PP forms for the purpose of their first treatment cycle when S was the intended birth mother, there were no WP or PP forms in their medical records for the second treatment cycle where T was the intended birth mother. </p>

	    <num>13.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is possible that the couple did complete further WP and PP forms and these were subsequently misplaced. However, the Clinic&#8217;s evidence is that it is more likely that they were not asked to complete new forms. Either way, S wishes to apply for a declaration of parentage in respect of  K with T&#8217;s full support.</p>

In that case, Mr Justice Poole found that, on the balance of probabilities, the WP and PP had in fact been completed was subsequently mislaid.

It is fair to note that the documentation does not spell out consent to legal parenthood explicitly, but I&#8217;m satisfied that, taken together, that is the effect of the seven documents.&#8221;</span></p>

It was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that the court could rely upon other available evidence to satisfy the legal parenthood requirements of the 2008 Act. Referring to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A &amp; B v Bourn Hall Clinic</span> above, Mrs Justice Theis found that the combination of the properly completed HFEA WP form by the patient, together with various other internal consent forms completed by the patient&#8217;s partner (which were all in writing and signed by him prior to treatment), were sufficient to satisfy the notice requirements of the 2008 Act.</p>

There is no reference to timing, other than requiring them to be in writing and signed before the treatment took place. The legislation puts the emphasis on the written consent, which is ultimately determinative. The undisputed evidence in this case is that such consents were in place prior to the treatment taking place, they were in writing and signed. The provisions of ss 43 and 44 required no more.

Y and Z completed the HFEA WP and PP forms for their initial treatment cycles at Complete Fertility with Y as the patient and Z as her partner. After a number of unsuccessful cycles, it was decided to transfer the next embryo to Z, but the clinic did not asked the couple to complete new WP and PP forms to reflect this change. Mrs Justice Theis found that the court could look at the evidence as a whole to determine what the applicants were consenting to, and documents other than the WP and PP forms could constitute a valid notice for the purposes of the 2008 Act. She further found that the court could accept WP and PP forms signed at an earlier stage as valid in future treatment cycles, enabling the court to rely upon the WP and PP forms signed for the initial transfer to Y as authority for the subsequent transfer to Z, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230; notwithstanding the lapse of time or change of treatment plan&#8221;</span> (paragraph 19).

These forms had not expired and thus could be deemed to apply to the second cycle of treatment.
