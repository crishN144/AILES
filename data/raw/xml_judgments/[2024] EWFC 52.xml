X had alleged to police that her brother-in-law had sexually abused her by touching her over her clothes.  She stated that &#8220;this is what happens&#8221; in the family home. X also said that she had been sexually assaulted by her paternal grandfather in the family home and that the last incident was about a month ago. X said that she was worried about her family being made aware of her allegations and feared negative consequences. Due to worries about her self-harming and having suicidal thoughts, X was taken to hospital.  X remained in hospital between 4 December 2023 and 8 December 2023.  </p>

Following the initial allegations, X further alleged that, historically, she had been raped by her brother in the family home but that his assaults had now stopped.  The police then arrested her brother and imposed the same bail conditions as imposed on X&#8217;s brother-in-law and paternal grandfather not to have contact with X or unsupervised contact with anyone under 18.</p>

The MASH Team spoke to X&#8217;s sister, Y, about these concerns, and Y sated she had told the mother about these matters.  Subsequently, X stated to her teacher at school that nothing had changed at home and that her mother was more worried about getting into trouble. X stated that her mother told her to tell the school that she was joking about the comments she made regarding her brother-in-law touching her inappropriately.

Y alleged that since she could remember, up until she was 13 years old, her paternal grandfather had sexually abused her. Y stated that her paternal grandfather would touch her inappropriately, watch her shower and make her watch adult pornography when he would babysit her. Y further alleged that her paternal grandfather had made her translate messages on an inappropriate web chat, and had touched her on numerous occasions from a young age up until the age of 13.  When the Children&#8217;s Guardian later asked X about this allegation in the context of these proceedings, X stated that she had told her parents but they said to &#8220;leave it&#8221; because of the family&#8217;s reputation.</p>

I do not know where this has come from. I can only think that maybe it is about what Y said about him in the past. She was roughly around X&#8217;s age at the time. There was an occasion when Y told us that he was not a good person. This is all that she said despite us repeatedly pushing her to tell us why. It was a long time ago now and there has not been anything else said by her or any other children or family members about the paternal grandfather.&#8221;</p>

The parents chose to prioritise the care of the brother and agreed to X residing with a friend of the family for a short time.  In her statement, the social worker stated that the mother and the father appeared far more worried and shocked at the possibility of X&#8217;s brother not returning home than the allegations that X had made of sexual abuse.  The parents contend that their prioritisation of X&#8217;s brother&#8217;s care reflects their concern about his particular vulnerabilities and not a minimising of X&#8217;s allegations.</p>

It appears X is viewed as a child who is rebellious, has bad behaviour and habits, and whose statements should be doubted as they believe it is likely to be as a result of her mental health needs.&#8221;</p>

It appears the family have prioritised maintaining a positive reputation in their family, and wider community, by avoiding the "shame" they fear will come with disclosing sexual abuse within the family. It appears that parents and family members have placed their reputation and cultural family dynamics over children's safety, and this has enabled sexual abuse to happen in the family over many years. This attitude and perspective from X&#8217;s parents seems to have influenced X&#8217;s siblings too, as Y stated that she is embarrassed and feels bad that she did not speak out about the sexual abuse from paternal grandfather sooner, and felt that the implication of shame on the family over the subject stopped her from doing so. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the decision that the mother should care for X in an Airbnb, the Operations Director suggested during the course of her evidence that the interim care plan had now formally changed, the local authority having taken a reasoned decision that the mother would now care for X in the interim.  The Operations Director&#8217;s further stated that a revised interim care plan was now in the process of being completed.  However, the Position Statement of the local authority for the hearing on 5 March 2024 was clear that the local authority&#8217;s position, as approved by the Head of Service, was that X would be cared for in an Airbnb whilst the Local Authority continued its search for a foster placement for her.  At the outset of this hearing, counsel for the local authority did not suggest that position had changed and nor had the other parties been put on notice of any change of position.  In these circumstances, and at the conclusion of the Operations Director&#8217;s evidence, I invited counsel for the local authority to take instructions from the social worker regarding the interim care plan.  The social worker instructed counsel that she had not been made aware of any change to the interim care plan and had not been instructed to draft a revised interim care plan.  As I have noted, ahead of this hearing the local authority had not provided any amended care plan, any revised risk assessment, any safety agreement, any visiting matrix or any con&#64257;rmation that the relevant regulations had been complied with.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian had not been consulted about a change of interim care plan. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to the mother&#8217;s ability to protect X in light of the matters set out above, the Operations Director also sought to rely on what she contended was a robust risk assessment that preceded the decision to place X in her mother&#8217;s care.  Beyond that however, the Operations Director repeatedly descended into vague generalities regarding, by way of example, families &#8220;going on a journey in respect of disclosures&#8221; (the Operations Director appeared to be unaware of the long standing convention regarding the proper description of allegations of sexual abuse prior to any conviction or findings of fact dating back to the Cleveland Report).  The Operations Director was not able to articulate beyond such vague assertions what specific forensic factors had caused the local authority now to conclude that the mother was capable now of protecting X against the risk of sexual abuse, save to repeat that X&#8217;s behaviour had improved since being in the care of her mother.  The Operations Director was prepared to provide her definitive conclusions regarding the mother&#8217;s ability to protect notwithstanding that she had not had sight of the statement of the mother dated 16 February 2024, in which the mother repeatedly references her view that the allegations made by X must be viewed through the prism of X&#8217;s mental health.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The purported risk assessment deals only in the most cursory manner with the allegations of sexual abuse, with a brief summary of the allegations that misses out any account of X&#8217;s recent allegations against the paternal grandfather.  In particular, the superficial and incomplete narrative account set out in the purported risk assessment does not deal with the precise nature and extent of the allegations made by X and makes no reference to the views expressed by the mother concerning the source and credibility of those allegations.   The narrative makes no reference at all to the fact that on 31 January 2024 the court was satisfied, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/38/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.38(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, that there were reasonable grounds for believing that X had suffered significant harm, that the allocated social worker and the Children&#8217;s Guardian were each of the view that the parents were not able to protect X from a risk of sexual abuse, that in those circumstances the local authority had sought the removal of X from the care of her parents or that there was an ongoing police investigation following the arrest of the X&#8217;s brother, brother-in-law and paternal grandfather.  Both parents informed the social worker that they have longstanding mental health issues, the mother suffering from chronic depression and anxiety and the father having severe anxiety, panic attacks, hallucinations and paranoia.  These are not dealt with.  The hurried and inadequate narrative is followed by a series of tick boxes that have themselves been inaccurately completed.  Finally, the purported risk assessment that the Head of Service and the Operations Director advanced as the forensic foundation of their conclusion that the mother is now able to protect X from the risk of sexual abuse in the interim contains no analysis whatsoever of the nature and degree of the risk of sexual harm to X or of the extent of the mother&#8217;s ability to protect from risk of sexual harm in light of the evidence available. The risk assessment does not deal at all with X&#8217;s allegations of physical abuse against her family members, including the mother.  In the foregoing context, the conclusion of the risk assessment is limited to the following, grammatically incorrect, observation:</p>

The local authority dd not appear to have considered the question of whether the arrangements for the mother to care for X impacted on the ongoing police investigation in light of the statements previously made by X.  In this context, I note that when the Children&#8217;s Guardian last spoke to X, X stated that she is no longer sure whether she was sexually abused by her brother.</p>

For my part, I would view the two decisions as seeking to make essentially the same point, though the tone in Re W is markedly more imperative. I particularly refer to the observations that it is not open to a local authority within proceedings to decline to accept the court's evaluation of risk [81] and that a local authority cannot refuse to provide lawful and reasonable services that would be necessary to support the court's decision [83]. I would agree with these propositions to the extent that the court's assessment of risk is sovereign within proceedings and that a local authority cannot refuse to provide a service if by doing so it would unlawfully breach the rights of the family concerned or if its decision-making process is unlawful on public law grounds. However, the family court cannot dictate to the local authority what its care plan is to be, any more than it can dictate to any other party what their case should be. What the court can, however, expect from a local authority is a high level of respect for its assessments of risk and welfare, leading in almost every case to those assessments being put into effect. For, as has been said before, any local authority that refused to act upon the court's assessments would face an obvious risk of its underlying decisions being declared to be unlawful through judicial review. That must particularly be so where decisions fail to take account of the court's assessments. Or where, as in this case, there is an impasse, there may have to be an appeal. But in the end, experience shows that the process of mutual respect spoken of by Thorpe LJ will almost inevitably lead to an acceptable outcome.</p>

I cannot agree with the submission made on the behalf of the guardian &#8211; "some judges might have pursued the matter further with the agency decision maker, but this judge cannot be said to have been wrong not to do so." As Lord Justice McFarlane remarked during argument, that amounts to a lottery, depending upon the inclinations of one judge as against another. The obligation upon the court is not merely to make its assessment, but to see it through. That is a matter of principle, and not one of individual judicial inclination.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 31 January 2024, and on the application of the local authority, the court reached a clear conclusion in these proceedings with respect to the risk of harm and with respect to the best interests of X consequent upon that assessment of risk.  In this case, the court decided that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the circumstances with respect to X are as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 31(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

However, it does mean that the court is satisfied on the evidence that there are reasonable grounds for believing that X has suffered or is at risk of suffering significant sexual and physical harm and that harm or likelihood of harm is attributable to the care given to her or likely to be given to her by her mother and father.  </p>

The court&#8217;s welfare assessment was based on the clear evidence that the local authority placed before the court indicating that the mother was not capable of protecting X from a risk of physical and sexual abuse.  Within that context, the court approved an interim care plan removing X from the care of her parents on the basis that the local authority would implement that interim care plan.</p>

The evidence of the Head of Service and the Operations Director simply ignored these matters notwithstanding that the local authority itself instigated these proceedings, led evidence in the proceedings which indicated that the mother was not able to protect X from the risk of physical and sexual abuse and requested that the court approve an interim care plan of removal.  </p>

As I have noted, the document deals only in the most cursory manner with the allegations of sexual abuse, the superficial and incomplete narrative account failing to deal with the precise nature and extent of the allegations made.  As already noted, the purported risk assessment contains no mention of the court&#8217;s decision that there were reasonable grounds for believing that X had suffered significant harm on the basis, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, that the parents were not able to protect X from a risk of sexual abuse or the ongoing police investigation.  There is no analysis whatsoever of the nature and degree of the risk of sexual harm to X or the extent of the mother&#8217;s ability to protect from risk of sexual harm in light of the evidence available.  The document does not deal at all with X&#8217;s allegations of physical abuse against her family members, including the mother.  Most fundamentally, in circumstances where the Head of Service and the Operations Director contend the document evidences change on the part of the mother to the extent that she is now able to protect X, there is no reference to the views expressed by the mother central to any assessment of her capacity to protect.  Within that context, and in particular, there is no record of the mother acknowledging the concerns regarding sexual and physical abuse arising from X&#8217;s allegations, of accepting responsibility for what X alleged she experienced in the family home, of understanding the impact on X, of a recognition of the need to change or of a commitment to change.</p>

Robust risk assessment in the context of alleged sexual abuse is not derived from vague assertions about families &#8220;going on a journey with respect to disclosures of sexual abuse&#8221;.  It is derived from the careful, detailed, evidence based social work practice that is articulated in, and has been repeatedly emphasised since, the Cleveland Report and which I summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (Sexual Abuse: Finding of Fact Hearing) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2019/27" uk:canonical="[2019] EWFC 27" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWFC 27</ref> at [599].

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The decision of the Head of Service and the Operations Director to place X in the care of her mother in an Airbnb, also has no forensic foundation in any other evidence.  Before deciding to place X in the care of her mother in an Airbnb, r.17 of the Regulation 17 of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010 required the local authority to assess the suitability of mother to care for X, including the suitability of the proposed Airbnb accommodation, taking into account the matters set out in Schedule 3 of the Regulations.  The matters defined in Schedule 3 include the mother&#8217;s ability to protect X adequately from harm or danger, including from any person who presents a risk of harm to X, and to ensure that the home environment is safe for X.  Whilst the Head of Service asserted that approval for the placement of X with her mother pursuant to r.17 of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010 had been given, neither the Head of Service and the Operations Director were able to provide the court with any documentary evidence of this decision having been considered, taken and recorded.</p>

However, once again, neither the Head of Service nor the Operation Director was able to provide the court with an amended interim care plan with respect to X.  Indeed, the care plan for X appeared to evolve during the course of the evidence, and in particular the evidence of the Operations Director.  As I have noted, as at 5 March 2024 the local authority&#8217;s position was that it would continue its search for a foster placement for X.  At the outset of this hearing, counsel for the local authority did not suggest that position had changed and nor had the other parties been put on notice of any change of position.  The social worker appeared completely unaware that the interim care plan had changed and the fact that, on the Operations Director&#8217;s evidence, she should have been drafting a new care plan. Whilst the Operations Director stated during her evidence that the interim care plan had changed from foster care to placement with the mother as the result of a considered discussion and between her and the Head of Service, I regret that I was left with the distinct impression that the Operations Director had revised the interim care plan during the course of her evidence in order to give the appearance of rationality to a decision making process that had in fact driven by a shortage of resources. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, it appeared that the sole argument advanced by the Head of Service and the Operations Director to support their assertion that the mother was now able to protect X from the risk of sexual and physical abuse centred on the improvement in X&#8217;s behaviour, and thus to depart from the risk and welfare assessments of the court, was that X&#8217;s behaviour had improved in the care of her mother.  In this respect, the Head of Service and the Operations Director each argued that this improvement in behaviour was evidence of the mother&#8217;s capacity to protect X from sexual and physical abuse to a greater degree than was the case when the local authority sought the removal of X from her mother&#8217;s care.  There are obvious difficulties with that contention.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no robust assessment demonstrating that the genesis of X&#8217;s improved behaviour <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> the result of any improved capacity on the part of the mother to protect her from sexual and physical harm as opposed to, for example, the fact that X is simply happier in the care of her mother than in foster care.  In this context, time and again the Head of Service and the Operations Director mistakenly conflated improvements in X&#8217;s behaviour, which have not yet been the subject of formal assessment and may derive from any number of factors, with a reduction in the risk of harm arising from the allegations made by X that, whilst in the care of the mother and the father, she was subjected to sexual abuse by three relatives over the course of at least five years, including repeated rapes.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the noted change in X&#8217;s behaviour over a short period of time is not a sufficient foundation to depart from the risk and welfare assessments of the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Alleged sexual abuse is a complex and grave safeguarding issue that demands a careful and precise forensic approach to evidence based risk assessment.  The casual and cavalier approach adopted by the local authority to risk assessment and decision making for X in this case is the antithesis of the correct approach and one which manifestly fails to safeguard X.  On 31 January 2024, this court assessed X to be at risk of sexual and physical abuse and assessed the mother and the father as being unable to protect X from that risk.  In that context, the court further assessed X&#8217;s welfare as requiring the removal from her parents&#8217; care.  The local authority has to date placed nothing before the court that justifies those conclusions being revisited.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the foregoing circumstances, it is the expectation of this court that the local authority will accord the highest respect to the risk assessment and welfare assessment of this court and will now implement the decision made by the court in these proceedings consequent on its assessment of risk and welfare on 31 January 2024.  I shall list the matter for further hearing on 14 March 2024 before Arbuthnot J for the local authority to confirm to the court that this is the course of action that it now intends to take or to seek to persuade the court on proper evidence that the court should now revisit its risk and welfare assessments.  I will make further directions accordingly.</p>
