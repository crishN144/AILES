He had been preparing to travel back to Libya on 7 October 2023 to attend the wedding of his brother-in-law (postponed from July) when four police officers attended his home, served him with the FMPO and confiscated his passport. He was hurt and offended by this and missing the wedding which the family were all looking forward to. He states that when he and MP were ordered to facilitate PP&#8217;s return to the UK, he arranged her tickets and booked her flight from Libya to Tunisia and encouraged her to return, but she chose to remain in Libya.  He was deeply offended by the suggestion that he would force PP into marriage which was contrary to the teachings of Islam.  He describes the order made against him as &#8220;totally baseless and false&#8221;.</span></p>

Further, PP had not received any of the paperwork relevant to the application.  District Judge Bell directed that a full bundle would need to be provided, including the relevant papers before a substantive case management could take place.

This does not mean that a court has to consider the point afresh each time it exercises its discretion in, for example, a case where a local authority loses a licensing appeal or every time the magistrates dismiss an application brought by the police.

The Children Act 1989 imposes duties on the local authority in respect of the care of children. If the local authority receives information that a child has been subjected to or is likely to be subjected to serious harm it has a duty to investigate the report and, where there are reasonable grounds for believing that it may be well founded, to instigate care proceedings. In this respect the role of a local authority has much in common with the role of a prosecuting authority in criminal proceedings. It is for the court, and not the local authority, to decide whether the allegations are well founded. It is a serious misfortune to be the subject of unjustified allegations in relation to misconduct to a child, but where it is reasonable that these should be investigated by a court, justice does not demand that the local authority responsible for placing the allegations before the court should ultimately be responsible for the legal costs of the person against whom the allegations are made.  </span></p>

Wilson LJ in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">In re J </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">at para 19 disclaimed any suggestion that it was appropriate &#8220;in the vast run of these cases to make an order for costs in whole or in part by reference to the court&#8217;s determination of issues of historical fact&#8221;. But, as I have indicated, there is no valid basis for restricting his approach in that case to findings in a split hearing. The principle that he applied would open the door to successful costs applications against local authorities in respect of many determinations of issues of historical fact. The effect on the resources of local authorities, and the uses to which those resources are put would be significant. </span></p>

Within that email PP used the agreed safe word secretly to convey that she was in danger.  In fact, she used the full phrase set out in her email dated 18 November 2022 when that plan was devised (&#8220;I&#8217;ve been sick for the past 3 days&#8221;). She sent that email to Mr CD, whom she had emailed on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> November 2022. She copied in Ms AB, the person who had been actively involved in supporting her and devising the safety plan and whom she knew had a safeguarding role at her work.  The contents of her email dated 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> July 2023 stood in stark contrast to her email 5 days earlier which anticipated her return (a day late) to work.  She purported to be resigning from her work. She said that her stay in Libya would most likely be &#8220;long term&#8221;. But she also referred to documents including her passport and spoke about her hope to &#8220;come back&#8221; and complete an exam. She thanked Mr CD and Ms AB for their combined efforts towards her portfolio and her &#8220;general wellbeing&#8221;. These other aspects of her letter, read in conjunction with her use of the safe word denoting that she was in danger, are notable.  They could be read as further clues that PP was seeking outside help to get her back to the UK. </span></p>

I reject that submission.  It ignores the dilemma that the police still had to grapple with.  What weighed heavily with the police was that PP remained in Libya and it had not been possible for the police to satisfy themselves that her changed position was what she truly wanted to happen. On any view, there was a stark contrast between the matters listed at paragraph 65 (a) to (h) above and PP&#8217;s application to the court seeking to discharge the FMPO.  For that reason, the police took the position that the FMPO proceedings should continue.  I find that it was reasonable for the police to take that stance.</span></p>

Although the order of that date recites issues relating to the bundle, this went both ways.  Just as there was a need for the police to ensure the respondents were in receipt of material evidence, so too the police had not received written evidence that the respondents had filed directly with the court.  Furthermore, the matter needed to be transferred to a higher tier of court to address case management including the material that the police sought to withhold.  I do not find that the police acted unreasonably at that time so as to justify a costs order against them on that basis.  The issues that the court was faced with on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> December 2023, including the issue concerning material that police sought to withhold, meant that a further hearing before a Circuit Judge to address case management was an inevitability, and this led to the hearing before me on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> January 2024. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">At that hearing, the police invited the court to list a final hearing, with oral evidence to be called and tested, and I acceded to that application. I did so knowing that PP had issued her application to discharge the FMPO (which I refused to grant at that hearing). I had read PP&#8217;s statement and that of FP.  I made clear to the parties that the respondents&#8217; evidence needed to be included in the bundle going forwards, but that in no way inhibited the court making progress on case management at that hearing.  Indeed, I listed a final hearing then and set out the witness requirements.  I took that step, notwithstanding the position that PP herself was advancing, because I had also read the very worrying accounts that PP had given earlier, and I had read about her use of the safe word in the email sent in the early hours of 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> July 2023 to convey covertly to the recipients of that email that she was in danger.  As my order dated 8 January 2024 records, I had also seen and read evidence in a closed bundle of material. I was satisfied that that written evidence was properly being withheld pursuant to rule 11.7(2)(a) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010.  It remains the position that that material is properly withheld. I am conscious for the purposes of this costs issue that FP (and his legal representative) do not know what is within it. It suffices to say that the concern of the police that PP may not be conveying her true feelings was also supported by that material.</span></p>

PP&#8217;s use of the safe word, and the context in which she did so, has been set out within the written evidence in the &#8216;open&#8217; bundle and FP has always been aware of the significance that the police have given to that evidence.  PP&#8217;s statement dated 24 November 2024, whilst advancing a case to discharge the FMPO, also referred to other times when she had told professionals things that she now denies were true, including that she would be in danger if she took a flight back to the UK (see paragraphs 31 to 32 above).  When the proceedings came before Cobb J at the final hearing listed on 13 and 14 March 2024, the carefully crafted plan agreed at that hearing was designed to create a means by which the police could speak to PP and be satisfied that she was able to speak freely. </span></p>
