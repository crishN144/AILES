They have got two older sisters, UV, who was born on [redacted], and XY, born on [redacted]. The family first came to the attention of the local authority in 2005 following a drug warrant raid at the family home, which resulted in the father&#8217;s arrest for the possession of cannabis. There have been recurring concerns about the children&#8217;s exposure to domestic abuse, allegations of sexual abuse and the parents&#8217; use of physical chastisement. </p>

That was as a result of poor school attendance, say the local authority, QR falling asleep in class, poor academic performance, a failure by the parents to keep medical appointments, the boys&#8217; enuresis and concerns that QR, OP and XY were overweight. There were also concerns about the state of the family home and the children&#8217;s routine and boundaries.</p>

The mother said that she had gone missing in the early hours of 16 March 2022. UV texted her parents and alleged that she had been abducted in the middle of the night when she went outside. Police officers ultimately found her at a Londis shop in the afternoon of 16 March 2022. When spoken to by the officers, she said she may have woken up with her private parts feeling sore. I note there was a core group meeting on the morning of 16 March 2022 which the mother attended. No mention is made of UV being missing and, indeed, at the meeting it was agreed that UV would be closed to Children&#8217;s Services. The mother called the police at 3.30 in the afternoon on 16 March 2022 to report UV missing.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is accepted that as a result of UV&#8217;s allegation of abduction by a number of unknown males, and saying her private parts were sore, the early evidence kit was taken to UV&#8217;s home address and her knickers were seized and tested for a semen sample on the inside front gusset area. Both parents accept the seizure of the knickers as a matter of fact, but the father&#8217;s various responses differ as to whether he was at home at the time of the seizure or not. It is accepted there was a DNA match between the semen sample taken from UV&#8217;s knickers and the father and that the probability of such a match is 1 in 100 million.</p>

On the same date, an indecent image of UV was found on the father&#8217;s phone and messages between the daughter and the father, in which UV asked if she should oil her body before coming to bed and stated, &#8220;I love you bad.&#8221; The existence of these messages on the father&#8217;s phone is not disputed by the parents. The issue is who sent them. It is agreed that the father was arrested on suspicion of rape at 23 minutes past midnight on 21 March 2022. He provided a pre-prepared statement and gave a &#8220;no comment&#8221; interview on 21 March 2022, and he was released on bail with a condition not to have any contact with the children.</p>

I also note that in the disclosure of his messages with third parties, there is a discussion prior to UV&#8217;s incident of someone being kidnapped, which could be interpreted as somehow being drug-related. On 27 October 2021, somebody called [redacted] messages the father: &#8220;They nocked on th&#163; door she opened tye door and they snatched her (sic)&#8221;, which bears an uncanny reality to what UV herself reported. He goes on: &#8220;G, his daughter got kidnapped, bro once he paid so much money to the reb to get his daufhters back and he got her bak alhamdulliahor coz of money (sic).&#8221; I do not need to make findings about that, but it is part of the background. The mother accepted in the witness box it was most likely that UV had made the whole story up and this could have been due to a falling out with her father.</p>

During that PLO process, Eva Armsby provided a parenting assessment, dated 8 August 2022. The father failed to engage properly with that assessment. Dr Maguire carried out a global psychological assessment of the family in July 2022. By way also of background, UV had a baby born in [redacted].</p>

At the hearing on 4 October 2022 I made an interim supervision order. On the face of my order of that date, it is recorded that the mother agreed she will not facilitate any contact between the children and their father other than that contact organised by the local authority and she will notify the local authority of any attempts by the father to have unauthorised contact with the children and the father agrees that he will not seek any contact with the children other than that organised by the local authority. I explained to both parents that in the event of a breach of these agreements, it is likely that the local authority will apply for an interim care order and the interim removal of the children from their care.</p>

I noted that Dr Maguire&#8217;s report did not expressly recommend an intermediary, so I approved the putting of a question to Dr Maguire about whether this was necessary for the mother. In January 2023, I made a police disclosure order. On 26 January 2023, I had a non-compliance hearing about police disclosure. The police indicated at that hearing that the phone downloads from the father would not be available for nine months. On 3 March 2023 I made a further disclosure order against the police. On 26 March 2023, I ordered the local authority to provide a schedule of findings with the police material that they did have, which included TikTok messages which were alleged to be between the father and UV and the local authority says were indicative of a sexual relationship.</p>

I directed a report from Communicourt by 20 May 2023, and gave the mother until June to respond to the schedule of findings. She did not attend the first intermediary assessment in May 2023, but attended a second one, and a report was produced by Communicourt on 2 June 2023. The mother responded to the schedule of findings, which included the verbatim cut and paste of the TikTok messages, on 28 June 2023.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact-finding hearing about the father&#8217;s relationship with UV began on 31 October 2023. The father did not attend that hearing, reporting through counsel he was so unwell that he had been unable to leave his home for ten days and was bedridden. I made a witness summons for his attendance. The evidence of the process server was that at 10.39 on 3 November 2023 they served the witness summons at the father&#8217;s address. An adult male, not thought to be the father, answered the door and the papers were left with him for the father. On 7 November 2023, the father did not attend court. The officer in the case was in court herself to address the matter of police disclosure and informed the court that on hearing of the father&#8217;s non-attendance she had ascertained he had left the UK on a flight to [redacted country] at quarter-past six on 3 November 2023, the date on which the witness summons was served. He travelled on a single ticket. I recorded, on the face of my order of 7 November 2023, that if the father does not attend the hearing on 15 November 2023 the court may draw an adverse inference from his non-attendance and his non-engagement with this fact-finding hearing, and the court may make such findings in his absence as it sees fit, including findings about his non-attendance. I made it very clear that he should attend on 15 November 2023. He did not. He has not given details of when he plans to return to the UK.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other problem that meant that it was difficult to complete the fact-finding hearing in the autumn of 2023 was that the Metropolitan Police did not provide full disclosure of the results of the seizure and analysis of the father&#8217;s mobile phone. The difficulty was that once an indecent image was found the phone had to go to a specialist unit for inspection and, throughout these proceedings, the court has made disclosure orders against the police. At the fact-finding hearing in autumn 2023, the Family Court discovered that the phone contents had been processed and were ready to be viewed by the officer in the case. The officer in the case made a statement setting out the chronology of the police investigation of that phone and, ultimately, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to assert public interest immunity over those full disclosures and a full download was given to Evidence Matters whom the court approved as experts to assist.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">What emerges from DC Phillips&#8217; statement is what appears to the Family Court to be a lack of urgency and inefficiency at every stage of the process of this phone download, and the total absence of cover when an officer is on leave for some reason. We have now received all the material downloaded from the police, so it cannot be argued that the trial of this matter has in any way been unfair due to this disclosure issue but, sadly, this has led to significant delay for the boys. I make no criticism of the officer in the case, she has come to court repeatedly and done her best to assist. However, the systems and processes within the police for examining the phone and responding to disclosure requests have led to real delay which is detrimental to the children&#8217;s welfare.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to procedural fairness. Dr Maguire reports that the mother is of a low cognitive ability. Her IQ is 71. That is only 2 points higher than individuals who are considered to have a formal learning disability. In particular, she processes information slowly, has poor understanding of verbal material and difficulties with how well she can remember information for short periods while she processes it. The psychologist felt that her lower ability is not immediately evident. When asked an additional question, she gave a clear recommendation that the mother would benefit from having an intermediary and, indeed, she has one now. In accordance with Family Procedure Rules 3A and PD 3AA, we have taken regular breaks and made sure that the mother can take part fully. No one has alerted me to any unfairness arising from the procedure and I have not been warned that any part of this process was in need of modification or told to conduct the hearing a different way. We have got a written set of ground rules, dated 31 October 2023. I have had those in front of me and ensured that the mother has familiarised herself with the courtroom.</p>

Mr Davies supports the finding of sexual abuse on the evidence that the Guardian has heard, has provided me with a very helpful chronology and assisted the court with his analysis of the issue of failure to protect.

Thus, depending on the circumstances, a prima facie case may become a strong or even an overwhelming case. But, if the silent party's failure to give evidence (or to give the necessary evidence) can be credibly explained, even if not entirely justified, the effect of his silence in favour of the other party may be either reduced or nullified.&#8217;</p>

DC Tanner attended the family home to speak to UV about the semen that had been found in her underwear. She was a straightforward witness who was clearly trying to assist the court fairly. She recalled UV did not seem to want the police there and was agitated and, although she was not unpleasant, she did not want to speak to the police and certainly not about her dad. She described UV as &#8220;anti-police&#8221;. She described the mother as &#8220;appropriately shocked and open with the police&#8221;. She believed she asked the mother about whether she had had any sexual activity with the father and she remembered the mother telling her it was two months after the baby was born and working it out from ST&#8217;s date of birth. She was confident she had accurately recorded her conversation with the mother. She said her notes were not taken contemporaneously but written up the next morning. She accepted that it would have been best practice to take notes while another office spoke to the victim, but she painted a very vivid account of sitting on UV&#8217;s floor and having a sensitive conversation with her.</p>

She accepted the evidence in the bundle in 2018 suggested that UV had been approached by males for images online and the concerns that were raised about this in the police Merlin records.

Not all of the matters pleaded in the interim threshold are accepted by the parents, but there is a partial acceptance of some of the issues by both of the parents. There have been concerns historically about physical abuse and domestic abuse. On 1 December 2013, the police were called and the father smelt of alcohol on arrival. He demanded that the mother and the children leave the address and the mother alleged being hit round the face and pushed in the chest.</p>

Neither wished to press charges. In 2017, on 19 January, the school noticed red marks on QR&#8217;s face. QR alleged that the father pinched his cheek. On 1 May 2018, UV alleged that her father had hit her with a belt on the legs after finding out about her message to a Year 11 boy. She said the father twisted her arm behind her back and slapped her across the face. She moved to live with the paternal grandmother, with a safety plan in place.</p>

On 24 June 2018, the father was arrested and found guilty of being drunk and disorderly. On 8 June 2021, UV alleged she was assaulted by the father at the home address. The police were called by a third party who said that they could hear a loud argument taking place between a male and a female. UV alleged that the father had whipped her with a wire after noticing love bites on her. The father was arrested in relation to this.</p>

I do not need to make findings about these because my focus in this fact find is of sexual abuse, but they are part of the wider canvas. There are reports of the father under the influence of alcohol and violent on occasion, and the bundle as a whole suggests that the father is an influential figure in the family and that no one wants to do anything that causes him a problem. When I look at the messages between him and UV, they often seek reassurance from him in their messages that is rarely forthcoming.</p>

There is a previous report of sexual abuse by a lodger at the paternal grandmother&#8217;s home. This allegedly took place between May 2014 and July 2014 but did not come to the police attention until July 2015. The description given to the police by the girls is one of rape and sexual assault. One of them says that they wanted to tell the police but their parents did not want to, as they said there were concerns about Social Services at the time and because of family honour. It seems that the police record separate assaults involving this lodger in 2015, at which point the parents wanted to report the sexual assault. The mother tells the police that the father invited this man to stay at their address. The father told the police he was only aware of the incident that happened at his mother&#8217;s house, where the suspect had been seen trying to kiss UV and this was seen by a family friend. At the time they did not wish to involve the police as they wanted to deal with this as something that had happened between the family.</p>

On their attendance, UV had locked herself in the bathroom and cut her wrist with a razor. There, in short, had been an argument between her and her sister. The police note the following on 31 May 2023:</p>

As a result of that she wanted to go to hospital so she was taken voluntarily to the Royal London where officers booked her in for a mental health assessment and the wounds to her wrist were superficial and cleaned up.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the witness box she struck me as being quite flat but I bear in mind that this is an intensely stressful experience for her, and at other times in court she has been openly tearful. What struck me about her evidence is that she did not seem to be able to put herself in UV&#8217;s shoes at times or imagine what it might have been like for UV to be the victim of abuse by the father (if, indeed, she was) and the complex process that might have led to this. It is fair to point out that the intermediary assessment had not taken place when the mother filed her first statement in November 2022. The intermediary assessment is dated 2 June 2023. By the time the mother had responded to the schedule of allegations in June 2022, her solicitors would have been aware, therefore, that she needed an intermediary, but it is not crystal clear to me if, indeed, she had one when she gave her June response.</p>

Of course, I gave her permission to do that and she provided a revised response in October 2023, with intermediary assistance, before the fact-finding hearing. I therefore caution myself that the mother did not have an intermediary clearly involved in the preparation of all her responses and statements until October 2023. That said, the issues raised by and large are not complicated ones. For example, the TikTok messages, which are key to this case, are written in everyday text speak and not lawyer language, but I am conspicuously cautious when I look at any material the mother prepared without obviously having intermediary assistance.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">When it came to her evidence, I found it to be shifting and contradictory. I noticed a pattern in the witness box where she would only accept something in evidence if she was confronted with the evidence in such a way that she had no choice but to do so. So, for example, when she was asked if she was aware that the father had been married, she said &#8220;no&#8221; to Mr O&#8217;Brien initially. When she was then told about the messages on his phone from her, when they talked about his wife in [redacted country], she said: &#8220;He was speaking about getting married in [redacted country] in 2021 and, as far as I know, he did get married.&#8221; Her text messages between her and the father in 2021 clearly show she was aware of the marriage. At D21, she talks of his &#8220;cunt wife in [redacted country]&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">What she said in the witness box often sat uncomfortably with what she has put in messages contemporaneously to the father. For example, she told Mr O&#8217;Brien she was not aware the father was buying or selling stuff like bikes and clothing, but it is clear at D11 and 12 of the bundle that she and the father discussed a customer collecting something they had purchased from the father and online reviews. She maintained in the witness box that she was aware that the father used cannabis, but this contradicts what she told Dr Maguire, that she was unaware that the father was using drugs. There is a pattern of a lack of openness in her written evidence. For example, she gives no substantive response to the allegation that the father made a call from custody. She said that was for the father to respond to. However, it became clear in the October 2023 hearing that the number he dialled was hers. She then accepted in the witness box that he did call her phone from the custody suite. That is something that she could have volunteered earlier in the court process.</p>

For example, she said no one had heard from the father since he went to [redacted country]. Given the sheer volume of the communication between family members in the messages, that seems to me unlikely if their historic behaviour is anything to go by. Her evidence was that when she called UV a &#8220;cunt&#8221; in the messages, she had not meant to put it there. This was unconvincing. It is a word she uses in other messages. It is not misspelt or retracted. And it was equally unconvincing when she said she referred to &#8220;crack&#8221; in the messages but she was unaware that the father was using crack cocaine. It was also improbable that she said there were no tensions with the baby and UV living with her given the possibility that the baby is the father&#8217;s.</p>

She had not been invited to his flat, did not know if he sublet it, did not know where he got the money from for cannabis, did not know about the woman that the father appears to have married in the UK, whose divorce papers are discussed in the messages. She told Mr O&#8217;Brien in the witness box that there was not much she knew about this man but that is hard to reconcile with the fact that she has known him since she was fifteen years old (I think that is over twenty years) and has had five children with him.</p>

I first remind myself that there are strengths and limitations to this type of message evidence. Some of the strengths of this evidence is that it is contemporaneous, it is unfiltered, it is done on the basis that it is private and nobody is expecting a Family Court Judge to read these messages. It is spontaneous, it is not prepared with court in mind. However, I warn myself it is only one facet of a relationship. People do still talk and meet each other face to face, and it is difficult to place these messages in context because I do not know what is happening offline, in the real world, as it were, and I caution myself not to read too much into messages in isolation. They are a snapshot. But I can look, I think, at broad patterns in these messages and highlight themes that come up repeatedly. I have reproduced the messages verbatim with the typographical errors and abbreviations which appear in the original.</p>

For example, she says: &#8220;So don&#8217;t bother start missing me now the only person u missed so much was ur older daughter and it still is.&#8221; The mother accepted the father might have treated UV differently because of the relationship that they had when she gave evidence, but she did not think that at the time.</p>

There are suggestions that the mother finds her behaviour problematic (C3, C4, C12, for example) and there is a theme that the mother feels disrespected and undermined by the father and, on one analysis, this is particularly acute when it comes to UV. &#8220;You said to your daughter when I said no so you&#8217;d better make sure that you tell her no&#8221;, is an example of that perception of being undermined.</p>

When she was asked about this, she said that she was talking about what he had done in general and specifically to him smoking cannabis. This message is sent after forty-seven of what appear to me as blank messages. That means the contents of those messages I cannot see what was in them. This is a high volume of communication in very quick succession. There is then a break of two hours before the mother&#8217;s response that I have just read out, &#8220;I&#8217;m not even going to say a word on what you&#8217;ve just done.&#8221; The father&#8217;s response to the mother is, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to come. Very horny. Can you help?&#8221; Whatever was going on, I did not find the mother&#8217;s explanation for it credible. However, without knowing the full details of the preceding forty-seven messages, and whatever was going on &#8220;offline&#8221;, in the real world at the time in person, it is a step too far, I think, for the court to draw an inference that the mother was referring directly to sexual abuse. She is frequently condemnatory of the father throughout the messages for a variety of reasons relating to his behaviour, and there are many aspects of his behaviour which, according to her messages, which might be open to criticism. Although the mother&#8217;s answers to these messages, which I have looked at with real care and specifically, were not entirely convincing, I do not think it suggests a direct knowledge of sexual abuse and that would be an inference too far for the court to draw safely.</p>

He was given medication for this. This is medication with which the court is familiar. It is often seen in the treatment of those with anxiety. But there is no evidence in the bundle to assert his anxiety or depression has stopped him from going out or engaging with life generally. Indeed the messages he has sent over time suggest otherwise. He has come to court bar one occasion every time before the fact-find and the importance of him attending has been underscored by the issue of a witness summons warning him also that the court may draw adverse inferences and will continue without him. He should have been in court. He has given no credible reason for his failure to attend and has effectively disengaged from the process. He is clearly well versed in tech, judging by the messages, and could have asked to attend remotely. Up until January 2024 he was in touch with his solicitors.</p>

When I look at what I know of UV as a whole, she is a girl who seems to take her appearance seriously, as well as her grooming, and, on one level, it seems unlikely that she would have put on a pair of dirty underwear having bathed before getting ready to go out. She was wearing the knickers when she left the home and I think it is forensically significant that the DNA inside the knickers is in the gusset area. Although no DNA was found on UV herself, I notice the examination record: &#8220;Bath x 1, washed genitals multiple times.&#8221; Should semen have been deposited onto the knickers after the father ejaculated following masturbation, one might have expected a wider distribution of semen if he used the cloth as a wipe.</p>

This is agreed. What is not agreed is what was said at the time. PC Patel&#8217;s evidence was that he did not think there was any discussion between the officers and the father in relation to DNA before the father mentioned it. He gave evidence that there were two women at the window and one downstairs at the gate. He said that, from memory, the shouting was coming from the upstairs window. He said that the father was shouting a lot but he thought he was speaking to his daughter, but was unable to be more precise as to who he was speaking to when he called out [nickname redacted].

On neither of the recordings can I hear the arresting officer, or any other officer, mentioning DNA or who the rape victim was in relation to the offence and they do not mention DNA inside UV. The father&#8217;s comments upon arrest indicate he realised why he may have been arrested and he communicates this to family members. One interpretation is that he has put two and two together and is then trying to communicate with the family to cover his back. He is trying to get a message across and continues even when he is told by the officers to stop. In my view, it is an early attempt to try and alert the family to the fact that the police have found DNA inside UV even before that has been communicated to him. The scene was chaotic, with UV screaming and hysterical and mother in and out of the house getting tissues, clothes and the father&#8217;s phone. I accept the mother may not have heard exactly what the father said at the time and what the father said does not allow me to infer that the mother herself knew about the incident that led to the semen deposit. &#8220;You know that incident that happened&#8221; seems to be said in relation to UV&#8217;s question and could be, of course, interpreted by the mother, if she heard it, as relating to UV&#8217;s &#8220;missing&#8221; episode rather than any other incident.</p>

DDO Miah gave evidence that the person he called for the father and the father were told not to speak [redacted language] before the call started. He believed the father was using derogatory language to try and intimidate a witness. He was unable to explain why the phrase translated, &#8220;Pass the phone to this lady&#8221; was derogatory, and the interpreter was unable to assist on this point too. But he said he had to intervene because the father was speaking in an aggressive manner. The clear impression he gave is that the father was acting aggressively albeit the statement does not mention aggression until the call is terminated.</p>

The mother did not volunteer the evidence that the father dialled her phone from custody until she was in the witness box. I do make due allowance for the fact that the mother, of course, was unable to comment on whether the father called his sister but she could have provided information that there was a received call from him on her phone, which she did not take, and that that information came out for the first time in the witness box. This information from the mother was given to the court when it was clear that the court had already been told that the number that had been dialled from custody was the mother&#8217;s. She said none of the children told her that they answered the call but thought that UV could have done so. She said she asked the children who took the call but received no response. All of this detail given in the witness box is detail which could and should have been provided at an earlier stage and her evidence was unconvincing.</p>

She seemed to accept that the majority were not between her and the father. I would observe that the tone of the TikTok messages between UV and her father are of entirely different tone to the ones that I read between the mother and father. The messages between the father and UV read as if they are teenagers with a degree of immaturity at times. The messages between the mother and the father, even those which are sexualised, are blunt and to the point, and often without any element of affection in them. Looking carefully at the two sets of messages, between the father and mother and the father and UV, the spelling and use of abbreviation of whoever is sending those messages are different; the emojis that the mother and father use in their conversations are different to those that the father and UV use. The mother gave evidence that she genuinely thought some of the messages were hers because it was her TikTok account, but with more evidence and reflection she went through every single one of them.</p>

Mr Davies asked her: &#8220;If you were shocked when you first read those messages, what made you lie?&#8221; The mother replied: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to believe it, not so much about me lying but when more evidence came forward with the download of the phone, that&#8217;s when it sank in.&#8221; &#8220;You don&#8217;t say&#8221;, notes Mr Davies, &#8220;in your response, that they are yours.&#8221; &#8220;I should have said in more details on that&#8221;, said the mother.</p>

The Evidence Matters states that the examiner is unable to discern the original creation date of images 1 to 3 and if they were taken using the handset of a camera or received by or downloaded to the handset. Images 4 and 5 were created on 1 March 2022. The photos are associated with a video that shows UV naked from the waist up getting dressed. The photos and videos were either taken using the handset or received or downloaded using the handset&#8217;s camera roll.

Again this does not sit easily with her written case that she was not paying much attention at the time and was merely disappointed that UV had taken the photo. Ms Roberts submits that the video evidence made it clear to the mother that what she had been told about the photo was untrue, but the mother&#8217;s evidence relied on not just what she was told but what she said she saw herself, and she contradicts herself in the various accounts that she gives. Maybe that was because she was repeating what she was told by others or maybe because she was colluding with the father and UV in framing a narrative. Ms Roberts submits that we do not know whether the police image was the one that the mother was shown but the mother appears to accept in her evidence it was, and refers to it being &#8220;one of the pictures that UV had accidentally sent to the father&#8221;.</p>

Various family members from the father&#8217;s side, who were put forward for viability assessments, have either disengaged or withdrawn. It is fair to note that at the family group conference the social worker approved that plan with the paternal family, that they should support the mother, so it would be unfair to criticise the mother for accepting that support if it were to be offered. But from the evidence before me, and the text messages in which the mother perceives herself as clearly being so unsupported and unappreciated, I do not see, in practice, that either the paternal or the maternal family have helped out in day to day ways. The paternal grandmother has carers herself and the paternal family care for her, so the offer of help from her in the family group conference is sadly quite unrealistic. I do not have evidence that they have sought to support the mother practically with childcare, guidance or in other ways. Neither do the family seem to have the support of a wider community, for example, from the mosque or more broadly in the local community.</p>

I understand that UV was not a child under Social Services at this point but her siblings were, and it is highly relevant to the allegation that the father had a sexual relationship with her. I asked the mother about this in the witness box, and she said she was surprised that UV had not told the social worker but did not pick up on the point that she should have shared the information.

I might also add to those the following that the mother did not mention drug use by the father. In her position statement she purports to be shocked by the hair strand test. However, in her oral evidence she said she was aware of cannabis use and the text messages suggest that she was aware of crack cocaine use, which is consistent with the hair strand test. Her original responses, and those given in October 2023, have largely unravelled. In them she sought to align her narrative with the father and possibly with UV. Her explanation about the knickers and the semen, and who sent TikTok messages, and whether she saw the topless picture and when, and her response as to who accessed the TikTok account, may well have been influenced by others, but they are not true and they are misleading and she has rowed back from many of them.</p>

Now, it could, of course, be that the reasons he gives for missing contact and illness, for example, are genuine or it could be that he has a lack of commitment to his children, or it could be that he is seeing them some other way and so that the contact centre contact is not quite so necessary for him to see them.</p>

She spoke of parenting alone and how it had been harder and &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I will do if he can&#8217;t visit&#8221;, because she feels this will &#8220;destroy my children&#8221;.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is alleged that the family have breached these agreements and the local authority received anonymous referrals in respect of this. Ms Ahmed&#8217;s evidence was that it was the same anonymous source each time, and she took steps to investigate the information. The mother shared it could be malicious, but she took the professional view it was not. She replied to Mr Davies that when she took over the case she reviewed the social work files and there was no history of anonymous referrals and these reports all started after the father&#8217;s arrest. Her written evidence was that on many unannounced visits, one or other of the children were having a shower, and this is at various times of day. She gave oral evidence. She said she stayed for around an hour and the mother would knock on the bathroom door and the children would put their head around. However, she would not be able to see the whole room. She gave evidence that these visits would take place at different times of day. She would ask if she could wait until they came out, but they did not. On a couple of occasions she visited she was not able to see every room in the house namely 11 November 2022 and 4 November 2022. She was told on one occasion it was because XY was asleep. On the following unannounced visits, one child was in the shower: 6 January 2023, 26 January 2024, 1 February 2023, 13 February 2023, 24 February 2023 and 21 March 2023. There is no record that I can find in the social work evidence that the children were routinely in the shower during the day before this period of time.</p>

It is also strange and noteworthy that it is a different child on each occasion, so it is not one child, for example, who wants to avoid the social worker but there seems to be an element of taking turns on one interpretation. This was not put to the mother so I approach this issue with conspicuous care, but this evidence is part of the evidential picture and I cannot disregard it altogether. I weigh it very carefully in the balance.</p>

Of course, an honest witness can make a mistaken identification, so I look carefully at the circumstances where this took place. Ms Tomisin saw the interaction of serving food. It was not a fleeting glance. She was in close proximity. It was daylight. There was nothing obstructing her view. Although she had not seen the father before, she had got a picture of him and actually it was her express purpose in visiting that she should be able to identify him if necessary and she said she made contact with him.

The broad pattern of hiding in the shower, or a child hiding in the shower when the social worker came, only started in early 2023 and the last occasion this happened was in early March 2023. The end of this period of January to March 2023 in which the shower is a feature coincides with the report from the anonymous referrer and QR say that dad has moved back in (made in March 2023). It is during this period of January to March 2023 that the social worker was routinely unable to see all of the house.

The father is a manipulative and powerful figure who has had police involvement for violence, and I think it would be the dynamic of the family that seems to allow him to do as he wishes. It is the careful calibration of all the evidence that leads me to this inescapable conclusion.

It often relates to a Mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in case where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household.

As Aikens LJ observed in Re J, &#8220;nearly all parents will be imperfect in some way or another&#8221;. Many households operate under considerable stress and men go to prison for serious crimes, including crimes of violence, and are allowed to return home by their long-suffering partners upon their release. That does not mean that for that reason alone, that parent has failed to protect her children in allowing her errant partner home, unless, by reason of one of the facts connected with his offending, or some other relevant behaviour on his part, those children are put at risk of suffering significant harm.&#8221;</span></p>

It seems to me that there are three broad time periods. There is pre-arrest, there is post-arrest but pre-proceedings, and, of course, these time periods go to the threshold question of whether, as of October 2022, when proceedings started, the children were suffering or likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the care given to them by their parents. Then we have during proceedings. What happened during proceedings and the approach of the mother is maybe of more relevance to the welfare assessment that will follow and will inform any risk assessment needed after this hearing. Mr Davies has really helpfully characterised it this way, that a failure to protect a child can encompass a spectrum of behaviour from direct knowledge of harm to reasonable suspicion of harm to failure of curiosity to being oblivious.</p>

There is the preferential treatment the Father gives her as we see in the text messages. The mother got angry at this but did not seem to explore the underlying reason for this with the father or UV. The mother perceives on one level that the father and his wife are a threat to her in the messages and directs a similar level of anger at UV from time to time, but, as I have already observed, it is an inference too far, in my view, to say that she was directly aware of a sexual relationship between the father and UV from those messages alone.</p>

She goes missing overnight but, in fairness to the mother, the child protection conference says that the mother took appropriate measures to report this. This is in the missing episode prior to the kidnap one, if I can describe it that way. They live in a small house and, on one level, it might be thought surprising that the mother did not notice anything. UV is self-harming. She has been asked for naked pictures of herself as far back as 2018 and in 2021 the father was so cross with her when he finds love bites that there is an allegation that he physically hurt UV as a result. These are flags that might lead a reasonable parent to have a particular scrutiny of their child&#8217;s phone and to check their child&#8217;s online activity, either for sexual content or, indeed, to check that they have not been viewing self-harm material, which is sadly very widely available on the internet.</p>

There is, on one level, poor boundaries in the home and the impression I have very clearly formed is that father did what he wanted and came and went as he saw fit. The father masturbating in mother&#8217;s bed when he chose to stay over is suggestive of questionable sexual boundaries by the mother in allowing this. Of course, I am mindful that the children did not see this. And that sadly the mother herself has experienced abuse as a child, which might alert her to the possibility that these things do happen.</p>

When a victim is groomed by someone, it can often be very subtle and incremental. The social worker did not seem to spot any signs and the child protection conference on 3 February 2022 says that the children have all reported good relationships with both parents and their siblings. The notes record the &#8220;close relationship between parents and children have been observed during home visits, when they are all sitting together in the living room making jokes and engaging in conversation together&#8221;. At that child protection conference and, more broadly, the feedback from the schools and the health visitor, do not raise any concerns of a sexual nature.</p>

Later that day the mother is told by DC Bridges, Tanner and Davies about the semen in UV&#8217;s underwear. Later that day too, the topless image is found by the police on the father&#8217;s phone. I have been unable to ascertain from the evidence before me when the mother was informed about this image. It is not mentioned in the pre-proceedings letter of 13 April 2022 or in the meeting of that date. The father and UV, of course, are told about this image and the TikTok and the semen in their interviews, but that does not necessarily mean the mother knows about it, and if she was told about it by the father or UV in March 2022, she may not have been given an accurate account. The first time I can find that the local authority refer to the topless image and the messages about UV oiling herself, and the TikTok exchanges, is with the social worker&#8217;s initial social work statement served for the application in late September 2022.</p>

The local authority take, I think, over six months to issue proceedings. The father has denied the allegations throughout. He emerges from the evidence as somebody who gets his own way and tries to control the narrative. The mother had few other sources of support. No &#8220;keep safe&#8221; work was done by the local authority. XY does not report seeing anything to the mother, from the evidence before me, and UV consistently says that the father has not abused her. I have re-watched her VRI with the detective and she is quite convincing in her disdain for this idea when he puts it to her. The officer in the case says: &#8220;I can see from your face what you think of that idea.&#8221; The information has emerged piecemeal. It is unclear what the mother was told and exactly when from the police and Social Services documents, bar the DNA issue. The mother is vulnerable and I have already noted her particular difficulties on E28, which are not immediately apparent.</p>

On her own evidence, she says she was shown the image of UV topless by the father which, of course, was before his phone was seized. If she is telling the truth about this, then she has not told the social workers about it and is covering up in some way. If she is lying about this, similarly she is not investigating and has been misleading in her evidence.

In the witness box, the mother accepted that, &#8220;Going by the evidence that something has gone on and I was not aware of it.&#8221; She said in chief that she should have been aware but there were no signs that it had happened. When asked if she chose not to ask too closely what was going on, she accepted she could have asked. The mother gave evidence that she did not think there was a sexual relationship between the father and UV before she saw the Evidence Matters report. She said it was more the TikTok messages that shocked her, but these were the messages that were mentioned, albeit not reproduced in full, in the original social work statement and that statement reported that UV asked her father if she should oil her body before coming to bed and told him, &#8220;I love you bad.&#8221;</p>

Her failure to take responsibility for making sure that she read and, if necessary, re-read all of those TikTok downloads and asked questions properly about what they suggest earlier in the proceedings, suggests that she simply did not take the issue seriously or, alternatively, she was prepared to be led or fed a line by the father in her responses.</p>
