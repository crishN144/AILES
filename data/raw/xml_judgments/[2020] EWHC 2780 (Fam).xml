I reserved judgment at least in part to accommodate the filing of further written submissions on the issue identified at [8](iii) above.  Having received those submissions, I then invited the parties jointly to instruct a Scottish family lawyer to advise on the relevant law in Scotland; I received the expert opinion from Jonathan Mitchell QC of the Faculty of Advocates on 24 September 2020.  I then commissioned further submissions on a discrete issue arising on the evidence, which I received on 9 and 12 October 2020.

In 2006 a residence order (<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span>) was granted in favour of the father.  Henry&#8217;s mother has had only limited contact with Henry during his life.

He has a mild intellectual disability, is reported to suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (&#8216;ADHD&#8217;), for which he is prescribed the drug risperidone, and a possible (though contentious) diagnosis of foetal alcohol syndrome. He has attachment difficulties, struggles to show empathy, and has found it difficult to communicate his feelings.  For some time, he has been under the care of his local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services; there are reported concerns that he may have an autistic spectrum disorder, but he has not yet been formally assessed for this.  Henry can still become hyperactive and anxious; his challenging behaviours include displays of anger, aggression, self-harm, screaming, soiling and violence.   </p>

Professional support offered by the Local Authority over this time did not, regrettably, ease the father&#8217;s difficulties (and latterly his partner&#8217;s difficulties) in caring for Henry; the father felt that the levels of assistance offered were insufficient.  In July 2019, the father, who it is recognised had provided overall a &#8220;good standard&#8221; of care of Henry&#8217;s basic needs (and is said to &#8220;idolise&#8221; his son), was finding it too difficult to manage Henry&#8217;s challenging behaviours, and in particular his aggression; he requested the Local Authority to accommodate Henry.   </p>

While searching in England for a suitable placement, many units which were approached declined to offer Henry a place, advising that they felt that he would require a <span style="font-style:italic">secure</span> environment, and that a simple residential care setting would not be appropriate by reason of the risk he posed to himself and others.

		  </authorialNote>. The fact that Henry&#8217;s mother had not seen him for several years did not in my judgment absolve the authority of the responsibility of satisfying the important statutory requirement to establish whether she was, for example, &#8220;willing and able&#8221; to &#8220;provide accommodation&#8221; for him or &#8220;arrange for accommodation to be provided&#8221; for him; nor could the Local Authority say that it had complied with its obligation under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref>C(2)-(4) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span>, namely the requirement to make arrangements for Henry to live with a parent, except where it would not be consistent with his welfare.  The statute is clear enough; the guidance reinforces it: &#8220;A local authority cannot restrict a person&#8217;s exercise of their PR, including their decisions about delegation, unless there is a care order or an emergency protection order in place.&#8221; (The <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> Guidance and Regulations, Volume 2: Care Planning, Placement and Case Review</span>, para 3.197 (DfE, 2015);   </p>

This was, in my judgment, far too long.  In this period, Henry did not have the benefit of an independent children's guardian to represent and safeguard his interests at a crucial stage of his life. Further, the court was deprived of the opportunity to consider and/or control the planning for Henry and to prevent or reduce unnecessary and avoidable delay in resolving these important jurisdictional and welfare issues.  It transpires that the decision to apply for a care order was in fact made in February 2020, but the application was not issued for four more months.  Miss C, social worker, accepted that the application was not issued in a &#8220;timely way&#8221;, a considerable understatement, and commented: </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re X &amp; Y</span>, Sir James Munby P considered whether <span style="font-style:italic">paragraph 19 </span>of <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 2 </span>could apply to the <span style="font-style:italic">temporary</span> placement of children abroad, but declined to comment.   Having regard to the specific issue raised in that case he was clear that <span style="font-style:italic">paragraph 19 </span>of <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 2 </span>could not be used for the purposes of placement in secure accommodation outside England and Wales; he said this: </p>

Quite apart from any other consideration, temporary placements, such as Ossian House in Scotland, are often required to provide emergency accommodation where there is no suitable alternative in England &#8211; a mobile home, static caravan, or staffed holiday home.

On the evidence before me, it appears that he had no real idea what he was being asked to agree to.  Although he said he was &#8220;fine&#8221; about moving to the placement in Scotland, he had not visited it, and he knew little about it.  In my judgment, the Local Authority should be cautious before placing much, if any, reliance on a young person declaring that they are &#8216;fine&#8217; with a proposal; it is well-recognised that &#8216;fine&#8217; is often used as a means of deflection, to avoid engagement on real feelings.  If someone declares that they are &#8216;fine&#8217;, this may be a clue, I suggest, that the very opposite is true.  In any event, it is reasonable to assume that almost any option offered by the Local Authority would have compared favourably with the situation in which he then found himself &#8211; placed as a sole young person in a caravan, supported by 2 staff members.  Tested another way, what if the erroneous view that he was going to a &#8216;bad boys&#8217; home had prevailed, and he had therefore objected to going?

In my judgment, if the child who is to be placed <span style="font-style:italic">temporarily</span> in a residential children&#8217;s home outside of England &amp; Wales but within the United Kingdom (i.e. as here, in Scotland) is the subject of an interim care order, the placement can be achieved under <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/38" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 38</ref></span>, relying on <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/33/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(7)</ref></span> and <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/33/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(8)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span>; the details of the proposal for such a placement outside of England and Wales, but within the UK, would be contained in a relevant care plan.  The care plan will doubtless be subject to careful scrutiny by the court, as Mr Wraith rightly suggested (see [21(ii)] above).  In my view there is no need for a local authority to make specific application to the court for permission to place a child in interim care within the UK.   It would however be prudent for the English court, at the time of making the interim care order, specifically to recite on the face of the order that it has considered the care plan for temporary placement in the UK/Scotland, so that the authorities in the relevant part of the UK are aware of the court&#8217;s endorsement of that arrangement. </p>

But if its purpose is to protect [Henry&#8217;s] best interests and his rights, there is no apparent lacuna, any more than there was between August 2019 and July 2020. And <span style="font-style:italic">section 11 (7)</span> of the [<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/36" uk:canonical="1995 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children (Scotland) Act 1995</ref></span>] does make clear in my opinion that the focus, and thus the purpose of legal regulation, must be on his best interests. In <span style="font-style:italic">Cumbria</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Salford</span> and their lookalike cases which have been brought since 2016, the core order sought in the Court of Session was one authorising the deprivation of liberty which was perceived as necessary to protect not only the local authority but also care homes and their staff; that took matters beyond a classic best interests consideration, and the court was prepared in each case to accept that the child&#8217;s best interest was to be deprived of their liberty.&#8221; </p>

This route would not even need to be considered, he observes, were there in place a coherent intra-jurisdictional legal framework between England and Scotland (and/or other jurisdictions of the UK) for dealing with jurisdiction, transfer of proceedings, recognition and enforcement in family proceedings.  The point has considerable force, in my judgment, particularly given that any petition would be used simply to formalise arrangements in this case which are otherwise (a) lawful (the secure accommodation cases involved matters of personal liberty which, if left unauthorised, carried implications for the child and their carers), (b) agreed, and (c) have operated satisfactorily in meeting Henry&#8217;s welfare for a significant period. </p>

So far as I understand the parties&#8217; positions. it is intended that Henry will retain his habitual residence in England, and will indeed return in due course to England; it is a case in which the Local Authority intends to continue to exercise parental responsibility for him with his parents at least for the time being.  There is no intention to transfer responsibility for Henry to the Scottish local authority; nor would it be likely, or indeed necessary, that an equivalent order to an interim care order should be made in Scotland to achieve recognition.

Behaviour management is now addressed by distraction and deescalation techniques; the only form of &#8216;restrictive&#8217; behaviour management is the use of &#8216;time outs&#8217; in Henry&#8217;s room.

However, before making any interim care order, a court would need &#8211; as it would in any public law case &#8211; to scrutinise the care plan.  In a case such as this, the court will want to ensure very specific compliance (<span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>) with the requirements of the <span style="font-style:italic">2010 Regulations</span>.  If satisfied with such compliance, and of the view that the plan for placement in residential care in Scotland meets the needs of the child, it would be appropriate for the order placing the child in the interim care of the authority to be endorsed with the explicit acknowledgement and approval of the plan to place the child across the border in Scotland; (see in particular [35], [37], [49], and [51] above); </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0.01in">The current interim care order in respect of Henry is not recognised and is not capable of enforcement in Scotland. Happily, at present no party seeks its enforcement, and there appears to be no reason in Scots law for taking any step towards recognition other than for &#8216;legal tidiness&#8217;.  If any party (particularly the Local Authority) seeks recognition or enforcement, it would be appropriate for that party to petition to the <span style="font-style:italic">nobile officium</span> of the Inner House of the Court of Session for an order in that court; I suggest that the success of such an application would depend on a range of factors including the specific facts, and the nature of the relief sought;  (see in particular [54], and [63]-[72] above).  While it appears possible for the parents to litigate in Scotland in relation to Henry on matters strictly limited to his immediate protection (see [70]/[71] above), it is reasonable to assume that, through judicial liaison under the 2018 Judicial Protocol, steps would be taken to avoid concurrent proceedings being held in the two jurisdictions;  </p>

There is a scarcity of suitable registered children&#8217;s homes in England and Wales, and local authorities, particularly those in the North and North-East of England, unsurprisingly look across the border to the number of high-quality residential resources there.  A child placed in one of the southern counties of Scotland (i.e. Dumfriesshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, or Roxburghshire) could be much closer to his/her home in Tyneside, for example, than if he or she were placed in many parts of England and Wales.  </p>
