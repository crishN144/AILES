The lease agreement entered into between her and the Husband, using the vehicle of the Third Respondent, was a genuine transaction intended to meet a genuine business need. Under that agreement she would be entitled to the rental income and the Husband, in return, would be entitled to a fixed income of some &#163;4,500 per week.

There are two, interrelated, duties of the court before making an order under Part III. The first is to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application: s 16(1). The second is to consider whether an order should be made under s 17 having regard to the matters in s 18. There are two reasons why the  duties are interrelated. First, neither s 16(2) nor s 18(2) and (3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account. Section 16(1) directs the court to have regard to 'all the circumstances of the case' and s 16(2) refers the court to certain matters 'in particular'. Second, some of the matters to be considered under s 16 may be relevant under s 18, and vice versa.</span></p>

Second, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction. Third, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Subject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. The reasons why it was appropriate for an order to be made in England  are among the circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what order should be made. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Where the English connections of the case are very strong there may be no reason why the application should not be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. The full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases. The conditions which can be attached to leave, together with the court's case management powers, can be used to define the issues and to limit the evidence to be filed, as was done by Munby J in this case. This enables the jurisdiction to be tailored to the needs of the individual case, so that the grant of leave does not inevitably trigger a full-blown claim for all forms of ancillary relief.&#8221;</span></p>

Operating a property lettings business in a sub-prime market must be a difficult and demanding operation, securing rental payments, addressing disputes over deposits, room conditions and it struck me as unconvincing that the Husband would leave this to K, especially given his concerns about her drugs use in late 2017. </span></p>

K was very critical of the Wife for not coming to her aid. The police were called and the Husband detained overnight. The Husband has criticised the introduction of this issue and it is right that K understandably found it upsetting. However it seems to me it was relevant and not unfair to raise it as the Husband&#8217;s counsel had suggested that K was a suitable person for the role she had adopted with R3. Given that this incident in relation to the drugs was less than a year before the lease agreement was entered into it does seem to me to be relevant. I observe in passing that K said it was just a small quantity of cannabis and I do not suggest otherwise, but the relevance is in the Husband&#8217;s strong reaction to finding it and the suggestion that several months later he would be content to entrust K with control of the rental income from his property portfolio. </span></p>

Doing the best I could do with limited evidence I think it unlikely it is more than a million pounds but likely that it significantly exceeds &#163;100,000.

It is clear the Second Respondent was actively involved in supporting the Husband&#8217;s position in the English proceedings by the provision of witness statements in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1996</ref> proceedings for example. </span></p>

I agree that in the final analysis this point was not strongly pursued by the Applicant but it seems to me that the need to satisfy all of the requirements of section 23(4) are more pertinent and my central findings are that (i) the Husband the Second Respondent were working together with the primary intention of maximising the difficulties for the Wife to pursue her claims and so there is bad faith in relation to both of them and (ii) the original &#163;109,000 was not the Second Respondent&#8217;s money and so he has not provided full valuable consideration.  They did not act with good faith, and I have no hesitation in finding that the Second Respondent had actual notice of the Husband&#8217;s intention to defeat the Wife&#8217;s claims. Even if I am wrong about this I am satisfied the timing of the charge and the possession proceedings fixes the Second Respondent with constructive notice of the Husband&#8217;s bad faith.

That criticism is significantly misplaced when this case cried out for the husband to make an open offer, either on a Schedule 1 basis in part or on an outright basis, to realistically meet a modest housing award and modest income award. The husband failed to make any sensible proposal and worse still made it very difficult for the wife to formulate an open proposal by the way he conducted himself. </span></p>

I adopted an outright award but assessed needs conservatively for the reasons I explained.</span></p>

That might be fair in a case in which a party had litigated unreasonably, but I have found that the wife has litigated reasonably and therefore it will be a very difficult and unfair outcome for her if no order as to costs is made and the impact of this of in reducing her award by some &#163;178,000.</span></p>

I have in mind the CGT the husband has to pay on disposal of property and this is why he should have made a very early offer to settle the case, rather than placing obstacles in the way, and such an offer would have protected him and encouraged the wife to settle these proceedings. But in my judgment he took a completely different approach and made things more difficult for the wife.</span></p>

It seems to me that the misconduct of the husband crosses the threshold into the indemnity standard and that it is the sort of conduct that the court should mark its disapproval of. The misconduct has also made it very difficult for the case to be resolved.  </span></p>

Also it is difficult for Miss Hussey QC to criticise the wife when the husband&#8217;s conduct has inevitably driven costs up. In fact, each party&#8217;s financial remedies costs are similar and the husband&#8217;s slightly more than the wife&#8217;s.  That is a powerful point.</span></p>

There were some errors in one of the wife&#8217;s witness statements and in letters prepared by her previous solicitors, which she should take responsibility for.  She overstated her housing claim in producing property particulars of 3 bedroom properties in [an area of London] and, although I take Mr Perrins&#8217; point that they were all in the bracket, in my judgment the wife over pitched her claims.&#160; The issues in relation to the single joint expert evidence as to the value of the Lebanese properties are limited given my conclusions.</span></p>

There is to be no overlap with the existing costs order.</span></p>
