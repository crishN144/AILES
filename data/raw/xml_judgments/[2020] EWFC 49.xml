X was conceived following artificial insemination that took place at the respondent&#8217;s home with Y using W&#8217;s sperm. At that time Y and Z were civil partners. The parties had met through a website when the respondents were seeking a known donor. W maintains his understanding that they were looking for a co-parent. The extent of W&#8217;s role in X&#8217;s life remained in dispute after X&#8217;s birth, with W seeking to rely on what he understood to be a co-parent role, which was not shared by Y and Z.  </p>

X was separately represented during those proceedings; Ms Adams was her Children&#8217;s Guardian. A feature of the earlier proceedings was the different perceptions by W and Y and Z about his role in relation to X and the impact that had on Y and Z, in particular on their role as X&#8217;s parents. I accepted Y and Z&#8217;s evidence at that time that they recognised X is going to ask questions about her genetic background which they will need to deal with. They </p>

He considers it is important for her identity and to understand her background, as he said in one of his statements <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;her sense of identity and her heritage&#8217;</span>. He has tried to avoid proceedings by approaching Y directly in 2017 and, according to W, they reached an agreement for him to see X which she then changed her mind about. In addition, he refers to other reported cases where men in his position have been able to see their child and he states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8217;there is a lack of explicit judicial consideration of the interests of gay men involved in collaborative co-parenting...&#8217;.</span> He also suggests that Y was not as forthcoming as she should have been in 2015 about the state of her relationship with Z.</p>

He considers it focuses too much on the adult conflict, relies on Y selfreporting of W being the trigger for her anxiety without any evidence base for Y&#8217;s claims. W sets out how he recognises that he is not X&#8217;s legal parent but is her genetic father. In his oral evidence he updated the court about his personal circumstances, including his recent nursing qualification. He accepted that Y would facilitate any contact with him once X started asking questions, but he considered it should not be </p>

Her position remains largely as it was in 2015, she does not consider X spending time with W is in her interests at this stage. She fears that W would be unable to accept limited contact, sees little change in his position  and relies on the conclusion the court reached previously that his lack of insight and focus on his rights and the adult conflict without considering the reality of X&#8217;s position and those who care for her, making the prospect for any sustainable change in his behaviour very unlikely.</p>

She described the steps she had taken and the advice she had sought about how to make sure X has a full understanding of her background. This has included her compiling an age appropriate story book in 2019 for X about the relationship between Y and Z, how they had been helped to have a baby and gave a positive description of W&#8217;s role. She described how she had read this to X on two occasions in late 2019 and Ms Adams looked at it as part of her assessment, as described in her report. X had asked who the man&#8217;s name was, Y told her W&#8217;s first name. She said X had not asked anymore about this, but it was on her electronic device with her other story books, so available to her when she wanted to. She considered X was not yet ready to see W, although she had some information about her circumstances, she had not asked any more. Y considers it should wait until she is older, making it clear if X did start asking questions and wanted to have contact with W, Y would take steps to arrange that.</p>

In her report she recognised that W has progressed in respect of his sensitivity to the difficulties of the situation but still failed to show any genuine insight into X&#8217;s need. Whilst she recognised it was a loss for X to not have the benefit of an additional loving relationship with a genetic parent, but she considered the threat it represents to her stability and her primary carer are too great. She was concerned about the way the application had come about and W&#8217;s lack of understanding of the difficulties that were being encountered by Y as X&#8217;s primary carer during the breakdown of the relationship between Y and Z. Ms Adams considered that what was known of Y&#8217;s mental health and its relationship to court related matters meant her assessment was that court ordered time for X to spend time with W would impede her recovery, which represents further cumulative adversity for X bearing in mind the background of her parent&#8217;s separation, local authority referrals and this application being the third set of proceedings concerning X.</p>

Consequently, she had concerns about whether he would in fact follow any professional advice with the result that she considers that there is a real risk he would soon seek more. When asked why she had not referred to any research about the benefits for children of contact with their genetic parent she responded saying she was fully aware of the benefits for children to have access to information about their parentage but such studies do not dictate the outcome, there is a need to look at the relevant issues in each particular case.</p>

By introducing W at this stage could risk her welfare, as it may undermine her relationship with her parents and risk her current emotional stability. In her view it would be better in this case to follow X&#8217;s thinking rather than risk the impact on her welfare of any re-ordering of her current established relationships. She did not equate introducing W was the same as the mother&#8217;s new partners. When W explored whether any self-assessment tool could be exaggerated Ms Adams said she did not consider that to be the case in her discussions with Y, she considered the way Y talked about her difficulties led her to form the view they were genuine difficulties.</p>

I have no doubt she will continue to support X in this sensitive and age appropriate way which meets X&#8217;s welfare needs.

For example, he sought to question Y during this hearing about why she had withdrawn from that arrangement. That raises the real risk that if he did have any time with X it is very likely he would seek an increase in the time and his involvement in X&#8217;s life, which would, in my judgment, put at risk her current stability.</p>

He maintained his position that he regarded the orders that he sought as X&#8217;s right and how he should be treated the same as other donor fathers in his position. I have fully taken into account the fact that he is a litigant in person although he has shown no difficulty in engaging with these proceedings and articulating his position in his documents, and to the court in his evidence and during the hearing. However, his somewhat blinkered reliance on general rights has meant he has been unable to engage with X&#8217;s reality now and the steps Y is taking to assist her. Although he has said he would follow professional advice there is a real risk that he would only follow it if it was what he agreed with.</p>
