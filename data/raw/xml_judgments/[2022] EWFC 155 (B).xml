The wife has incurred, in the course of these proceedings, a total of &#163;419,894 in legal costs and the husband a total of &#163;375,337. It is sad to note that nearly &#163;800,000 of family money has been spent on lawyers in a case which was, from the position of an objective observer, readily settleable. As ever, it is difficult (indeed impossible) for the trial judge, who must remain unaware of the without prejudice negotiating positions and the course of the FDR, to make any meaningful assessment of why no compromise was ever reached.</p>

Parties signing statements and Solicitors drafting statements should pay proper heed to the remarks of Peel J in <span style="font-style:italic">WH v HC </span><span style="color:#000000">[2022] EWFC 22</span>: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Parties, and their legal advisers, may be under the impression that to describe the other party in pejorative terms, and seek to paint an unfavourable picture, will assist their case. It is high time that parties and their lawyers disabuse themselves of this erroneous notion. Judges will deal with relevant evidence, and will not base decisions on alleged moral turpitude.&#8221;</span></p>

She comes from a family with Arabic heritage, and was born in another European country, but she was brought up in the USA and resided in the USA until late 2006, only moving to England with the husband after the marriage. My overall impression is that, notwithstanding the international flavour of her life since 2006, and her dual UK and USA citizenship, her heart lies firmly in the USA. She is a pleasant, impressive, intelligent, able and educated individual, appropriately proud of having attained an MBA from Wharton Business School in Pennsylvania (thought by many, including the wife, to be the finest business school in the world), and (as I shall develop further below) had a highly successful career in the world of investment finance before 2008 in the USA (and latterly in the UK) which has not been pursued since 2008.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">They met in London and started a relationship in May 2003. It is common ground that, initially, this was largely a trans-Atlantic relationship, with the wife living in New York and the husband in London and visiting each other only for such fleeting times as they could fit around their work; but it is common ground that it was a loving and intimate and emotionally committed relationship from an early stage. It is common ground that in about August 2004 the husband relocated to New York to enable him to pursue the relationship more easily. There is a dispute which I need to resolve as to whether this became a relationship of cohabitation when he arrived in New York in August 2004 (as the husband contends) or only later when they became engaged in January 2006 (as the wife contends). On that issue I want to make the following comments:-</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in">In broad terms it is the wife&#8217;s case that (for personal and moral reasons, and notwithstanding that they were in a loving and intimate relationship from even earlier than August 2004) she did not contemplate cohabiting with the husband prior to formal engagement and that, whilst he spent an average of two or three nights per week with her at her flat before January 2006, and sometimes as much as four, they were definitely not cohabiting as such until January 2006.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:0.12in">In broad terms it is the husband&#8217;s case that the parties commenced full cohabitation as soon as he reached New York in August 2004. He accepts that he did rent a room for $1,000 per month in another apartment nearby from August 2004 until early 2006, but this (he says) was a formality required of him by the wife to be able to present a picture of non-cohabitation to the wife&#8217;s father, who was thought to have personal, moral or possibly religious objections to pre-marital cohabitation. He told me he only actually stayed in this rented room about 15 nights in the period he rented it. In his view they were in all senses a cohabiting couple throughout this period.</p>

It is an instinctive response to a given set of facts. Ultimately it is grounded in social and moral values&#8230;This element of fairness reflects the fact that to greater or lesser extent every relationship of marriage gives rise to a relationship of interdependence. The parties share the roles of money-earner, home-maker and child-carer. Mutual dependence begets mutual obligations of support. When the marriage ends fairness requires that the assets of the parties should be divided primarily so as to make provision for the parties' housing and financial needs...&#160;In most cases the search for fairness largely begins and ends at this stage&#8230;Another strand, recognised more explicitly now than formerly, is compensation. This is aimed at redressing any significant prospective economic disparity between the parties arising from the way they conducted their marriage. For instance, the parties may have arranged their affairs in a way which has greatly advantaged the husband in terms of his earning capacity but left the wife severely handicapped so far as her own earning capacity is concerned. Then the wife suffers a double loss: a diminution in her earning capacity and the loss of a share in her husband's enhanced income. This is often the case. Although less marked than in the past, women may still suffer a disproportionate financial loss on the breakdown of a marriage because of their traditional role as home-maker and child-carer&#8230;Compensation and financial needs often overlap in practice, so double-counting has to be avoided. But they are distinct concepts, and they are far from co-terminous. A claimant wife may be able to earn her own living but she may still be entitled to a measure of compensation&#8230;A third strand is sharing. This 'equal sharing' principle derives from the basic concept of equality permeating a marriage as understood today...This is now recognised widely, if not universally. The parties commit themselves to sharing their lives. They live and work together. When their partnership ends each is entitled to an equal share of the assets of the partnership, unless there is a good reason to the contrary</span><span style="color:#000000">.&#8221; </span></p>

In my view there are at least three. Any or all of them might supply such a reason, although one must be careful to avoid double counting&#8230;The most common rationale is that&#160;the relationship has generated needs&#160;which it is right that the other party should meet. In the great majority of cases, the court is trying to ensure that each party and their children have enough to supply their needs, set at a level as close as possible to the standard of living which they enjoyed during the marriage&#8230;&#160;A second rationale, which is closely related to need, is&#160;compensation for relationship-generated disadvantage. Indeed, some consider that provision for need is compensation for relationship-generated disadvantage. But the economic disadvantage generated by the relationship may go beyond need, however generously interpreted. The best example is a wife, like Mrs McFarlane, who has given up what would very probably have been a lucrative and successful career. If the other party, who has been the beneficiary of the choices made during the marriage, is a high earner with a substantial surplus over what is required to meet both parties' needs, then a premium above needs can reflect that relationship-generated disadvantage. A third rationale is&#160;the sharing of the fruits of the matrimonial partnership.&#160;Of course, an equal partnership does not necessarily dictate an equal sharing of the assets&#8230;.But there are many cases in which the approach of roughly equal sharing of partnership assets with no continuing claims one against the other is nowadays entirely feasible and fair&#8230;&#160;Thus far, in common with my noble and learned friend, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, I have identified three principles which might guide the court in making an award: need (generously interpreted), compensation, and sharing. I agree that there cannot be a hard and fast rule about whether one starts with equal sharing and departs if need or compensation supply a reason to do so, or whether one starts with need and compensation and shares the balance. Much will depend upon how far future income is to be shared as well as current assets. In general, it can be assumed that the marital partnership does not stay alive for the purpose of sharing future resources unless this is justified by need or compensation. The ultimate objective is to give each party an equal start on the road to independent living.&#8221;</span></p>

The strength of this argument is weakened by my findings in relation to the commencement of the relationship and it is not at all clear on the evidence how much of these investments should be treated as pre-dating August 2004 as opposed to a later date. Further, and also significantly, is the fact that the husband similarly accrued some of his valuable pension prior to 2004 (it is currently worth &#163;1,023,826 and he started accruing the pension in 1999). If I were to deduct a straight-line portion of his pension (although this might not be fair because he has not accrued it on a straight-line basis, there is no evidence to assist any different calculation) this would remove a significant amount to set off against whatever the correct figures were for the wife. I find myself unattracted by the proposition (advanced by the wife) that I should deduct from one side and not the other. In my view the search for fairness here is best served, absent any detailed expert accountancy evidence and after this long marriage, by leaving in all of these assets in my schedule and subjecting them all to the sharing principle.</span></p>

Both are looking for a good country home in the vicinity of the city in which they live or possibly further West in the context of B&#8217;s attendance at boarding school. The husband contended for a mutual housing need of c. &#163;2,000,000. The wife contended for a mutual housing need of c &#163;3,000,000. I sensed both contentions had an element of strategic positioning rather than genuine attempts at assessing need. As ever, the selection of a home takes into account location, size, appearance, decorative state, number of bedrooms and no doubt other things and it is not for the court to select a particular property, but overall my conclusion is that a housing fund of c. &#163;2,500,000 each (including the costs of purchase) would provide a generously suitable home for each of the parties.</p>

For me, these had the feel of lawyers&#8217; strategic padding and I decline to include them under the heading of capital need. I take the same view about the asserted need of &#163;919,427 for a second home in  America &#8211; if she does remain living in the UK (and she may well not once the children have left school) then it is reasonable for her to have good holidays in the USA each year, but there is no need for the ownership of a second home. </p>

Inevitably this case has involved the usual &#8216;battle of the budgets&#8217;. Again, I sensed a significant element of strategic forensic positioning in the way each side put forward its figures; but this comment particularly applies here to the wife. The reality here is that this high income family did not generally live a hugely high spending lifestyle. To their credit they generally spent sensibly and saved a good deal, which is why they have a substantial amount of capital at this stage. My sense was that the wife&#8217;s proposed annual expenditure budget of &#163;331,885 for herself and the children when with her (living mortgage-free and not including any school fees) was far in excess of anything which could reasonably be described as a &#8216;needs&#8217; budget in the context of the standard of living which had been enjoyed during the marriage.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On a very broad analysis, if the wife never earned another penny in her lifetime, the equal capital division discussed above would leave her with investment funds (including pensions) of just short of &#163;4,000,000 to fund her living expenses for the remainder of her life. In very broad Duxbury terms this would provide (using At a Glance tables) an income for life of c. &#163;175,000 per annum net. In my view it could not sensibly be argued in this case that the wife has income needs above that figure. Indeed, I would probably place the figure rather lower than this and in addition, as I shall set out in more detail below, I do not accept that it is reasonable to assume that the wife will never earn another penny in her lifetime. Further, she will have the benefit of child periodical payments to supplement her income while the children are in education.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span class="within-new" style="color:initial">The husband has taken every opportunity to suggest that this income is heading on an alarmingly downwards spiral. A key client of his died in 2021. The husband was unwell for a while in 2021 and has a bad back as well. He has informed the bank that he wants to take four weeks unpaid leave each year with his children. At age 48 he is getting to the end of his career in a young person&#8217;s business. His &#8216;book of business&#8217; has been partially distributed to others. He has been warned that the January 2023 meeting will give him bad news. It may be that there is something in some or even all of these pessimistic observations, but (as Mr Calhaem was able to establish in cross-examination) he has something of a record for making unduly pessimistic predictions and I sense some significant strategic positioning here as well. Even if his income falls to some extent in the years ahead, I don&#8217;t think it is unreasonable to predict that (unless he chooses otherwise) he will most likely remain by most standards a very high earner for a significant number of years ahead. As Mr Calhaem has illustrated, even if he retires at age 60, or even age 55, he should still have been able to save a good deal of money from his substantial surplus of income over expenses, even assuming that he pays full child maintenance and child education costs.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is correct, as Ms Faggionato has submitted, that there was a diminution in the wife&#8217;s income in 2007; but it seems to me that this was mostly attributable to her move to London in December 2006 to be with her new husband and her move from the American bank to the English bank (which was also hampered by the effects of the global financial crisis at that time). In 2008 the wife was pregnant with A, then took maternity leave and was then made redundant by the English bank and the wife has never worked in this field again. It was, for me, an unfortunate feature of the husband&#8217;s presentation that he urged that I should somehow conclude from the events of 2007 and 2008 that the wife had lost her way and lost her status as a potential high earner. I have little doubt that the wife remained a potentially high earner and the reasons for the loss of her position were first the move to London to be with the husband and secondly the arrival of her first child in 2008 and her decision to devote herself to the child-care role &#8211; both in my view relationship-generated sacrifices by the wife. If neither of these things had happened, I am satisfied that she would have remained a very high earner, probably in New York. </p>

In this context the letter sent by the husband to his employers in 2011 in the context of negotiations about his remuneration after the move between Middle East countries is, in my view, of significance.

It does not follow from this that she has no earning capacity at all or even no earning capacity beyond that which she could earn through her company. She is intelligent, resilient and well qualified in business, still not old and in reasonable health and her need to be devoting time to child-care is diminishing and will diminish further when B becomes a boarding pupil next year. Although there was little evidence before me targeted towards this, I would suggest that, if she so decided, it is more likely than not that the wife could find remunerative employment at perhaps &#163;50,000 per annum gross in a business-related employment and quite possibly significantly more than that.</p>

The language of the House of Lords appears to reflect this concept in that they speak of "handicap" or "sacrifice" of "suffering a loss" or "economic disadvantage". But in any usual situation where compensation is claimed the victim is not an active enthusiastic voluntary participant in the events that give rise to the claim. True, in a negligence claim contributory negligence can reduce the damages, but even there it can hardly be said that the victim was an active volunteer. Lady Hale recognises this strange aspect of this type of compensation claim in para 138 where she said "all couples throughout their lives together have to make choices about who will do what ... sometimes freely made in the interests of them both. The needs generated by such choices are a perfectly sound rationale for adjusting the parties' respective resources in compensation" and in para 154 where she said "the fact that she might have wanted to do this is neither here nor there"&#8230;I would have thought the free choice made by the claimant to give up work was the dominant consideration. While it was true that her decision was agreed with Mr McFarlane, the reason Mrs McFarlane gave up work was because she decided to give up work. No-one forced her to give up work. She was not browbeaten by Mr McFarlane to give up work. Her motives for giving up work seem to me to be irrelevant. Perhaps she was driven by an intense maternal instinct. Perhaps she was bored with her high-flying job and saw a life being supported by Mr McFarlane bringing up her children as more comfortable. Perhaps she wanted to do something else. Her motives seem to me to be irrelevant. At the end of the day, however, what cannot be disputed is that the reason Mrs McFarlane gave up work was because she, an intelligent liberated autonomous adult woman, decided to give up work. I cannot see how that can be characterised as a loss "suffered" by her entitling her to an award in excess of her reasonable needs.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite this line of authorities discouraging the pursuit of compensation claims, I have found Moor J&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">RC v JC</span><span style="color:#000000"> [2020] EWHC 466 to be the most resonant and applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case the court held that, prior to the marriage, the wife had been on a clear path to becoming a partner in a magic circle Solicitors&#8217; firm and would in all probability have become a very high earner. Instead, she became a child-carer for the family on the arrival of children and her high earning prospects were accordingly extinguished by a relationship-generated sacrifice. The husband continued his high level, high earning, work through the marriage, a capital pool was duly established and it was likely that he would continue to earn at a high level for at least another four years after the court hearing. On the application of the sharing principle an equal division of assets would produce for the wife a fund of &#163;4,850,000. This would be sufficient to meet her housing needs of &#163;2,500,000 and income needs through a Duxbury fund (including some pensions) of &#163;2,350,000. The court could not justify any needs-based outcome greater than the sharing outcome; but Moor J went on to consider whether it was appropriate to make a discrete compensation award, and decided to do so in the sum of &#163;400,000 and, in so doing, expressed the following views:-</span></p>

I accept Mr Bishop's submission that there have not been many successful claims for compensation for relationship generated disadvantage. In my view, this is, primarily, because, even if there is sufficient evidence of loss, a respondent can either argue that the applicant would never have been able to earn as much as they are going to be awarded from their share of the marital assets or that the assets and income are insufficient to do more than cover the parties' needs. Equally, I remind myself that an earning capacity is not capable of being a matrimonial asset to which the sharing principle applies. A spouse is not, therefore, entitled to share it going forward </span><span style="font-style:italic">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Waggott v&#160;Waggott</span><span style="font-style:italic">&#160;</span><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2018/727.html" title="Link to BAILII version" style="font-style:italic">[2018] EWCA Civ 727</a><span style="font-style:italic">). </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">If I take the view that the Wife has satisfied me that there was relationship generated disadvantage, I am clear that I must comply with section 25A and see if I can reflect that disadvantage fairly within the capital division such that a clean break can still be achieved&#8230; Finally, I turn to compensation for relationship generated disadvantage. I have found quantification of this claim very difficult. First, I am satisfied that I should take the Husband's future working life at four years until he has attained twenty years in the partnership. His income is likely to fall during that period and he will have an obligation to maintain the children both as to their maintenance and their school fees for a considerable number of years thereafter&#8230;I have formed the very clear view that there should be a clean break in this case. The Wife has already benefited from the Husband's earnings since she gave up work until now, given my equal division of the assets. I am clear that, when I look at relationship generated disadvantage, it is the next four years that I have to consider&#8230;I have come to the conclusion that an appropriate sum to award for relationship generated disadvantage, over and above her half share of the assets, is the sum of &#163;400,000. Whilst this could be portrayed as being an additional &#163;100,000 per annum for the likely remainder of the Husband's time at the firm, it will be paid up front on the sale of the former matrimonial home&#8230;Exceptionally, in this case, I have found there to have been relationship generated disadvantage sufficient to justify an award of compensation. I continue to be of the view that such cases will be very much the exception rather than the rule. It is rare to be able to make the findings of fact that I have made in this case. Even having done so, I have been clear that the case remains a suitable one for a clean break with, by the standards of such cases, a relatively modest additional award. I have already made the point that, in many of these cases, the assets will be such that any loss is already covered by the applicant's sharing claim. In other cases, the assets/income will be insufficient to justify such a claim in the first place. It follows that litigants should think long and hard before launching a claim for relationship generated disadvantage and they should not take this judgment as any sort of "green light" to do so unless the circumstances are truly exceptional.&#8221;</span></p>

I have no difficulty on the facts of this case in concluding that the wife has made a relationship-generated sacrifice of her high earning career in investment finance to devote herself to supporting her husband&#8217;s career choices and providing child-care for her children. I have concluded that, whilst she should be able to find reasonable work now, this is very unlikely to get her back to anything like where she would have been if she had not made that relationship-generated sacrifice.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">How should this compensation claim be quantified? Like Moor J, I have found this the most difficult part of the exercise. The award must reflect the fact that the wife in this case has to a significant extent benefited through the sharing exercise from the upside of her sacrifice &#8211; the accretion of capital from the husband&#8217;s high earnings, including the fruits of the absence of income tax in the Middle East. I must take care not to fix the award in a way which amounts to a sharing award of the husband&#8217;s high income. I bear in mind that the wife made a voluntary choice to do what she did with her career. Although a compensation claim is an income-related claim I need to bear in mind the statutory steer in favour of a clean break arising from Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, section 25A &#8211; and there is enough capital in the husband&#8217;s hands to achieve this fairly. In the end I have concluded that I should broadly follow a similar route to the one adopted by Moor J in relation to the wife&#8217;s compensation claim. To achieve a fair outcome I propose to add five tranches of &#163;100,000, a total of &#163;500,000 to the wife&#8217;s award and to order that they be paid now as a lump sum on a clean break basis.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground that the husband will pay all future school fees for both children, but there is a difference of view about university tuition fees. The issue is complicated by the fact that there might very well be a difference of opinion as to whether the children should pursue their tertiary education in the UK or the USA. Typically, tuition fees are cheaper in the UK and there is usually a government loan available. In the USA tuition fees are typically much more expensive, but there are not infrequently scholarships available. Further, especially in B&#8217;s case, decisions about tertiary education are some years away and the respective income positions may look very different when the time comes to make those decisions. For me to make an all-encompassing order now for the husband to pay university tuition fees, whatever they may be, I fear runs the risk of pre-judging the sensible child-focused decision which should be made at that time. In the circumstances I propose to make an order which leaves open the question of how university tuition fees are funded to be decided as and when the time arrives. I trust that these two well-educated and intelligent adults, who love their children dearly, will make sure that their differences do not in due course get in the way of the children&#8217;s obvious needs to engage in suitable and good quality tertiary education. </p>
