	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">Does the Court of Protection have power to make an order which authorises that a person who is not a child (ie who has attained the age of 18) may be deprived of his liberty in premises which are a children&#8217;s home as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref> and are subject to the Children&#8217;s Homes Regulations 2001 (as amended)?</p>

	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.47in">Both parties and their counsel in these proceedings submit that the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;.  I agree with them that the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I wish to stress at once the scope of that question which I have precisely drafted.  This judgment and my answer to the question applies only in the case of a person who is not a child, that is, who has attained the age of 18.  This judgment says nothing at all in relation to a person who has not attained the age of 18, and in particular to persons between the ages of 16 and 18.  Further, this judgment is only concerned with a person in a children&#8217;s home, and says nothing at all with regard to a person who may be detained in a residential school.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I also wish to emphasise that both parties and their counsel who are before me in this case are agreed upon the answer to that question and the reasons for the answer.  In other words, I have not heard any argument or submissions to the contrary.  If, in some other case, on a future date, some party wishes to argue to the contrary, then of course that limitation or reservation upon the value of this ex tempore judgment as a precedent may be noted.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The reason why the question has been posed appears to derive from two relatively recent developments.  The first development is the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West</span> case.  The explanation given in that case by Baroness Hale of Richmond as to the scope or breadth of the concept of a deprivation of liberty has led to a concern that a significant number of people are, or may be, being deprived of their liberty who were not previously thought to have been.  As is well known, this has led to a very large number of applications to the Court of Protection in order to seek authorisations for the deprivation of liberty.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The second development is a document headed &#8220;Deprivation of Liberty &#8211; Guidance for Providers of Children&#8217;s Homes and Residential Special Schools&#8221; dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;February&#160;2014 and issued jointly by the President of the Court of Protection and the National Director Social Care OFSTED.  It appears that as a result of that guidance document there has been, or is, uncertainty on the part of many lawyers and providers in this field as to the scope or extent of any power of the Court of Protection to authorise, when appropriate, the deprivation of liberty of certain categories of person who are accommodated in children&#8217;s homes or residential special schools.  As the above defined question indicates, that concern has arisen in the present case, but I know that it is much more widespread as a result of the circumstances which I now describe.  </p>

Some of the counsel who appear before me in this case today were also engaged at that hearing.  I understand that that hearing involved at least six different local authorities and, astonishingly, around 15 advocates.  I understand that it concerned a number of issues of general public importance in relation to children or young persons in this broad context.  The President reserved, and as of today has not yet delivered, his judgment.</p>

One of the counsel appearing before The President, Ms&#160;Natalia&#160;Perrett, made reference to the present case.  At page 65, line 69, of the verbatim transcript of that hearing she said:  </p>

In a passage at the top of page 67 the President said:  </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.91in;margin-right:0.38in">&#8220;&#8230;It may be that, subject to Holman J&#8217;s approval, the way to participate would be to put in written submissions.  There is a whole range of ways in which to participate but I think the practical way forward is for you to discuss that and try to come to some sensible solution.  I am sure that&#8230; if you and the others involved come up with an agreed solution which does not affect the overall timescale and does not imperil the hearing&#8230; Holman J would be content to go along with it.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.47in">In that short passage I would wish to stress the reference by the President himself to not affecting the overall timescale, viz. of the present case, and not imperilling the hearing of the present case.  </p>

If they are being deprived of their liberty, that in turn raises further issues as to how any such deprivation of liberty is to be authorised.  This involves a careful consideration of the terms of the Children&#8217;s Homes Regulations 2001, the Education (Non-Maintained Special Schools) (England) Regulations 2011, and the National Minimum Standards for Children&#8217;s Homes and Residential Special Schools.  For children over the age of 16, it may also raise issues as to the terms of the joint guidance published by OFSTED and the President of the Court of Protection in February 2014. </p>

By way of example only, as at 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;March&#160;2014, there were more than 6,500 over 16 year olds residing in care homes, children&#8217;s homes or residential special schools.

I understand that this case is to be heard before Mr Justice Holman tomorrow, on Wednesday, 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.  The judge kindly granted permission for the parties to disclose copies of their skeleton arguments to the Secretary of State so that my client could consider whether he wished to intervene in this case.  The skeleton argument on behalf of the local authority was provided on Thursday, 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June, and the skeleton for P was provided to the Secretary of State yesterday, on Monday, 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2014.</p>

The Secretary of State understands that it is common ground in this case that the Children&#8217;s Homes Regulations 2001 and the National Minimum Standards for Children&#8217;s Homes do not apply to P, as she is no longer a child, being more than 18 years of age.  It is also common ground between the parties that the Court of Protection therefore has jurisdiction to authorise P&#8217;s deprivation of liberty in her current placement.</p>

However, he reserves the right to make submissions on the correct interpretation of the regulations and the National Minimum Standards in any future case where this may arise.&#8221;</p>

There are a number of other parties to that case, namely the Westminster City Council, and the mother of the person concerned, and the  providers of the place where the patient in that case currently resides and may be being deprived of her liberty.  So this is a very last minute application, made only yesterday, and I have absolutely no idea what the position is of the other parties to those proceedings to the proposition that their case should be consolidated or linked with the present case.  </p>

Since the Westminster City Council case, as its name indicates, is entirely located in London, it is probable that the present case would have to be transferred, at least temporarily, to London, and in no time at all the parties to the present proceedings would be sucked into expensive and delaying procedures far away in London.  Since there is complete unanimity between the parties and their counsel in the present proceedings as to the outcome and also as to the relevant law, it seems to me that that would be highly undesirable, and indeed would have the adverse effect of affecting the overall timetable and imperilling the present hearing, which was highlighted by the President himself on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June in a passage that I have already quoted at paragraph 9 above.</p>

Bizarrely, if I were to allow the application made by the Official Solicitor and Mr Hallin to consolidate, adjourn and transfer for some set piece hearing in London, it might well eventuate that the patient in the present proceedings had already moved on from the children&#8217;s home in question before that hearing had taken place.</p>

It concerns a young woman, SG, who was born in early June 1995.  Today she is in fact now 19.  She was born in Romania and was apparently rapidly abandoned by her parents and taken to a state orphanage there.  The first few years of her life appear to have lacked human affection and natural processes of bonding or attachment.  When she was about 4 she was adopted by an English couple, who are, of course, now her parents.</p>

She certainly has learning disability, a disinhibited attachment disorder, and quasi autism.  Features of her condition have always been hypersensitivity to external stimuli, and challenging behaviour.  More recently there has been a tragic history of self harm.  Her childhood has, as a result, been very disrupted.  She attended, but was removed from, various schools.  She has had to spend long periods in hospitals.  More recently she was placed in children&#8217;s homes.  Challenging behaviour towards staff, absconding, damaging property, episodes of self harm and hitting out at her father have all been recorded.  </p>

However, now that she has attained the age of 18 and is indeed now 19, it is completely recognised by the responsible local authority, in agreement with her parents, that arrangements must be made to enable her to move on to what is described as &#8220;supported living&#8221; in the community.  This will take time to identify and set up, and, I have no doubt, considerable funding issues will need to be addressed.  The local authority need to find a provider who will purchase or otherwise make available a suitable property and recruit a sufficient number of staff to care for her and keep her safe.  The plan is that some premises will be found in which she can live together with a small number of other young women with similar needs.  I have been told in the words of the skeleton argument on behalf of the local authority that:</p>

There, too, she is the subject of very considerable staffing on a 3:1 basis.  The staffing includes monitoring her while she is in the bathroom (ensuring her dignity is maintained at all times), locking the front door as a preventative measure, following, observing and monitoring her on visits into the community, and if she &#8220;attempts to leave the staff supporting her, they should follow several paces behind her and attempt to maintain conversation.&#8221;  Items which may be used for self harm will be removed, and she remains supported 3:1 during the day and 2:1 during the night.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.31in;margin-right:0.42in">The Court of Protection should be reminded by the parties of the regulations that apply to children&#8217;s homes and residential special schools.  The Court of Protection does not have the jurisdiction to require any home or school to act in breach of such regulations or to authorise any such breach.  Accordingly, the Court of Protection should not make an order authorising a plan for the care and supervision involving the detention of a person, where to do so would involve the children&#8217;s home or a residential special school breaching the regulations that apply to it.  If compliance with an order of the Court of Protection would involve such a breach of the relevant Regulations it cannot be relied on to justify breach of the Regulations or enforced in a manner that would involve such a breach.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Pausing there, that paragraph contains, if I may respectfully say so, no more than a legal truism.  Regulations have the force of law, and no court, frankly, in any circumstances that I can readily think of, can authorise a person or body to act in a way that contravenes a regulation, or still less a statute, so as to be in breach of the regulation or statute.  On a careful reading of that paragraph of the guidance, it ultimately says no more than that.  The question, therefore, in any case is whether what the Court of Protection is otherwise being asked to authorise would amount to a &#8220;breach&#8221; of some regulation.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Pausing there, it is possible (I put it no higher than that) that the accuracy of that part of the guidance is more debatable.  It may beg the question of whether paragraph 17A(1)(c) of the regulations is a platform or a ceiling.   But that is territory into which I simply should not and do not venture in the present case because paragraph 4 of the guidance is directed to &#8220;a child&#8221; and, as I have stressed, the patient in this case is not a child.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The essential point and difficulty that has been raised by this case, and maybe a large number of other cases, is that readers of the guidance have understood it to be preclude any resort to the Court of Protection at all, in any circumstances in which the premises in which a person (whether a child or an adult) is residing or detained happen to be premises which are a children&#8217;s home as defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref>.  It is, however, necessary to stress and emphasise yet again that the point that has been made in both paragraphs 3 and 4 of the guidance is that the Court of Protection cannot authorise an act which would involve or represent a breach of the regulations.  That simply does not arise and is not in point in any case in which the person concerned has attained the age of 18.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I will not quote at length from the various other regulations within Chapter 1 of Part III of the Children&#8217;s Homes Regulations 2001, but any reader of them can see that regulation 11, which is concerned with promotion of welfare, refers repeatedly to &#8220;children&#8221;.  Regulation 17, which relates to &#8220;Behaviour, management and discipline&#8221;, refers repeatedly to &#8220;children&#8221; or &#8220;a child&#8221;.  I have already quoted regulation 17A (1), and pointed out that that refers repeatedly and exclusively to &#8220;a child&#8221;.  So also does regulation 17A(2).  Regulation 17B, which is concerned with &#8220;Policies and Records&#8221;, refers again and again to a &#8220;child&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The short and simple point is that the relevant parts of the Children&#8217;s Homes Regulations 2001 simply do not apply at all in the case of a person who is no longer a child.  It may often happen, as it has happened in this case, that the premises in which a person, now adult, resides or is detained happen also to be a children&#8217;s home.   But it frankly makes no difference whether the premises themselves are a children&#8217;s home or are some dedicated premises that have been provided in the community under the kind of &#8220;supported living model&#8221; contemplated for this very patient in this very case.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In my view, the Court of Protection has undoubted power in the present case to make, if appropriate, an order authorising the deprivation of liberty.  Further, it is the duty of the person or body, in this case the local authority, who is or are depriving the patient of his liberty, to apply to the court for an authorisation; and, indeed, the duty of the court to make such authorisation as in its discretion and on the fact and in the circumstances of the case it considers appropriate.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In the present case it is common ground, and there is abundant evidence to support the proposition, that this patient lacks capacity to litigate and to make decisions as to her care and residence, and that it is in her best interests to continue for the time being to reside in the premises which are a children&#8217;s home in which she has been residing for some time, and that the deprivation of her liberty which is involved should be authorised.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">So for those reasons I, myself, answer the question posed in paragraph 2 above as &#8220;yes&#8221;, and there will be an order which records that the court does consider that neither the Children&#8217;s Homes Regulations 2001 nor the joint guidance issued by the President of the Court of Protection and OFSTED dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 prevent the Court of Protection from authorising under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> that a person who is an adult (viz. over the age of 18) may be deprived of his liberty in premises which are a children&#8217;s home.  There will be appropriate declarations as to the lack of capacity and best interests of the patient and authorising the deprivation of her liberty; and I now transfer this matter back to the Court of Protection sitting in Liverpool where future decision making will be resumed after an appropriate interval by the local district judge there.</p>
