	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">This appeal raises a short, but not unimportant, point upon the justification for a court granting an interim secure accommodation order in circumstances where the making of a final secure accommodation order might well be justified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The factual background need only be shortly stated. The young person concerned is &#8216;M&#8217; born on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 1992, and therefore now aged 15 years. M was made the subject of a full care order on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2005. As a result of serious concerns about her behaviour, which included stabbing another resident at a children&#8217;s home in September 2007, she was made the subject of an interim secure accommodation order by the Birmingham FPC on the 20th September 2007. That order expired on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2007 and was replaced by a final secure accommodation order which was due to expire on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2007. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">On 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2007 the Local Authority issued a fresh application for a further three month secure accommodation order. That application came before the justices on the 20th December 2007. Following a consideration of the evidence and submissions by advocates for the local authority and for M, the justices made an interim secure accommodation order for three months, adjourning the case to 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2008 &#8216;for further directions with a time estimate of 2 hours&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The local authority now appeals against that decision and asserts that a final secure accommodation order for three months should have been made at the hearing on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December. The appeal is opposed by counsel taking instructions on behalf of M&#8217;s guardian.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">It is accepted that the issues raised by the local authority relate to current practice in relation to secure accommodation applications and have implications that go further than the simple factual boundaries of this case. At the beginning of the appeal hearing I therefore gave the authority permission to appeal out of time. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">As will be apparent, the case argued for on behalf of M&#8217;s guardian potentially has significant resource implications for CAFCASS nationally. Senior management in CAFCASS had not been made aware of the appeal, and the guardian&#8217;s stance, and I therefore made arrangements at the close of the oral hearing for the papers to be disclosed to CAFCASS legal in order to provide the agency with an opportunity to make written representations. In due course Penny Logan, a senior lawyer with CAFCASS Legal, filed a Skeleton Argument setting out CAFCASS&#8217; position.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">At the hearing in December there was no dispute that the criteria for making a secure accommodation order were established in relation to M. There was also agreement as to the care plan for M, which included a programme of assessment and the development of a &#8216;mobility plan&#8217; to enable her to leave accommodation at the end of the three month period. It was also accepted that any order should be in place for three months by the end of which time it was anticipated that M would be able to be free from any further secure accommodation order. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The local authority&#8217;s case is that the justices used the device of making an interim order, in a case which would otherwise have justified a final order, solely in order to keep the children&#8217;s guardian and M&#8217;s solicitor in post during the currency of the order so that they might monitor the implementation of the care plan, and if necessary, support M through the process. The local authority assert that the use of an interim order in those circumstances was impermissible and plainly wrong.</p>

We understand that Mr O&#8217;H, solicitor for M who was previously appointed in these proceedings, has been re-appointed for this application. Likewise the same child&#8217;s guardian, DP, has been re-appointed but she has been out of the country on annual holiday and has no knowledge of the current application. On behalf of M, Mr S (counsel) concedes that the criteria for making a secure accommodation order is satisfied pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(1)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Mr S also accepts that the court order should be for a three month period. The dispute for us to adjudicate on today is whether the order should be a final order or an interim order&#8217;. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8216;We are concerned that if we make a final three month secure accommodation order today, this would have the effect of discharging both the appointment of the solicitor and of the guardian. This does not seem to us to be a sensible course of action, particularly bearing in mind that M is only 15 years old and is a very vulnerable young woman. Furthermore if there are difficulties with the completion of the reports from the two doctors within the expected times scale and the &#8216;mobility&#8217; does not go smoothly we deem it appropriate that both the solicitor and guardian would still be involved in the case to help and assist M. This can only be achieved by making an interim secure accommodation order which we believe will be for the benefit of M and to safeguard her security&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">In September and October 2007 M had had the benefit of representation by a solicitor and a children&#8217;s guardian. For the December hearing the same solicitor was reappointed and, whilst unable to attend for the entirety of the hearing, had instructed counsel, Mr S, to represent M at the hearing. Unfortunately the children&#8217;s guardian, DP, was out of the county and unaware that the hearing was taking place. In any event at the hearing in December M, on being told of the care plan and that it included an element of  &#8216;mobility&#8217; (meaning that she would have time out away from the secure unit as the plan developed)  herself instructed her counsel that she agreed to the period of three months. Mr S was therefore able to tell the justices that the length of the order sought by the local authority, namely three months, was agreed on behalf of M. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Mr Piers Pressdee, counsel for the local authority, in a skeleton argument which is  a model of clarity, focuses in on his central point which is that, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25(5)</ref>, the power to make an interim order only arises if the court adjourns the hearing of the local authority application. Hence, he says, the first question for the justices&#8217; consideration should have been whether or not to adjourn the hearing, rather than whether or not to make an interim order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Mr Pressdee addresses these two points and invites the court to conclude that there was no need for an adjournment in order to achieve procedural fairness; the mother for understandable and acceptable reasons (which do not need to form part of this appeal judgment) was neither present nor represented and M was effectively represented through counsel and gave plain instructions which were sufficient to allow the case to proceed, further, there was no justification in adjourning the case for evidential purposes as the questions which the justices had to determine, namely whether the criteria were met, and, if so the period for which any order should be made, were not in dispute.   Indeed, Mr Pressdee says, that it is telling that within the adjournment order itself no directions were made by the justices other than simply setting the matter down for a further directions hearing in March. Thus, the local authority&#8217;s case is that there was no basis for adjourning the application.</p>

Against that submission the local authority argue that the fact that M wanted an interim order does not, of itself, give the court jurisdiction to adjourn the hearing and make an interim order if such an order is not legally permissible in any event. Dealing with that point in passing, the fact that the young person was insisting upon an interim order does not, of itself, give the court jurisdiction to grant one if it is otherwise impermissible to do so.</p>

CAFCASS submit that the guardian in this case had no opportunity to perform any duties and could not assist the court in the manner described by Hoffman LJ. CAFCASS further submits that this case cannot be said to fall into the &#8216;exceptional&#8217; category identified by Hoffman LJ which might justify an immediate final order being made at the first hearing. CAFCASS also question whether the justices were correct to make an order for three months at that hearing, given that the guardian was not yet involved in the case. In short, CAFCASS&#8217;s position is that it questions the proposition that the final order should have been made in a case which was not exceptional and where no guardian had effectively been appointed and it questions the proposition that an interim order for as long as three months was justified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">The court has been assisted by a further distillation of the local authority&#8217;s position in supplemental written submissions. Within those, the local authority (as it did orally) that a much shorter adjournment than that made would have been permissible to allow the Guardian to return to the country and carry out her statutory duties.

It is not to oversee the exercise by the local authority of its statutory duties, nor to perform some free-standing welfare role for the benefit of the child. It is not accordingly a proper use of the court&#8217;s power to prolong secure accommodation proceedings simply in order to keep a children&#8217;s guardian involved for the purposes of assisting the child, or overseeing the performance of the local authority&#8217;s statutory duties. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.89in">Applying those principles to the present case, I am satisfied that there were no grounds upon which the court could justify adjourning this application for a period of three months. The fact that the children&#8217;s guardian was unaware of the application, and had not been able to perform any of her duties in relation to it, was, however, a matter that did justify an adjournment for a shorter period. Depending upon the guardian&#8217;s circumstances, an adjournment for a period of, say, up to four weeks might have been appropriate. The purpose of the adjournment would be for the guardian to undertake her statutory duties and to provide a report for the assistance to the court. The judgement on this appeal is being given after the total period of three months set by the justices has in fact expired. It is therefore academic to consider what the court could or should have ordered at the expiration of a four week interim order, however, on the information that is available, it is extremely likely that a final order for a period of two months would then have been justified. </p>

The reason given by the justices (namely to maintain the appointment of the guardian and the solicitor for the child during the currency of the three month period in order to help and assist M) was not a permissible reason for making an interim order in the absence of any other proper justification for an adjournment. Further, for the same reasons, the period of three months chosen by the justices in order for the solicitor and the children&#8217;s guardian to remain in post whilst the local authority executed their care plan and move towards M&#8217;s mobility was also impermissible.</p>

Due to the timing of the appeal, and the acceptance by all sides that the value of the appeal was to achieve some clarity on the issue of principle, rather than affect the actual arrangements for M, the appropriate course for this court to take is simply to replace the justices order with a full final secure accommodation order for the same period of time, namely for three months from the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2007.</p>
