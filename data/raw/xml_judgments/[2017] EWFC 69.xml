The mother does not have the benefit of legal advice.  The Court has done its best, as have the other parties, to enable her to get such legal advice if she wanted it but on each occasion she has been clear, as she is perfectly entitled, to say she has considered the request and would prefer to be able to represent herself.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The court has had concern about that because of her relatively young age (she was 18 at the end of last year) and the nature of the proceedings. I am satisfied, from the two occasions that I have seen the mother, she has had the opportunity to be able to consider all the documents the court has, including the skeleton arguments that have been sent to her. She has spoken with eloquence and clarity about her position, about which she has remained entirely consistent.  So, despite the nature of the application and her relatively young age, I do not consider the court should consider delaying this matter any further to give her another opportunity to seek legal advice, as I am satisfied she has been given every opportunity for that to be done and for the reasons she has given, she has chosen not to take that up.</p>

The mother has not identified the birth father.  According to her, he is white British, had been adopted himself and they separated after the relationship had lasted about six months.  He knew she was pregnant.  He did not support the pregnancy continuing, as far as he knew she was going to have a termination.  In fact she did not as, according to her, it was too late for it to be done other than by way of a surgical procedure, which she did not wish to take place. She decided to continue with the pregnancy, but with only limited members of her family knowing about the position..</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">In July 2016, the mother and her mother, TT, contacted the Local Authority reporting that she was pregnant.  That was discovered following a scan on the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2016 which established that her pregnancy then was about 19 weeks.  She wished for her baby to be adopted. The case was transferred to the Duty and Assessment Team for allocation and pre-birth assessment. At that time, the mother did not want to disclose the name of X's father. A social worker was allocated, DS, and she saw the mother on three occasions in August, on two of those occasions with her mother, TT.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">During those visits, the mother was clear she had not been pressurised to relinquish the baby.  She was unable to care for the baby at her mother's home, due to the lack of space, she felt she was too young and unable to provide the baby with the love that she would receive from two parents. She considered that her child would be better off with a new family. This is the position she has maintained, and she did not want the birth father to know. She reported the birth father's reaction to discovering she was pregnant had been to storm out, prior to that he had researched ways for her to be able to have a miscarriage and had, in the early stages, on one occasion slapped her in the stomach.</p>

At that stage, the mother had the benefit of being allocated a social worker in her own right, MY, who has provided a statement dated the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016.  She had two meetings with the mother and TT prior to X's birth, in one they were accompanied by the adoption social worker.  Those meetings were to explore her reasons for her decision, to discuss the process that would take place and consider again her position in relation to identifying the birth father.  The mother remained clear she did not want him to be informed, she wanted the confidentiality that she had kept in relation to her position to be maintained.  </p>

She was content to remain on the ward with X until she, the mother, was ready for discharge.  She was discharged later that day and X was placed with her current carers, a foster adoptive placement under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</p>

At a meeting the next day, the mother said she wanted to know when she would meet with Cafcass to sign the forms.  She acknowledged candidly her mixed emotions at that time, that was missing X, wanting to hug her but was clear she had no intention of wanting to separate X from her current carers and remained clear she wanted X to have a better life than she felt able to give her.  She also referred, at that meeting, to tensions in the family home due to the difficult relationship she had with her stepfather.  </p>

Mother told me it was 'understood' between them all that she would seek a termination.  Mother said she and her mother looked into this but found she was too many weeks pregnant to just take a pill and she would have to travel to London for a surgical procedure.  Mother said she did not want to have that type of procedure.  Mother told me, 'They have assumed I have had an abortion.  They do not know I kept the baby'."</span></p>

I made directions requiring position statements to be filed and listed the matter for further hearing today.</p>

When she first discovered she was pregnant he had helped her write a letter to her mother to tell her about the pregnancy. That had resulted in the meeting taking place as described in MY's statement with the respective mothers, the mother and the birth father. The meeting ended, according to mother's statement, with her having to inform the father's mother when she had booked an appointment to have a termination and she said the father had stormed out.  She said her relationship had continued but according to the mother, he looked at ways to enable her to lose the baby and hit her in the stomach.</p>

The Court has an unfettered discretion to be exercised having regard to all the circumstances and in a manner compliant with the requirements of the Convention.  That said, and where there exists family life within the meaning of Article 8 as between the mother and the father, one generally requires strong countervailing factors or compelling reasons or cogent and compelling grounds to justify the exclusion from the adoption process of an unmarried father without parental responsibility, but at the end of the day every case is different and has to be decided having regard to its own unique circumstances."</span></p>

It may be that there is out there a father who would want to and be able to bring her up.  If her father cannot himself bring her up then it might nonetheless be appropriate for L to have contact with him, even if only indirect contact after she has been adopted, and even if she is to be adopted then for the purposes of life story work, L needs to know as much as possible about her father and his family so that, for example, she can in later life if she chooses to do so try and trace him.  Also, she needs the emotional security of knowing that all this was investigated along with any relevant medical, ethnic and financial inheritance matters before the final decision for her adoption was made.

She may well be correct about her fears regarding father's reaction, but it has to be recognised that she has limited or no information regarding the father's wider family, or his current circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">What this Court does have is information that the mother at the time was a young vulnerable woman, who has tried to make decisions in what she considers is in the best interests of X.  Her position is rational and reflective and no one has sought to criticise her for the actions and the steps that she has taken, save in the respect of not revealing the identity of the father. Despite the sensitive discussions on this topic that have taken place with the social workers, who have had discussions with her on behalf of the Local Authority, and Mr Shone, the mother has not wavered in her position.  The Local Authority, in particular, are to be commended for the way that they have managed this sensitive situation, providing  the appropriate balance of support and consideration of the issues that have been involved, but without putting undue pressure on this young mother.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Against that, the Court has to take into account the impact on X of having ceased to be, if she is adopted, a member of the original family and become an adopted person, how X may react to this knowing that the paternal family were not given the opportunity to give her the security that her welfare clearly requires.  How that will work with X is of course difficult to tell, although certainly the Court's advice has always been that it is important for children in X's situation to have as much information in relation to their origins as possible</p>

All the indications are that she is settled extremely well there, she has formed a secure bond with those that care for her and that position has Article 8 implications for X and her right to a family life with them.</p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">In considering what the Court should do in this situation, it has to balance the competing Article 8 rights of those with whom it is engaged. This is in the context of the birth father not knowing the existence of X and having no existing relationship with her.  He was aware of the pregnancy, but thought it had been terminated. As Miss Logan observes, he took no subsequent steps after that to make any enquiries about the position or, importantly, about the mother's welfare.  </p>

At the moment, only her mother knows the identity of her father and has refused to give that information, or to countenance any further enquiries being made.  Mother has been urged to reflect on her position which she has, but has maintained her view.  No party has sought to suggest any other steps can be taken to shed further light on this issue.  Any further delay, unless purposeful for X, is likely to be detrimental to her welfare.  </p>

	    <p class="BodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left:0.39in">I would just like to end with some final words.  It is of course a matter for the mother.  She should continue to reflect on her position and if she changes her mind and wishes to disclose who the father is, absolutely no one would criticise her for that step.  If she does do that, the position would need to be reviewed in the light of that information.  I hope she is able to maintain her contact with X.  It will be an important part of X's identify to enable her to make sense of her origins.</p>
