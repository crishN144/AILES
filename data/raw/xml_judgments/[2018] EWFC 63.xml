	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in">This hearing concerns four children A, B, C and D. Their parents are M and F. The parents have been couple for some 14 years and have been married for about seven years.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in">On the 6th of March 2018 Hertfordshire County Council issued an application seeking an interim care order and full care orders in respect of all four children. This followed from C and D having been made subject to police protection orders on the 1st March 2018, followed by emergency protection orders in respect of all four children on the 2nd March 2018. Intervention by the police and then social services arose because of facial bruising seen to D during a visit by social workers to the children&#8217;s home on the 27th February 2018. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in">The local authority care plans at issue were for C and D to be placed in foster care and for A and B to remain at home and orders were made to that effect. The local authority has since issued a placement application in respect of C and D and seek placement orders in respect of them and care orders in respect of A and B with a plan that they would be placed in long-term foster care. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:-0.25in">4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in">These applications are opposed by the parents and indeed the children's guardian, Ms Stephens, although she had originally supported the making of the earlier orders.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:-0.25in">5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in"> The local authority threshold at issue relied upon an incident at the family home on the 10th February 2018 during which time A sent a text message to a friend alleging that his mother had tried to stab him with a knife. It also included an unexplained injury to D&#8217;s toe in 2016 and what was said to be significant facial bruising to D on the 28th February 2018. In light of those allegations it seems hardly surprising that the police and the local authority acted as they did, that the Guardian supported the local authority at that time and that the court made the orders that I have mentioned.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:-0.25in">6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in">The threshold has moved on and indeed moved on considerably since then and was subject to change even during submissions and now broadly says that the mother has a history of losing her temper with the children. That the children sustained injuries which were inflicted, again this was originally said to be intentional or negligent by either or both of the parents but it was accepted at the outset of the final hearing that there was no evidence to support the allegation that the injuries were deliberately inflicted, but that the children had suffered significant harm as a result of inadequate supervision. That the children's physical needs were neglected and finally that the parents had not provided consistent parental boundaries/guidelines in respect of the children's behaviour.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:-0.25in">7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in">The allegation that D was injured intentionally by either one or both parents was withdrawn in light of the medical evidence available from Dr Cohn in an email of August 2018. It remains however that D had, on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2018, various bruises as identified in child protection medical on that day and set out in the original threshold. Some of the injuries observed on D included bruising to the inner surface of both arms which were seen at the child protection medical on the 28th of February, but not mentioned in the original threshold. However, the local authority now says that those injuries together with the injuries observed on the 2nd March 2018 and the earlier injury to D&#8217;s right little toe, when he was about two months old, is evidence of the parents&#8217; lack of care, which is directly related to the parent&#8217;s lack of supervision. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:-0.25in">8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in">The parents&#8217; response is that the mother did not know of D&#8217;s injury to his toe until it was seen by a GP as part of a regular medical check-up for D. The parents say the other bruises to D simply arose from him being an active toddler and that there is nothing sinister in them but accept that with a little more forethought that some could have been avoided, particularly those to D&#8217;s arms.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:-0.25in">9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in">It is said that the children's physical needs were neglected and many examples are given between August 2016 and March 2018 when C was said to be dirty with stains in her underwear and that she, and indeed mother, smelled malodorous. This being remarked upon at C&#8217;s child protection medical, albeit there was nothing else of concern noted. </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:-0.25in">10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0in">The mother denies the allegation relating to C, saying that she was taken to the CPM after nursery and having been to the stables, but otherwise both parents accept that they have allowed the house to become cluttered and untidy giving the appearance of it being unclean. They go on to say that since C and D were removed from their care that they have made great strides in decluttering the home of far too many clothes, out of date or broken toys and other material. They say they have re-decorated part of the house including some of the children's bedrooms and have refloored part of the house. They have provided photographs to me. It is accepted by the local authority that this is the case but they are concerned about the sustainability of such improvements as they have been seen in the past and subsequently matters have deteriorated once again.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:-0.25in">11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0in">It is further alleged that the parents have not provided consistent parental boundaries/guidelines in respect of the children's behaviour. This was not in the original threshold and appeared in the final threshold although again it underwent a number of changes during the course of the hearing as I have said. The final threshold contained under this heading an allegation that the children have exhibited inappropriate sexual behaviour. This was changed to read that the parents have provided inappropriate responses to the children's exhibited sexual behaviour and relied upon two instances in October 2013 concerning A and a third on the 22nd of July 2016 concerning A and B. The parents accept these events happened but are quite clear that they dealt with them appropriately. It is also said under this general heading that C demonstrated highly over familiar behaviour to almost all professionals she met in the months before she went into foster care. The parents accept that she is a friendly and affectionate child but that she is not overfamiliar with adults and say that as the mother has introduced professionals to C as <span style="font-style:italic">"safe&#8221;</span> whilst in the company of her and her father there is no cause for concern and that at her age it is an ongoing process.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0in">Finally, it is alleged under this subheading that the parents lack of attunement to the children&#8217;s needs and what is said to be <span style="font-style:italic">"the mother&#8217;s reluctance to talk about sex means there is likely to have been limited opportunities for the children to have had discussions with their parents about sexual relationships and/or sexual abuse ".</span> The mother gives a detailed response saying she believes it neither necessary or desirable to have such in-depth conversations and that she has always told the children they have a right to feel <span style="font-style:italic">"safe</span>" and that no one should touch them or do anything to them that would make them feel uncomfortable being encouraged to tell the mother or father or another responsible adult such as a teacher or a member of the family, if anything ever happens to make the feel uncomfortable or upset. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0in">It is upon this threshold the local authority says that the only realistic option for the children is that A and B should be made subject to care orders and placed in long-term foster care together and that C and D should be placed for adoption together. The children&#8217;s care plans say that there should be contact between A and B and their parents some 4 to 6 times a year and that there should be no contact at all between C and D and their parents or A and B. Their reasoning is that this will cause difficulties in finding an adoptive placement for C and D and contact with A and B would put the security of any adoptive placement at risk. As I have said this is a heavily opposed application by the parents and not supported by the guardian who says that C and D should be reunited with their parents and A and B, and that this should be supported by a supervision order for 12 months. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;text-indent:0in">The local authority having considered the guardians final analysis have produced a reunification plan which sets out a timescale for unification and support that can be provided to the parents. This includes the support of family and friends. However, having produced this reunification plan in conjunction with the Guardian this is not their position. The parents would be willing to agree to a supervision order but it is obvious from the parent&#8217;s evidence, their case generally and submissions that they do not accept that the threshold for making orders is crossed. The guardian does but I thought that she and indeed Mr Stott, her counsel, struggled to support it. </p>

That assessment was negative but was challenged by Mr and Mrs G.  However, as matters have transpired they have not pursued that but remain with other family members and friends part of a support group that the parents can rely upon. A paediatric report form Dr Cohn and an updated email. There was a witness statement from the deputy head teacher at the school attended by A; the acting deputy headteacher at the school attended by C and B; an outreach worker at the children&#8217;s centre, who has worked with the whole family from May 2017 until the present; and the operations manager for Homestart. She has had no direct contact with the children but met the parents at a meeting and Homestart have provided help around improving the home conditions; a health visitor for the children since February 2016 until June 2017. In addition to the assessments I have mentioned there was further special guardianship assessment for Mr and Mrs G prepared by Sarah Waters, an independent social worker. There is also a statement from a social worker from the family finding team, who dealt with generic issues around the adoption of C and D.</p>

Concrete examples, pictorial illustrations and role-playing would aid her comprehension. She added that due to the mother&#8217;s difficulty with verbal skills and working memory it was recommended that information be provided at a slow and measured pace with pauses to assist assimilation. In light of this it was necessary to list the final hearing for eight days. This included a reading day for me and I have read all relevant documents in the bundle. In the event the second day of evidence was not used as it comprised solely of Dr Moore, who conducted the child protection medicals, and Dr Cohn giving oral evidence and because of the local authority&#8217;s change of threshold it became unnecessary. </p>

The reality is that in this country there must be tens of thousands of children who are cared for in homes where there is a degree of domestic violence (now very widely defined) and where parents on occasion drink more than they should, I am not condoning that for a moment, but the courts are not in the business of social engineering. The courts are not in the business of providing children with perfect homes. If we took into care and placed for adoption every child whose parents had had a domestic spat and every child whose parents on occasion had drunk too much then the care system would be overwhelmed and there would not be enough adoptive parents.&#160; So we have to have a degree of realism about prospective carers who come before the courts."</span></p>

There is no doubt that for a considerable period of time, literally to the door of the court, that the local authority said firstly, that many of the injuries to D were inflicted and secondly that there was a concern that the children had been at risk of being the victims of sexual abuse. Such that the ADM in her first decision regarding C and D&#8217;s adoption decision noted <span style="font-style:italic">"In 2010 a number of referrals to children services were made regarding emotional sexual and physical abuse&#8221;</span>. In addition, the ADM recorded that <span style="font-style:italic">"following D&#8217;s six-week check where he was found to have a considerable graze on his foot ";"M was unable to give an explanation and the medical confirmed it was a non-accidental injury ".</span> It is plain when one reads the child protection medical that Dr Moore, whilst concerned mother was not aware that D had sustained an injury which was regarded as a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">significant abrasion&#8221;</span>, it was still nevertheless described as a "<span style="font-style:italic">relatively minor injury "</span>. At no time was it said that it was a non-accidental injury. (Quite apart from the improper use of that phrase following the decision of Lord Justice Ryder in Re S (A Child) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/25" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 25" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 25</ref>). Despite this plain mistake the parenting assessment commences by saying that <span style="font-style:italic">"and it was confirmed that the injury was non-accidental ".</span> In addition, it says that C and D were removed from their parents later that day under the powers of police protection. That is again simply not true. Those statements are inaccurate. </p>

Nevertheless, there was, in my judgement, throughout the local authority&#8217;s evidence a pervasive failure to accurately state the correct position by reference to the primary evidence, there was also, in my judgement, a tendency to only look at the negatives in respect of this family and not the positives and to wrongly infer from the evidence that something was a <span style="font-style:italic">"concern "</span>or to put it another way a risk when it was not. In addition, there was a tendency for inaccuracy in stating what other professionals had said. I have already noted some examples from the ADM decision, but in the evidence of Miss X I note further examples.</p>

In addition, M remains in infrequent contact with the stepfather who was one of her abusers while he maintains relationships with at least some of sisters&#8221;</span>.

It really ought not to be necessary, after so many years, to have to remind professionals working with children of the difference between an allegation and a disclosure. The incident in October 2013, when A was seven, does not accurately record the circumstances of the section 47 investigation which says <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;On 15/10/2013 the primary school reported that A and seven other boys in his class chased a 10-year-old girl and touched her inappropriately. On 22/10/ 2013 another referral was received from the school reporting A with another boy sandwiched a year one girl between them, thrust sexually into her and said she was sexy. A admitted both incidents and as a result he was expelled from school for two days and RAMP was put in place to assess and monitor A&#8217;s inappropriate behaviour at school&#8221;.</span></p>

He feels a sense of responsibility that is unwarranted and everything must be done to reassure him that is not the case. Jo Clarke in her assessment and in her oral evidence was clear that this had had no significant impact on A.

The local authority has changed their position and say that it amounts to a lack of supervision, which the parents accept. Of note are the bruises to Ds forearm, although similar bruises were seen whilst D was in foster care, about which no adverse comment was made. F says that the bruises to D&#8217;s arms were caused when in the heat of the moment he grabbed D to stop him running into a busy carpark around the home. Clearly a little more foresight would have made him realise that he should have been holding the hand of a toddler in those circumstances no matter how active he may be, perhaps that made it more important to take hold of him. However, it was done to save a potential greater harm and the father would not be the first or indeed the last parent who does not act appropriately in the situation and whilst it has caused D harm to the extent that he had bruises, again I can find no evidence that it caused him significant harm.

Nothing of this is said in the evidence to balance what is said in the child protection medical, even though this was known. I am frankly astonished, given the mothers evidence, that this has found its way into threshold at all. It is not an example of C being neglected, it is more of a young girl who it seems enjoyed mucking out horses with her mother. The mother&#8217;s evidence is not contradicted and it is more likely C had a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;poo&#8221;</span> at school rather than having left home with soiled pants and that the malodorous smell which the doctor could not identify came from mucking out the horses as likely also did the nails.

This frankly could only have come from the parenting that he had received to that point. The parents believed the first incident was a game that got out of hand and clearly that is right and the second was because A had learned dance moves from a TV advert.

Once again, the parents are not the only members of society who are concerned about such advertising and it would be an impossible task for any parent to supervise everything that is shown on TV. The parents acknowledge that what A did was wrong and sought support and advice from the school and the GP. There has been no repetition of such behaviour. I think I can reasonably infer from that that whatever the parents did by way of supporting A worked. It simply cannot be described as a failure to provide consistent boundaries.</p>

It is recorded in the MASH report that during a telephone call with the mother on 28 July that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;M acknowledges the previous concerns about A sexualised behaviour in school back in 2013&#8221;; &#8220;A does not have unsupervised access to the Internet at home&#8221;; &#8220;M said she spoke to A about the comment he made when health visitor was visiting she told him that the comment was not appropriate, not funny and unkind and he must not repeat it again. She stated clearly that B and A share a bedroom and that C has her own bedroom and she noted that two recent social work assessments completed had both commented on the appropriate sleeping arrangements of the family</span>. Again, referring to the MASH report it says<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;one of them regularly sleeps in C&#8217;s room&#8221;. </span>This is denied by the mother and seemingly supported by previous social work visits and there is not a scrap of evidence in any witness statement on that point.</p>

That statement comes directly from the parenting assessment and is repeated in Ms X&#8217;s final witness statement without giving any details. However, in her first witness statement she said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;C is friendly energetic and upbeat which is positive. A potential issue with this temperament is that she has been observed to be unusually open with strangers, readily accepting and enjoying attention from adults who are kind to her and engage her appropriately for her age&#8221;.</span> I note that this is something also referenced by the health visitor and Dr Moore during the child protection medical on the 1st of March 2018, who noted <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;she did appear to be over friendly in the consultation room&#8221;.</span></p>

Clearly it is something that needs to be addressed but I am satisfied that the parents have done so and will continue to do so. It is self-evident no such concerns arise in relation to A and B and I think I can reasonably infer from that that the parent&#8217;s guidance in this area has been adequate and is an ongoing matter. Again, there is no evidence that this has caused C any harm let alone significant harm and I am satisfied that the risk of future significant harm simply does not arise because of the parents ongoing work with C.</p>

It is a concern that M and F allow the children ongoing (albeit irregular) contact with a family member who has been accused of sexual abuse against M. This is despite M&#8217;s reservations and concerns about him spending time alone with her children. M and friends lack of achievement to their children&#8217;s needs and close to reluctance to talk about sex means there may well be limited opportunities for the children to have had discussions with their parents about sexual relationships and or sexual abuse&#8221;.</span></p>

I am quite sure that both problems which flow from them have been clearly identified by the parents and that the father will now be more active in the future and that the mother will undertake the therapy recommended by Jo Clarke, which is being actively sought for her. It is noted that this will be a difficult time for the mother but Jo Clarke was clear that there was no reason why the mother could not undergo this therapy whilst parenting the children. However, the parents together with their wider family and friends are agreed that this is an area where the mother will need significant support even to the extent of the father considering that he may need to give up work for the time being to enable him to be a full-time carer for the children.</p>

My Lords, for that reason I would go further and announce loud and clear that the standard of proof in finding the facts necessary to establish the threshold under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> or the welfare considerations in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> is the simple balance of probabilities, neither more nor less. Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. The inherent probabilities are simply something to be taken into account, where relevant, in deciding where the truth lies.&#8221;</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">... As to the seriousness of the allegation, there is no logical or necessary connection between seriousness and probability. Some seriously harmful behaviour, such as murder, is sufficiently rare to be inherently improbable in most circumstances. Even then there are circumstances, such as a body with its throat cut and no weapon to hand, where it is not at all improbable. Other seriously harmful behaviour, such as alcohol or drug abuse, is regrettably all too common and not at all improbable. Nor are serious allegations made in a vacuum. Consider the famous example of the animal seen in Regent's Park.

He commented: &#8220;Much material to be found in local authority case records or social work chronologies is hearsay, often second- or third-hand hearsay.  Hearsay evidence is, of course, admissible in family proceedings.  But, and as the present case so vividly demonstrates, a local authority which is unwilling or unable to produce the witnesses who can speak of such matters first-hand, may find itself in great, or indeed insuperable, difficulties if a parent not merely puts the matter in issue but goes into the witness-box to deny it.&#8221;  He went on to underline the need to formulate the threshold so that it is clear what is asserted (not X reports or it appears that but Y happened) and the need to demonstrate the link between the facts asserted and the harm this is said to establish, particularly with respect to parental attitudes and behaviours which do not directly impact the child such as dishonesty or failing to engage with professionals.</span></p>
