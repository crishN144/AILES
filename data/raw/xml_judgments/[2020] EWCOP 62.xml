Prior to the execution of them, the solicitors (who were themselves experienced in this field) obtained a capacity assessment from Sue Altass, a registered mental health nurse and specialist mental health practitioner. Ms Altass, having assessed KC on 8 August 2017, and with knowledge of KC&#8217;s diagnosis of Alzheimer&#8217;s Dementia in December 2016, was of the professional opinion that KC did have capacity to execute the LPAs. The capacity assessment records that &#8220;[KC] would like all 4 daughters to be granted LPA as they will all benefit from her will.&#8221; The recommendations in the assessment stated as follows: </p>

First, one must identify the allegedly offending behaviour or prospective behaviour. Second, one looks at all the circumstances and context and decides whether, taking everything into account, it really does amount to behaviour which is not in P&#8217;s best interests, or can fairly be characterised as such. Finally, one must decide whether, taking everything into account including the fact that it is behaviour in some other capacity, it also gives good reason to take the very serious step of revoking the LPA.&#8221; [75]</span></p>

The court has already recorded (on the face of the order on 3 June 2020), that the presumption of capacity enshrined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of the MCA has not been rebutted as regards KC&#8217;s capacity to execute the instruments. The court could therefore proceed to dismiss the instant application and register the instruments as valid LPAs on the basis that KC had capacity to execute them at the time. </p>

In the present case, where there is a significant and seemingly intractable dispute between KC&#8217;s adult daughters, it was submitted that the court&#8217;s powers in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/22/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22(3)</ref>(b) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> were engaged. The Official Solicitor (who was appointed to act for KC as to matters relating to her health and welfare only) submitted that the court should not register the health and welfare instrument and, as the issues raised are germane to both instruments, the court should also refuse registration of the property and affairs instrument. </p>

Whilst the Official Solicitor does not invite the court to scrutinise the criticisms that the daughters levy at one another, it is evident that they do not see eye to eye. Allegations of bullying and abuse have been made from both sides and despite these proceedings having been issued approximately three years ago, relations do not seem to have improved. The Official Solicitor submits that in light of the ongoing and long-standing conflict, the court cannot be satisfied that the attorneys (if appointed) would be able to act in KC&#8217;s best interests by working together and making decisions on a joint basis, despite all having KC&#8217;s best interests at heart; </p>

Given that the evidence suggests that KC&#8217;s daughters would be unable to act in the manner that the LPAs were intended (i.e to make joint decisions on KC&#8217;s behalf), the court can be satisfied that it is not in KC&#8217;s best interests for the LPAs to be registered. In light of the nature of the issues raised above, the court may consider that the same factors may impede the proper management of P&#8217;s property and affairs and conclude that the finance LPAs also should not be registered. </p>

This could not be done under the existing instruments for the reasons set out in paragraph 20 above. If the court took the view that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/22" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 22</ref> MCA is invoked and the instruments should not be registered on the grounds that the three named donees propose to behave in a way that would not be in KC&#8217;s best interests, it is potentially open to the court to direct that the instruments are not registered and then to appoint some or all four of KC&#8217;s daughters as deputies to manage her property and affairs and/or health and welfare (subject to the obvious point that LCR would be an unwilling appointee). The submissions on behalf of the Official Solicitor should, in my view, be read in this context (as opposed to suggesting that the court can appoint all four daughters as attorneys).  </p>

Those factors include taking into account KC&#8217;s wishes (which were that all four of her daughters be involved in making decisions about her future care, finances etc) and (if it is practicable and appropriate to consult them) the views of anyone engaged in caring for KC or interested in her welfare. In other words, there would need to be a degree of co-operation, engagement and, where possible, agreement, between all four of KC&#8217;s daughters.

There is abundant evidence that for whatever reason LCR on the one hand and SC, AC and CP on the other, have a difficult, fractured and acrimonious relationship based on mistrust, conflict and what at times has appeared to this court to be dislike. If anything, the entrenched positions and conflict has intensified as these proceedings have progressed and as, sadly, KC&#8217;s health has deteriorated. At a time when she has most needed her daughters to all pull together the chasm between them has if anything deepened and widened. It was KC&#8217;s hope that her daughters would pull together and make decisions together. In my judgment, the evidence strongly indicates that sadly there is no prospect of that happening. I do not intend to make any findings as to where the rights and wrongs lie as between the Applicant on the one hand and the Respondents on the other. It is not necessary for the court to do so for present purposes. Furthermore, I am of the very clear view that it would not be in KC&#8217;s best interests for the court to enter such territory.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.53in">This leads me to the final consideration of the three-limbed approach articulated by HHJ Marshall QC (and which I respectfully adopt); should the court exercise it&#8217;s discretion and direct that neither LPA instrument is registered? I am very clear that in the present case neither LPA instrument should be registered . I say this for the following reasons: </p>

If anything, it would exacerbate and emphasise the difficult and fractious sibling relationship which cannot be and is not in KC&#8217;s best interests. The court is of the clear view that SC, AC and CP (if appointed) would not be able to act in KC&#8217;s best interests by working together with LCR and making decisions on a joint basis, despite all four daughters having KC&#8217;s best interests at heart. CP came very close to acknowledging this at the hearing and whilst all three proposed attorneys expressed the hope that they would work with LCR in KC&#8217;s best interest, there is ample evidence which demonstrates that such expressions are of hope over reality.      </p>

I will make such an order. She also indicated that it would be appropriate for the court to order that a panel deputy be appointed to manage KC&#8217;s property and affairs. I agree. In so agreeing, I apply the court&#8217;s powers in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(6)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> and apply the principles contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and the best interest&#8217;s principles contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref>. It cannot be a proper exercise of these principles and the court&#8217;s powers to appoint all of KC&#8217;s daughters as attorneys (especially in the face of opposition from LCR to any joint appointment with her sisters). In addition, any such appointment would not heal the rift between the four daughters of KC and lead to a working relationship that would be in KC&#8217;s best interests. For the reasons already given in this judgment, the evidence strongly indicates that sadly there is no prospect of all four of KC&#8217;s daughters pulling together and making decisions together. Any decisions regarding KC&#8217;s property and affairs should be made by an independently appointed guardian (who in making any such decisions will be under a duty to consult with all four daughters prior to making any decision).  </p>
