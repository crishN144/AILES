He would pay a full market rent to reside there.

I was available for my mother 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and caring for her became increasingly difficult. Although I did not keep receipts for everything I bought for her, it was all paid for from a separate wallet containing cash withdrawn from her accounts, and I never used that cash for anything else, so in that way I was able to ensure that my own expenditure and hers were kept entirely separate.&#8221;</p>
