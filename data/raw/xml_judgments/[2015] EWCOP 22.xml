In particular, it looks at cases in which the CICA requires a trust to be created in order to exclude any possibility that the assailant may benefit from the compensation award. These cases arise almost exclusively in the context of domestic violence, where the assailant is a family member.</p>

Where the parties were unable to reach a settlement out of court, and the matter went to trial, the Master&#8217;s involvement was unnecessary, and the civil judge&#8217;s decision was final. This practice had developed during the nineteenth century and was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (Mental Health Patient)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] 1 All ER 609" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] 1 All ER 609</ref>. </p>

It also has powers to make ancillary vesting orders, and orders varying or revoking a trust in certain circumstances: MCA Schedule 2, paragraphs 5 and 6. The court must exercise these functions itself and cannot delegate them to a deputy: MCA, section 20(3). For similar reasons, but essentially because it is a decision that the donor must make personally, I very much doubt that the creation of a trust is something that the donor of an Enduring Power of Attorney or Lasting Power of Attorney for property and financial affairs can lawfully do by an attorney. </p>

It is difficult to envisage a case where it would be appropriate for CICA to be joined as a party to such an application, and the decision to place the award in trust would be a matter for the Court of Protection to be determined having regard to P&#8217;s best interests under the principles set out in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.

What is clear is that the Schemes involve a bilateral process. There must be acceptance on the part of the applicant to the award offered. The situation differs from the usual one where a person can unilaterally decide to settle his property on trust and make a transfer to trustees on terms he or she considers appropriate, without having to agree the terms of the settlement with another person (although agreement of the trustees to act in that capacity would, of course, have to be obtained).</p>
		  </content>
		</paragraph>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The requirement for agreement from the applicant means that the process is not one that can be described as unilateral action on the part of the CICA, such that the CICA is properly regarded as the settlor. The CICA is not imposing a trust on the applicant. Indeed, the applicant&#8217;s agreement to the amount of the award and the payment into trust including the specific provisions required by the CICA is required. Once written acceptance has been provided, the applicant has an entitlement to the award (albeit title that is subject to conditions and at least in respect of the 1990 <span style="font-style:italic">ex gratia</span> scheme, not legal title in the ordinary sense because there is no contractual or statutory right to payment). Paragraph 9 of the 1990 Scheme sets out rules which govern what happens to an award once it has been accepted and is concerned with administration of award monies.</p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, the CICA cannot and does not take responsibility for ensuring that the trust deed satisfies the applicant&#8217;s needs from the point of view of taxation or advising the applicant as to whether or not a disabled person&#8217;s trust is a suitable vehicle. These are matters that an applicant (or his representative) has to decide and if necessary, take appropriate advice. The CICA&#8217;s role under all Schemes is to determine whether compensation is payable and the appropriate amount of such compensation while ensuring that particular public policy requirements of the CICA regime are satisfied (such as the excluded persons rule). The CICA has no wider role or responsibility to ensure that an applicant, having accepted an award and agreed to a trust, is provided with a trust deed which best meets his individual circumstances, there will be situations where the taxation implications of such a trust are extremely complicated and the CICA has no role to play in determining the best option in relation to such matters.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It follows that the CICA&#8217;s position is that neither it nor the Tribunal is the settlor of the trust in cases where the CICA or the Tribunal requires that the award sum be paid into a trust and requires specific terms are included in the trust. The applicant has an entitlement to the award following written acceptance of the award pursuant to all the rules of the Schemes. There is a distinction drawn in the various schemes between the acceptance of the award and the settlement of that award on trust or the administration of the award. The applicant is, accordingly, the settlor. There is, therefore, settlement of property belonging to P and the property must be settled pursuant to an order of the Court of Protection under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/18/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18(1)</ref>(h) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Further or alternatively, the Official Solicitor notes in his position statement that there is a role for the Court of Protection to play in circumstances where the terms of the trust are left for negotiation between the CICA and the applicant or his representative. As explained above, this is the typical process adopted for agreeing a trust. Neither the CICA nor the Tribunal imposes a trust on the applicant, albeit that certain terms, such as an excluded persons&#8217; clause, will not be negotiable. The person authorised on behalf of the applicant to conduct the claim has responsibility to agree the trust terms on behalf of the applicant. Appropriate recourse should be made to the Court of Protection in cases where there is doubt as to which form of trust or which trust terms would be in the applicant&#8217;s best interests. In those circumstances, the Court of Protection has a role in making a decision in the applicant&#8217;s best interests.&#8221;</p>

The territorial application of the CICA Schemes extends throughout Great Britain and the reference to a &#8216;guardian&#8217; in paragraph 106(e) of the 2012 Scheme is to an appointment under Part 6 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000.

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in">&#8220;The Tribunal has imposed a requirement that the applicant provide a suitably worded <span style="font-style:italic">Peters</span> undertaking. If the deputyship is discharged, there is no effective <span style="font-style:italic">Peters </span>undertaking in place. This would circumvent the requirement imposed by the Tribunal, if that is the position, then in accordance with paragraph 13 of the decision of the Tribunal on 25 July 2012, the matter would have to be remitted to the Tribunal for further consideration of how to ensure that paragraph 19 of the 1990 Scheme is complied with (which provides that compensation will be reduced by the amount of entitlement to present or future social security benefits). A possible alternative is to arrange for a trustee to sign the <span style="font-style:italic">Peters </span>undertaking.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I agree. Where there is no deputyship in place and the award is to be managed by trustees, the trust deed itself should contain provisions restricting the trustees&#8217; powers to apply for public funding of P&#8217;s care without first obtaining the permission of the Court of Protection. </p>

	    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I do, however, wonder whether the involvement of the Court of Protection is really necessary. The whole point of a <span style="font-style:italic">Peters</span> undertaking, as Lord Dyson said, is that &#8220;it places control over the [claimant&#8217;s] ability to make an application for the provision of the claimant&#8217;s care and accommodation at public expense in the hands of a court.&#8221; The Tribunal itself has powers under paragraph 19 of the 1990 Scheme to deal effectively with the risk of double recovery.</p>
