	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This matter comes before the court in the urgent applications list at 4.15 p.m. on the afternoon of Thursday, 25 July 2019, and concerns the welfare of a thirteen-year-old boy called P.  Yesterday, very sadly, P was involved in a very serious road traffic accident in which he sustained multiple injuries which are life threatening, those injuries are set out in the report of one of his treating doctors that is before the court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I am required to decide on an urgent basis whether it is in P's best interest, should his condition deteriorate suddenly, to be treated by way of blood or products in circumstances where consent for such treatment cannot be forthcoming either from P, by reason of him being in an induced coma, or from his mother and father, who are committed and conscientious Jehovah's Witnesses.  The parents are aware that the application is being made and have attended this hearing by telephone from the hospital. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I should say at the very outset of this judgment, that the fact that the parents are not able to consent to the use of blood products should not be taken as indicating that they are in any way being obstructive regarding the care required by P.  In an eloquent address to this court, TP made clear to me that he and LP seek the best possible outcome for their son, that they deeply appreciate the efforts being made for P by the medical team in this case and that if, ultimately, all other avenues having been tried, P requires blood products they would not obstruct this.  It is within this context that TP and LP make clear that, due to their deeply held religious convictions, they would not be able to give their consent. As TP told me, this position is part of their &#8220;very being&#8221;. </p>

This application is made at short notice and the Trust are represented by Miss Watson of counsel.  In the circumstances, I am conscious that the parents are not represented, but as I have already alluded to, I have had the opportunity to hear from them.  I am also mindful that P himself is not represented before the court, but I am satisfied in this urgent situation that his interests have been sufficiently articulated before me by both his treating clinicians and his parents. </p>

For those reasons, I am content to deal with the application this afternoon in the urgent applications list and I consider the application properly brought in that context.  </p>

He is presently intubated and ventilated. I heard oral evidence from Dr G by way of telephone, which evidence the parents were also able to hear.  The key points of that evidence are as follows.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">P is, as I have said, relatively stable, but Dr G considers his condition may deteriorate suddenly.  If there is a sudden deterioration, Dr G is clear that there may be a requirement for blood products to be administered.  Dr G considers it is impossible to be certain when any deterioration may occur and is clear that if it does occur, it can occur extremely quickly.  Dr G makes the point that children who suffer brain injuries of the type sustained by P and abdominal injuries of the type sustained by P are known to be at risk of deteriorating in this manner.  In addition, Dr G told me that serious illnesses consequent on the type of injuries P has can, in any event, lead to a drop in haemoglobin that would require treatment or a drop in oxygen to the brain that, likewise, would require to be treated with blood products. Dr G says that whilst it is believed that P's bleeding is now under control, it is impossible to say whether small bleeds continue or whether a large bleed may occur.  Once again, Dr G is concerned that this can happy at any time and that any deterioration could be swift. </p>

	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Within the foregoing context, Dr G was clear in asked questions put by Miss Watson, that there are no alternative medications available to treat P in the event of a deterioration requiring the administration of haemoglobin and other blood products.  However, she is equally clear that before any treatment using blood products, the medical team will utilise such other treatments as are available and will turn to blood products only as a last resort. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">As I have already noted, I also heard from TP on behalf of TP and LP.  He gave a calm and considered summary of the parents' views in what must be, for both of them, an extremely difficult and traumatic situation.  In particular, he made the following points to the court. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">Entirely understandably, he makes the point that this is a very difficult situation.  He makes clear to the court that he and LP do not wish to be difficult or to cause trouble or to seek to be confrontational.  They make clear that what they want is the best possible outcome for P.  They appreciate the efforts and the concern of the medics and all that is being done for their son. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">Within this context, TP and LP state that all they ask is that doctors try all other options for P before using blood products.  They make clear that they cannot give their consent, but they would understand the position that the doctors may find themselves in if all other options had been tried and failed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I also bear in mind that Dr G's report makes clear that the parents have stated that whilst P has not formally joined as a Jehovah's witness (he being too young), they say that his religious views are in line with those of his parents, and I have borne that very carefully in mind. </p>

The jurisdiction of the court to make such an order arises where a child lacks the capacity to make the decision for him or herself.  In the context of a disagreement between those with parental responsibility for the child and those treating the child.  The court has no power to require doctors to carry out an alternative medical procedure, including a blood transfusion, against their own professional judgment.  </p>

This will include, but is not limited to, medical, emotional, sensory and instinctive considerations.  The test is not a mathematical one.  The court must do the best it can to balance all the conflicting considerations in a particular case with a view to determining where the final balance lies.  In reaching its decision, the court is not bound to follow the clinical assessments of the doctors, but must form its own view as to the child's best interests. </p>

Within this context, as I have done recently in <span style="font-style:italic">Cardiff &amp; Vale University Health Board v T</span> [2019] EWHC 1671, in which objection was also taken on the ground of religious belief, it is important to set out clearly the legal principles I apply regarding parental wishes in cases in which the court is charged with taking best interest decisions regarding the medical treatment of children. </p>

In those circumstances, it seems to me that it is vital that the position in relation to consent is clear.  Within that context, whilst understanding and respecting the views of the parents, I am entirely satisfied that the doctors need clarity in relation to consent in treating this very seriously ill young man. </p>

That fact, it seems to me, further concentrates the court's mind on the need for doctors to be able to deploy all treatments available on an urgent basis in an effort to ensure P's welfare and, indeed, survival in the knowledge that the position as to consent is settled and certain. </p>

Within that context, I am satisfied the court must have regard to the fact that there is a strong presumption in favour of preserving P's life.  In my judgment, the sanctity of life is a powerful factor in this case.   </p>

I do not know from him what they are because he is not, at present, able to tell me.  I bear in mind that his parents have informed Dr G that P shares his parents' religious convictions.  I afford P's views, as I take them to be on the basis of that evidence, respect, but I am not satisfied that those views can outweigh the other factors that drive me to the conclusion that it is appropriate to grant the application of the Trust. </p>

Be that loving concern, a strongly held religious conviction or an irrational and mistaken view of the science involved in the proposed treatment.  Within this context, the court's decision involves no judgment on the validity of the parents' beliefs, be they religious or secular in nature.  In making the objective best interest decision it is required to in cases of this nature, the court subordinates the views and wishes of the parents to the best interest of a child solely by reason of the fact that responsibility for arriving at that objective assessment of a child's best interest lies exclusively with the court in which assessment the child's best interest are the court's paramount concern.&#8221; </p>

Within this context, I am entirely satisfied that it is in P&#8217;s best interest to grant the order sought by the Trust in the circumstances I have set out above.  In those circumstances, I am further satisfied that any sustained view on the part of his parents borne of their deeply-held religious views does not, irrespective of the genesis of those views, act to alter the court's conclusion that such a course of action is objectively and manifestly in P's best interests.  I again make clear again that, ultimately, the parents themselves recognise this.  They simply cannot consent.  </p>
