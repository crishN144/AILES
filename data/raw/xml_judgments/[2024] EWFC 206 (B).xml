	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Since then, the parties have been almost constantly involved in litigation against one another, in the Family Court, but also in the High Court, in disputes arising from the ownership of a business (and associated companies) relating to the husband&#8217;s work as a content creator, commentator and influencer. This work started out with making sports content videos with (Company A), television appearances, making documentaries, making promotional videos and entering into agreements for product endorsement or charging for his appearance, or for giving talks at sports-related events. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">It is the wife&#8217;s case that the business was her idea, that she participated fully in its set up and operation at the outset, but was later frozen out by the husband. She is a 70% shareholder in Company B, the company originally set up as the vehicle for collecting revenue from Company A. She says she is entitled to compensation for the profits which she says she has been deprived of in the past, and to which she would be entitled to in the future.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In around November 2018, just after these proceedings commenced, the husband set up two new companies, Company Y which was the umbrella company for a number subsidiary companies connected with the production of television programmes that the husband was involved in, collecting revenue connected with his appearances on television or relating to programmes made on television, collecting revenue relating to his work as an influencer, or through brand promotion, merchandising deals. Company Y collected all the revenue from Company A and his other business activities in place of Company B. Company B didn&#8217;t receive any income from Company A thereafter and stopped trading sometime in 2020.</p>

	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">At around the same time, the husband entered into an agreement with his accountant, in which the accountant was to hold 90% of an umbrella company, Company Y, on trust for the husband. In his Form E, the husband then suggested that he in fact was the legal owner of only 10% of Company Y. The agreement with the accountant was soon discovered and revealed to be a sham. There is no issue in these proceedings that the husband is the sole owner and beneficiary of Company Y and its subsidiary companies. The accountancy expert Mr Pym proceeded on the basis that Company Y was 100% owned by the husband. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In January 2017 the husband had entered into an agreement with two businessmen, PN and GN in which they set up a company together called Company X. The plan was that PN and GN would raise investment for Company A/Company B and once Company A/Company B reached a value of &#163;5 million, PN and GN would gain a stake in those companies as well as Company X, which was intended to be a business that provided the same format for other sports teams, not just Team X. In the event that business relationship broke down. The husband says PN and GN never provided the investment, PN and GN said the husband reneged on his agreement to transfer a stake in his company to them. In October 2019 PN and GN issued proceedings in the High Court against the husband, the wife and their business partner ML (who is the camera operator and editor of the videos), all of whom were signatories to the agreement with PN and GN.</p>

	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In December 2020 that litigation was settled by the husband and ML. They agreed to pay &#163;250,000 to PN and GN, by which settlement they understood PN and GN would no longer pursue them for a stake in Company A/Company B.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Unbeknown to them, PN and GN had shortly before the settlement entered into a secret agreement with the wife, which led to the wife transferring shares in Company B to PN and GN, so that they gained a controlling interest in the company by a different route. Their intention was ultimately to remove the husband and ML from the business, but to retain the name, intellectual property and thereby revive their original business plan. </p>

	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Acting as the controlling shareholders in Company B, PN and GN took steps to contest the husband&#8217;s application to register the Company A trademark. They then sent him a further letter before action, effectively seeking to relitigate the case that had previously been settled. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The husband issued an application in the Family Court to set aside the wife&#8217;s disposition of shares to PN and GN. The application was eventually listed before me. I allowed the application and made orders pursuant to section 37 Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to set aside the share transfers. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">As a result the threat of commercial litigation instigated by PN and GN has now fallen away. They no longer have an interest in Company B so do not have standing to bring litigation. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Nonetheless, on behalf of Company B, the wife continued to contest the application to register the Company A trademark, successfully.

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The wife asserts that she was entitled to receive remuneration as a shareholder of Company B, and the husband has wrongfully deprived her of that money. She says that the husband has hidden his true income from the court, and that he has sufficient funds to compensate her for her lost remuneration from the business. She seeks a lump sum payment of &#163;1.45 million as well as transfer of the family home to her. </p>

	  <num>20.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The husband says the wife is not entitled to a share in the business. Firstly he says her contribution to it has been minimal. Secondly, he says her conduct in making secret deals with PN and GN led to extensive litigation that has led to him being mired in debt and without funds to meet his own needs, let alone to &#8216;compensate&#8217; her, either to the extent she is seeking, or at all. He proposes that she retains the family home and he retains the business, and each of them bear their own liabilities.</p>

Depending on the circumstances of the case, some of those factors may have more weight than others, and some may not be relevant to the issue at hand, but the law is clear that I must have regard to each of them.  Further, the first (but not paramount) consideration of the court must be given to the welfare of any child of the family, in this case B and C.  </p>

The wife&#8217;s shareholding of 70% puts the valuation of her ownership at &#163;123,900 or &#163;414,400, but a further discount of 5% is applied to reflect that she does not own the shares outright.

The wife in general terms said that she did not accept the figures, but again, was not able to point to any respect in which she said they were inaccurate or the primary evidence was unreliable.  The explanation for the change in figures comes down to the increase in the drawdowns in the Director&#8217;s Loan Account.

Any issues about the trademark fall to be dealt with in those proceedings, I have not been shown evidence that the husband has either acted unreasonably or that his actions in this respect should weigh against him in the section 25 assessment. There is no evidence to support the assertion that the husband&#8217;s dealings with PN and GN amount to litigation conduct. If anything, the wife&#8217;s conduct in that respect closer resembles litigation conduct which the Court should take into consideration. However, for reasons given, I consider that it would not be fair to adjust the final outcome to reflect this. </p>

That means that the profit on the bottom line is substantially less than the top line figure. The wife shows her naivety when she suggests that the income he generates through his business must be available to him to spend freely. Nonetheless, the husband can continue to expect to receive around &#163;4,500 a month net.
