There are a number of chronologies set out within the papers, and although elements of those are disputed by the mother, the mother has also filed a statement which is 68 pages long and contains a chronology and answer to the social work statement and chronology in 326 paragraphs. Y has obviously had substantial involvement with medical services and then social care since shortly after she was born. The first referral was received by social care in September 2014, when Y was only 1 year old. The prospect of there being fabricated illness (as it is referred to in the papers at that time) was raised from that time. Y has had very extended stays in hospital, including from approximately December 2014 to April 2016.</span></p>

The prospect of public law proceedings being started has been a live one for a number of years.</span></p>

Importantly the psychologist sets out that the mother&#8217;s ability to understand and respond to verbally presented material is within the borderline range, and above that of only 2% of her peers. The psychologist sets out at E101 of the bundle a list of issues in relation to individuals with a weakness in verbal comprehension. The mother&#8217;s non-verbal fluid reasoning skills however are somewhat better and above those of 18% of her peers. This is a particularly relevant scale as it is described as the ability to examine novel problems, organise thoughts, examine rules and logical relationships and create and test solutions.</span></p>

The examples of why this is important is that you might use this to solve problems, to encode store and retrieve information, to retain information, to acquire new skills and move information into long- term memory. The psychologist reported that the mother often forgot the question that she had been asked as she tended to begin her response and drift off topic, and explained that she had difficulty learning for example how to cook unless she could have a visual record of this and engage in lots of repetition.</span></p>

The psychologist suggests that the mother is likely to need assistance in reading and understanding complex documentation with jargon and unusual vocabulary. She set out that when the mother was asked to read and comprehend new information, she was not always able to produce the correct answer, performing to the level of a 10-year-old.</span></p>

She clearly knows the mother well, and tried hard to work with her over that lengthy period of years. She spoke sympathetically and knowledgeably about the mother and the children. She accepted that the mother cares deeply for both of her daughters, and that the mother had very little support. She accepted that the mother was quite &#8216;concrete&#8217;, and that although she had high expectations of professionals this was only as much as the social worker would expect from any parent. She accepted that the mother was able to sit and listen and share perspectives in a calm manner at times, but not all of the time. Mother did get frustrated if professionals had a different view of Y&#8217;s medical needs and that was one of her main sources of frustration. Mother would particularly become frustrated if she was given conflicting information, and the previous social worker was very clear that at times the mother would struggle to listen and understand meetings and so therefore she would follow that up with her. The previous social worker emphasised that over a substantial period of time, she would speak to the mother if she could prior to meetings, and then afterwards if that was necessary. She accepted that at times mother would follow professional advice, and accepted that some of mother&#8217;s behaviour was understandable as she was frustrated. She went on to say however that mother would sometimes dismiss advice that was given, or take matters into her own hands. She accepted that the mother does not intentionally harm the children, her concern was that harm was being caused by the mother to the children.</span></p>

The concern she expressed was that as Y&#8217;s needs will continue to change, Y is likely to surprise everyone with new problems, which will need to be dealt with. Y will progress, and that is shown by the fact that she made very good progress recently, but she will never reach adult independence.

One is an HNRNPU gene disorder which causes learning and physical disabilities, hypotonia, together with complex and unusual forms of epilepsy. She also has a KCNJ11 gene disorder which affects the potassium channels and can cause problems with blood sugar regulation. Her difficulties are anticipated to be life-long and her treatment has been geared to managing her symptoms as she has grown older. She has experienced some medical problems which have resolved and others which have evolved. These are set out, together with her overall medical history, treatment, and the interactions between her mother, and professionals, in the reports of the treating clinical paediatrician, of the 11th April 2021 and 15th July 2021  There are also over 12,000 pages in the medical evidence bundle, predominantly relating to Y.  Due to the rarity of her gene disorders, and their unpredictable course, treatments have had to be tailored to her needs and on occasion there has been some disagreement between medical professionals about precise treatment options.</span></p>

There are aspects however about how the evidence has developed which are relevant to the matters I need to determine. This allegation was it appears originally set out due to the concerns expressed by the local authority that the mother may have exaggerated issues with Y at a point when the package of support was being questioned with a view potentially to being reduced. Clearly that is likely to cause many parents concern, and perhaps worry. The local authority had originally pleaded that the mother may have fabricated the 8 minute seizure to bolster her case that the package of support should not be reduced, or that more time should be given to consider any reduction They no longer assert that however, and accept that seizure took place as the mother states.</span></p>

I had not seen anywhere asserted or suggested that the type and duration of seizures that Y has would cause her development to regress. That was why I asked the independent expert paediatrician to consider that specifically, as this is in truth a very typical response given by the mother, and a typical type of assertion that she makes. The independent expert paediatrician was very clear that was not the case as I set out above, but when the mother gave her evidence later she insisted that she was right. Sadly, as with so many of her assertions, it in truth made little sense. The mother gave as an example to support her statement the fact that Y had a seizure, and now was not crawling. When she was challenged that Y would not be expected to crawl at her stage of development, she did not reconsider her answer, but in fact sought to support it by other assertions as I set out above. Like many of the mother&#8217;s responses it was given with great conviction, and an element of certainty that made it apparent the mother would not consider other options.  As with much of the evidence as I shall set out in more detail below, the mother had an opportunity after the independent expert paediatrician gave his evidence on that to consider her view, but she was not able to adapt it even to admit an element of doubt or uncertainty.</span></p>

The clinical paediatrician emphasised that despite her having many discussions with the mother, the mother still thinks that oxygen during a seizure is dangerous for Y. The clinical paediatrician gave evidence that when Y has a seizure, and requires a bag and mask, oxygen will make no difference, but it is not harmful to Y. Although the hospital seizure plans say that there should be &#8220;no oxygen&#8221;, that does not mean oxygen should not be given, it means that it is not required. The clinical paediatrician explained at length that it was standard procedure in hospital if someone has a seizure for them to be given oxygen and that could be important for some people. Y does not need that, but it is not harmful for her, and it is better overall that in hospital there is always one plan for every patient, otherwise it could impact negatively on someone who does require oxygen. I asked the clinical paediatrician in relation to this, and what the continued difficulty was. I asked if she had explained that in simple terms to the mother. She said she had, on many occasions. She was at a loss to tell me what the continued difficulty had been, or why she had been unable to persuade the mother that she was mistaken, and why this continues to be a problem.</span></p>

She went onto say that she would not be moved from that view, and it had happened on several occasions when Y had a seizure in hospital. The mother went on to say that Y can use oxygen after a seizure, suggesting that one of the medications can cause lower oxygen levels, but repeated that during a seizure it can put Y more at risk of cardiac arrest. Mother accepted that in the past she cut the green tube to Y&#8217;s oxygen, adding that &#8216;if you give her air and oxygen in that chest wall that will put her into cardiac arrest&#8217; &#8211; adding that that had actually happened, and &#8216;they&#8217; (referring to the clinical paediatrician and the independent expert paediatrician) are &#8216;wrong&#8217;.</span></p>

Further, I accept the evidence of the clinical paediatrician, that she has on many occasions since her involvement attempted in a variety of different ways to explain to the mother that oxygen administered during a seizure will not harm Y. It is not of course sufficient for these findings to be made simply on the basis that the medical evidence is correct, the importance is that the medical opinion had been explained clearly to the mother, that it had been explored and understood by the clinical paediatrician what the mother was saying in response, and the conclusion still from the clinical paediatrician was that there was no danger to Y.

The independent expert paediatrician was of course employed by the court to consider the entirety of Y&#8217;s medical notes and prepared not just his report, but also a chronology. His evidence was that there was no mention at any time of Y suffering from a cardiac arrest, whether from having oxygen during a seizure or otherwise. There is nothing to suggest in the medical notes that anyone has ever told the mother that oxygen could cause a problem with Y&#8217;s respiration whilst having a seizure. I heard evidence from the clinical paediatrician and the independent expert paediatrician that it was likely to assist Y by raising her oxygen levels which can drop during a seizure.</span></p>

I would like for decisions to be made and stuck to and not for things to keep changing. In terms of the use of lubricant when changing the catheter, Y is that used to have a catheter I do not feel that she needs this. In respect of the weighing of soiled nappies, I was told that I could do this by urodynamics. The scales I was provided with initially came from them. These were then lost in hospital, so I had to replace them. It may have been the medical advice that this was not necessary, but I was told I could do this. I would weigh wet nappies to keep an eye on the amount of urine passed as this was often an indicator of UTI&#8217;s, which Y was prone to getting. When she had a UTI, her kidneys would not work properly and so she would end up retaining a large amount of liquid. I accept that the issue of the use of nappies has been an ongoing issue. The issue is the supply and demand. The suppliers provide 5 nappies a day for Y. The Children&#8217;s Hospice are using 6-8. Therefore, there is a shortage. The social worker said that she would give the money to the Children&#8217;s Hospice for more nappies to be purchased but then the Children&#8217;s Hospice have been asking me to make the purchase. The issue just needs to be resolved properly.</span></p>

She accepted that exaggeration was very normal from parents, but it does mean that things that are important could be missed. She said the school had always told her that Y is bright and happy and loves school. She said her biggest fear was that something important would be missed in relation to Y because they are so sceptical about the mother&#8217;s reporting. She said previously if something was reported, it was often not reported by other people caring for Y or the school, and that could mean something is missed. She said now it was good to feel confident. She said that in the past sometimes they have repeatedly looked for things in case they are wrong, but that even when they had done that it has not resulted in reassurance for the mother, and they just go around in the same loops.</span></p>

She said the mother was asking staff to put things in the records that she thought had happened, which they did not agree with. She said that therefore they had gone to the extent of letting staff write a concern sheet was not completed in front of the mother, as the relationship between the carer and the mother needed to be maintained, and that was why carers were adding things in the form afterwards. It was therefore agreed that the carers could complete these emails out of work hours and away from mother. She said that the mother&#8217;s compliance was variable. She said that there could be periods of up to 6 weeks to 2 months where there were no difficulties, and then matters would escalate quite quickly over a short period of time. She was very clear this was a pattern and said that towards the end of their time helping to care for Y the cycles were escalating in her view. She said that at times there would be some form of verbal conflict, which in her view would affect Y at times. She gave as an example that the mother considered a carer being in Y&#8217;s room was disturbing the mother, and that therefore the only way this could be managed was for the carer to be downstairs, and watching Y on a monitor. She said in her view that placed Y at risk, but as the mother was not allowing carers upstairs then they evaluated the risk was greater if they were not there than if they were monitoring at a distance.</span></p>

It is concerning that given what the mother accepts at allegation 4, that she does not accept the implications of that, spelt out in allegation 5. That is however consistent with much of what the mother says she accepts, and her understanding of the problems in this case. It is, in truth, self evident that significant and long standing conflict and disagreements over diagnoses and treatment can lead to misunderstandings over Y&#8217;s health care needs. The evidence is clear that they do create the probability that Y will have additional and unnecessary medical interventions. I accept that for a child with the medical needs of Y, there will inevitably be some areas of disagreement and perhaps lengthy discussion between carers and the medical professionals. The issue is the extent to which the mother&#8217;s behaviour goes beyond that. In my view the evidence of Nurse (2) shows a typical example of that behaviour. She had to manage carers feeling under pressure from the mother not to write things in front of her, even if they considered it to be factual, as that would cause such conflict that it was not in Y&#8217;s best interests. Without a proper record from the carers of Y, there is of course a risk of things being missed, and accurate records not being made, as the clinical paediatrician so clearly expressed her worries about.</span></p>

Nurse (2) gave evidence that there were behaviours of the mother which made carers uncomfortable to record their observations. That was clearly supported by Care Worker (2), who considered she had to take photos clandestinely, instead of confronting the mother. I have borne in mind when considering this allegation that for any parent, having carers in your house for that period of time would be intrusive. It is not surprising that there were flash points and some disagreements. The evidence overall in relation to this however shows a pattern which exceeds what would be expected, where the mother&#8217;s behaviour did hamper the reliable record keeping and treatment from doctors for Y, and communication problems were created by her mother.</span></p>

In another example where the mother clearly disagreed with the medics, significant conflict was caused by the mother insisting that Y&#8217;s nappies needed to be weighed. Indeed, the mother sets out in some detail in her response to this why she was of that view that the nappies needed to be weighed. The medical evidence however was clear as I set out above, that was not necessary, and again, the mother&#8217;s insistent assertion of why this was necessary medically made no sense, and was incorrect. This was a very typical piece of evidence from the mother, which does exemplify many of the problems in the case, that the mother set out in her response in writing, saying that it was necessary to keep an eye on the amount of urine passed as this was often an indication of UTI&#8217;s, when that is not correct. Similarly, the mother asserted that when Y had a UTI, her kidneys would not work properly and so she would end up retaining a large amount of liquid. Again, that is not correct. The mother&#8217;s stance about this issue of weighing nappies however was unable to be changed despite the number of times this was discussed with her.  Nurse (3) was clear that this was such an issue she called the urology department herself, and then tried to discuss with the mother to reassure her, which would have the impact then of reducing conflict and problems, but the mother would not change her belief. This then is another example where the mother&#8217;s behaviour does illustrate this allegation, which I find to be made out.</span></p>

In considering the totality of the findings that I make: I am quite satisfied this allegation is made out. H&#8217;s behaviour, and the mother&#8217;s reaction to her, and her ability to assist H is concerning. Just as on many occasions doctors have attempted to discuss with the mother some of her erroneous medical beliefs, and she has been unable to make changes to her thought processes, it seems that the courses in themselves are not really assisting the mother in her parenting towards H.</span></p>

Mother has regularly wished to test the levels and has repeatedly reported low blood sugars when the same measurements have not been replicated when Y has been admitted to hospital using more sophisticated equipment. The method of home testing was a painful procedure requiring a blood sample from finger or heel being taken and it was unreasonable for mother to persist in testing for low blood sugars when she was advised this was not medically necessary. Mother attempted to argue that Y could tolerate such repeated painful testing by claiming that Y had a high pain threshold, but had no justification for making that statement and has herself described examples of Y showing signs of pain. Y has also been observed to flinch as if anticipating pain. The health services eventually had to remove the blood sugar monitor which mother had at home to prevent her from overusing it. Mother contends that she was justified in repeatedly checking Y&#8217;s blood sugar levels and she did not accept the medical advice that this procedure was not necessary and caused Y pain. She continues to contend that Y had a high pain threshold. However, the Local Authority points to continued evidence that Y does experience pain and flinches from it. Evidence of her further asking for blood sugar levels to be checked at the Children&#8217;s Hospice, when Y was otherwise bright and alert, is also relevant.</span></p>

I do not accept saying that Y cannot feel it, so it does not matter. I do recall saying that Y has a high pain threshold. I had asked for investigations into Y&#8217;s blood sugars due to observations that I had made including when Y is shaking and dithering her mouth which is an indication of low blood sugars and when I have checked her blood sugars, they have been abnormal. I have asked for tests to be done in hospital in keeping with the observations and at the times when I have tested at home. I do not dispute that at the times when the hospital has conducted tests what they report however, if they did this at the times when I have reported concerns then they may also see what I have been referring to. The hospital has conducted their tests randomly and not when Y has been dithering and shaking as I had reported. I had reported observations of dithering and shaking at 14:30, 18:30 and 23:30. These observations have continued whilst at the Children&#8217;s Hospice when I have been in contact. I am concerned that if there is something amiss with Y&#8217;s blood sugars that this could potentially cause her harm and I did not want this to be overlooked. The clinical paediatrician also reports on E63 &#8216;uncertainties relating to Y&#8217;s blood sugars are: 1) whether the KCNJ11 mutation has any bearing on her blood sugar status now and if not, whether it will in the future; and 2) whether any of the low BM readings that have been reported at home or those recorded by paramedics accurately reflect genuine hypoglycaemia&#8217;. Low blood sugars have been observed other than by me. I only tested Y&#8217;s blood sugars when I considered this to be necessary and there were indications that she might be low. I accept that I was asked to hand the blood sugar monitor over. I felt that I was being bullied to do so. I still have the blood sugar machine as this was not handed over to the GP. This has not been asked for again. I have not used this again either.</span></p>

I have also observed her mouth dithering which is also a symptom of low blood sugars. The care plan was to check if she presented like this. I only ever asked for this to be checked when necessary. There have been occasions when Y&#8217;s blood sugars have been low, and these have been observed by paramedics before and also when Y has gone unconscious as a result.

However there has been a pattern of several attendances in a row of Y at hospital without that being raised, and then another episode of acute illness with low BM at home, often corroborated by ambulance staff, but with any hospital testing being normal on each occasion. The clinical paediatrician states that when she first met the mother in January 2017 the mother said that Y has low blood sugars often associated with a seizure. Mother reported obtaining readings as low as 1, when a normal level is 3.5. There have been no levels that low recorded in hospital at any stage. The clinical paediatrician also reports that the mother has said that Y&#8217;s low blood sugars do not correct with a strong sugar solution, but suggested they do correct with sugar-free paracetamol which The clinical paediatrician made clear does not make sense. The clinical paediatrician was concerned that the mother was testing Y&#8217;s blood sugars very frequently and not considering the impact of that on Y, and that the mother reported symptoms and signs of hypoglycaemia that were not reported by the carers or by the school.</span></p>

The hospital therefore changed to check her blood sugar only when there were any other symptoms, and she had very few blood sugars done after this and nearly all at times when she had a very significant drop in her oxygen saturation. There was one occasion when she had a low blood sugar 3.1, but the staff treated it so it is difficult to understand what the cause might have been.</span></p>

In cross-examination, he elaborated upon his report by stating that it was his understanding the KCNJ11 mutation gave a theoretical risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. He said type 2 diabetes only occurs in the older age group, and Y would not have type 2 at her age. He was taken to a low measurement of 2.2, and said that would not be suggestive of diabetes, as your blood sugar would be high for that type of diabetes, not low. It could be a period of starvation, or secretion of insulin, which Y does not have. He said it could be an erroneous measurement.</span></p>

This was in relation to a note she had made on 23 January 2018. Her evidence was that the mother had told her that she had checked Y&#8217;s blood sugars, and they were low at 2.6. Nurse (1) stated that when she checked them half an hour later after the mother had left to take H to school the blood sugars were 5.2. Nurse (1) had checked the machine she had been given by the mother, and the previous reading said 6.9, and that previous reading had been done the day before. Nurse (1) was clear they do not keep any machines such as that at the Children&#8217;s Hospice, and that was the only machine which could have been used. She said that a normal range of blood sugars would be between 4 to 6, but 6.9 would be in a normal range. A reading of 2.6 then could have been problematic if it was not dealt with. She stated that in her view it was not an unreasonable request of the mother to ask her to do it, but that it was an invasive treatment and there need to be a clear need as to why she was doing it. It was not in the care plan at the Children&#8217;s Hospice. She said that the mother did not suggest that she had given Y something to eat after that low reading. She was quite clear that that monitor had not produced a reading of 2.6.</span></p>

It is also apparent that at the very  least at one stage it was considered that some variants of that disorder could cause problems with blood sugars. It seems clear that was expressed to the mother by way of a letter from the genetics department. What is then apparent is that she requested a blood sugar monitor and from her evidence above was given that. It shows how the facts and realities of Y&#8217;s problems can be misunderstood. If a parent tells another medic that a hospital has given her a blood sugar monitor, then it sems to me that medic will assume that there was a medical need for that. Similarly, if a parent tells a medic that Y has been in hospital for investigations into her blood sugar levels, then any professional (or otherwise) may well understand that to be because Y had been showing abnormal blood sugar levels.

I am careful not to look back on the situation and the mother&#8217;s actions with the benefit of hindsight, but rather in the light of the evidence. There is no evidence that Y has ever had a problem with her blood sugar levels. To the contrary, there is evidence that during detailed testing in hospital she does not. That creates the problem that although the mother has asserted this is an ongoing problem that she can see signs of, she is clearly mistaken, as the medics are quite satisfied now that there is no more uncertainty, and Y does not suffer from problems with her blood sugars. Whatever the mother may believe she was witnessing, was not in fact low blood sugars.</span></p>

The Local Authority further invites the Court to refuse to accept mother&#8217;s assertion that she had received conflicting information about what she should do in the event of such a seizure, which in some way might excuse her failure to take the action, which she appears to accept she should have taken. It is asserted that she had received very detailed training which allowed her to distinguish between the different types of seizures.</span></p>

I accept that I did not call for an ambulance. I accept that I did not administer medical treatment. I did call Rapid Response following the myoclonic seizure and it was confirmed that Y was okay. I did not know that a myoclonic seizure lasted seconds rather than minutes. I had been told that I should time the seizure which is what I did. I had received conflicting information about this. With myoclonic seizures you also did not administer medication. Since this incident, the guidance has been much clearer over expectation. I regret not calling for an ambulance and I am ashamed of that decision. I am being truthful about this incident taking place. There is an error in my statement at paragraph 300, in which I refer to 3 myoclonic seizures, this should read tonic seizures. Y does not need to go into hospital for myoclonic seizures as they are not epileptic seizures. My understand is that they are not the ones that can damage the brain, the tonic ones are. Y has a complex seizure plan and complex epilepsy. I accept that the seizure plan was not clear, and this appears to have been accepted as well by professionals following the event. I accept that I did ask for a transfer to a London Hospital. At one point this was going to take place but then it was decided that Y should stay at the local Hospital. I have held my hands up that I could and should have dealt with things differently.</span></p>

It was suggested to her that the mother thought that she should only call an ambulance if it was a tonic/clonic seizure. Her evidence was that what the mother described to her was not a tonic/clonic seizure, but that Y was slumped forwards with her arms pulled in and violently shaking for 8 minutes. She said that the jerking movements were consistent with myoclonic seizures. She said that she found it hard to understand why the mother had not called an ambulance when the mother told her that she had not seen a seizure of this severity before but accepted that perhaps the mother hadn&#8217;t understood the severity of this seizure. She said the mother told her that once it subsided Y reverted to normal and slept for 45 minutes. She agreed that an ambulance should have been called for. She said that in her view this seizure went on for &#8216;a very, very long time&#8217; and it was a long time for someone to watch a seizure.

I do not accept that any confusion about what type of seizure it was would impact upon that.

Although clearly there were a number of disputes between her and the medics, as set out in the allegations I have already considered, it is hard to understand how that would impact on her decision not to call an ambulance or how events when Y was far younger could still impact on her in a practical way during that event. Ultimately, given I was unable to ascertain exactly why she took the decisions she took, it is a significant concern in the future that the mother could take such a decision again if she were caring for Y. It is certainly true that the mother has given various and quite different reasons for her decision made on that day.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.65in;margin-right:0.22in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I have considered all the evidence relating to this allegation. I am quite satisfied that Nurse (3) was accurate in what she says, and that Y did not have any form of seizure during that phone call, and her eyes did not roll upwards. I am quite sure that Nurse (3) would have seen if Y had indeed rolled her eyes upwards for six seconds and would simply have reported and recorded that. I also accept her clear recollection that the mother did suggest that Y jerked and in my view the mother has resiled from that suggestion given the way in which Nurse (3) illustrated that she was holding Y. Nurse (3) would clearly be able to have felt that. I am particularly concerned not only that the mother asserted Y was breath holding but that she involved H in relation to that, when clearly that was not taking place. I accept the local authority&#8217;s submissions in relation to this matter, that it did appear the mother was adjusting her evidence in relation to this.</span></p>

That does not detract however from the seriousness of the mother asserting that incident above took place when clearly it did not. In my view the very significant disparity between the number of seizures that the mother reported and the number that everyone else, including the hospital, carers at home and the Children&#8217;s Hospice reported is too large to be explained by the mother being more observant. I make this finding as I set out below in more detail that the mother reported seizures that were not taking place.</span></p>

In my view it is established on the balance of probabilities that the mother does overestimate the number of seizures that Y suffers from, and states that seizures have taken place when they have not and she does not accept that can have serious consequences for Y, and is not careful of her assertions about seizures, and will not accept she may be mistaken at times. I am conscious of the mother&#8217;s numerical difficulties, but I am satisfied that the mother has told professionals that Y has had up to 70 seizures a day, despite her denials of that.</span></p>

Whilst the mother again claimed that the Children&#8217;s Hospice had called her, and used that fact to illustrate why she was right about this report, as they would not call her about a shorter seizure, it was shown that there was no evidence that such a phone call had been made. I have no doubt that the Children&#8217;s Hospice would not only have documented such a seizure, but would have documented the phone call following it. That is not at all what the documents show, in fact quite the contrary, they show that no such call was made, and the mother is either mistaken in her recollection of this, or it is an example of her exaggerating a seizure taking place. The local authority assert this demonstrates the mother making up something to vindicate her position, rather than admitting she was mistaken. In my view that is correct. The mother&#8217;s evidence was characterised by an inability to accept she may be mistaken, and a dogmatic insistence that she was correct even when taken to other evidence which clearly disproved her stance. I accept of course that at least partly this is out of the mother&#8217;s lack of capacity to change her thinking, it is not simply that she chooses to behave in this way, and that is illustrated by a number of the conclusions of the psychological assessment.</span></p>

She said although the mother reported she was undertaking this procedure, Y did not need that intervention at school, and it was not needed when Y was in hospital for a two-week period in October 2018. It has never been needed during subsequent admissions to hospital. The clinical paediatrician sets out her concern that the mother&#8217;s reporting she was aspirating up to 1 litre of air from Y&#8217;s stomach, and that in her view that was unlikely to be accurate unless it was referring to repeated aspirations over many hours. The clinical paediatrician set out that if there was air in Y&#8217;s stomach which was under pressure it should come out by just venting the gastrostomy. A carer had reported that the mother had aspirated with such force that her knuckles turned white. Whilst the clinical paediatrician accepted there was a possibility that Y may swallow more air than most children, there was no reason why that would only happen when in her mother&#8217;s care. She stated that there was no reason therefore for Y to have aspiration of her gastrostomy to remove air as opposed to simply venting. The clinical paediatrician stated that the mother had been told not to aspirate Y&#8217;s gastrostomy, but she continued to do so.</span></p>

The clinical paediatrician was of the view that if this was vented gently then there was no harm, but it was still not necessary.

I am conscious of the mother&#8217;s difficulty with accuracy in mathematics, and do not wish to simply assume that she is wrong, but the combination of the evidence from all the witnesses means that I am quite satisfied that the mother has not aspirated 1,400ml of air from Y&#8217;s stomach. It appears to be far more likely that the mother has become muddled with the sums she has added up. To withdraw 1,400mls of air using a 20ml syringe would take 70 syringe fulls. Whilst no medic suggested that was impossible, and it would be open to me to make a finding that did take place, (which for the avoidance of I would view as an entirely unpleasant and unnecessary procedure to be performed over a lengthy period of time on Y on a large number of occasions according to the mother), my finding is that did not take place, and the mother is simply mistaken in relation the quantity of air.</span></p>

The mother quite clearly however believes that it is. It is a very typical example of the difficulties in this case, and the many things that the mother holds strong but incorrect views about.

He was asked whether there was a need for deep catheter suctioning, and he said that clearly Y had changed over her lifetime, but Y is now fully fed.

It is used to protect the lungs. He accepted it was possible that a change of medication could increase secretions for Y.

She accepted at the end of that part of her evidence again that she was told not to do this. She said that it was necessary when Y had a chest infection, as she does not have a good swallow and she was therefore prone to aspiration when she was poorly. She accepted that since Y has been in hospital and then in the Children&#8217;s Hospice, she has not needed suction at all, but then added that in her view that was because the professionals looking after her do not recognise when Y needs suctioning, adding that was where some of her disagreements came in.</span></p>

The mother was also suctioning at far too high a pressure, and the clinical paediatrician had not told her that was acceptable. The medical evidence of both the clinical paediatrician and the independent expert paediatrician was that Y did not need this suctioning. Y did not need it at any point in hospital, or whilst she has been at the Children&#8217;s Hospice. There is no doubt that the mother has been told by the clinical paediatrician that this was not necessary, but that she requested the suction machine from a worker who did not know Y well, and then used it in a most excessive way. The descriptions of Y&#8217;s reaction to it are very unpleasant and should have alerted any carer.</span></p>

This must have been extremely unpleasant for Y. I do not accept the mother&#8217;s suggestion that she did not notice blood in the catheter as she was probably attending to H. Either that happened so frequently that she did not really notice it, or she was so intent on what she was undertaking that she considered that acceptable. Either is extremely worrying.  I also do not accept the mother&#8217;s suggestion that in advance of seeing blood in the catheter she had asked the previous community nurse about that. In my view for any parent to think that suctioning their child could cause them to bleed, would be a frightening and distressing suggestion and not one that would occur to a parent unless it had actually happened. I find that was an untrue assertion by the mother to try and make what happened seem less serious.</span></p>

She fails to take on board medical advice that, for example, a reading of zero on a heart rate monitor will often be due to failure of the monitor being used, not cardiac arrest, especially if Y is conscious and babbling at the same time. Repeated reporting of such problems could cause professionals to miss genuine crises in the future. Mother has claimed to have undertaken CPR on Y which has not historically been documented. Mother claims cardiac arrest has occurred at the hospital on 6 occasions, although there are no historical medical records to that effect. The symptoms which mother describes as &#8216;cardiac arrests&#8217; would inevitably cause great concern to medical practitioners. Her evidence for suggesting that Y has actually suffered such alleged incidents appears to rely on machine recordings and allegations that proper records are not kept; and it is not credible. This catastrophic description may be similar to mother claiming that if Y sleeps on her back or her front, then she stops breathing. The Local Authority invites the Court to make the findings sought in Paragraph 19. The Court may also wish to conclude that Y&#8217;s heart has not stopped beating, whether on 56 occasions, or at all, and that mother&#8217;s persistence in insisting that cardiac arrests took place in the past, serves to emphasise her reluctance to accept medical advice with which she disagrees.</span></p>

She said that was a difficult one, but that Y did display symptoms of one. She described Y stopping babbling and turning her head to one side. When asked when this happened the mother accepted that she had not been present and that a carer had described that to her, and she was in a meeting when she was telephoned. She accepted that she was relying on what someone else had said who was not a professional and then went onto say that she was told Y had a TIA. She was again challenged that that is not recorded anywhere in the papers, but insisted that was what she was told.</span></p>

Yet again I remind myself of the mother&#8217;s cognitive difficulties, but she has been challenged in relation to this aspect on a number of occasions, she has had the benefit of expert legal advice and the assistance of an intermediary, and of hearing the evidence of the clinical paediatrician and the independent expert paediatrician. She is immovable in her belief and will clearly continue to repeat that to medics who may be treating Y in the future. Once again that creates a very real risk of Y not being correctly treated, or of being treated in an incorrect way.</span></p>

She set out her view however that there had been no treatment that was making that difference, nothing has changed, but her health was now much more stable, and in her view that could be ascribed to the fact that she was being looked after by carers who were more consistent, doctors were being given more accurate information, and that reflects her true being. The clinical paediatrician said that in her view the improvement in Y is not explained by anything medically that has been done to Y, but that the reality was Y was presenting now as a stable child, which was not the situation before. That was not due to anything that they had done, and that in her mind it showed that what she had been told before was not true.</span></p>

I also agree with the independent expert paediatrician, that the problems in this case appear to be from the mother&#8217;s cognition and her psychology. There are many examples given of how the mother holds strange and inaccurate medical beliefs.

The reality is however that her actions and in particular her inability to understand medical advice, to analyse that and apply it to Y&#8217;s needs, and her inability to change and adapt her thinking has undoubtedly caused Y significant harm.</span></p>

The welfare of Y when I consider this change to the care plan is my paramount consideration. I have given particular attention to the matters contained in the welfare checklist at </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Garamond">s1 (3) of the Children Act 1989</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.

Even when she was living at home with her mother and sister, she has had very regular admissions to hospital sometimes just overnight sometimes for longer periods. Y has now been apart from her mother and sister since April 2021, and has had a move between the two Children&#8217;s Hospice sites. There is a great deal of evidence that Y responds well to her mother, and enjoys her mother&#8217;s love and affection. It seems to me that Y would wish to be at home with her mother and sister if that were possible, but I must also reflect the findings that I have made above, that the mother has insisted on performing unnecessary and at times painful procedures upon Y, and I have no doubt Y would not wish that to carry on.</span></p>

I have made findings that the mother is sadly not able currently to respond appropriately to Y&#8217;s physical needs, and indeed some of her actions I have no doubt will have caused Y emotional harm as well. Given the mother&#8217;s responses to some of the matters that the local authority alleges, the court can currently have no confidence that the mother&#8217;s behaviour would be any different if Y was returned to her care, no matter what package of support was put into place.</span></p>

Although on behalf of the mother it is asserted that any move is for administrative convenience, in my view that is misconceived. Not only is the Children&#8217;s Hospice not an appropriate place for Y, but they gave notice on that placement 3 months ago, as they are entitled to do, and have been extremely patient. In my view there is a clear welfare balance to Y being in a family type environment, and with regular carers, not nurses, however well meaning they are.</span></p>

I bear in mind that their accommodation will be unknown to her, and it will be a strange environment. As I have set out above, Y has sadly become accustomed over her short life to staying in a number of different places, different beds in hospitals, 2 different Children&#8217;s Hospice sites, and I accept that any moves should be minimised. I must weigh it seems to me whether there is a need for a change at the moment, or whether as the mother asserts Y could remain at the Children&#8217;s Hospice if she cannot return to her care.</span></p>

That has of course been the subject of very significant consideration over most of Y&#8217;s life. Although I certainly accept that the full extent of the mother&#8217;s difficulties was not known, I am entirely satisfied that those working with the mother did so sympathetically and trying to assist her for many years, and that medical problems and concepts and solutions were discussed with her in many different ways over a sustained period of time, and in a way that she is able to understand from her evidence. She has not been able to modify her behaviour, or to accept the concepts even when they were explained very simply to her. Her ability to do so in the future must of course again be the subject of proper assessment that will only be possible once a clear understanding of the mother&#8217;s response to my findings is possible. That further assessment must of course take into account the mother&#8217;s difficulties.</span></p>

As I have set out above, whilst they have been extremely patient, they have given legal notice to the local authority that Y cannot remain there. It appears to me to be quite wrong to suggest that the court could simply ignore that and refused to make an order that effectively sanctions Y&#8217;s removal from placement. For the avoidance of any doubt however, even on a welfare analysis Y should not remain at the Children&#8217;s Hospice. It is an institution, and however well-meaning the staff are, and however long they may have worked there for, it is not a family environment. It seems to me that it is very much in Y&#8217;s welfare interests for her to be cared for if possible by consistent carers, and in a family type situation and accommodation.</span></p>

I urge her to consider very carefully my findings. I appreciate that will entail a significant adjustment to many of her beliefs which she will find very challenging. She must attempt to understand that she is not always correct in relation to Y and her needs, and it appears likely to the court that only if she is able to make proper and genuine changes to her beliefs and behaviours that there is any real prospect of Y returning to her care.</span></p>
