On 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 that application was dismissed by His Honour Judge Bond.

He has challenged the integrity of the Judge and I bear in mind that this is a committal application with potential consequences for him if findings were made against him.   I should say that I am aware that the Local Authority at present instructed do not seek an immediate committal order but would require a suspended order if the contempt was established.   I bear in mind also that there are parallel criminal charges against Mr. Goodall and they too maybe affected by a finding made on the committal proceedings.   With some hesitation I have decided that I should not continue to deal with these proceedings.   I will recuse myself from the committal application and I will not require the application to be considered by the other Circuit Judge sitting in this court.   I propose to transfer the committal application to the High Court and will refer it to the Family Division liaison judge&#8221;.</p>

In respect of this alleged breach, Mr. Wade stated that it constituted a clear breach of the injunction in that Mr. Goodall has caused staff to feel harassed, intimidated and threatened.   Whilst the County Council is confident that no further action will be taken by the police against members of staff, Mr. Wade asserted that Mr. Goodall&#8217;s actions had caused significant alarm to individual officers and further annoyance to the Local Authority&#8217;s staff in general. Mr. Wade claimed that Mr. Goodall had no evidence to support his assertion that any criminal charges will be brought.   Further, the comments were defamatory because no charges had been brought.   Although the Local Authority had been found to have failed to prevent the children being named by their adopted names prior to the adoption order being made, there has been no finding that the Local Authority had unlawfully changed Mr. Goodall&#8217;s surname so as to cover the abuse allegedly suffered by the girls in care or that the girls did indeed experience any abuse during their time in care.</p>

That includes, in particular, the Local Authority&#8217;s social work staff, the lawyers who represent all the parties in proceedings, court staff and judges.   Those individuals have to accept, of course, that parents whose children are the subject of care proceedings will have strong feelings; but, equally, all those professionals are entitled to be treated with respect.   This court will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the safety and security of those professionals is protected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case Judge Meston found that the Local Authority had in one respect acted improperly, namely by permitting the children to be known by their adoptive surname shortly before the Adoption Orders were made.   Apart from that error, I can see no evidence of any error or misconduct or action on the part of the Local Authority which justifies any criticism whatsoever.   They have done their work, in my judgment, with proper professionalism, acting as they rightly believe in the interests of the three girls whose welfare was the paramount consideration in the children&#8217;s proceedings.</p>
