		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The same considerations apply to a defendant who is unsuccessful. The Court has the right and the duty to decree the proper relief against him, but it can do no more. It cannot add to that relief directions or commands as to his future conduct. If they are not part of the relief itself they are pronounced without authority. The conception of the Court interfering with litigants otherwise than by granting the relief which it is empowered and bound to grant is wholly vicious and strikes at the foundation of the status and duties of judges. We claim and obtain obedience and respect for our office because we are nothing other than the appointed agents for enforcing upon each individual the performance of his obligations.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore, while a decision of a senior judge can amount to a binding precedent, its direct effect is confined to the parties to the proceedings. Obviously, in an incidental way, a decision of a judge can have an impact on non-parties, but the court has no authority to award relief against non-parties (save in defined exceptional circumstances), or, for that matter, to pronounce commands against a party which is not part of the relief properly awardable. It is a basic axiom that where a court takes it upon itself to exercise authority which it does not possess, its decision amounts to nothing and no party can in the least be bound by it: <span style="font-style:italic">A-G v Lord Hotham</span>&#160;(1827) 3 Russ 415 per Sir Thomas Plumer MR..</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was submitted to me that a judgment in these proceedings might be helpful in a later application concerning a future, as yet unborn, child. The classic common law view, as propounded in <span style="font-style:italic">Hollington v Hewthorn</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1943] KB 587" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1943">[1943] KB 587</ref> by Lord Goddard CJ, is that factual findings made by judges in civil cases are inadmissible in subsequent proceedings between different parties. The rule was traditionally explained as being an instance of the proscription of hearsay evidence, such that it fell away with the passage of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/38" uk:canonical="1995 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Evidence Act 1995</ref>. However, in <span style="font-style:italic">Hoyle v Rogers &amp; Anor</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/257" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 257" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 257</ref> Christopher Clarke LJ held at [39] that the rule survived.

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The trial judge must decide the case for himself on the evidence that he receives, and in the light of the submissions on that evidence made to him. To admit evidence of the findings of fact of another person, however distinguished, and however thorough and competent his examination of the issues may have been, risks the decision being made, at least in part, on evidence other than that which the trial judge has heard and in reliance on the opinion of someone who is neither the relevant decision maker nor an expert in any relevant discipline, of which decision making is not one. The opinion of someone who is not the trial judge is, therefore, as a matter of law, irrelevant and not one to which he ought to have regard.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This reasoning forcefully reflects the general proposition that the role and purpose of a court is solely to determine on the evidence the dispute between the parties before it. It echoes the judgment of Sir William de Grey, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in the <span style="font-style:italic">Duchess of Kingston's case</span> [1775-1802] All ER Rep 623  (20 April 1776) where he stated:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;What has been said at the Bar is certainly true as a general principle, that a transaction between two parties, in judicial proceedings, ought not to be binding upon a third; for it would be unjust to bind any person who could not be admitted to make a defence, or to examine witnesses, or to appeal from a judgment he might think erroneous. Therefore, the depositions of witnesses in another cause in proof of a fact, the verdict of a jury finding the fact, and the judgment of the court upon facts found, although evidence against the parties, and all claiming under them, are not, in general, to be used to the prejudice of strangers.&#8221;</p>

I therefore accept that a fact-finding judgment in public law children proceedings would not be technically inadmissible in later proceedings in relation to a different child. But when considering whether to order a fact-finding trial in respect of un-admitted allegations for possible use in later proceedings the court will surely have in mind the reasons why the common law has developed the public policy principle that such a judgment is generally inadmissible.</p>

The over-complication of the procedures for conclusion by compromise risks the loss of that essential benefit in what may be a very finely balanced and complex situation. If there is a concession that the essential orders should be written either by consent or unopposed, if there is a formal concession of the passage of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s&#8197;31</ref> threshold, if that concession is based on specific admissions of abuse or neglect, if the court is satisfied that the order and its foundations are proved, it seems to me quite contrary to public interest that the proceedings should be prolonged simply to resolve nice differences as to the expression of the essential concessions.</p>

Explicitly, the original authorities hold that the potential utility of the judgment in later proceedings involving a different child is not a legitimate purpose of such a hearing (I shall call this <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the different child&#8221;</span> purpose or factor).

She was the subject of care proceedings in Guildford in 2016 - 2017, which concluded with AW being placed with her father, CC.  In those proceedings, threshold matters included causation of a rib fracture, sustained in late 2016 &#8211; early 2017 and ingestion by AW (then pre-mobile) of dihydrocodeine, a medication prescribed for VW, which resulted in AW becoming profoundly unwell.  A judgment of Recorder Bugg given on 4 September 2017 concluded that, while it could not be said that the dihydrocodeine was administered deliberately, VW had &#8216;somehow committed an act that recklessly endangered AW&#8217;s life&#8217;.  No finding was made as to causation of the rib fracture, in view of the accepted possibility that it could have been caused during CPR.    </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in">When surveying the justice of the case&#160;I confirm that I have stood back and rechecked that I have taken into account all relevant matters, including all matters relevant to the implementation of the overriding objective. I am not persuaded that there would be any particularly material &#8220;gulf&#8221; between the facts that would underpin a care order without a fact-finding exercise, and the apprehended factual findings were I to permit the matter to proceed to trial. This exercise is quintessentially conjectural and hypothetical. However, I have taken into account the level of seriousness of the disputed allegations and I have satisfied myself that the process I have ordained does justice to the reality of the case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fundamentally, I am not persuaded that a fact-finding hearing is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">necessary</span>. During argument I asked Mr Sampson QC: <span style="font-style:italic">cui bono? </span>By which I meant, for whose benefit would a fact-finding judgment accrue? In the <span style="font-style:italic">Oxfordshire </span>case it was foreseeable that the father would apply for direct contact in the future. Plainly, a judgment containing clear factual findings would be highly relevant were such an application to be made. In this case, however, VW will agree to a care order and a placement order being made. It has been suggested that there is a possibility that the VW will apply in the future either for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 47(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>, or for leave to revoke the placement order under s. 24(2)(a) of the same Act. Each provision requires proof of a change of circumstances since the placement order was made. The change of circumstances must be significant and unexpected. Then the court must go on to make the familiar evaluation whether in the light of such a change of circumstances, and all other relevant facts, the application should be allowed to proceed. At that stage the applicant has to show that there are &#8216;solid&#8217; prospects of success.</p>

If I am wrong about that, I am clear, on the specific facts of this case, that the probability produced by a combination of the likelihood of (i) another child being born to VW, and (ii) care proceedings being initiated in respect of that child, and (iii) findings about VW&#8217;s conduct before 26 March 2020 (now nearly  2&#189; years ago) being material in such proceedings is so small as to rule out this factor as a relevant consideration in the discretionary exercise.   </p>

If I am wrong on this point, then I make clear that on the facts of this case I am far from satisfied that a judgment is needed on the un-admitted allegations in order to be able to reveal the whole truth to IW. If (and I emphasise if) there is an advantage to IW in the years ahead coming to understand the whole truth about his adoption, then I do not believe that the interlocutor who chronicles that whole truth will have any difficulty in assembling the story from the existing schedule of admitted allegations, and the 4,200-odd pages of evidence including the uncontradicted expert evidence referred to above. I do not believe that the chronicler needs the assistance of a judgment in order to assemble that story.</p>

Taken at its highest, the case that the local authority wishes to prove could not conceivably be for the main purpose of later enabling  the public identification of VW as a child abuser. That is not a relevant factor on the facts of this case. </p>

In particular, I have regard to the need to be able to allot to the case an appropriate share of the court's resources, while taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases. In my opinion the five days in September would be much more appropriately occupied by dealing with a case where the resolution of factual issues will have a direct bearing on the outcome of the proceedings. </p>

In my judgment it would be a deplorable waste of valuable resources for the un-admitted allegations to be formally adjudicated in a state trial. I cannot see any upside to allowing this to proceed; by contrast I can see (and have seen) huge downsides. The downsides include the unquestionable toll that the process would take on VW. </p>
