I have had the benefit of a detailed email by Ms Singleton, who is a manager at NYAS. She has met with P and provided her professional opinion on if P is competent to instruct her own representation. She set out that this is a very balanced case, so much so that she would have requested an expert report. However, we are fortunate that one is already available, prepared by Dr Hessel Willemsen (hereinafter referred to as Dr W), which recommends P is not competent. Further, Ms Singleton prepared a Position Statement on behalf P for this hearing, which P did not respond to and therefore hasn&#8217;t been approved by her. On the first morning of this final hearing I gave an extemporaneous judgment which determined that P was not competent and should not have separate representation. My conclusion was in line with that of all the professionals.</span></p>

The inherent probability or improbability of an event remains a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. As has been observed, &#8220;Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities&#8221; (Re B<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/35" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 35</ref> at [15]).</span></p>

It is well established that the court cannot put a gloss on to the paramountcy principle in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1</ref>.  I do not read the judgments in Re: A as purporting to do that.  The test is, and must always be, based on a comprehensive analysis of the child&#8217;s welfare and a determination of where the welfare balance points in terms of outcome.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is important to note that the welfare provisions in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1</ref> are precisely the same provisions as those applying in public law children cases where a local authority may seek the court's authorisation to remove a child from parental care either to place them with another relative or in alternative care arrangements. Where, in private law proceedings, the choice, as here, is between care by one parent and care by another parent against whom there are no significant findings, one might anticipate that the threshold triggering a change of residence would, if anything, be lower than that justifying the permanent removal of a child from a family into foster care. Use of phrases such as &#8220;last resort&#8221; or &#8220;draconian&#8221; cannot and should not indicate a different or enhanced welfare test. What is required is for the judge to consider all the circumstances in the case that are relevant to the issue of welfare, consider those elements in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1 (3)</ref> welfare check list which apply on the facts of the case and then, taking all those matters into account, determine which of the various options best meets the child's welfare needs</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.&#8221;</span></p>

Both these examples relate to public law proceedings but have no less application to private law cases, particularly where there are child protection issues but there is no need of local authority involvement because the caring parent, as here, has proved that they are capable of protecting their child. The reality is that, with ever-decreasing resources and the closure of contact centres, long-term supervision will rarely be a realistic option in private law cases such as this; that does not mean however that in an appropriate case such a route should not be deployed as a means of allowing a child to continue to have a relationship with her absent parent</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.&#8221;</span></p>

As Baker J said in in Gloucestershire CC v RH and others at [42], it is essential that the judge forms a view as to the credibility of each of the witnesses, to which end oral evidence will be of great importance in enabling the court to discover what occurred, and in assessing the reliability of the witness. </span></p>

The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities. However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence. Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable.</span></p>

The approach in R v Lucas is not confined, as it was on the facts of Lucas itself, to a statement made out of court and can apply to a &#8220;lie&#8221; made in the course of the court proceedings and the approach is not limited solely to evidence concerning accomplices.</span></p>

Where the &#8220;lie&#8221; has a prominent or central relevance to the case such a self-direction is plainly sensible and good practice. </span></p>

It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8220;lie&#8221; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane&#8217;s judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8220;capable of amounting to a corroboration&#8221;. In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. </span></p>

If the issue for the tribunal to decide is whether to believe X or Y on the central issue/s, and the evidence is clearly one way then there will be no need to address credibility in general. However, if the tribunal looks to find support for their view, it must caution itself against treating what it finds to be an established propensity to dishonesty as determinative of guilt for the reasons the Recorder gave in [40]. Conversely, an established propensity to honesty will not always equate with the witness's reliability of recall on a particular issue.</span></p>

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others. As memory fades, a desire to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural &#8211; a process which might inelegantly described as &#8220;story creep&#8221; &#8211; may occur without any inference of bad faith.&#8221;</span></p>

In the intervening period the forensic landscape has changed out of all recognition. Amongst the many advances is the advent of the smart phone and of social media in all its forms. Of particular relevance in this context is the almost universal use of email as a means of instant communication. Another development of relevance is that as a result of the withdrawal of legal aid in the majority of private law cases, a large proportion of parents are unrepresented and therefore do not have, as the judge described it in the present case, the 'steadying in&#64258;uence' of legal advisors. </span></p>

Such behaviour may be the result of anxiety but in other cases, as in this case, it is part of a campaign of behaviour by one parent against the other which amounts to a deeply disturbing form of oppressive behaviour on their part. </span></p>

All too often such communications are ill-considered and ill-judged with the consequence that every minor dispute or misunderstanding is met with an application to the judge. More importantly, the distress and anxiety caused to the other parent and to the children at the centre of such a raging dispute cannot be overestimated, nor can the damaging consequences where the focus of the litigation veers away from what, on any objective view, would and should be regarded as the real issues going to the welfare of the children concerned. </span></p>

F is appropriately concerned and has been taking advice as to the correct course of action. He has engaged with the work around boundaries and is currently engaging with the teen parenting course, although there have been some concerning incidents, they do not have concerns about F&#8217;s care of P and he is providing good enough care.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">TBR was concerned about M&#8217;s continued lack of acceptance and refusal to engage in the therapeutic work with P. There were some reported difficulties with arranging a parent consultation with M but more concerningly was M&#8217;s clearly hostile and combative approach within that session. It was clear when reading about the session (the content of which was not disputed by M in cross examination) that M had attended with her own agenda and used the time to ensure that her criticisms of F and professionals were heard, M appeared to lose sight of P within that session beyond her own narrative of P. In oral evidence TBR was clear that M&#8217;s approach &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">leaves P feeling responsible for the conflict between her parents</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;. Further it is very concerning when M says that when P comes back to her she will have to undo all that F has done, as it would be harmful to P. </span></p>

The 3 month reunification plan didn&#8217;t work because M has not been involved with the work, this did not have to be engagement with TBR and it was accepted that she may feel more comfortable with another therapist but there is no evidence that she has undertaken the work required or come to terms with the judgment, .

His reasoning was in accordance with his previous evidence on this point. P is currently at the centre of her parents&#8217; dispute, she has been drawn into this conflict by M (including conversations during contact), she does not have the emotional intelligence to oversee the issues and therefore is not capable of forming her own view and opinion separately to that of the adults around her (specifically M). Further, if P were to engage with the case and have to consider the evidence this is likely to be distressing to her because she will be drawn further into the parental conflict (as set out in a previous judgment the impact on P is not part of the 2 stage test I need to apply however, it is a valuable part of Dr W&#8217;s evidence regarding the impact on P of drawing her further into the conflict within this case). Finally, Dr W felt that P being separately represented could have the effect of &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">M using P&#8217;s instruction of a solicitor to advance the mother&#8217;s case&#8221;.</span></p>

I have raised this quote as I believe it is borne out by the contact notes where P continually tries to communicate with M that she doesn&#8217;t wish to discuss certain matters but M continues to raise them. Equally, P has never raised with a professional face-to-face that she would like to have separate representation, yet M continues to doggedly pursue this for her own reasons, despite all professionals being clear as to the distress and harm this is likely to cause P. </span></p>

M feels her role as a mother has been taken from her and this is a very difficult loss.

Dr W is clear that P needs protecting from M and this is essential when considering contact. However she continues to be negative about F, fails to accept all of the courts findings and continues to minimise concerns and pull P into the adult disputes. If P makes an allegation about F to M she should be seeking to deal with this directly with F in an adult and conciliatory manner instead of discussing them with P.

M criticised G for the report not containing an analysis of the Welfare Checklist, I felt this was unfairly critical as while the headings are not contained within the report, her &#8220;Conclusions and Recommendations&#8221; section is 38 paragraphs long. Within those paragraphs all of the elements of the welfare checklist are covered (for example wishes and feelings are at paragraph 4.5 and 4.6, education at paragraph 4.7, and her emotional needs are throughout the 38 paragraphs). This is a complex case and the G has, in my opinion, dealt with all elements of the Welfare Checklist and how they interrelate in a non-linear manner.

At that stage he struggled to acknowledge where he was at fault and while open to some suggestions was at a loss as to how to implement them. During this hearing he was reflective, thoughtful and has clearly gained a significant amount of insight into himself and P.

This leads F to believe that while P does want to live with M it is misguided because she just wants to have her own way.

This seemed to me to be wholly contradictory to M&#8217;s evidence given on the previous occasion where she said she felt F was cutting her off from her friends and family and trying to get them to side with him. I had made a finding (as set out in her schedule) that he was misguided when trying to communicate with her side of the family by setting up a WhatsApp group. This line of questions was also in stark contrast to the evidence M gave in the first consented hearing where F was upset that she didn&#8217;t make allowances for P to spend time with the paternal family and M&#8217;s response was that it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">her responsibility to promote F&#8217;s family</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221; with her clear message being that if F wanted P to spend time with his family it was up to him to facilitate it. I had some sympathy with F as he tried to answer questions on why he wasn&#8217;t taking P to her Maternal Grandparents&#8217; home etc given the history in these proceedings. It seemed M was putting F in a position where he would have been criticised regardless of the action he had taken since the last hearing. </span></p>

While I will deal with this later in the findings, I will highlight here the hypocrisy that came with M&#8217;s line of questioning. In the first fact finding I made a finding that M had smacked P. This was something P had complained about to friends and professionals, and M had vehemently denied it, M had, in essence, called P a liar. It was only when giving evidence during the hearing that M accepted, she had smacked P as a result of arguments about studying and P&#8217;s mobile. M&#8217;s approach to her situation was to protect herself and not only deny P&#8217;s experience but also to portray P as being untruthful to everyone, including the social worker at the time. I am still unaware if M has even acknowledged to P what she did or said sorry to her. M&#8217;s is seeking to vilify F for reactions and responses which were very similar to her own, despite him having done everything to repair the situation with P and her having compounded the situation by causing further harm to P. After that hearing I did not use the finding I made against M about hitting P to remove her from M&#8217;s care, instead I ordered 50/50 division as all matters had to be taken into consideration. </span></p>

Fortunately, and somewhat by chance, part of the conversation between P and Ms Singleton had covered boarding as P wishes to board for a week towards the end of last term due to it being a fun week and some of her friends would be boarding, however she didn&#8217;t think she would be allowed to as F was supporting it and therefore P didn&#8217;t believe M would.

However, she has also sent a number of emails which are long, rambling and give serious cause for concern as to M&#8217;s perception of the situation and her future intentions. I can appreciate that F and the professionals may not know which version of M they will be interacting with and this will place further strain on those relationships and ultimately P. There has to be some acknowledgement from those working with the family that this situation is placing significant strain on M as she feels as if she has lost everything, they need to ensure they communicate with her effectively and in a timely manner. However the intervention that is likely to have the greatest impact on M and this situation is her engaging in the recommended therapy, with a therapist that has had sight of all the papers in this matter and can assist M in understanding and accepting the judgments and the reasons for them. </span></p>

It is positive that she has engaged with this and is finding it beneficial. I accept that M sent to Ms Hewitt the documents which were ordered to be provided to the therapist but due to this being the wrong type of therapy, Ms Hewitt hasn&#8217;t read those documents. Sadly, this is not the correct type of therapy and the professional recommendations remain that psychoanalytic psychotherapy is the correct method to assist M in moving forwards in a manner that will assist P. An example of this is that M says she didn&#8217;t write a letter of apology to P, even about the few findings she did accept as she &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">didn&#8217;t have any help</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;.

I then take this one step further in that it is also M&#8217;s view that hearing P&#8217;s wishes and feelings means I would automatically agree with them and they would form the basis of any orders. By having this expectation M is fundamentally misunderstanding the legal approach; I can and do listen to and acknowledge what P has said she wants but listening is vastly different to agreeing with P. P&#8217;s voice is only one which I must hear and give consideration to, in short it is one piece of the jigsaw puzzle that is the evidence in this case and it is not the determinative piece. </span></p>

While F has spent a significant sum on the legal costs in this matter, he has not made a costs application against her and it is not for me to police what an individual spends on their case, what I do note is that both parties have had proper cases to put at all three of the disputed hearings and F has been successful in the majority of his representations and the findings he has sought.

When I have had to make determinations about location or frequency/duration of contact at interim hearings it has been a difficult balance between trying to protect P from the harm that is being caused by the current spending time arrangements with M and allowing her to have the most normalised relationship possible give P&#8217;s age and wishes and feelings. Regarding P&#8217;s birthday contact M did not mention that it was the contact supervisor who reduced the duration of the contact due to her own family commitments, instead seeking to place all of the blame of F. As a result of this last minute change of plans F was not able to be home when P arrived however returned shortly thereafter. It is a theme of M&#8217;s case that accusations are made against F but once evidence is considered there are other extenuating circumstances that are often beyond F&#8217;s control. </span></p>

Were P to be returned to M&#8217;s care the expectation would be that she would also implement those same rules with P.

None of the professionals have concerns regarding F&#8217;s boundaries for P or that he has been calling her inappropriate names, which F explained in the context of a discussion with P and M has no first-hand knowledge of. Teenagers are known to be untruthful at times and therefore it is important to recognise that what they say may be exaggeration or incorrect, P has acknowledged that she does this or that she can be &#8220;dramatic&#8221; in the moment but upon reflection what she is saying is not the truth either of what has occurred or how she feels ((v) and (iv) as I have taken them out of turn). Finally, F does not accept that he was filming P, instead he was pretending to, to calm her down and stop the situation escalating. While that is not the ideal parenting technique to deal with the situation both F and P are learning how to work with each other. By de-escalating the situation in the manner F did it effectively protected hm and safeguarded P, I would not encourage the continued use of this method but it is the reason therapy between F and P needs to continue.</span></p>

Getting a child to do something they do not want to or do not enjoy is a part of parenting. Although this has to be balanced with a recognition that P is growing older and at some stage there needs to be discussion about if she should continue, this discussion to involve P and her view to be taken into consideration. The same approach needs to be taken to clothes and make up, there are occasions where certain items or too much make-up is inappropriate and it is important that children are taught this by their parents, however as P grows this needs to be determined on a discussion basis, although that may already be the way in which F is parenting P and this will be assisted by the therapy. Finally, given P&#8217;s history and the situation at school where P locked herself in a classroom with a boy and another student, F is correct to be cautious about school trips, who is going and the level of supervision that will be required. </span></p>

Whether this is because she has overheard discussions between F and other adults or as a result of those conversations being had with P directly I cannot determine. F has also accepted that he should be more positive about M within the home and this is something that can and should be worked on. I do not consider that F sending a single email from the wrong address was anything other than an accident, it was not a full email (only containing the salutation at the beginning) and was not signed off from M. There is nothing, other than M&#8217;s interpretation, to suggest there was malicious intent. Finally, far from being concerned that F has misstated or exaggerated the case around sexual exploitation my much greater concern is that M does not see the dangers of this or the behaviours by P which are risk taking and could lead to further harm. M is so busy trying to denigrate F that she has entirely lost sight of the real and significant harm that P has suffered and continues to be at risk of suffering, with one element of this being child sexual exploitation.</span></p>

P continues to be on a CPP and is considered to be at risk of CSE. The experts&#8217; evidence is that the risk is as a result of the emotional harm from the animosity in the parental relationship, and that animosity is underpinned by M&#8217;s implacable hostility to F. P is particularly vulnerable due to her emotional immaturity, fragility and risk-taking behaviours which are a result of not feeling heard, being put at the centre of the parents conflict and having a spoilt and split image of F. There continues to be concerns about M&#8217;s permissive parenting and her parentification of P and sadly the transfer of residence has not been as successful as originally hoped due to M not undertaking the therapy required, not apologising to P and continuing to undermine F and the professionals to P. I previously made a finding that if something doesn&#8217;t materially change for P then the implications of continuing to be in her current state of emotional turmoil could be life long and affect her future relationships not just with her parents but with the wider world. While living with F has mitigated this to some extent the true work cannot take place while M continues to lack insight into the issues, her own behaviours, and places blame on all those around P. </span></p>

I have taken considerable time to listen to P including taking the unusual step of having a position statement prepared on her behalf despite her not being capable of being separately represented. I consider it is a mark of how much P does not want to be drawn into these proceedings that she did not respond to Ms Singleton&#8217;s email containing the positions statement and therefore it has not been formally approved. </span></p>

I accept that the wishes and feelings P states with the most regularity is that she would wish for a 50/50 arrangement. However, this ultimately seems to come from a place of wanting to remove the restrictions on her and her belief that M would do this. P does not seem to understand that a considerable portion of those restrictions are as a result of the CPP and would have to be enforced in either parent&#8217;s home, although I am not convinced M would be willing and able to enforce them. It is the professionals&#8217; view that P is not mature enough to understand the reasons for these restrictions and this is something I agree with. I have determined that P isn&#8217;t competent to instruct her own representation in this matter due to her lack of maturity and because she continues to be in the centre of her parents&#8217; conflict, meaning it is impossible to form her own view and opinion. What is exceptionally noteworthy is that while P says she wants to live with M or have a 50/50 division all other discussions she has with professionals about practicalities or approaches are around remaining with F, without actually acknowledging it. This shows how conflicted P regarding what she wants and what she considers she needs. </span></p>

P clearly requires therapy to support her in working through these issues. Boarding school would not remove P from any of these difficulties, she would still be aware of them and would continue to be exposed to them on weekends and during the school holidays.

By living with F it would reduce the elements that are causing P emotional harm especially if contact is managed in a way to allow P time to undertake her therapeutic work, and settle, into her new routine. It would allow an opportunity for F to continue his progress and for M to gain understanding and insight. This is the only approach which allows time and space for P to undertake therapy and change which will cease her inner turmoil. However, this approach is going to require time to embed and it has been shown that M uses every opportunity to reassert her narrative with P and draw P back into the conflict. </span></p>

In order for P to reach her full potential she requires positive attuned parenting from someone who is going to listen to her but not always agree with her. Who can acknowledge when they are wrong and apologise for their mistakes. At the moment F is the only parent that can provide P with this and he has been doing so for almost a year. At the current time F is the parent that is providing a safe, calm space for P away from the behaviour and influence of M. He is the parent that is providing the boundaries which the professionals state she requires. Without F, there would be no-one in her daily life who has insight into, and appreciates, the risks that she is at other than school. P would be unlikely to receive therapy which contains the narrative she requires and therefore her long term wellbeing will be compromised, and she would be likely to continue to participate in risky behaviours such as self-harm and continue to be sexually exploited which impact on her into adulthood. </span></p>

All of these concerns have been set out above. I have found that P requires a period of stability and certainty, especially as her GCSE exams are less than a year away, P needs to have the circumstances responsible for the inner turmoil she continues to experience to be mitigated as much as possible and to live in an environment where she is seen and heard but boundaries are put in place to support her and keep her safe. Therapeutic input is required but it must be the right therapy, which is informed by the findings of the court and which helps her make sense of her parents actions and the court decisions. This cannot be a generic therapist and needs to be someone with specialist training and knowledge of these proceedings.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Costs of contact &#8211; the leading case is cited above. Originally the costs of contact were ordered to be divided equally between the parents as I had made findings against both of them and I felt it was important that P see F supporting her time with M financially. It was my opinion that while the reunification plan was being implemented this was an important message to give P. However, this is no longer an interim situation and as such in my previous detailed email I reduced F&#8217;s contributions to a specific maximum amount. This was in part due to my understanding that the ISW was expensive and because matters have moved on such that M was requesting a high level of contact and I could not see why the costs of that should be passed on to F, even in part. As I have set out above I have to make a determination as to how contact between M and P should continue at this stage as I wish to hear submissions and consider the updated position. Therefore this is a determination in principle. If I were to order supervision of contact moving forwards the costs of this should be funded solely by M as the need for long term supervision of contact beyond a final order is due to her not undertaking the work required. I have made a number of significant findings against M for the purposes of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Griffiths</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> the important one is the continued implacable hostility towards F.

I note concerns about the impact on P however she has been provided with a narrative about the last judgment, my detailed email and will be provided with a further narrative about this judgment. Also given the conflict between the parents, it may be important when she is older for her to be able to access the impartial judgments as means of ascertaining the truth of what occurred and the findings made during the course of the hearings. As such I will publish this judgment and the previous judgment, suitably anonymised. </span></p>
