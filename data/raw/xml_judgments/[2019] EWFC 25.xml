It was password protected. The wife says the stick was in an envelope on the front of which the password was written. In May 2016 the wife&#8217;s German lawyers accessed the flash drive in her presence using the password provided by her. Those lawyers have provided a confirmatory statement.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;The question must, inevitably, depend on the facts of the particular case. Thus, if a husband leaves his bank statement lying around open in the matrimonial home, in the kitchen, living room or marital bedroom, it may well lose its confidential character as against his wife. The court may have to consider the nature of the relationship and the way the parties lived, and conducted their personal and business affairs. Thus, if the parties each had their own study, it would be less likely that the wife could copy the statement without infringing the husband's confidence if it had been left by him in his study rather than in the marital bedroom, and the wife's case would be weaker if the statement was kept in a drawer in his desk and weaker still if kept locked in his desk. But, as we have already said, confidentiality is not dependent upon locks and keys. Thus the wife might well be able to maintain, as against her husband, the confidentiality of her personal diary or journal, even though it was kept visible and unlocked on her dressing table.&#8221; </p>

	      </authorialNote>. The husband&#8217;s solicitors did not disclose the admissible and relevant documents on it at that time because the financial remedy case was stayed pending the outcome of his jurisdiction appeal. Even following the lifting of the stay the documents were not provided. Therefore, the wife made an application for specific disclosure of certain documents, or batches of documents, which she stated that she recalled (without having taken notes) as having seen when she accessed the flash drive. Such a recollection is admissible: see <span style="font-style:italic">Tchenguiz &amp; Ors v Imerman</span> at [169] and <span style="font-style:italic">UL v BK</span> at [56(v)]. The wife must have a remarkable memory because she was able in her witness statement in support of her application at paragraph 10 to detail 18 separate documents, or classes of documents, on the flash drive (&#8220;the paragraph 10 documents&#8221;). No one has, yet, explicitly suggested that the wife has been cheating and has kept notes of the documents on the flash drive, although Mr Oliver came very close to doing so. In his note for the hearing on 5 December 2018 he sarcastically referred to the wife&#8217;s &#8220;apparently near eidetic memory&#8221; and went on to say that &#8220;it stretches credulity beyond breaking point that W can recall at some considerable distance (in particular in relation to the memory stick information)&#8221;. He later referred to the wife&#8217;s &#8220;extraordinary and improbably unaided memory&#8221;. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I propose to order, in order to cut through the nonsensical position in which the court finds itself, that the disclosure of the paragraph 10 documents should be from the copy of the flash drive adventitiously retained by the wife&#8217;s German lawyers. I have no doubt that were I to go down the conventional route of ordering the disclosure from the flash drive in the possession of the husband&#8217;s solicitors that other spurious objections and obstacles would be raised. Therefore, it is appropriate that I should authorise the disclosure from the documents held by the wife&#8217;s German lawyers. This will give the husband the further assurance that he faces no risks, as he will not be making the actual disclosure. I will hear counsel as to when the disclosure should be made but I have in mind that it should be very soon. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In my judgment the husband fails on all limbs. He has not acted promptly. He has not demonstrated that there was a material change of circumstances since my order of 5 December 2018, or that the facts on which my decision was made had been misstated, or that I made a manifest mistake in formulating that order. Further, I am wholly satisfied that there was no good reason why the husband did not make his German law evidence available to the wife and to the court when I made the original order on 5 December 2018.  </p>

It seeks an order for delivery up of all the relevant documentation and for an order prohibiting the wife from using that material in any court proceedings including the financial remedy proceedings before me.  Those proceedings will take their course. However, I give the wife permission to disclose this judgment, the position statements, and the court bundle into those proceedings. </p>
