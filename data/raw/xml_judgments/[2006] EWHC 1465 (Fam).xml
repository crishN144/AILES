It relates to documents which were handed to one of his officers, DC Johnson, by a social worker H employed by the Applicant local authority, I, on 9 December 2005.  The Police ask about the use they can make of those documents.  They seek leave to use the documents if so required.</p>

By the final hearing on 19 May 2006 the apparent differences between the parties had been much reduced.  I have also been asked to give some guidance.  On this there has been broad agreement.</p>

Where material has come into existence in the course of proceedings to determine, whether in wardship or under the Children Act, how the welfare of a child will be best served, it is plain that consideration of the welfare of a child will be a major factor in the exercise of the discretion:  if disclosure will promote the welfare of the child, it will readily be ordered; if disclosure will not affect the welfare of the child, other considerations are likely to carry the day one way or the other; if disclosure will prejudice the welfare of the child, disclosure may nevertheless be ordered if there are potent arguments for disclosure, but the court will be much more reluctant to make the order.  It is plain that the public interest in the fair administration of justice, and the right of the criminal defendant to defend himself, are accepted as potent reasons for disclosure.  If, on the other hand, it could be shown that disclosure would for some reason be unfair or oppressive to a party to the wardship or Children Act proceedings, that would weigh against an order for disclosure.&#8221;</p>

But when balanced against the competing public interest which requires the court to protect society from the perpetration of crime it could only be in exceptional circumstances that interests of the individual ward should prevail.  In this case, although the results may be far-reaching and unpleasant for these young and damaged children, their interests are secondary to that greater public need.

They remain confidential, and subject to public interest immunity.  Disclosure of the information in those documents to the police as happened here remains permissible, indeed it is to be encouraged in appropriate cases.  As in the past that disclosure does not remove their confidentiality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The importance of information being available to agencies involved in child protection work has been emphasised repeatedly in the Court of Appeal as I have set out.  It is also in the Consultation and Response Paper published by the Government which led to the 2005 Rules.  That is now made clear by the express inclusion of the police in that role in the 2005 Rules.  It does not alter the existing position on exchange of information save to confirm the law as it has developed.</p>

But it has to be for the purpose of a criminal investigation.  I refer later to what I suggest is the reason for this.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What the 2005 Rules permit (taken with the authorities to which I have referred) is the communication of all the information within those documents to a child protection police officer whether they have been filed with the court or not.  It does not expressly permit the copying of documents on the court file.  In practice I consider this is properly permissible.  It would not make sense for a busy social worker to try and summarise verbally or in writing what might be a complex medical report for the police.</p>

Once the police have information from a local authority in the form of a document, they can use it for child protection purposes.  However it is confidential and the document (as compared to the information within it) cannot otherwise be used without the court&#8217;s express permission.  This applies both to documents not filed with the court e.g. social services records because they are confidential.  It also applies to documents filed with the court because only the court can authorise their use.</p>

There is mention of communication of a judgment in family proceedings to the police for the purpose of criminal investigation.  But this has I consider a separate reason for its conclusion.  With the help of that provision investigating officers are saved the time and expense of an application to the family court to learn for example what evidence was available at a family hearing and the findings of fact made by the court.

Because of the circumstances in which it came to be prepared by the father&#8217;s solicitor, the father has claimed legal privilege.
