The applicant had petitioned for divorce in this jurisdiction but her petition was not dismissed when the Italian process took precedence (instead being held in abeyance). The respondent&#8217;s Italian separation proceedings were followed by a divorce application. However, it was argued successfully that in this interim period between the two the only existing proceedings were for divorce in this jurisdiction with the result that this now took precedence. This dispute was resolved in favour of the applicant with the implication that matrimonial matters would now be heard in this jurisdiction. This decision was appealed [             ] and was determined in favour of the applicant [512]. I should say that even after this conclusion there was further litigation as to whether the conditional order of divorce should be made final or not. On 5 July 2023 [37] I made the order final at a contested hearing. There had been a suggestion the respondent was pursuing a further process of appeal to the European Court of Human Rights but this did not materialise. For the avoidance of doubt the Italian authorities have accepted the right of this jurisdiction to proceed exclusively in these matters.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">This change in jurisdiction did not prevent further and separate litigation in Italy. So in a manner similar to the schedule 1/TOLATA applications, the respondent raised discrete claims against the applicant as to the use to which jointly held funds had been put and as to the failure to complete a property transaction initiated pre-separation. This litigation was determined in favour of the respondent by the Italian Court with the net effect that the applicant is indebted to the respondent in the sum of about &#163;350,000 [313-360]. Separate to this the applicant has sought to enforce arrears of child maintenance owed under the Schedule 1 proceedings and Italian bank accounts have been frozen. Finally, the respondent has initiated / supported criminal proceedings against the applicant in Italy for alleged breach of the indirect contact order. I am told these have now ended in favour of the applicant. This Italian litigation could well have been incorporated within the litigation before me. This Court would have been placed to determine whether or not the funds utilised by the applicant should be subject to an addback in favour of the respondent. This Court could have sought to resolve the implications for the parties of the applicant&#8217;s failure or inability to complete a property transaction leading to financial loss. The Family Court was of course well placed to determine breach of its own child arrangements. </span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">I addressed these points ((ii) and (v) above) in the course of the hearing. I pointed out that this global litigation could be characterised as the deck of a ship with a line drawn down the middle and an equal number of chairs on each side of the line. Throughout the proceedings both parties had variously sought to redistribute the chairs onto their side of the line. In doing so a large number of the seats had been lost overboard and can no longer be recovered. The parties have engaged in this action notwithstanding they know there is a captain of the ship (me) who is ultimately obliged to come down onto the deck and redistribute the chairs in a fair manner wherever the chairs were found to be distributed at that point. The parties are both mature and intelligent individuals. This point cannot have been lost on them. That they could not see this much earlier has been to their substantial cost. I am told the Italian Judge has implored them to find a route out of this litigation and pointed to the fact that so much has been lost that would otherwise have been available for the child. I entirely agree with that sentiment and urge the parties similarly in respect of their future conduct. Sadly the past is now a fixture for the parties to reflect upon only.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">The central focus of any judgment under the MCA is a search for a fair outcome. Fairness will typically require consideration of the strands of sharing and needs. Less frequently reference may also be had to the strand of compensation. That is not alleged to be relevant in this case and I will not refer to it again. In considering these principles the Court is guided by the factors set out in section 25 of the MCA. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">The concept of sharing</span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt"> reflects the view that assets and resources accrued between the parties during the course of their relationship should be shared equally on the basis of equality of effort and contribution. It is therefore important for a Court to first identify and calculate the resource base available for distribution and to establish to what extent assets are a product of the relationship. This process is not typically challenging as in many relationships the assets available are entirely or significantly matrimonial in character. However even assets which did not accrue during the marriage may be deemed to be matrimonial either where they comprise an asset such as the matrimonial home (which is deemed to be central to the relationship) or where the asset has been treated during the marriage as something on which the parties jointly rely and has lost the sense of being a non-matrimonial asset. Thus assets brought into the relationship solely from one party may over time take on a matrimonial character. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt">The second strand is needs.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;font-size:11pt"> In the vast majority of cases this is the decisive factor. It reflects the individual parties needs whether as to capital or income. Built into this one also finds the needs associated with caring for children of the family whilst minors. This will be the Court&#8217;s first consideration. Needs will dominate sharing in circumstances in which needs can only be met by recourse to all the assets including those which are non-matrimonial. It will be no defence to a needs claim to contend a resource came from outside the matrimonial partnership. Needs will be assessed having regard to all the circumstances of the case, however, in any assessment the Court must keep in mind that it is providing a fair outcome for both parties and a crosscheck needs to be applied ultimately to ensure the outcome is fair.</span></p>

Examples of circumstances in which fairness impacts on an agreement may be where there is a requirement to meet the needs of children of the family or where subsequent and unforeseen events make it unfair to hold the parties to the terms of the agreement. In general terms it will be the strand of needs which provides a foundation for interfering with an otherwise valid agreement. There is authority which suggests departure from an agreement based on needs should be restricted to that necessary to meet needs alone. Viewed in this way one can identify three potential situations in which: (i) the agreement should be given full effect; (ii) unfairness or other vitiating factor causes the Court not to follow the terms of the agreement, and (iii) fairness demands the terms of the agreement be softened and identified needs met outside of the terms of the agreement.</span></p>

This comprised a property portfolio in Italy and liquid funds (c&#8364;1.85m). Following the receipt of the same the parties entered into a notarised agreement [154] under which existing property would be held as tenants in common but any future property including that inherited would remain the sole property of the party who had obtained it. It is agreed the liquid funds were subsequently paid into an account in joint names. The respondent contends this was done to protect the funds from groundless claims being made against the estate at that point in time. It is from these funds that the respondent claims monies were wrongly withdrawn by the applicant and this comprises &#8364;177,000 of the sums found against the applicant by the Italian court. It seems agreed there was about &#8364;1.5m left at the time of the separation and that the respondent withdrew the remaining sums on separation. It is also agreed that whilst the applicant was subsequently employed in this country, the respondent effectively acted as a manager for the property portfolio drawing his income from the sums received by renting out the said properties. The parties agree the sums received as income from the portfolio were used to support the family in the course of the marriage.</span></p>

As noted above there is a sum of close to &#163;350,000 owed by the applicant pursuant to the Italian litigation. If I found the applicant has a housing need of &#163;350,000 and by order provide the same, then this would be vulnerable to extinction via enforcement of the Italian debt. The question arose as to whether I should adjust for this and if so how? Fortunately this issue was readily compromised with the respondent sensibly agreeing that it would be wrong to seek to enforce the judgment given the implications it would have for his child&#8217;s housing. He agreed to a route forward under which this would not be enforced.</span></p>

For the applicant it was suggested the better route was to supplement any award by the sum owing, but make this only payable in the event the respondent does not co-operate to discharge the Italian debt. Should the respondent co-operate (as he said he would) then the sum would not be paid. If he did not then the debt would be cancelled by the cross payment. For his part the respondent suggested the appropriate route was to order no sum but for the parties to commit to the filing of a consent order in Italy discharging the debt. It was also agreed that as part of this the applicant would also have to withdraw her appeal. I am very grateful for the common sense shown by both parties in this regard. In my judgment the better approach is for me to order a lump sum equal to the Italian debt but which will not be payable (and will be self discharging) on the settlement and conclusion of the Italian proceedings on the basis of no liability either way. I judge this to be the better approach as it will leave this Court with jurisdiction with regard to enforcement of the supplementary sum in the event the parties fall into future dispute. This does still require the parties to actively co-operate in Italy but I consider it would be an inappropriate risk to pass all responsibility to that jurisdiction.</span></p>

On her case she has lived here now for more than 15 years and the child is settled here in school and socially. She has no plans to live in Italy and housing should be approached from that position. On what basis is this in dispute? The dispute arises because the respondent discovered the applicant had in fact been living in Italy in recent months and was employed within a school local to the area in which her parents continue to retain a property. He has reached the conclusion that the applicant is seeking a housing fund for expensive accommodation in London but will then move to Italy to pursue a career as a likely teacher.</span></p>

She accepts she has been working in Italy since about September 2022 when she obtained a support teaching post in the school identified by the respondent. She told me she will be continuing in employment there until June 2024 when she will have completed a teaching qualification which will enable her to return to this jurisdiction to work. She argued that this route was taken as it was  cost effective training in comparison to within the UK. Her parents have continued to care for the child whilst she effectively commutes to work in Italy - returning every fortnight weekend or so. The respondent doubts this account. He notes the applicant previously accepted becoming unemployed rather than taken a post in Kent given the disruption it would cause to her care for the child. He considers it is therefore odd to say the least that she would relocate to Italy leaving the child behind. He notes the job obtained is coincidentally very local to where the grandparents own property and sees this as a plan towards relocation full-time. He argues the applicant could have availed herself of training support within this jurisdiction were this her ultimate planned place of employment. Finally he points to the manner in which this was kept secret only being confirmed when he filed a late statement setting out the evidence for the same. The applicant stands by her case that this was a cost effective training route. She explained the circumstances in which re-employment in this country was difficult due to the research nature of her employment and her inability to find a required funding stream to support such a role. She therefore decided to make a career change which would provide a long term option. The location of her post indicates little about her future planning. Finally she kept this secret (although she would have revealed this at final hearing) due to her fears of being stalked by the respondent and points to historic spending which appears to show the respondent having hired a private investigator.</span></p>

I am somewhat doubtful she would have volunteered this at final hearing. However, I note that it was no part of her claim to seek maintenance from the respondent and as such the fact of her employment did not directly touch on an issue in dispute. I also have some sympathy for her argument as to why she did not want to disclose her account lest it be frozen. I make this observation having regard to a similar point made by the respondent as to how he has diverted monies from tenants to avoid the same outcome.I consider very little turns on the location of the school. In many ways it is hardly surprising the applicant would have sought a post local to the place at which she had free and available accommodation open to her. Further this is of course the area of Italy in which she grew up and it is therefore natural to seek a post in this area. I did not find the respondent&#8217;s evidence as to the detail of the posts undertaken as shedding very much light on this issue. On balance I accept the evidence of the applicant as to the financial benefits of training in Italy. It may be that alternatives are available in this jurisdiction but her account of her planning appeared logical and thought through. I accept she views this as a sensible launchpad to returning to teach in this country. On balance I find she has not modified her plans to live here in favour of Italy. In support of this I note that no changes have been made with respect to the schooling of the child and I also note the continued residence of her parents here. Together these are significant matters which would likely have been altered in favour of Italy were this the planning. Sadly, I also consider the nature of the adult relationship its such that the applicant has no wish to live proximate to the respondent in Italy. Finally, whilst I observed at the hearing that an untruthful account in this regard might later cause an order to be set aside (where the same had been based on London living) it is noteworthy that the range of costs of housing identified by the respondent are not significantly different between London and Italy.</span></p>

It is clear to me that the authorities plainly characterise this asset as matrimonial whatever the source of the funds used to purchase it. Unfortunately, the resultant funds have been all but spent on litigation on the account given by each party. What appears to be left is a sum of about &#163;100,000 held by the applicant&#8217;s mother (although said to reflect funds owing to the mother) and the balance &#163;160,000 which remains in Court Funds.

I understand the respondent to accept at least &#8364;1m was spent on legal fees. Whilst I have a supplementary bundle of bank statements (1830 pages) little time was spent on forensic examination of the same. I do have an analysis undertaken by the applicant in which she seeks to audit this spending. Of this the majority is agreed and identified as being legal costs. There is a residual sum of about &#8364;500,000 but on examination aspects of this could be seen to be explicable. Some of the expenditures relate to interbank transfers. I am not assisted by a detailed audit. The simple point is that about &#8364;500,000 has been spent since receipt in 2008 (excluding the legal fees). Viewed in a global sense this is less than &#8364;35,000 a year. Within this spending is undoubtedly further legal fees, school fees and other items which do not raise concern. One is likely left with a far from significant annual spending level. I have regard to the agreement between the parties as to &#8364;177,000 taken/spent by the applicant between around 2008 to 2016 (when &#8220;discovered&#8221;) as found within the Italian debt. When viewed in this way it does not strike me as particularly relevant that this sum has now been spent. I certainly did not receive an argument for a suggested add-back of these funds or any part of the same. The audit provided was largely general in nature and did not permit firm conclusions to be drawn contrary to the respondent. I recognise this spending has occurred and it is of course a matter of regret that these funds have not been preserved given the assistance they would provide the parties in offering a largely pain-free solution. But I accept they have been spent and I find no basis for penalising either party for the same by an addback.</span></p>

For my part I find it very difficult to conceive of circumstances in which this Court, approaching the spending through the prism of the MCA, would have penalised the applicant. I note that whilst this point was concluded against the applicant in the Italian proceedings she was not able to press her case for explaining the spending on the basis that her explanation appears to have come to late within those proceedings. It is not right to suggest, as I understood the respondent to suggest, that her explanation was rejected by the Italian Judge. Rather it was not entertained. Had I been asked to determine the point then I would have likely placed significant weight on the fact that the respondent failed to notice this spending for a number of years despite it coming from an account which he claimed to be effectively his own and despite the fact this amounted to close to 10% of the liquid inheritance. I found this account challenging.  The absence of curiosity on his part might be thought to support the applicant&#8217;s position. But I do not need to resolve the point given the concession as to the Italian litigation.</span></p>

As above it was from this that the applicant came to spend the sums noted above. Before me it was argued that this was telling evidence that these funds had been mingled or relied on in such a way to lose their status as non-matrimonial with the implication that they became joint funds. For the respondent it was said that this was only done due to there being in play some fraudulent claims which were seeking to set aside the inheritance. As a result he sought to protect the funds by placing them into joint names. He made a similar argument as to the funding of the FMH. I note within the Italian litigation the Court appears to have applied a strict legal rights approach in concluding these funds remained the absolute possession of the respondent alone. It is unclear what relevance this now has for me given these funds have in fact been completely exhausted. Whether or not they came to be reclassified they are now spent and no longer available for distribution in any event.</span></p>

One is a holiday property which the respondent claims to have recently sold for the sum of &#8364;43,000. The tracing of these funds is not possible as the respondent did not pay this through an account to avoid the funds being frozen (see above). The second is a property in which the parties lived when in Italy and which is now comprised in the property portfolio (valued at &#8364;137,500 - see [448]). The applicant contends the sharing principle applies to these assets as being matrimonial in character. The respondent disagrees but his reasons for doing so are somewhat obscure. One can see the matrimonial elements would thus total approximately &#8364;180,500 (&#8364;43,000 +  &#8364;137,500) [or &#163;157,000] plus the proceeds of the FMH [&#163;887,000] totalling &#163;1.044m.

It seemed to me he was claiming it might arise were he ordered to pay more than about &#163;200,000 (the maximum sum he claimed affordable). I struggled to understand the logic of this argument. It was not helped by the fact that evidence of such a risk (in the form of debts) was entirely absent from the evidence filed by the respondent. He had naturally outlined his debts within his Form E and had provided a section 25 statement. But neither provided the evidential foundation for this suggestion. When questioned it was difficult to understand what he meant by bankrupt. He was certainly not saying his debt came anywhere near the value of the property portfolio. I was left with the impression that he would be able to fund all his liabilities but that this would likely come with some &#8216;tough&#8217; choices and implications for income (which is a function of the portfolio).

In evidence she told me she had borrowed &#163;234,000. On receipt of the proceeds from the FMH (&#163;472,000) she had paid about &#163;280,000 of this into her mother&#8217;s account with the balance being used to settle debts. There was now only &#163;105,000 left and she remained indebted to her parents for about &#163;180,000. I was provided with a recent statement from this account showing the remaining balance. As such the applicant claimed to have no remaining proceeds form the FMH. The respondent challenged this account noting the complete absence of documentary evidence with relation to either the borrowing from the parents or the use to which the FMH funds were put. There is some weight in these criticisms but this must be tempered by the reality that the respondent has spent what he has on litigation and the applicant will have undoubtedly also spent a significant sum. She puts her own expenditure at around &#163;500,000. This appears reasonable on the basis of what I know. She has of course recovered some of this (or perhaps remains owed sum of this). Sadly, even without an account it is easy to see how the majority of the FMH proceeds may have come to be spent. Absent reliance on the same it is difficult to understand on what basis the applicant will have funded the costs. I am therefore satisfied in broad terms that the applicant has largely spent this money (as has the respondent with regard to his share).</span></p>

It is clear from my conclusion above that little turns on the fact of borrowing from the parents. It matters little whether the applicant borrowed X from her parents and then settled this or part of it from the proceeds of sale. In reality this is just a discussion as to whether the funds were spent directly or indirectly on costs. I am in no doubt they have come to be dissipated as claimed by the applicant save for the remaining &#163;105,000. I struggle to understand the evidential foundation that would have permitted the applicant to have both funded her costs and preserved the funds at the same time. This does not provide an answer to the status of the remaining funds. I have no evidential audit of borrowing nor documentary evidence to support the claim of an extant loan. In such circumstances I find it very difficult to reach a conclusion of an outstanding level of debt to her parents. I reach this conclusion in circumstances in the parents have plainly devoted the last 7 years to their daughter and grandchild; to the fact that the applicant is the only child of the parents, and; the absence of positive evidence for a loan.</span></p>

The applicant makes a case for a 3-bedroom terraced house which would cost around &#163;1m. Such a property would be situated in the Chiswick area of London. Her claim for 3-bedrooms is on the basis that her parents will visit on an occasional basis. Her evidence was that they would return to Italy once these matters are resolved and she has returned with a teaching qualification from Italy. I am satisfied a 3-bedroom property in Chiswick would cost in the region stated. The respondent put forward no alternative properties in that area. The respondent argues the applicant could be housed in accommodation similar to that in which she is currently housed on a rented basis. He was able to identify similar 2-bedroom flats within the complex in which the applicant lives for around &#163;450-500,000 and argued there was no need for a 3-bedroom property to provide occasional housing for the grandparents, As to location he disagreed there was a need to house other than in Brentford where the applicant and child are currently living, and have been living since separation about 7 years ago. Whilst the applicant pointed out the child was schooled in Chiswick the respondent noted this had been a choice made by the applicant when she was living in Brentford. In any event the distance between Brentford and Chiswick is short. The applicant opposed a flat due to the annual charges that would be levied on the same (service charges and to a degree ground rent). The applicant put forward no alternative properties in Brentford. I am satisfied a 2-bedroom flat can be obtained for around &#163;450,000 in that area. It can be seen I have no figures for alternative 2-bedroom properties (flat or otherwise) in Chiswick or for 3-bedroom properties (flat or otherwise) in Brentford. Plainly such properties do exist but the parties have chosen not to inform me in such regard. This is not an unusual state of affairs to face a Court but it means the parties have to accept the Court will have to form a view if it reaches a conclusion contrary to both cases given the search is for a fair outcome not a coin toss between the options identified by the parties. </span></p>

I accept the evidence that funds paid have settled debts linked to litigation lending. I accept the applicant will likely have some mortgage capacity on return to working in this jurisdiction. It seems a likely gross income for her might be close to &#163;30,000 at such point giving her a mortgage of no more than &#163;100,000. She has a working life to normal retirement of about 20 years. With child benefit and child maintenance her likely net income would approximate &#163;30-36,000. The respondent has worked in recent years managing the portfolio. He declares an income of about &#163;40,000 net from this. At first blush this appears a relatively modest return on a portfolio of close to &#163;2.5m being an annual return of about 1.6%. However the evidence suggested that the gross return is about twice this before tax. In any event there was little examination as to this point save to draw attention to the mismatch between the claimed global income and sums deposited over a period of time. The respondent explained this discrepancy on the basis that the sums received from tenants also included amounts relating to services (gas/electricity) which then have to be met by the respondent. I recall within the schedule 1 proceedings I identified an income of about &#8364;58,000 (based on conclusions drawn within the Italian litigation). Were this correct then this would produce a net income of about &#163;50,000 which is not very far from the declared income. I am conscious of the fact that this is overlaid by a different tax system on which I have little if any information. Within this in mind I find a likely income of between &#8364;42,000-50,000 per annum. </span></p>

It would also in my assessment be unfair not to have regard to the circumstances arising after the date of the agreement which now make it unfair to hold the parties exactingly to its terms. There is no question the parties consciously entered into a separation agreement under which the 2008 inherited resources would be sheltered from future claim.

This of itself does not cause the protected resources to lose their protection. A clear distinction has to be drawn between the process of mingling insofar as it acts upon non-matrimonial resources when compared to its impact on resources subject to a nuptial agreement of this sort. It will very often be the case that protected assets come to be utilised to support the family. Many of the leading cases on such agreements include such a feature under which an inherited resource has permitted the family a high level of luxury during their married life. However, support from such resources does not lose the resource the shield of the agreement. In my judgment this is different from when one considers non-matrimonial assets which have come to be relied upon. In that case the passage of time blurs the distinction between matrimonial and non-matrimonial character. This is not the same with those assets protected by an agreement. The agreement remains a clear and operative feature in place whilst the resources are utilised. In this case the assets are not only non-matrimonial but protected. I do not consider the passage of time has changed the principled application of the agreement.</span></p>

The points I make arise in the context of fairness as referenced in &#167;7 above. First, it must be recognised that at the time of the agreement the child was not born and thus any agreement must be read subject to this supervening event. Second, I consider it impossible to ignore the impact that the litigation has had on the parties and its relevance to this question. But for the litigation the parties would retain the benefit of the FMH. As I have made clear this was plainly matrimonial in character whatever the source of the funds used to purchase the same. It can be seen that but for the litigation this would provide a fund in excess of &#163;800,000 to assist in meeting the applicant&#8217;s housing needs without reference to the protected resources. Allowing for the Italian matrimonial property (&#167;26) one would be in the territory of &#163;1m available. In my assessment it would be unfair to lose sight of the fact that whilst the portfolio assets have been preserved the parties have essentially litigated at the expense of the matrimonial assets. The impact of this if left unmodified would be deeply unfair and would objectively fall outside of the contemplation of reasonable parties when settling the nuptial agreement. I consider the Court is required to make adjustments to balance the unfairness that would otherwise be occasioned by these circumstances.</span></p>

In the course of the hearing I was naturally taken to my earlier conclusions within the schedule 1 proceedings. A question arises as to why and if so the extent to which I should depart from the conclusions reached at that time? For the applicant attention is drawn to the differential assessment undertaken when considering the schedule 1 assessment as compared to any assessment under the MCA. In my judgment the distinction exists but is not so sharp in a case in which one is invading protected assets to meet needs under the MCA. There are points which  are equally relevant whichever approach is taken. I struggle for my part to see why the appropriate location and form of accommodation needed should be materially different under each provision. In my assessment the differences are likely to be found in the detail rather than the general.</span></p>

During the schedule 1 hearing it was the area identified as being appropriate by both parties. I can see no sound basis for now moving the need to Chiswick. The implication of doing so is to significantly impact on the housing need without real justification. In my assessment the location of the child&#8217;s schooling does not displace my assessment. This school has been selected whilst living in Brentford, its maintenance has been entirely possible from Brentford and the distance travelled is short.</span></p>

Again the applicant and child have now lived in a flat for 7 years. If anything the situation will be substantially improved as and when the wider family leave to return to Italy. At that point a flat will be plainly more bearable for all. But to suggest a house is needed due to the cost of a flat misses the point that a property such as the Victorian terraced houses favoured by the applicant would also have significant maintenance costs. In reality the solution I favour leaves the applicant free of mortgage and as such well placed to meet charges associated with such accommodation. In my assessment the applicant&#8217;s needs are for a 2-bedroom property in Brentford. I do not consider it can be appropriate to invade protected resources to enable a larger property for the key purpose of housing family members on occasional visits.</span></p>

This reflects the somewhat different nature of this assessment and adds a slightly more generous approach when compared to my earlier conclusions. I also note the respondent&#8217;s position demonstrates some house price inflation over the period in question. I have reached the viewed that a property closer to that advocated for by the applicant in the schedule 1 proceedings would fairly meet her needs. This would still be a 2-bedroom property but it would be somewhat more spacious and comfortable to reflect all the circumstances of the case. Although neither party has touched this territory I consider myself to be assisted by the earlier details particularly having regard to the balance between the respondent&#8217;s property details both then and now. I have reached the conclusion that a fair housing budget would be &#163;650,000 to which should be added &#163;50,000 to cover the costs of purchase and furnishings. I do not find a basis for a contingency fund. I therefore find a budget of &#163;700,000 is appropriate. I appreciate there will be charges associated with the same.

I consider an appropriate interest rate at this time is 4% on a simple basis. This will not run until the 6 month point but will then accrue at a daily rate of &#163;47.67 (based on &#163;435,000). I will make this order on a clean break basis. I do not consider it appropriate to maintain a spousal award equivalent to the interest sum pending payment.

On a straight line basis I infer the reduction in income to the respondent will be such as to reduce his income to no less than &#163;36,000 (85.5% of &#163;42,000). I consider this will preserve an income stream sufficient for both parties.</span></p>
