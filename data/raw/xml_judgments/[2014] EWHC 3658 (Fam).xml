The judgment was given on 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2013, and was clarified on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2014.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The first is that, in her distribution of capital, the District Judge erred in not properly reflecting the non-matrimonial origin of part of the divisible pool.  The second is that the District Judge&#8217;s decision in relation to spousal maintenance was erroneous, specifically inasmuch as it provides for step down as and when the two children of the family complete university education.  The third ground is that the District Judge erred in not providing for the spousal maintenance to be index linked.  Mr. Justice Bodey has ordered that the question of permission to appeal should be heard today, with appeal to follow, if granted, with a time estimate of one day.</span></p>

Under the rule in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Ladd v. Marshall</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, evidence or events subsequent to judgment are more readily admissible than evidence that relates to events that occurred prior to judgment, for reasons that are too obvious to spell out.  The significance of those events, I will deal with later when I give my decision on the question of whether leave to appeal should be granted; if so, whether the appeal should be allowed; and, if so, what orders should be made in consequence thereof.  </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">I say immediately that I am not satisfied that the third ground of appeal is arguable.  It was not even raised before the District Judge at trial.  She determined that the spousal maintenance should not be index linked, and that was, in my view, a decision that was squarely within her remit of her discretion, and I do not regard the third ground as arguable.  Permission is, therefore, refused in relation to that ground.  </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So I turn to the first two grounds.  The relevant facts referable to the first ground are these.  Towards the very end of the marriage, the wife received from her mother &#163;465,000.  In fact, she received a little more than that, but some was diverted directly to the children of the family.  That &#163;465,000 which she had obtained from her mother derived from the estate of her late father.  The funds were received in two tranches; &#163;100,000 in 2009, and &#163;365,000 in September 2010, a mere ten months before the end of the marriage, and at a time, as is recorded in the judgment, when the wife believed that the husband was forming a relationship with another lady.  </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The way in which the District Judge dealt with that is set out in some detail in her judgment.  Before I turn to that, it is perhaps helpful if I were to set out, in short form, the relevant law in relation to the treatment of property that derives from a source other than the joint endeavours of the parties.  </span></p>

Obviously, any income that was earned on those savings was at a lower rate of tax than if he had them in his name.  He used to worry that if anything happened to me, if I died suddenly, he would have to go through probate in order to get hold of his own money, as it were.  So the reason I transferred some of that money into his name was because most of our joint assets at the time, liquid assets, were in an NS&amp;I bond which I could not touch.  You know, it had to be locked in for a certain amount of time to earn that interest&#8221;.</span></p>

This was the explanation for that transfer.  She was tested in this account in cross-examination.  At p.118, she said this:  &#8220;I think it was put in places where it would earn those amounts of interest for &#8230; the family&#8221;.  Then she was asked this question:</span></p>

I do not think we are disputing that I would try to make the best possible rate of interest on any resources that came into the family home.

The placement of monies in his name or her name, at least on a plain reading of the words, seems to have nothing to do with any underlying decisions by the parties as to whether such and such a fund should be characterised as matrimonial, with a concomitant consequence of  equal division on divorce or not.</span></p>

Historically, surplus savings were put in the wife&#8217;s name although earned and deriving from the husband, because she was a lower tax payer.  In 2009-2010 the husband had bought shares in the company which employed him and bought a car, and therefore a joint decision was made to put &#163;190,000 of the wife&#8217;s mother&#8217;s gift in the husband&#8217;s accounts to build them up.  Others of the money were invested.  No representation was made by the wife at that time that this was her money to the exclusion of the husband, or that it should be ring fenced as hers.  The wife, fairly and frankly, accepted in oral evidence that she, &#8220;put the money where it would earn the best interest for the family&#8221;, and she said to me, &#8220;In a way it might have been pooled&#8221;.</span></p>

I have come to the conclusion, after careful consideration, that the wife regarded the money from her mother, much of it the proceeds from her late father&#8217;s business, so in a real sense not personal or sentimental, as a windfall available to her to use as she chose.  This money was not invested separately or ring fenced as was open for the wife to do, but applied in a way consistent with the couple&#8217;s long term established ethos in relation to prudent savings - all surplus money from whatever source applied and set to work in the best way to benefit the family.</span></p>

The wife brought into the relationship monies from her uncle, her mother and her late father, so she too made a significant financial contribution.  The wife looked after the home and the children enabling the husband to work, and she is therefore a fully entitled wife.  The children are now young adults, but each party will continue to support them financially and emotionally as necessary.  The wife is in need of financial support as she has been a housewife and home maker, and she is entitled to look to the husband to achieve this while doing what she can to earn for herself&#8221;.</span></p>

The company has been taken over by some venture capitalists.  His shares have been purchased, and have achieved a price of &#163;1.1 million gross on which income tax has been payable, leaving him with a net receipt from that source of &#163;580,000.
