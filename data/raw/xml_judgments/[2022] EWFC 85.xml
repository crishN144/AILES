I have elected to prepare a written judgment, rather than deliver it orally, to ensure that the parents and also any professionals who will now report to the court or assist the parents with the arrangements for their children within these proceedings can have swift and comprehensive access to the court&#8217;s decisions and the reasons for those decisions. </p>

Ms Morjaria represented the father and Ms Wood the mother.  I heard oral evidence from both parents.  A social worker from Local Authority B, &#8216;Social Worker B&#8217;, also attended the court building to give her evidence.  Two witnesses attended remotely by CVP link:  Mr C (a friend of the mother) and &#8216;Social Worker A&#8217; (a social worker with the Local Authority A).  By agreement, I read a witness statement from Mr D, a religious minister, and neither parent sought to call him to court to answer questions. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.01in">This finding of fact hearing has been for the court to hear evidence and decide whether allegations made by the mother against the father have been proved.  These decisions then underpin and inform the court&#8217;s decision-making going forwards when conducting the welfare analysis about the best interests of the children, which will be the next step in our journey.  The court makes &#8216;binary&#8217; decisions at this fact-finding stage.  Either a fact is found to be proved or it is found not to be proved on the evidence put before the court.  If it is proved, the fact will inform the welfare decision-making stage and if it is not proved, the allegation will be disregarded. It is for the party making an allegation to prove that allegation on the evidence properly placed before the court.  The judge in this English jurisdiction does not act as an investigator contacting witnesses or making enquiries herself.  The main purpose of this fact-finding process is to provide a basis for the assessment of risk.  The court&#8217;s consideration should be limited to those issues which are relevant to an assessment of risk and the children&#8217;s welfare.  It is neither possible nor desirable for the court process to be used as an exercise in vindicating or condemning one or other parent for their conduct in a relationship or for apportioning blame at the end of a relationship.  The focus must be on providing a basis for the accurate assessment of risk for the children&#8217;s future relationships with their parents. </p>

The Cafcass letter dated 14 February 2020 recommended a <span style="font-style:italic">Local Authority</span> section 7 report, informed by the previous social work assessment, which had included an investigation of the allegations of sexual abuse.  The magistrates ordered indirect contact and a <span style="font-style:italic">Cafcass</span> section 7 report (pp86-90).

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.01in">On 14 July 2020 the case was heard by a Recorder.  Indirect contact was increased to include video messages from the father to the children and their face-to-face contact with the paternal grandparents, and specific directions were given to prepare for a 4-day fact-finding hearing on the &#8216;first available date after 28 September 2020&#8217;.  It is sobering to record that this hearing started exactly 18 months after that date, 20 months after the directions were given and 2 &#188; years after the father made his application.  A hearing listed in May 2021 was vacated due to a lack of any judge to hear the case.  The delay in the listing of this hearing has been egregious.  The long wait for court time must have caused both of these parents considerable added stress.  The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> reminds the court that &#8216;any delay in determining [the case] is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child&#8217;.  I can only acknowledge the delay and the impact of this on the family and express my personal regret that they have had to wait so long. </p>

On 10 August 2019 the mother recorded Yasmin making an allegation of inappropriate sexual touching by her father. The police and Local Authority A became involved.

Individuals do not need the consent of professionals to record a meeting, as the information is personal to them and exempt from the data protection principles under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2018/12" uk:canonical="2018 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Data Protection Act 2018</ref>.  Recording the social worker&#8217;s meeting was not illegal.  It is, however, generally good practice and good manners to inform all those involved in a meeting if it to be recorded.  The court has the power to control the evidence placed before it under FPR 22.1 and the test is one of relevance.  The recordings made by the mother were clearly relevant to the issues in the case, and the father through his counsel made no challenge to the admissibility of the recordings.  Transcripts prepared by the mother were, helpfully, very largely agreed between counsel and put before the court without opposition.  It is then for the court to consider the weight to be given to the recordings and the light they shed on the issues in the case. </p>

This is the central allegation in the case, of magnetic importance to the analysis of risk.  It is the issue that caused the collapse of the cooperative model of parenting between these parents in the early days of their separation and it is the catalyst that caused the mother to leave the family home with the children to live in a refuge.  It is, and has always been, strongly denied by the father. </p>

Both parents agree that on 10 August 2019, a Saturday, the father had spent the day at the family home, although he no longer lived there, interacting with the children.  The mother, although in the house, had kept largely out of the father&#8217;s way.  In the late afternoon, whilst Xavier slept on the sofa, Yasmin, then aged 3 &#189;, and her father were together in the living room, playing.   The mother had been in another room at the back of the house and then went upstairs to take a phone call.  The father called up the stairs to say he was leaving, somewhat earlier than anticipated.  He had arranged to meet a friend that evening and in fact met them an hour or so earlier than originally planned.  It is common ground that the father had not bathed or showered Yasmin and that she needed only limited help with her toileting and the only toilet in the house was upstairs.  There is no suggestion that Yasmin and her father had been playing rough, physical games.  Her father spoke of playing with some Lego.   </p>

The mother then used her phone to record a 3-minute conversation between herself and Yasmin, in which Yasmin answered the question &#8220;why did you say your foof is red?&#8221; with &#8220;Daddy touched it&#8221;, going on to say, in answer to further questions from the mother &#8220;with his hand&#8221; and &#8220;too hard&#8221;, &#8220;so strong&#8221;.

I accept the mother&#8217;s consistent account, which is supported by information in the police and Local Authority disclosure, that the delay was not of her making.  On Sunday 11 August the police and EDT staff advised her that a medical would be intrusive and that a GP examination would be preferable.  An appointment was arranged, but the GP was unwilling to do the examination given the context of possible abuse and referred the matter to the local hospital, who declined the referral due to a lack of child protection expertise.  The examination was eventually done by doctors at a city hospital on 15 August, after the mother had contacted social services on 13 August 2019 to progress the arrangements.  I have not seen the notes from the examination itself, but it is referred to in the Local Authority A documents at p 210 and in the Local Authority B assessment at p 282 (para 22).  It is common ground that no injuries or marks or redness were recorded in Yasmin&#8217;s genital area.  There was no evidence found of any sexual abuse.  However, the medical examination could not, of course, rule out the possibility that touching had taken place.  The mother insisted that Xavier, then aged 5, should also be intimately examined, although he had made no disclosures save to say he had a sore bottom. </p>

The outcome of the assessment was a recommendation for Xavier and Yasmin to remain open to the Local Authority on Child in Need plans.

Moreover, Yasmin does not continuously display sexualised behaviour which could be indicative of sexual abuse&#8230; [the mother] is persistent in wanting answers but this may never be achieved given Yasmin&#8217;s age; I feel it is imperative for the children&#8217;s emotional well-being that&#8230;she makes attempts to promote safe contact between the children and [their father]&#8217; (p223).

I do not know the exact date the mother left the area, but Cafcass records show she was living in the new area by the time of the safeguarding interview on 27 January 2020 (p317), which puts the move soon after the Local Authority A assessment concluded with a recommendation for a Child in Need plan. At p244 a date of December 2019 is mentioned for the move, in a social services&#8217; document.  In this recording, Yasmin states &#8220;when Xavier was sleeping and you were upstairs daddy just took my pants off and he tickled it fast and then when you came down&#8221;.

I do not place any weight on these 2 potential factors.  Role play in the context of a consenting adult sexual relationship does not, in my judgement, shed much light on a propensity to engage in actual abuse of preschool children.  In any event the father does not accept the detail of the mother&#8217;s assertion, claiming instead that the role pay focussed on a student/professor type relationship, and I will never be able to resolve that factual conflict.  The father explained why he left the house earlier than planned on 10 August 2019.  He described it as a day of considerable tension.  There is support for this account in the police disclosure, which shows that the mother had gone to the police in order for her complaints against the father to be logged only 2 days before.  Leaving the house early because of the atmosphere and stress is very plausible in the circumstances.  For the avoidance of doubt, I place no weight at all on the father being bisexual (this point having been raised by the mother with police on 8 August 2019 - p355 - but I take judicial notice that there is no correlation at all between bisexuality and paedophilia). </p>

Their concepts of time and of their own bodies are not the same as adult conceptions.  Children are suggestible, they can be imaginative and they pick up language from those around them.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in;margin-right:0.01in">I have recorded at paragraph 52(v) that no social work or teaching professionals are concerned about sexualised behaviour from Yasmin (or Xavier).  I phrased this carefully, as there are mentions of sexualised behaviour in the papers. The mother raised concerns with Social Worker A, which were specifically considered with the health visitor, and the social worker was satisfied, having considered NSPCC guidance, that the behaviour was normal behaviour typical of Yasmin&#8217;s age and stage (pp214-215). Refuge staff reported to Social Worker B concerns that Yasmin had been kissing another child and some concerns about Xavier&#8217;s behaviour, but no concerns had been noted by the nursery or school (as confirmed in the ICPC minutes) and again the information was viewed as being within a range of normal behaviour and not indicative of abuse.  The mother has raised the &#8216;pavement&#8217; comments and her counsel, Ms Wood, suggested to Social Worker B that this concept could have been suggested to Yasmin by an abuser, as it is outside the range of concepts expected from a 3-year-old, but this is speculation.  I come back to the point that no teaching or social work professional has raised concerns that these children have displayed sexualised behaviour.  It is also, in my judgement, speculation to read much into Yasmin&#8217;s choice of the word &#8216;wash&#8217; in referring to her mummy touching her private parts at p276, and the word &#8216;touch&#8217; when she refers to her daddy.  In both instances Yasmin recorded it as &#8216;good touch&#8217;, as she worked through the exercises on types of touch. </p>

I can quite understand why this omission has caused the mother such concern.  However, it remains the case that Social Worker B had properly planned a piece of direct work with Yasmin to find out about &#8216;bad touch&#8217; in a way that would guard against a rehearsed answer from a child.  When specifically asked about &#8216;bad touch&#8217;, having worked through the booklet, Yasmin did not make any disclosure.  The same is true of Social Worker A&#8217;s direct work with Yasmin.  In my judgement this is important.  It is also important, in my judgement, that Yasmin made no disclosures to the police officers.  All those trained in questioning children about abuse have received no allegations from Yasmin <span style="font-style:italic">as part of their structured work</span>. </p>

It is important that I look at all the evidence to reach my own conclusion.

The recordings are not the result of a transparent and professional process.  The weight of the evidence, in my judgement, falls against making the finding the mother seeks.  Yasmin was only 3.  She has not displayed sexualised behaviour that concerns those professionals who interact with her most often, in her educational settings.  She has not made allegations in response to detailed police and social work processes on 4 different occasions. The social work evidence as a whole shows children who report a warm and loving relationship with their father with appropriate physical affection. </p>

These concerns were at least part of the reasons that the children were placed on a Child in Need plan initially and a Child Protection Plan in the second Local Authority area.  Social Worker B accepted in her oral evidence that her categorisation of the mother&#8217;s parenting as potentially &#8216;toxic&#8217; in her written report was probably overly harsh, and I concur with that assessment.  The children have not been heard to speak anything other than positively about their father and they show none of the traits commonly exhibited by children who have been manipulated or alienated (such as having nothing positive to say about and no happy memories of the &#8216;absent&#8217; parent).  I cannot know whether Yasmin&#8217;s comment to Social Worker B during the recorded direct work was &#8216;rehearsed&#8217; or not.  Social Worker B herself has muddied the waters on that, suggesting in her evidence two alternative and broadly incompatible scenarios: that her use of the word &#8216;tickle&#8217; had been deliberate to prompt Yasmin subtly at that intermediate point of the process and also that she was careful to go through the booklet methodically to guard against any rehearsed statements before asking about Yasmin&#8217;s experience at the end of the exercise. </p>

The first Local Authority investigation was prompted by the NSPCC after the mother had been recommended to call them by Childline.  In her oral evidence before this court the mother presented as genuinely concerned for her children and anxious to listen to her daughter&#8217;s voice.  Social Worker B did miss a comment by Yasmin and now accepts that her assessment of the mother was harsh.  The mother has not been entirely fairly treated by the second Local Authority, who did not in fact arrange the meeting with her as required in the ICPC minutes.  I repeat that these children have not been taught to speak negatively of their father, but speak warmly of him and miss him, and that is an important point. </p>

It is not, of course, either parents&#8217; fault that this fact-finding court process has taken such a long time.  It was the conclusion of the ICPC that clarity and progression would only be achieved once the court had considered the evidence and made (or declined to make) findings, and the court itself has considered that a fact-finding hearing is necessary to form the basis for an assessment of risk. </p>

In my judgement there is no evidential link shown between Xavier&#8217;s behaviour at school in lacking empathy and this one occasion of exposure to an unsuitable game.  Whilst Xavier himself reports his father as being more permissive in allowing him to play video games (describing this positively at p246), there is no evidence that could possibly support a conclusion that the father&#8217;s approach to Xavier&#8217;s gaming could amount to &#8216;mental abuse&#8217;. </p>

She says the stress of all of this is what prompted her to go to the police on 8 August 2019. The mother also asserts that she was the victim of financial control (para 4-7 p151-2), with the motivation being to manipulate and undermine her. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.01in">In its judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-N</span>, the Court of Appeal said, at paragraph 32: &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">It is equally important to be clear that not all directive, assertive, stubborn or selfish behaviour, will be &#8216;abuse&#8217; in the context of proceedings concerning the welfare of a child; much will turn on the intention of the perpetrator of the alleged abuse and on the harmful impact of the behaviour. We would endorse the approach taken by Peter Jackson LJ in Re L (Relocation: Second Appeal) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/2121" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 2121" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 2121</ref> (paragraph 61): &#8220;Few relationships lack instances of bad behaviour on the part of one or both parties at some time and it is a rare family case that does not contain complaints by one party against the other, and often complaints are made by both. Yet not all such behaviour will amount to &#8216;domestic abuse&#8217;, where &#8216;coercive behaviour&#8217; is defined as behaviour that is &#8216;used to harm, punish, or frighten the victim&#8230;&#8217; and &#8216;controlling behaviour&#8217; as behaviour &#8216;designed to make a person subordinate&#8230;&#8217; In cases where the alleged behaviour does not have this character it is likely to be unnecessary and disproportionate for detailed findings of fact to be made about the complaints; indeed, in such cases it will not be in the interests of the child or of justice for the court to allow itself to become another battleground for adult conflict&#8217;. </span></p>

It is common ground that the family were short of money and the father had significant debts which he was attempting to repay - the mother mentions this to the police on 8 August 2019 (p 334).  The father was the breadwinner and the mother&#8217;s income was limited to <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span> payments, for example for babysitting.  The father seems to have paid the family&#8217;s bills using a combination of his income and the tax credits, and the mother was left with her limited earnings and the child benefit to pay her phone bills and anything else she wanted to buy.   </p>

The mother did not have access to much money, but money was obviously very tight and needed for housing costs, utility bills and essentials for the family.  I do not find that the father kept the mother short of money to harm or punish her or to make her subordinate. The Valentine&#8217;s card, distress and arguments were obviously upsetting, but do not in my judgement have the character of coercive and/or controlling abuse.  It is unnecessary and disproportionate for the court to engage in further enquiry as to these allegations: it would not be relevant to decision-making for the children going forwards. </p>

The mother&#8217;s extra-marital liaison in London in 2018 was also an act/s between consenting adults.  The father was not in London and was not involved in commissioning or arranging the affair. Messages exchanged between the parties in June 2018 and exhibited to the mother&#8217;s statement show the father apparently encouraging her to liaise with other men (p 174, 179 and p181).  The messages at pp 184-187, also sent in June 2018 appear to show that the parents were not in fact &#8216;on the same page&#8217; about what was going on. </p>

The father accepts that he went to the beach but did not reveal his presence, instead taking some photos using a zoom (pp197-198) and then sending a message to Mr C a few days later: &#8220;did you have a nice time at the beach with my wife and kids?&#8221; (p200).  The father said he had been feeling unwell at home after an operation, but had then felt better and had decided to surprise his family by joining them at the beach.  He was disconcerted to find Mr C with them, as he believed his wife to harbour romantic feelings for Mr C (who is mentioned in text messages between them in the context of the mother dressing sexily, for example pp174 and 176). </p>

I also accept the father&#8217;s evidence that he went to the beach to surprise his family but was instead surprised to see Mr C with his family.  The father&#8217;s message to Mr C may be regarded as &#8216;passive-aggressive&#8217; but the father took no action to follow this up with any further communication.  The taking of 3 photos before going home and the sending of one message, after one unexpected event does not, in my judgement amount to abusive stalking behaviour.  The court has not been told of any other incidents where the father has followed the mother or taken pictures of her without her knowledge. </p>
