She also sought enforcement orders against a company called Halesowen Estates Ltd by way of the imposition of a fine, the sequestration of assets or such other sanction as the court considers just. Mrs Hart alleges that Mr Hart has acted in breach of an undertaking which is recorded in the substantive financial remedy order and which was necessary to render effective the transfer of shares in a company to Mrs Hart; she also alleges that the Respondents have each acted in breach of subsequent enforcement orders that were made on 24</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> February 2016 and 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 2016. The undertaking and each relevant order bore appropriate penal notices and was served on the Respondents. For reasons that I will explain, this judgment relates only to the allegations of contempt against Mr Hart; I have had to adjourn the issues relating to Mrs Byrne and Halesowen Estates Ltd. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">After a procedure lasting 3&#189; years the substantive financial issues arising from the divorce were listed before me for resolution in May 2015, leading to a final order being made by me on 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> June 2015. Significant delay and expense were caused in the interlocutory stages of the proceedings by Mr Hart&#8217;s failure to give adequate information or comply with court orders. At the substantive hearing before me his evidence was manifestly unsatisfactory, his disclosure was shown to be profoundly inadequate and I rejected many of his contentions. He is an exceptionally poor and untruthful witness. Mrs Hart is at the opposite end of the spectrum of veracity. She is reliable and truthful; she has also been exceptionally patient with Mr Hart in these proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Both parties sought permission to appeal against my substantive decision of June 2015 and, on 26 February 2016, Kitchin LJ granted Mrs Hart permission to appeal but refused the application for permission by Mr Hart. On 24 May 2016 the President further rejected the application for permission by Mr Hart at an oral hearing. The appeal by Mrs Hart was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">st</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> August 2017.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">These committal proceedings relate to the order that I made transferring to Mrs Hart the shares of Mr Hart in a company called Drakestown Properties Ltd (see paragraph 13 of the substantive order of 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> June 2015 at C4) and the undertaking that Mr Hart gave in order to render that transfer of shares effective. As this judgment will show I am sure that Mr Hart has done his utmost to prejudice Mrs Hart and to put her under pressure by failing to comply with his undertaking and with the subsequent enforcement orders that I have made. Further, he has simply not engaged properly in these extremely serious committal proceedings or complied with orders made on the adjournment of them.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Every effort has been made by Mrs Hart, her legal team and by me to avoid this case reaching this crisis point. There have been a number of hearings within these committal proceedings (which I will describe later) and, on each occasion, it has been obvious that Mr Hart has not produced information that he should have produced in compliance with the undertaking that he gave and, later, the orders that I have made. On each occasion that the case has returned before me orders have been made with the intention of ensuring that Mr Hart&#8217;s default is remedied. That has all been to no avail. Nobody wishes to see an 83-year-old man (or a 65-year-old woman, Mrs Byrne) facing a committal application. However, despite frequent court hearings, orders and the clearest possible warnings (e.g. see the transcript of 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">th</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> March 2017, p90) Mr Hart has not done what he was ordered to do or what he undertook to do. Enough is now enough. As I will explain he is now in very serious and sustained contempt of court.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">The delay in the provision of information has caused obvious prejudice and expense to Mrs Hart. The most clamant example of prejudice is that she was unable to submit accounts for Drakestown Properties Ltd for the year ending 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">st</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> December 2015 until further information had been produced as a result of the hearing in March 2017 and faced intervention by HMRC. The accounts that she has filed for both 2014 and 2015 have had to bear a caveat due to the lack of information that she has had. But she has also been unable to deal with demands for rates and subsidence issues; she has also been left without any proper financial records of the company. Even the company computers were removed and computer records have never been provided. </span></p>

To tie down what has and what has not been disclosed by Mr Hart is a massive exercise and it is necessary to blow aside any number of smoke screens that Mr Hart has erected. I now know this case extremely well together with the personalities involved, having spent many days hearing the original application and, later, the many enforcement hearings. The end result, in my opinion, can be stated very simply:</span></p>

The transfer should not have been complex and, as counsel who appeared on Mr Hart&#8217;s behalf in March 2017 (Mr Trevis) himself said, it is not a difficult company to run. Mrs Hart should have had no difficulty running the company with the assistance of the management agents that she sensibly appointed as long as she had the information necessary for her to do so. However, to run a company that lets out units it is obvious that it is necessary to have the company computers, leases (both old and new), the licences (both old and new), the accounting records, the banking records, the tax records, the details of the liabilities and commitments of the company and details of those who owe the company money. Mr Hart has chosen not to give these to Mrs Hart. There has been a long running battle about the production of old licences and leases. On 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">nd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> February 2018, in his evidence, Mr Hart stated that the licences that were granted were of one year&#8217;s duration (save for the seven long leases). It simply defies logic or reality that previous licences would not be retained. As I put to him myself when he gave evidence, if a new licence were to be granted today it would make no sense to rip up the licence that expired yesterday. Mr Armstrong submitted in closing that it was perfectly understandable that a small company like this would not retain historic licences and leases. I reject that submission &#8211; the primary trading of this company was in the rental of units and so it would have been ridiculous for the company to have disposed of old licences and leases immediately upon expiry. I have no doubt at all that there were copies of old licences that could and should have been disclosed and that Mr Hart and Mrs Byrne had the power to effect that disclosure.</span></p>

However, when Mrs Byrne gave evidence at that hearing she was unable to explain any aspect of the accounts and knew very little about the company. I had and have no difficulty in accepting Mrs Hart&#8217;s evidence that it was Mr Hart who controls that company also and the records that it kept. That view is reinforced by the explanation that Mr Hart gave at the hearing in March 2017 about how Drakestown&#8217;s income was applied &#8211; Halesowen Ltd collected the rents, paid them to the trust company, Dudley Estates Ltd (which he controls) which then re-applied some of the income to Drakestown (see response xv in Mr Hart&#8217;s statement of 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">nd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> March 2017).</span></p>

He and his colleague have both produced evidence to state that &#8216;the statutory accounts are prepared from incomplete records&#8217; (see Mr Parkar&#8217;s statement of 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">nd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> March 2017, his oral evidence and the letter from Mr Kalinsky dated 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">rd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> March 2017).  The fact that accounts were prepared in the past on the basis of incomplete records does not mean that Mrs Hart should be required to continue that practice, particularly as someone who is taking over the business and starting afresh. The intention of the undertaking was to put her in a position in which she could conduct the efficient and effective management of the business &#8211; that includes preparing proper accounts based on complete records. She should have been put in a position whereby she could submit audited accounts to the Revenue.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr Parkar said that fully audited accounts were prepared for Drakestown for the year to 31.12.2010 and he accepted that, for those to be prepared, full documentary evidence must have been supplied to the accountants (e.g. invoices, receipts, etc). Thus, evidence to support audited accounts was kept up to 2010 and I have no doubt that it continued to be kept.  Mr Parkar said that, after that date, the accounts for Drakestown had been prepared on the strength of bank statements and VAT returns only (the incomplete records to which I have referred). However, he agreed with me that, if he had been acting for someone who bought this company part way through the accounting year (i.e. someone who was in the equivalent position of Mrs Hart) it would have been negligent to prepare accounts based on bank statements and VAT returns submitted by the previous owner only. Further, even if the previous owner, Mr Hart, did choose to submit accounts based on incomplete information, there is no reason why the new owner, Mrs Hart, should be forced to continue that practice especially where she had the benefit of the undertaking and orders of February and July 2016.</span></p>

It would be negligent, I agree, for an accountant to prepare accounts of the company now based only on VAT returns and bank statements relating to the time when Mr Hart ran the company, particularly given the very poor and distrustful relationship between these former spouses. Mrs Hart could certainly not be expected to do so. In any event, a complete set of bank statements was only produced during the period of the adjournment of the hearing in March 2017 (i.e. with Mr Hart&#8217;s statement of 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">nd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> March 2017), therefore even the incomplete records were denied her until then.</span></p>

Further, historic leases and licences were not referred to in the note that was left behind for Mrs Hart.  He said that the historic leases and licences were drawn up by office staff and copies would have been retained by the tenants / licensees but that is no answer at all to his responsibility to produce them and it is not for Mrs Hart to track down tenants and licences and ask them for copies of past licences etc. I do not believe Mr Hart did leave documents in Unit 55 in the way that he alleges, in any event. It is inconceivable that this would not have been mentioned before or that important company documents would be dealt in this way.

Mr Hart knows full well that company records must be kept (not least for tax purposes &#8211; e.g. in the event of a tax inspection). It is plain from the documents that Mr Hart has produced that historic bank statements exist. The suggestion that historic licences and leases were not kept is risibly untrue &#8211; of course they were kept as essential company records.  Further there must have been documents relating to creditors and debtors as there must have been invoices from suppliers. In February 2018 Mr Hart said that there were handwritten ledger books kept; they have never been disclosed and cannot have simply disappeared.

As I will explain later in this judgment, it was known at the time of the hearing in May 2015 that Drakestown owed money to other companies but the sum claimed of &#163;1.638m was about &#163;500k more than was stated then. </span></p>

They readily agreed that that information/documentation was available to them (a concession which, I contend, is also evidence that there is a breach of the paragraph 5 of the order of 24 February 2016) and, after some persuasion, that they would produce it by 4 PM on 2 August 2016.

The effect of this is that deductions were made from VAT (p1432) for purchases that were either never made or were never properly recorded. I am not able to say whether the cheques were forged (as Mr Mitchell suggested) but this does highlight just how much information Mrs Hart needs in relation to the company if she is now going to operate it effectively and how careful she has to be about accepting the information provided by Mr Hart.</span></p>

An order was made for the provision of further information which is set out in paragraph six of that order [C16]; paragraph 5(ii) of the order contained a recital that Mr Hart and Mrs Byrne confirmed that the documents in paragraph six were available and could be provided [C16].

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Mr Hart was asked how Halesowen accounted to Drakestown for money that it collected. What records were kept (not least so that accounts for both companies could be drawn up)? He said: &#8216;You can find it in the bank statements&#8217;. The bank statements are those of Halesowen Estates that can be found at JH-162 onwards. The entries in those bank statements that are not redacted are those which relate to rent paid. Although he said that there were no cash payments [1-80] for rent, that was not correct [JH-210 and JH-356]. But, more importantly, Mrs Hart has calculated (and Mr Trevis, counsel for Mr Hart agreed) the receipts in to Halesowen Estates account total &#163;258,455 for 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">st</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> January to 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">st</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> December 2013. The rent received in the accounts for that period can be seen at JH-1187 - &#163;362,699. Therefore, Mr Hart was asked, where did the rest of the money received go? He said that he did not know the explanation for the shortfall. The shortfall is greater than might appear from the figures because the figure of &#163;258,455 would include the VAT (of about &#163;51,691) that was paid whereas the figure of &#163;362,699 would not include VAT. Asked: &#8216;where is the rest of the income?&#8217; he could not explain it. Further, the 2013 rent received figure was in fact lower than the 2012 rent received figure (JH-1187). The figures for rent received were 2012 &#8211; 396,795, 2011 &#8211; 420,035, 2010 (audited) 456,217. Therefore, says Mrs Hart, where has the rest of the money gone? There is no satisfactory answer from Mr Hart about this. This is a significant amount of money (about &#163;150k over a year in 2013) and cannot simply have disappeared. It must have gone somewhere, and Mr Hart has not explained this. It suggests that there was some arrangement that Mr Hart had for the payment of rent from Drakestown units elsewhere and that incomplete records have not been provided as ordered. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">There was another issue that arose in March 2017 in relation to the records. Mr Hart was asked when giving evidence to look at 3-1316 &#8211; it shows the rental income that was received and, therefore, it should be possible to see the entries on that page being paid into the bank. Mrs Hart&#8217;s accountant has been through that page and found that out of 37 entries there he can only account for 18 payments into the bank account. Mr Hart was asked to look at the bank account at JH-614 and it is plain that some rent received could not be seen going into the redacted bank account statements that have been disclosed. In closing Mr Armstrong said that the exercise carried by Mrs Hart&#8217;s accountant was incorrect because some of the entries in the unredacted bank statements (which he had seen) would account for these payments.  I think that it is very unfortunate that this arose in closing speeches in the way that it did (bearing in mind that it related to evidence that was given eleven months before). However, I do not feel confident about making findings in relation to this point.</span></p>

Mr Parkar had said that the documentation that was held by the accountants was returned to the company after the accounts were prepared; therefore, it did not come from them.
