	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">As long ago as 2008 Children Act proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (hereinafter referred to as "<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>") were considered and Her Honour Judge Cameron on 25th February 2008 made an order which is called a "Shared Residence Order". In fact, the order was a fairly conventional one dealing with issues of residence, the application of the mother for leave to remove the children permanently from the jurisdiction to relocate to the Republic of Ireland on a permanent basis, and for consequential contact to the father. It was, with the greatest of respect to the designation of "Shared Residence Order", quite clearly a conventional order in terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> for residence and contact.

It was only in consequence of the 2008 Act that the mother was permitted to take both children to Eire. Accordingly, questions of the appropriate jurisdiction to determine issues relating to the children pursuant to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> do not arise.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">Before I continue with the development of the history, it is worth saying a little bit in more detail about the content of this February 2008 order. The learned judge heard counsel for the mother and a solicitor for the father. She had read the papers. She took oral evidence from a CAFCASS officer, a Mrs. Glencross, from the mother, from the father and from one other person whose role in the affair I know not. That detail matters little.</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">As I have indicated, a residence order was made, albeit called "Shared," which effectively gave the bulk of the period of residence to the mother. She was given permission to take the children to Eire on the permanent basis she requested. There was provision, albeit called "Shared Residence", for contact to the father as follows: for approximately a week at Easter of that year; for the May half-term, four days; for the summer of that year, just over two weeks; and on one weekend a month from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon, the father was to have contact, the mother ensuring the children arrived at Stansted Airport not later than teatime on Friday, and the father to ensure the children returned to the maternal grandparents' home (where the mother was to live with those children at least for a while) on the Sunday afternoon. There was further provision about travel arrangements. There was in addition, as of 2009, provision that the boys could come to their father for about three weeks per annum: for a week at Christmas; for a week at Easter; and for each half term holiday. In addition, the father was given permission to travel to Ireland once a fortnight in order to have the "care of the children from Friday to Sunday".</p>

	    <p class="jus" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.25in">Unfortunately, matters did not prove to be straightforward and, for reasons I do not propose to go into (it being unnecessary for the purposes of this judgment) the father felt obliged to take enforcement proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> in 2010. Her Honour Judge Cameron again heard the matter. On 25th August 2010 a consent order was made. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the mother did not attend that hearing but careful instructions must have been taken from her. What follows are the agreed terms. The order of February 2008 was varied up to a point. The provision of one weekend a month (referred to above) was changed to once every six weeks and the mother again was to ensure that the children went to the father's house on the Friday in England. There was provision for monetary payments. In respect of a further provision of the order, the period of three weeks per annum was slightly extended to over four weeks. And instead of Christmas for one week, that was to be changed to half the Christmas holiday. Further provision was made, again as I emphasise, all by consent, that the father was to collect and return the children from the airport after visiting during the holiday period. There was also provision recording the agreement of the mother and the father that the boy H should benefit from some counselling. Again, I know not what the background to that was, but I mention in passing that both H and his little brother A had, as I understand it, had some limited counselling although as I emphasise the ambit of it is not before me, quite rightly.</p>

It is the mother's case &#8211; which I record without making any findings at all, that not being my business today, that the father has behaved unattractively at handovers, been critical of the mother and of her family and that generally his behaviour, not just limited to handovers, has been upsetting to the mother and others. For that reason, as well as others which she mentions in her statement (and again in respect of which I make no findings) she stopped the contact.</p>

I need not go into the detail of his proposals for the above is sufficient thrust to permit me to consider the question which arises at this point, that question being: is England and its courts the appropriate jurisdiction in which to determine such an issue?</p>

As I understand it, he did not purport to give any indication of what his views were nor did he &#8212; quite rightly &#8212; purport to determine it, but adjourned the matter for argument before a Judge of the Division. It was thus that it found itself this morning in Ryder J's list but a more wholly inappropriate listing is hard to imagine, he being the urgent Applications Judge and not necessarily nor indeed in fact, as his day has turned out, having the time to hear it. Happily, my one-day case settled and I was able to consider it.</p>

I have no hesitation in finding the habitual residence is indeed in Eire.</p>

Albeit somewhat surprisingly and I do not criticise him for it -- the answer came through counsel after a careful consultation that if the father could be assured that his contact would be preserved and indeed fostered, he would not be seeking to uproot the boys from Eire. Accordingly, subject to negotiation and various discussions which were subsequently had, it might have been possible for this case to have proceeded on the basis that I signed Annex 2 and/or Annex 3 Certificates under a European Instrument called Council Regulation EC Number 2201/2003 otherwise known colloquially as "Brussels II Revised" but referred to hereafter in this judgment only as "the Regulation".</p>

The difference between the parties is slight belying the impression given in the written material. The father, although he did not go into elaborate detail and specify his complaints, does suggest he has been the subject of unattractive behaviour from the mother and/or the members of her family just as she complains that the father has been behaving unattractively towards her.</p>

The mother, through Miss Islam, tells me that that is not acceptable to her. She wants a formal undertaking from the father to that effect and she has not proposed to enter into any such agreement for her own part. Although the father initially seemed to baulk at that, as his counsel's submissions progressed and after she had taken further careful instructions, the father, in order to advance matters, indicated that he would be prepared to give such an undertaking to be reviewed at the next hearing. And even though the mother would not offer her agreement to a similar inhibition on her behaviour, he would as an act of goodwill proceed on that basis himself.</p>

Again, as I understand it, the father acquiesced to that up to January 2013 when the mother will have given birth and recovered from the pregnancy, then the old arrangement taking place again.</p>

I appreciate that they have had some limited counselling and, as I said earlier, I know not what the subject of that was. But for my part, I can foresee that the essential enquiry, after the mother has set out her case as to why the six-weekly visit (as I shall call it) should be in Ireland or England, she apparently continuing to accept that the longer visit should be in England, that this further enquiry need not, be an extensive one.</p>

Pursuant to Article 8 of the Regulation general jurisdiction in relation to questions of parental responsibility lies in the courts of a Member State where the child is habitually resident at the time the court is seised. There is, of course, the period of three months after any child moves from one jurisdiction to another during which the court retains a vestigial jurisdiction: see Article 9 paragraph 1. These children have long been habitually resident in Eire so the English courts are, if I were to look only at that Article, no longer appropriate, Eire being the court of habitual residence for some four years now. But that is not an end of the matter.</p>

I know very little about his circumstances in Germany. In the near future it seems idle to make any order as to contact here since, as recent events have demonstrated, the father is not in a position to put the mother in cleared funds so as to enable the contact to take place. Frankly, I would risk making some so-called 'final order' of indefinite and long-term duration with complete uncertainty as to whether or when it would ever actually be implemented. Further, the position at the moment is that there has been a decision adverse to the father by the First-tier Tribunal. I have no knowledge whether or when a further appeal to the Upper Tribunal might be heard, nor of course what the outcome might be. But the current position, at all events, is that the father's position here is extremely tenuous and that does not seem to me to be an appropriate context in which to be making some long-term order.</p>

As I have already remarked, the contact order that was made by Her Honour Judge Hughes was expressly confined to the calendar year 2009 and did not even purport to be an order of longer term duration.</p>

Rather, it is patently in his best interests that all future issues as to contact are considered and resolved in the court in Germany which is already seised of this matter. It does not seem to me that Article 15 of the regulation is directly in point in the present case but, even if it was, I would unhesitatingly conclude that Germany is the Member State with which this child 'has a particular connection'. Each of subparagraphs (a), (c) and (d) of paragraph 3 of Article 15 are satisfied, in that Germany has become the habitual residence of the child, Germany is the place of the child's nationality, and Germany is the habitual residence of a holder of parental responsibility, namely the mother. If Article 15 was in point, I would unhesitatingly conclude that the courts of Germany 'would be better placed to hear the case' and that that 'is in the best interests of the child.'"</p>

Thus, the likelihood of the litigation continuing throughout its duration in this jurisdiction seemed open to question at the very least and there were many features making it more appropriate for the matter to be heard in the country of habitual residence of the child. I need not further refer to the case specifics which supported that view by Holman J.</p>
