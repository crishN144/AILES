They are currently aged 12, 9&#189; and 6.  The applicant was formerly married to, but is now divorced from, the father of those three girls.  The ethnicity of both parents is Nigerian, and their country of origin and citizenship is Nigeria.  Currently, it is understood that the father is in Nigeria although he visits England regularly.  The mother has been living in England, together with her daughters, for several years, although her visa has now expired and she frankly admits to being an overstayer.  However that may be, that is no reason, of course, for denying to these innocent young girls the protection of an FMGPO if one is otherwise required and is appropriate.</span></p>

I underwent the Type 2 procedure and so my clitoris and labia were removed.  I did not want the procedure but I had no choice.  Since the procedure, I have suffered terrible pain from my injury.  It has never properly healed.  After sexual intercourse, the wound will usually open again.&#8221;</span></p>

She says that he beats her and the children, regularly using weapons, such as belts, and that she has scars all over her body.  She says that he will often beat her and, whilst he is hitting her, will say to the children that he is going to kill her.  She says that he regularly threatens to harm or kill her or the children.  So, if there is any truth at all in what the mother says, there is a general background to this case and application of very serious violence and sadistic brutality.</span></p>

In February 2015, he sent the ceremonial robes from Nigeria in preparation for this.  Now the school holiday is upon us he has told me, via messages, that he expects to see the children immediately.  He has requested that the two elder girls be sent now.  He is angry because the eldest is over ten years old and past the usual age for the procedure to happen &#8230;  The respondent has requested the umbilical cords and first teeth of the children to be used as part of the ceremony.  He is very serious about the preparations and carrying out the ceremony in the school holidays so that the children can heal before the new term starts.&#8221;</span></p>

I have to have regard to all the circumstances, including the need to secure the health, safety and well-being of the girl, or in this case girls, to be protected.  As I have said, those short sentences from the statement of the mother in this case are sufficient to illustrate the scourge of female genital mutilation and how profoundly damaging that it may be, not only in the short term, but in the long term to the health and well-being of the person affected. The mother underwent this procedure about 14 years ago.  She describes how she has suffered terrible pain from it, it has never properly healed, and even now, after sexual intercourse, the wound will usually open again.  </span></p>

The primary categories under paragraph 2(2) are the girl who is to be protected by the order or &#8220;a relevant third party&#8221;.  Paragraph 2(7) defines that a relevant third party means a person specified, or falling within a description of persons specified, by regulations made by the Lord Chancellor.  However, Mr Zimran Samuel, who appears on behalf of the applicant mother today, tells me that, because the implementation of these provisions was brought forward, no regulations have yet been made specifying who may be a relevant third party for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2015/9" uk:canonical="2015 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref>.  So at the moment it is not possible to say that the mother is a relevant third party.

She says that she has suffered great violence at the hands of her former husband.   But if she in her own right needs protection from him, she has a different statutory remedy under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>, as amended.  I wish to make very, very clear that, in adding, as I will, those restrictions against the respondent father from coming within 100 metres of the home or the children&#8217;s school, I am doing so purely for the purposes of protecting these three girls from female genital mutilation, and not for the purpose of protecting the mother from any feared violence from the father. But it does seem to me, on the facts and in the circumstances of this case, that simply to prohibit the father from himself or by others practising enforced genital mutilation upon these girls is not sufficient. He must, for the time being, be prohibited altogether from coming within a restricted radius of their home and, when they return there next term, their school. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE HOLMAN:  That is not what she says in her statement.  Her statement says, &#8220;I had a two-year visa that expired last year. I am currently an overstayer.&#8221;  My judgment was quoting what she said in her statement and was accurate.  Her statement may be inaccurate, but that is her error not mine.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. SAMUEL:  I will put that aside. Those were my instructions in raising it. Secondly, my Lord, I told the court that there was not yet a list by the Lord Chancellor of who would be considered relevant third parties.  That is correct, however, if I can put on the record for clarity, there has been guidance issued that relevant third parties do at the moment include local authorities.  There is not a list yet but----</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE HOLMAN:  Has the Lord Chancellor made any regulations?</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. SAMUEL:  My understanding is at the moment, no, but there has been guidance circulated by the MOJ.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE HOLMAN:  That is just guidance. What <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> clearly says is that an application may be made by a relevant third party, relevant third party means a person specified &#8230; by regulations. If the Lord Chancellor has not yet made the regulations, we do not yet have a defined relevant third party.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. SAMUEL:  I would not wish to mislead the court.  It might be that something exists that I have not seen, it is always possible, but what I have seen - and I have been doing some research to find out, my Lord -  is that the MOJ circular says &#8220;relevant third parties include local authorities&#8221; at the moment and that is it.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE HOLMAN:  I think that what I have said in the judgment was that you had told me that there were no regulations and you did tell me that.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. SAMUEL:  My Lord, as far as I am aware there is no current list.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE HOLMAN:  I do not think that anything needs correcting in the judgment, because I correctly said what you told me.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. SAMUEL:  My Lord, very well. The last thing that I wish to raise is I wonder, my Lord, if you would consider having this judgment released on BAILII for a few reasons that I can briefly outline.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE HOLMAN :  The first question is whether a transcript is made of it.  If a transcript is made of it, I put all transcripts of all judgments on BAILII, so, if it were to be transcribed, it will go on BAILII.  Who is going to pay for a transcript?</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. SAMUEL;  My Lord, may I seek to persuade you that it should be at public expense?</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE HOLMAN: All right. </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. SAMUEL:  Firstly----</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. JUSTICE HOLMAN:  You do not need to develop it.  It is very important.   This is the first, so I will say - and you can add it into the order - that a transcript of the judgment given today must be made forthwith on an expedited basis at the expense of public funds.   I will ask my clerk to trigger that, but you must make sure that that goes in the order.</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR. SAMUEL:  I will, my Lord.  </span></p>

	  <heading style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">MR JUSTICE HOLMAN:  I will automatically put it on BAILII, because my personal view is that, if any judgment is transcribed for any purpose, it should be placed on BAILII.   It is not for judges to decide what is or is not in the public interest. As far as I am concerned, if a judge says it and it is available, it is in the public interest that the public should be able to read it if they wish.  If it bores them to tears, that is nothing to do with me.  </span></heading>

Can you ring them today so I can get on with it early next week otherwise I will be going away? </span></p>
