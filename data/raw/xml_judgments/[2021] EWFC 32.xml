A few days earlier, F had made an application in Monaco; it was dated 18 November 2019 and issued on 21 November 2019. M&#8217;s English solicitors had previously sent F letters before action. He was evasive when questioned before me as to his receipt of these letters but the fact is that a letter sent by his English solicitors to M&#8217;s English solicitors <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>he issued his proceedings in Monaco makes clear that he was aware of the correspondence. Indeed, in his application to the court in Monaco F pleaded that on 24 October 2019 he had received a letter from M&#8217;s English solicitors threatening proceedings in England. It is reasonable to infer in the circumstances that his application in Monaco was a preemptive strike. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">By his application in Monaco (I quote from the English translation), F sought blood testing to establish whether or not he is C&#8217;s father and, pending the results of this test, continuation of maintenance in the sum of &#8364;2,225 per month currently being paid by him to M. He reserved the right to bring civil proceedings &#8220;for moral or financial prejudice&#8221;: (i) if C is his child, in the sum of &#8364;130,000 &#8220;for the moral prejudice he suffered&#8221; as &#8220;the result of a theft of sperm or even a breach of trust on the part of&#8221; M; (ii) if C is not his child, &#8220;reimbursement of the entirety of the sums paid (&#8364;127,000 of pension paid to this day) or that could still be paid (besides &#8364;35,000 of moral prejudice)&#8221;; and (iii) in any case, &#8220;compensation of the moral and financial prejudice suffered because of [M&#8217;s] fraudulent schemes, who &#8230; has relocated to England for the purposes of the case in order to manipulate the criteria of jurisdiction and applicable law and obtain what she had failed to achieve by threat&#8221;, compensation being claimed in the sum of <img src="image2.png" style="width:7.2pt;height:8.64pt"/>100,000. Judging by what he told me in evidence the basis of F&#8217;s claim at (i) is his assertions that M told him that she was using a contraceptive, that he always practised coitus interruptus and, he insinuates, that she was somehow responsible for introducing his sperm into her vagina.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.04in">As I explain below, the doctrine of &#8220;reflexive effect&#8221; is a principle of our domestic law. It is not a rule of EU law. Essentially, the principle allows the court to treat &#8220;reflexively&#8221; (ie analogously) an earlier proceeding in a non-EU state as if it were in an EU Member State, provided that the terms of the EU Regulation in question do not prohibit such treatment. Thus, the underlying premise of Mr Amos&#8217;s submission is that, had the proceedings which were actually issued in Monaco been issued in another Member State, then those proceedings would have had priority under the Maintenance Regulation and the English court would have been bound to decline jurisdiction. For this purpose, Mr Amos relies upon Articles 3(c) and 5 read in conjunction with Article 12.  </p>

Much of the discussion in the Supreme Court was accordingly directed to the Maintenance Regulation. The issue in the case was simple.

The judge relied on the fact that the husband&#8217;s finances were based in Sweden &#8230;; but that ignores the importance under the Maintenance Regulation of the position of the wife (the maintenance creditor) and the identification of her needs in the place of her habitual residence &#8230; The judge said, &#8220;There is no prejudice to the wife as she can make her application in Sweden . . . I am quite satisfied that the only reason she has not done so to date is tactical&#8221; &#8230; However, there was prejudice to the wife, because by his ruling the judge deprived her of her rights under the Maintenance Regulation and her ability to rely upon <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 27</ref> as a matter of substantive law. He clearly thought that the wife had engaged in illegitimate forum shopping; but the Maintenance Regulation laid down a right for her to choose the forum in which to sue. She was entitled to do so by reference to tactical reasons. In the context of the Maintenance Regulation, there was nothing illegitimate in her deciding to bring her maintenance claim in England &#8230; [T]he judge said that it was &#8220;undoubtedly expedient to hear and determine the issues between these parties together in the same jurisdiction&#8221;; but the EU jurisdictional regimes expressly contemplate that different claims arising out of the marriage of the parties might well have to be determined in different jurisdictions. The judge also speculated &#8230; that the husband might be able to apply for a maintenance order against himself in Sweden; but it would be contrary to the Maintenance Regulation to allow him, as the maintenance debtor, by such a stratagem to determine the jurisdiction in which his wife&#8217;s maintenance claim should be heard.&#8221; </p>

Since article 3 allows a choice of jurisdiction and the substantive law to be applied in relation to a maintenance claim differs as between member states, I consider that the phrase refers to the nature of the claims being brought, i e as claims for maintenance of a specific person, rather than to the precise cause of action in law. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">&#8220;In article 13, read in the context of the Maintenance Regulation, I consider that the word &#8220;actions&#8221; refers primarily to maintenance claims of the kind to which the special regime in the Regulation applies. If the position were otherwise, and the word &#8220;actions&#8221; meant legal proceedings of any kind whatever, that would undermine the fundamental object of the Maintenance Regulation that a maintenance creditor has the right to choose in which jurisdiction to claim maintenance. On such a reading, there would be a substantial risk that this object of the Maintenance Regulation would be undermined by the commencement of proceedings by the maintenance debtor according to the jurisdictional provisions of instruments other than the Maintenance Regulation, laid down in pursuance of entirely different jurisdictional policies than that reflected in the Maintenance Regulation. By contrast, by reading &#8220;actions&#8221; as referring primarily to maintenance claims, such claims will be brought in exercise of the rights conferred by the Maintenance Regulation and hence in accordance with its objects and policy. Since it is the case that the Maintenance Regulation may have the effect of authorising more than one person to bring a maintenance claim, it needs to make provision for how a potential jurisdictional clash arising within the objects of the Regulation should be resolved. Any extension of the concept of &#8220;related action&#8221; beyond this in the context of the Maintenance Regulation has to be tested against the objects and policy of that Regulation, and accordingly will be narrowly confined to cases in which the risk of conflicting judgments is very clearly made out (an example would be if an obligation to provide maintenance were conditional on a marriage relationship actually continuing, and a court in another member state had been asked to dissolve the marriage, thereby bringing the relationship on which the obligation depends to an end: cf </p>

It merely adds a jurisdictional option which the maintenance creditor is entitled to choose, if she wants to. To give it wider significance than that would undermine the fundamental object of the Maintenance Regulation to protect the interests of the maintenance creditor by giving her the choice of where to litigate her claim for maintenance, since it would enable the opposing spouse, who is the maintenance debtor, to choose where to sue in relation to the question of marital status and then to argue, by reference to article 13, that the maintenance creditor&#8217;s maintenance claim must be brought in the same place.&#8221;  </p>

The interpretation of the definition of &#8220;related action&#8221; in article 13(3) has to reflect the policy and objects of the Regulation. The definition in article 13(3) must be strictly applied, since if the husband sought to maintain such an argument he would be seeking to rely on article 13 to derogate from the fundamental object of the Maintenance Regulation (as replicated in Schedule 6 for intra-state cases) to provide a right for the wife, as maintenance creditor, to choose where to bring her maintenance claim; and he would be seeking to do so by reference to an action brought by himself which relates to marital status or the division of matrimonial property rather than maintenance. The special jurisdictional regime for maintenance claims is not lightly to be regarded as supplanted by the operation of a distinct jurisdictional regime designed for different types of case.&#8221; </p>

If the two sets of proceedings in question were maintenance claims by the wife against the husband, one could expect the situation to fall within article 12 (same cause of action, same parties), so article 13 must be intended to extend further than that. In contrast to article 12, it does not require that the proceedings involve the same cause of action between the same parties. It is focused instead on &#8220;related actions&#8221;. The ambit of this category is to be ascertained from article 13(3), which &#8230; I think is intended to be a complete definition. Related actions are, accordingly, actions which are &#8220;so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings&#8221;. Articles 13(1) and 13(2) concern only &#8220;related actions&#8221; which come within this definition, article 13(1) referring to the situation &#8220;Where related actions are pending&#8221; and article 13(2) referring back to this in its opening words &#8220;Where these actions are pending&#8221;. </p>

But that is insufficient to define a related action for the purposes of the article. Actions could be said to be closely connected if they were both brought by the same litigant, but if one action was against a retailer in respect of a defective domestic appliance and the other was a petition for divorce, no one would suggest that they were related actions for article 13 purposes. The reference to avoiding the risk of irreconcilable judgments is vital, therefore, in fixing the boundaries of the category. </p>

I do not intend to o&#8250;er a definitive answer to this question &#8211; all  that is required is to determine whether the two sets of proceedings in this case were related actions, and further mapping out of the territory of article 13 ought to wait until it is required to cater for other facts. But examples of the sorts of situations that might fall within article 13(3) can still be helpful in ascertaining its meaning. Two such useful examples can be found in the husband&#8217;s written case. They are: (1) where a spouse is being pursued for maintenance by his or her first and second spouse at the same time, and (2) where there are child maintenance proceedings in one court, and spousal maintenance proceedings in another (assuming of course that these are considered to be two separate causes of action). Lord Sales JSC suggests the situation where there are cross-applications for maintenance, by the wife against the husband in one part of the United Kingdom and by the husband against the wife in another (see para 44 of his judgment). He gives a further example at para 45, inspired by the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Hoffmann v Krieg (Case 145/86)</span></p>

Another possibility might be where one spouse (say, the wife) applies for maintenance from the other spouse in one part of the United Kingdom and, in another part, the husband applies for an order against himself (see <span style="font-style:italic">Dart v Dart</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 2 FLR 286" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 2 FLR 286</ref>, 292). Again, this would depend on whether or not the two actions were, in fact, classed as &#8220;proceedings involving the same cause of action&#8221; and therefore within article 12 rather than article 13. It is also worth noting that, in this last example, there would need to be consideration of the point made by Lord Sales JSC, at para 46 of his judgment, about the potential problems of a maintenance debtor choosing the jurisdiction for a maintenance claim. But, in all of these examples, it is possible to foresee that, depending on the precise facts, there could be a risk of the two courts giving irreconcilable judgments.&#8221; </p>

Rather it is that the Regulation allows the court to exercise the powers available to it under its national law: here the CPR &#8230; include a power to &#8216;stay the whole or part of any proceedings or judgment either generally or until a specific date or event&#8217; &#8230; Its proper exercise is not unfettered, in that the court must not order a stay that is contrary to the letter or purpose of the Brussels Regulation. The argument for giving some articles reflexive effect is that this is required in order to give effect to the purpose (albeit not the letter) of the Regulation. If the court accepts this argument and therefore decides not to accept jurisdiction, to my mind &#8230; the proper form of order is to stay the proceedings.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Amos identifies four possible answers to the question whether, adopting the reflexive effect in relation to the Maintenance Regulation, the court has power to stay English maintenance proceedings: (A), &#8220;no-stay&#8221;, the English Court is prohibited from staying the proceedings; (B), &#8220;must-stay&#8221;, the English Court is obliged to stay the proceedings; (C), &#8220;can-stay&#8221;, the English Court has a discretion to stay the proceedings if it considers it appropriate to do so; or (D), &#8220;should-stay-unless&#8221;, the English Court should stay the proceedings, but has a limited, residual discretion not to do so if the competing state is one which, on policy grounds, cannot command international faith and credit/respect. His difficulty, as he appreciates, is (i) that Andrew Smith J was expressly relying on national law to grant a stay, not on autonomous EU law: <span style="font-style:italic">Ferrexpo</span>, paras 127, 154(iii); and (ii) that Recital (15) of the Maintenance Regulation expressly forbids &#8220;any referral to national law&#8221;. </p>

He concedes that, whilst there are obvious attractions to Option (C), discretionary can-stay, &#8220;the foundation for its application to the Maintenance Regulation is so insecure that it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain.&#8221; In fact, he concedes, &#8220;deriving from national law [it] is inconsistent with the clear terms of Recital (15).&#8221; Option (D), should-stay-unless, provides, he submits, a &#8220;sensible and pragmatic compromise&#8221;, but, as he accepts, &#8220;its juridical foundation is also somewhat (but perhaps slightly less) shaky.&#8221; Indeed. In my judgment, Option (D), like Option (C), founders on the rock of Recital (15). </p>

Option (A) entirely defeats his object, which is, in substance, to persuade me to stay the English proceedings. The problems with Option (B), which is for obvious reasons his preference, are two-fold. First, as he correctly acknowledges, this is to give effect to what Andrew Smith J described (para 125(i)) as &#8220;the most reflexive theory&#8221;, yet this is not the theory which in the event that judge adopted; as we have seen, he decided (para 154) to exercise a discretionary power rather than follow a mandatory rule. Secondly, it unavoidably brings in its train, as Andrew Smith J recognised (para 154(ii)), the wholly unacceptable consequence of requiring the court to refuse to assume jurisdiction in favour of courts in which the parties would not receive justice. </p>

For this purpose, the two fundamental aspects of the jurisprudence in relation to the Maintenance Regulation are (i) the existence of Recital (15) and (ii) the fact that in consequence the doctrine of forum non conveniens has no place. </p>

In contrast, the Maintenance Regulation in Recital (15) explicitly proscribes any referral to national law. This sets the Maintenance Regulation apart from the original Brussels 1 regulation and the Lugano Convention. That, in my judgment, is really the end of the argument. The application of the doctrine contended for by Mr Amos is simply inconsistent with Recital (15) and its associated jurisprudence. If a Convention or Regulation deals, expressly or impliedly, with the question whether priority should be afforded to a pre-existing identical or similar action in a non-EU state, and if so how, then that is the end of the matter. Here, recourse to domestic remedies which might be thought to have analogous, or nearly-analogous, effects is precluded by the terms of the Maintenance Regulation itself. </p>

However, the Regulation does not lay down any minimum duration. Before habitual residence can be transferred to the host state, it is of paramount importance that the person concerned has it in mind to establish there the permanent or habitual centre of his interests, with the intention that it should be of a lasting character. Accordingly, the duration of a stay can serve only as an indicator in the assessment of the permanence of the residence, and that assessment must be carried out in the light of all the circumstances of fact specific to the individual case.&#8221; </p>

Mr Scott argues that this introduces an undesirable element of uncertainty. If intention were synonymous with the subjective, capricious wish-fulfilment of one party, I would agree. The test for habitual residence is objective. But what is meant by intention here is no more than another way of bringing into play the <span style="font-style:italic">reasons</span> for the parties&#8217; actions. Concepts such as &#8216;permanent&#8217;, &#8216;habitual&#8217;, &#8216;residence&#8217; and &#8216;home&#8217; have a mental element which the court is well able to assess objectively.

To that end, in particular the duration, regularity, conditions and reasons for the stay on the territory of a member state and the family&#8217;s move to that state, the child&#8217;s nationality, the place and conditions of attendance at school, linguistic knowledge and the family and social relationships of the child in that state must be taken into consideration.

The concept operates in the expectation that, when a child gains a new habitual residence, he loses his old one. Simple analogies are best: consider a see-saw. As, probably quite quickly, he puts down those first roots which represent the requisite degree of integration in the environment of the new state, up will probably come the child&#8217;s roots in that of the old state to the point at which he achieves the requisite de-integration (or, better, disengagement) from it.&#8221;  </p>

In making the following three suggestions about the point at which habitual residence might be lost and gained, I offer not sub-rules but expectations which the fact-finder may well find to be unfulfilled in the case before him: (a) the deeper the child&#8217;s integration in the old state, probably the less fast his achievement of the requisite degree of integration in the new state; (b) the greater the amount of adult pre-planning of the move, including prearrangements for the child&#8217;s day-to-day life in the new state, probably the faster his achievement of that requisite degree; and (c) were all the central members of the child&#8217;s life in the old state to have moved with him, probably the faster his achievement of it and, conversely, were any of them to have remained behind and thus to represent for him a continuing link with the old state, probably the less fast his achievement of it.&#8221; </p>

The key, indeed only, question is whether by the relevant date that change has happened. This is a pure matter of fact. In answering the key question, the court examines the links to the previous state of habitual residence, the extent to which those links have ended, and the extent of the establishment of new links in the second state. As Mr Amos therefore submits, and I agree, in circumstances where, as a matter of EU law, an applicant can have only one habitual residence at any given moment, it is both legitimate and appropriate, indeed necessary, for the Court to assess the applicant's continuing ties to the previous jurisdiction at the relevant date (here, 26 November 2019) in determining whether the applicant has truly established, in the case of an adult, a new centre of interests or, in the case of a child, the necessary degree of integration, in the new jurisdiction by the relevant date.  </p>

According to F, their relationship was simply about sex, &#8220;transactional&#8221; and limited to very few occasions; according to M it was much more than that. That is not a matter I need to resolve, given that the ultimate question for decision is maintenance for C and that the nature of the relationship in 2013 hardly illuminates the question of habitual residence in November 2019. It is agreed that F has seen C only once, in January 2015. It is agreed that F has been paying M the sum of &#8364;2,250 per month (usually paid every two months) since March 2015, but whether that was by way of mutual agreement, as F says, or unilaterally imposed, as M says, is not a matter I need to decide.  </p>

The purpose of the assertion, he says, was as part of her attempt to demonstrate that she was taking active to steps to sever her ties to France. In cross-examination M had to accept that in fact she took no steps to deregister her business. Moreover, as Mr Amos correctly pointed out (and I noted it at the time) it was noticeable how she fenced the question and gave an explanation &#8211; that what she was </p>

The impression that M was seeking to convey, he suggests, was one of stability and C being settled. The inference as to the reason for the omission, he says, is obvious: by revealing that C had been at B school and left after only a term would undermine that picture of stability and C being settled. And, as he points out, it was not, as we now know, until January 2020, after the date for assessing habitual residence, that C started at C school. </p>

She accepts that she did not seek an increase in C&#8217;s maintenance from him prior to her move. If M was intending to leave France and to re-locate permanently to London, why not send F even a single text (or WhatsApp message) about this? But it is accepted that she did not raise it with him at all. This is, Mr Amos suggests, particularly baffling if M is (as she claims) totally financially dependent on F. How was she going to afford to live in London? Had she assessed what it was going to cost for her and C to live in central London? How was she to fund herself and C, particularly without any family support or childcare?   </p>

So the further back one goes into the history, the less the impact the facts, whatever they may be, are likely to have on the ultimate question. Thus, for example, questions as to the duration, nature and extent of M&#8217;s stay in London during the years 2004 to 2014, or as to the nature and extent of her relationship with F during 2013, are significant primarily as going to M&#8217;s honesty and reliability as a witness. Secondly, that questions of her honesty and reliability as a witness are significant primarily insofar as her case depends upon her own account rather than when the facts can be established independently and speak for themselves.  </p>

But where does it take him?

Where, in the final analysis, does this take us? To what extent does any of this, at the end of the day, impinge on the hard facts, independently established?  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The short answer to that critical question is that it leaves the fundamentals of M&#8217;s case as summarised above essentially intact. The most obviously important revelations are that M has not de-registered her French business and that she has left her car and some possessions &#8211; she says some boxes of clothes &#8211; with her mother and step-father in France. Those facts obviously have to be evaluated as part of the overall picture, as does the fact, in no way concealed by her, for she produced a photograph of their arrival on 28 August 2019, that she and C travelled to this country with not very much luggage &#8211; but she was, of course, moving into a furnished flat. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The reality, however, is that in August 2019 M was moving back to a country with which she had had what on any view was a significant connection in the years down to 2014; that the move had been carefully planned with, crucially, arrangements made in advance both for their accommodation and for C&#8217;s schooling; and that, as the bank statements show, they almost immediately settled into the kind of routine one would expect of a mother and child living in London. Virtually as soon as they had arrived, M made arrangements for their registration with both a dentist and a GP and by September 2019 C was having both ballet and music lessons. Mr Amos makes great play of the fact that in January 2020 C moved schools, as showing that she was not integrated or settled and that M&#8217;s planning was inadequate. I do not accept that. In November 2019 C was settled in B school, though it had always been M&#8217;s plan to move her to C school if and when a place became available. Mr Amos characterises M&#8217;s plan as &#8220;very high-stakes&#8221;, given her financial dependence on F (whom she never consulted), and uses her own words to condemn her for her choice of unsuitable accommodation. Be that as it may, the fact is that M moved to this country on 28 August 2019 intending, as I am satisfied, to make it her and C&#8217;s future home and, some twenty months later, they are still here and managing financially. </p>

A divorcing couple that has to litigate the consequences of the marital breakdown is not blessed. The couple that first litigates where to litigate might be said to be cursed. In reality it is a curse restricted to the rich. Only they can afford such folly. This case is a paradigm example. Let me assume that the husband is a man of means. The wife is said to be destitute. Yet she has incurred costs here of &#163;153,000 &#8230; The husband&#8217;s costs are put at &#163;108,000 in this jurisdiction. By contrast the costs in Germany are said to be &#163;11,000 for the wife and &#163;2,600 for the husband. The inevitable comparison should give the specialist practitioners in London pause for thought.&#8221;  </p>
