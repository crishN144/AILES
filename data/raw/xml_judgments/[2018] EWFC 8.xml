M and her family then moved home, and the relationship between F and J waned.  F stopped visiting.  Occasionally, M contacted F by social media with updates about J.  When J was about 3 or 4 years old, M contacted F and invited him to meet up with her and J; F was able to spend the day with J.  Although M had F&#8217;s mobile phone number, and they were in contact on social media, there was minimal contact, and F did not persevere with contact with J; his engagement was, I infer, affected by periodic depression.  </p>

He instructed solicitors, and together they identified a mediator to assist F to discuss the issues with M; the solicitors wrote to M, in conciliatory terms, to explore the possibility of mediation.  M initially agreed to attend mediation, but in the event did not attend the appointment. She blocked F from social media contact.  F, through solicitors, then made a more direct approach proposing the resumption of direct contact with J. In response to this letter, M&#8217;s mother telephoned F&#8217;s solicitor. She broke the news to F&#8217;s solicitor that J was now an adopted child, having been adopted some three years earlier by SF.   F was informed and was understandably shocked and upset.  M then proposed mediation; through this medium, the parties were able to negotiate a further meeting between J and F.  Having sought further legal advice, F applied through solicitors for legal aid to pursue this appeal.  </p>

The professionals were unable to conduct their statutory enquiries, and the magistrates were materially misled about J&#8217;s background history, his paternity, and F&#8217;s interest in J. The court was thus rendered unable, by virtue of M and SF&#8217;s misconduct, to reach a completely informed or reliable view about the appropriateness of the adoption in J&#8217;s best interests.   The outcome of the hearing was in my view clearly &#8220;<span class="para2text1" style="color:initial">unjust&#8221; because of the &#8220;serious&#8230; irregularity&#8221; which I have described above (</span><span class="para2text1" style="font-style:italic;color:initial">rule 30.12(3)(b) FPR 2010</span><span class="para2text1" style="color:initial">).

The severance of a family&#8217;s legal (and often actual) relationships, and the creation of a new set of legal family relationships, fundamentally impacts upon the life of the child, the natural parent who faces becoming a &#8216;former&#8217; parent, and the adoptive parent.

While ultimately that decision lies with me, I have nonetheless given considerable weight to his view in resolving, on balance, not to initiate any form of civil sanction.  I have additionally borne in mind, in taking this view, what I go on to say at [38] and [39] below.  However, should any person contemplate such deception of the authorities or the court in these circumstances, they should understand that generally such dishonesty would be punished.</p>

J knows that F is his natural father; he has recently said how much he enjoys seeing F and developing relationships with the paternal family.   F indicates no continuing experience of depression. M and F have constructively discussed the future of contact and have jointly proposed that I should make an order for regular weekend staying contact between J and F.   This, it seems to me, entirely accords with his best interests, and I am pleased to be able to do so.</p>
