I directed that she should be told of the special measures that could be put in place to allow her to give evidence.  I urged her to reflect not only on any harm that she may have suffered, but also upon her responsibilities, however unwelcome.  I acknowledged that there might be good or even compelling reasons for her stance, but that it came at a high price for others.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.38in">X&#8217;s allegations of abuse and events relating to her subsequent disclosure are relevant to my assessment of two reasons: (1) there appears to be a close temporal relationship between X&#8217;s reported experiences of abuse and her presentation with episodes of medically unexplained symptoms; (2) X&#8217;s experience of disclosure has left her feeling vulnerable and lacking in trust.  In particular she feels that her confidentiality has not been respected and that she has been misled about the potential implications of disclosure.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.38in">X has a long history of repeated presentations with medically unexplained symptoms commencing in early childhood.  Medically unexplained symptoms (i.e., symptoms for which no physical cause can be found) are often a manifestation of underlying psychological distress although the person presenting might not recognise this.  One psychological perspective is that presentation with medical symptoms provides an alternative route to care and respite when other more adaptive avenues of rescue are, for whatever reason, not open.  Although concerns have been expressed over time about the frequent, often non-specific and sometimes dramatic presentations of X to medical services, it is with the benefit of time and with the availability of information brought together from a variety of sources (including social services), that a clear pattern can now be seen.  Most recently, X has experienced episodes of physical illness which have at times been life-threatening.  It is the opinion of a number of medical professionals caring for her (based on a variety of clinical observations) that stress/psychological factors are, at the very least, exacerbating her symptoms.  As a result of her frequent presentations with exacerbations of this condition, X has received medical treatment which has had a number of damaging side-effects and there has been significant deterioration in her health.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.38in">X has been clear that the ongoing legal issues are a major source of stress and there does appear to be a pattern of worsening illness which coincides with the increasing pressures arising from these.  In order to safeguard her health, an ongoing aim of management is to try and reduce her exposure to various stressors and to engage her in psychological therapy which might provide her with an adaptive outlet for expressing difficulties.  However, this is likely to be a challenging and relatively long-term process.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.38in">X feels that her initial disclosure put in motion a chain of events which has left her feeling distrustful and lacking confidence in processes that should have been protective of her.  In particular it is her perception that, despite reassurances about confidentiality, it has at times been breached which has had negative consequences for her.  In addition, she feels that she was led to believe that she would never be required to speak of the allegations again and the current situation has therefore, once again, undermined her confidence in the system.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.38in">It is my opinion that disclosure of the social services records regarding X to other parties would be potentially detrimental to her health.  As above, she appears to manifest psychological distress in physical terms both through medically unexplained symptoms and through the well recognised exacerbating effect of stress on a particular medical disorder.  Her physical health has deteriorated considerably recently and, at times, has deteriorated to the point of being life-threatening.  There is therefore a significant risk that exposure to further psychological stress (such as that which would inevitably result from disclosure) would put her at risk of further episodes of illness.  It would also be working against the current therapeutic strategy of trying to help minimise stress and engage with psychological therapy.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.38in">I believe that X has the capacity to participate in court proceedings.  However, it should be noted that various professionals at different times have commented on the difficulty of interviewing her in relation to the alleged abuse.  My own experience of exploring these issues with her is that many of my questions were met with silence; she was clearly very uncomfortable and distressed and seemed unable to respond.  When I asked her about appearing in court she responded "I can't".</p>

However she said that this would be a traumatic prospect for her as she understood that the alleged abuser would be able to see her face and she could not cope with this.  As above, I also think that her perception that processes so far have, to some extent, let her down means that she does not feel confident in any of the reassurances provided.</p>

In this, I disagree with the Guardian&#8217;s submission.  It is not realistic to decide the application for disclosure of documents without considering the consequences if the application were to succeed.  Although the question of the issuing of a witness summons does not formally arise at this stage, it is inevitable that it will if X&#8217;s identity is revealed.  Once a summons was issued, X would apply to set it aside under the Family Procedure Rules 2010 r. 24.3(4).  At the outset, the court is entitled, and in these circumstances obliged, to ask the question &#8220;Where is this going?&#8221;.</span></p>

It is likely to have a severe and possibly dangerous impact upon her health and well-being.  There are also real practical difficulties in securing X&#8217;s attendance and in her being cross-examined by the father.  I have considered the various special measures of the kind set out in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/23" uk:canonical="1999 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/23/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss.23</ref>-29, but none of these would in my view provide an adequate solution.
