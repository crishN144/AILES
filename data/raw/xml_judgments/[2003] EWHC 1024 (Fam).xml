	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case concerns two children, and was what has become known as an intractable contact dispute. In this instance, the residential parent had persuaded the children (quite falsely) not only that the non-residential parent had both physically and sexually abused them, but also that the non-resident parent&#8217;s own parents, with whom the children had previously enjoyed a perfectly normal relationship, were also physical abusers and a threat to the children. The result was a cessation of all contact between the children, the non-residential parent, and the children&#8217;s wider family on that side. </p>

I had come to the clear conclusion that the children were suffering significant harm in the residential parent&#8217;s care. It had, furthermore, become clear that an assessment of the kind needed could only take place if the children were not in their own home</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have decided to publish my two principal judgments in this case in order to demonstrate one method of addressing an intractable contact dispute. I am immediately conscious, of course, that the case turns on its particular facts, although the phenomenon it represents is by no means uncommon. This was the second time I had used the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> procedure to remove children who were being denied all contact with their non-residential parent, and were suffering significant harm because of the residential parent&#8217;s false and distorted belief system about the non-residential parent, which the children had imbibed. </p>

It must appear to the court that &#8220;it may be appropriate for a care or supervision order to be made&#8221; with respect to the children in question. In other words, at the very lowest, the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the circumstances with respect to the children meet the threshold criteria under section 31(2) - that is to say that the children are suffering or are likely to suffer significant harm.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 37</ref> is, accordingly, a well focused tool, to be used only when the case fits its criteria.</p>

The definition of &#8220;specified proceedings&#8221; (ibid s. 41(6)(b)) includes private law proceedings for contact or residence orders in which the court has given a direction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(1)</ref> and has made or is considering whether to make an interim care order).  In these circumstances a children&#8217;s guardian must be appointed under section 41(1) unless the court is satisfied that it is not necessary to do so in order to safeguard the children&#8217;s interests.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the instant case, the residential parent asserted that the children had been sexually and physically abused by the non-residential and the latter&#8217;s parents. This was not true. I was, however, only able to proceed on the basis that it was not true because there had been clear and compelling findings by an experienced circuit judge, and I was able to confirm those findings by the evidence I heard. It is, in my judgment, very important that the local authority should know the court&#8217;s findings, and prepare its report on t he basis of those findings. In an intractable contact dispute, where the residential parent is putting forward an allegedly factual basis for contact not taking place, there is no substitute, in my judgment, for findings by the court as to whether or not there is any substance to the allegations. </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment it is vital for the local authority to know the judge&#8217;s thinking in making the order. Even if such an order is made urgently, a note of the reasons for it should, in my judgment, be prepared and made available to the local authority. Apart from anything else, clear reasons for the order save a great deal of time, and enable the local authority to focus on the salient points. In the instant case, I reserved judgment and shortly afterwards handed down the first of the two judgments set out below in a form designed to be read by both the parties and the local authority. In its original form, the first judgment was cross-referenced to the court bundles which were also disclosed to the local authority. Such a course may not be practical in other cases, particularly where the report is urgently required.  However, it is not enough in my judgment for the local authority simply to be told the judge has ordered a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> report.

If the report recommends care proceedings, the guardian already in place can act as guardian in those proceedings. If it does not, the court is going to have to try an alternative approach. This is an area where the independent tandem model, in my experience, has proved extremely helpful in providing advice and, where necessary, obtaining expert evidence.</p>

It is, however, of material assistance to a court if there has been an investigation by an expert who has come to the view that the children are suffering significant harm and that local authority intervention is necessary. This advice does not, however, in my judgment necessarily have to come from a psychiatrist or psychologist. A competent CAFCASS report by a Court Reporter should identify the problem.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question for me, therefore, is whether, at this stage, anything can be done to rectify the damaging situation for the children which I have described.  Several options were canvassed in evidence and in argument. They varied from doing nothing to an immediate removal of the children from Mrs. M&#8217;s care. I will, of course, return to them, once I have set out the relevant facts. I should, however, make it clear at this point that, in my judgment, the option of doing nothing is not acceptable. These children are suffering significant harm, and in my view the court has a duty to investigate all available options before it decides, if it has to, that doing nothing is the least damaging course.</p>

By doing so, I hope I will ease the process of understanding the case for any third party to whom permission is given for the court papers to be shown. .<marker name="tab"/>I am, however, also setting out the facts in detail because I wish both Mr. and Mrs. M to be in no doubt about my conclusions. Mrs. M told me that her solicitors had not taken her through the two judgments in the case given by the Circuit judge. I do not believe her. However, she will not be able to say that same about this judgment.  I am, I hope, writing it in plain English which she will be able to understand.  The parties will both be given a copy of the judgment as soon as practicable after it has been handed down, and it would, in my judgment, be a proper expenditure of public funds under both their funding certificates for their solicitors to go through the judgment with them. I cannot, of course, force Mrs. M to read it, let alone agree with it, but if she does not, it will be yet further evidence of her wilful disregard for the court and her refusal to understand that she is not acting in the best interests of her children.</p>

She recorded that the Child Protection Investigation Team had become involved with the family on 16 April 1996 following an allegation that D had been sexually abused by his father. D would then have been four.  There had been a joint police / social services investigation. L had been interviewed on video and there had been an audio interview with D. Neither child had made any allegations of abuse. Mr. M had been interviewed and had denied the allegations. The result was that no further action was taken. </p>

The difficulty about that proposition is that maltreatment of her is not currently put forward as a reason for preventing his contact with the children.  The reasons Mrs. M puts forward are alleged sexual and physical abuse of the children.  Since the Circuit judge who dealt with the matter more recently has effectively discounted any such proposition, it does not seem to me that I should give any weight to the initial allegations of domestic violence, and I do not do so.  </p>

His evidence had been helpful and convincing.  Accordingly the judge found, in summary, that the children were happy to see their father; that their father behaved appropriately to them; that they talked in the way one would expect.  Mr. DB had corroborated what Mr. M said namely that after an initial minute or so of difficulties, bearing in mind there had been quite a long break in the contact, they got on very well with their father and talked in an entirely sensible proper way.

He further described the children as sophisticated and well developed intellectually.  He recorded the children telling Mr. DB that they wanted to see their father.  He said they had not appeared apprehensive beforehand and everything went well.  Afterwards they said they wanted to see their father and they wanted to see their paternal grandparents.

She cried out.  He put a pillow from the sofa over her and he then hit her full force in the face.  <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">She went back upstairs, got back into bed and told her mother all about it the next morning.</span>  She went on to say - I mention this for the sake of completeness - that during 1999 on a number of occasions in which the mother was present, but not immediately present, (location identified) he beat her up and she suffered severe bruising as a result.  Now, a moment&#8217;s objective examination of this account of things will show how unlikely it is in the first place because it would involve somebody going into a room in which there were three people present, picking up a child, taking her out, taking her downstairs, abusing her, half-suffocating her, punching her, bringing her back - all the while being undetected.</p>

The passages I have highlighted are only one example of the lies which Mrs. M is prepared to tell in order to protect herself. No mother whose child is being sexually assaulted within earshot would fail to go to her assistance. Mrs. M thus has to invent an elaborate charade to explain why she did not do so. In addition, where a child is put up to tell lies, important details are overlooked. L tells the police she told her mother all about it. Had it happened, she would have done. But had it happened, and had she been told, Mrs. M would have been bound to take action. So, according to Mrs. M, L must be lying when she says she told her all about it. Of course, L is lying, but not for the reasons Mrs. M gives, which are entirely self-serving.  L is lying because what she describes did not happen. </p>

There are school reports relating to L and, most importantly, the report from The guardian.  Much of the parents&#8217; evidence is taken up by the allegation that L had been obliged to change school because in her statement made on 23 October 2001, Mrs. M said that on 6 March 2001 she had seen the children&#8217;s paternal grandparents driving around outside L&#8217;s school. This was, however, inconsistent with a letter written by her solicitors on 6 April 2001 in which it was asserted that both Mrs. M and D had seen the paternal grandparents outside D&#8217;s school. There is a statement from the paternal grandmother strongly denying that they had visited either school.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have not, of course, had oral evidence from the paternal grandparents, but the patent inconsistency in the two versions of the basic allegation makes it highly unlikely to be true. But more significant, of course (if it is true) is L&#8217;s hysterical reaction. It is, in my judgment, highly worrying that Mrs. M appears to think that it is necessary for L to change school because of a report that her paternal grandparents have been seen in the vicinity. L is not now in mainstream school. She is being educated by an organisation called Integrated<span style="font-style:italic"> Support Service. </span> She travels by taxi and apparently has a phobia about being driven by men. Despite some positive reports, I find myself most concerned about L&#8217;s education, and how she has got to where she is.  This is not a matter which I have investigated, but in my judgment is one of the worrying aspects of L&#8217;s upbringing.</p>

Mrs. M appeared quite unconcerned about what she was reporting L as saying, and went on to tell me that, so far as the dancing lessons were concerned, L was &#8220;taking the Mickey&#8221;. </p>

I can pick out some points which particularly concerned me. The first relates to D. D told The guardian that he had been &#8220;raped&#8221; by his father and his paternal grandparents. He clearly had no idea what the word meant. Mrs. M, according to the guardian, made no attempt to rationalise this with D or dissuade him from stating that he had been raped. On the contrary, she says, Mrs. M appeared to condone and encourage it.  Mrs. M was asked about this in evidence, and her answers confirmed the guardian&#8217;s evidence. She said D had been raped &#8211; he had had things done to him, He had told her in the past that he had been &#8220;taken out of his bed by his father&#8221;, who had &#8220;hurt his willy and his bum&#8221;. </p>

Dr. W was clear that the children had suffered and were continuing to suffer significant harm. He was equally clear that if the situation was not remedied, the significant harm would continue and that the children would be likely to grow up as emotionally damaged adults, with serious consequences for both of them in forming and maintaining relationships in their adult lives.  Both children had learned that the price of living in peace in their mother&#8217;s household was to say that they hated their father and to class him as an abuser. This was very unhealthy. L, in particular, as she got into adolescence will realise that she has a powerful weapon to get her own way with her mother. She will, in Dr. W&#8217;s opinion at some point rebel against her mother&#8217;s stance and is likely to search out her father. When she discovers, in Dr. W&#8217;s words that he is &#8220;an ordinary decent bloke&#8221;, her relationship with her mother is likely to be further damaged, perhaps irreparably so. He said: </p>

However, in the light of these conclusions, I am in difficulty about his recommendation that the children should remain with the mother, subject to the continuation and possible escalation of such emotional harm. In the three years since the father&#8217;s contact was unilaterally stopped the children have been subjected unchallenged to what the circuit judge described as the mother&#8217;s &#8220;pernicious influence&#8221;. They are manifesting now, in school refusal, violent ambitions, obsessive phobias and allegations of sexual abuse indications of abnormal and ungrounded thinking which, even if they do not truly believe, they are prepared to live.</span></p>

In the instant case, doing nothing will mean that the children will continue to suffer significant harm. Doing nothing could only be justified, it seems to me, by the argument that the cure (intervening in one of various ways by making an order) would cause more harm than the disease: in other words that the stress inflicted on the children by removing them from their mother&#8217;s influence or by the attempt to require them to attend contact with their father would cause them more damage than leaving them alone.

The circuit judge&#8217;s order is now 17 months old: arguably, it could be disproportionate to enforce it after this period of time. Perhaps more importantly, however, the delay which has occurred since the order was made reinforces the point that the children have been further damaged over that period, and any step which needs now to be taken must be part of a carefully planned strategy. </p>

I do not, however, in the circumstances of this case, think it would be right to take that course. These children are not in immediate physical danger: they are not in immediate need of removal to a place of safety or protection from an immediate risk of physical harm. There is no formulated care plan. It must, accordingly, be a matter for the local authority whether or not they decide to institute proceedings having read the papers (including this judgment) and carried out their investigation.  I think I can, however, properly say that if that is the local authority&#8217;s decision, I would welcome it. It would, it seems to me, substantially widen both the welfare and the implementation options open to the children and to the court, and would prove likely to be very much in their best interests. </p>

As I understood it, however, his objection was primarily based upon his scepticism about the capacity of local authorities to act effectively in cases such as this or to provide any worthwhile services for the children. I think he envisaged further delay, and an ineffectual and damaging investigation by the local authority, resulting in a further hardening of Mrs. M and the children&#8217;s position due to the threat hanging over their heads that the children might be removed.</p>

It is noteworthy that the only professional who has achieved any progress in this case is Mr. DB, the social worker from the local authority who organised the two periods of contact in the summer of 2000. He did so, it will be recalled, in the teeth of orchestrated opposition from Mrs. M.  In addition, it is difficult to see how Mrs. M&#8217;s attitude could become harder than it is already.</p>

The children should be told this was the person in whom they could confide. </p>

To give the obvious examples, the facts are that the children have not been sexually or physically abused by their father and paternal grandparents; their hostility to contact and their expressed hatred of their father are both entirely due to Mrs. M&#8217;s malign influence on them. These are not questions which can be reopened.   If Mrs. M persists in her assertions to the contrary, that is plain evidence of her refusal to recognise reality and what it is in the interests of the children.</p>

The history is set out in a&#160;long, reserved judgment which I&#160;handed down on 27th&#160;March 2002, following a hearing on 14th and 15th March 2002.  Before me on that occasion was a contact application by the children's father, Mr. M.  The children, by then, had for some time been separately represented in the proceedings by their CAFCASS guardian, and they had the benefit of representation from CAFCASS Legal.

I&#160;had deliberately reserved judgment, for two reasons.  First of all, I&#160;had formed the very clear view that the children were suffering significant harm in their mother's care and I&#160;wished the local authority to investigate the case under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref> of the Children Act, with a view to taking care proceedings relating to the children.

I&#160;deliberately tried to write it in plain English.  This was particularly important, so far as Mrs. M was concerned, because I&#160;made a number of very serious findings of fact against her and I&#160;wished her, in the investigation which was to take place by the local authority, to be very clear about the court's view.  Also, as I&#160;say in terms in the judgment, I wished to give her the opportunity to reconsider her position in the light of my judgment and in the light of the evidence given to me by the consultant psychiatrist instructed by CAFCASS Legal, Dr. W</p>

I&#160;am in no doubt at all that had Mrs. M been able to shift her position and accept the thrust of what was being said by myself, by Dr. W, by the children's guardian and, subsequently by the local authority, it might have been possible for the children to have remained in her care.  Certainly had she done so, I&#160;am reasonably confident that Mr.&#160;M - and this is no criticism of him - would have been content for the children to remain in her care, provided he was permitted to enjoy a proper relationship with them and they with him.  That is what he was seeking to achieve.</p>

I&#160;am quite satisfied that she takes no responsibility whatsoever for the significant harm suffered by the children and takes no responsibility whatsoever for the false belief which they had that they had been sexually and physically abused by their father and had also been abused by their paternal grandparents.  </p>

The result of that was the institution by the local authority of care proceedings which were immediately transferred to my court and a hearing for an&#160;interim care order took place, the purpose of which was to remove the children from their mother's care to foster parents where a&#160;full assessment of the children could be made in the absence of their mother's influence.

It may well be that the local authority could have done it in a more subtle way and it may be that the local authority is, to an extent, to be criticised for the head-on way in which it went about it but, equally, in my judgment, criticism falls very heavily on Mrs. M.  Of course, counsel for Mrs. M is entitled to say that a parent whose children are being taken away under an order of the court is unlikely, unless they are remarkable, to co-operate and facilitate; but, to my mind, Mrs. M's conduct was most unfortunate.  She brought in other members of the family and eventually directly involved the children.  She described herself as a mother fighting for her children and so unable to hand them over or help them move.  The result was that the children had to be removed by force and they were removed only after the local authority had been required to come back to the court to ask for a&#160;recovery order.  Once again, I&#160;regard that as wholly unfortunate and entirely misplaced thinking by Mrs. M; but there it is. </p>

Not surprisingly, the early stages of staying with her were very difficult.  The children absconded on 16 June 2002.  Again, I&#160;have not investigated the terms and history of that absconsion and therefore make no findings about it, but the children were returned and, once they had been returned and perhaps realised that this was for real, they settled down and the core assessment of them began.  On 4 July 202, they were re-introduced to their father.  On 11 July 2002, they were re-introduced to their paternal grandparents.</p>

There would need to be a&#160;process of rehabilitation, complicated by the fact that Mr.&#160;M would have to sell his own accommodation, which was unsuited for the children, and, in addition to which, would have to conclude proceedings for ancillary relief in the divorce proceedings with his former wife and then, he hoped, with those two sources of funds following what he argued should be a sale of the former matrimonial home in which Mrs.&#160;M lives, he would be able to purchase accommodation suitable for himself and the children, near his parents.  In the meantime, his parents would care for the children, with regular daily attendance by himself, depending on his shift work.  The children's places at their respective schools were to be maintained.  L was not in mainstream education and D would go to a secondary school next year.  It was proposed that there should be supervised contact to the children's mother and the maternal grandparents, at a contact centre.</p>

What Mrs. M says to me is that the reason she now thinks the children have not been sexually and physically abused is because they are now saying they have not been sexually and physically abused and, because they are now saying that they want to see their father, that is not only what they want but reflects the fact that they have not been sexually abused by him.</p>

Why did the children make those allegations?  Mrs. M said to me in terms that, in her mind, she bears no responsibility at all for the significant harm which the children have suffered and no responsibility at all for the fact that they alleged or believed that they had been sexually abused.  So when the early passages in my March judgment were put to her - and these were my findings which represented the factual basis upon which the case was to proceed and which were not to be altered - Mrs. M, whilst accepting that the children had become alienated from their father and grandparents, denied flatly that the responsibility for that state of affairs was anything to do with her.  She also denied flatly that she had done her best to instil in the children the false belief that they had been sexually and physically abused.  Whilst she now accepted that they had not been, she denied that it was her conduct in seeking to instil in the children the false belief that they had been abused which had caused them to suffer significant harm.  She denied that they would continue to suffer significant harm if they were in her care, and said that, now, she did not have a problem with contact to their father, were the children to resume residence with her.</p>

It may be, I&#160;do not know, that her views about Mr. M have softened.  I&#160;am sceptical about that, but what I&#160;am absolutely clear about is that she has no insight into the damage she has done her children; and no insight into the unscrupulous and manipulative way in which she induced them to believe that they had been physically and sexually abused; and caused them the sort of harm which, had it not been reversed by the previous orders, would undoubtedly in my mind have led to the children growing up as emotionally very damaged adults.  It seems to me that until Mrs. M can bring herself to recognise my findings and the findings of Dr. W, there is absolutely no prospect whatsoever of her having the residence of the children; and her contact with them, even, is going to be fraught with difficulty.</p>

As a mother, she had many good qualities and, as I&#160;made clear earlier in this judgment, had it not been for her behaviour in inculcating in the children the damaging belief systems they adopted for some years; and had she been able to allow Mr.&#160;M to enjoy a proper paternal relationship with them, these children would still be living with her.  I&#160;recognise also that I&#160;have said very harsh things about her, which it is difficult for any human being to take on board, but her incapacity to do so, to my mind - and I&#160;am going to use a&#160;technical term here - is pathological: there is something really wrong about her that she cannot take what I and others have said on board - or even begin to take it on board.  To do so will, of course, be enormously painful.  To recognise that she has damaged the children she loves, and almost irreparably damaged them - not quite, but almost - is an enormously difficult thing for a mother to do; but, as I&#160;say, unless and until she can begin to do it or even begin to do it partially, I&#160;see very little hope of restoring a&#160;meaningful relationship between her and the children, and I&#160;certainly see no hope at all of the children safely living with her, despite her protestations, now, that she does not hate her former husband and that she has no problem with contact.</p>

The difficulty is - and again I&#160;put this from an amateur point of view - that if Mrs. M goes to the children and says "I'm very sorry" and apologises to them for the events of the last three years, she is quite unable at the moment to say, "I&#160;am very sorry, it was my fault.  I got it wrong."  What she will be saying is, "I am very sorry that you think I&#160;lied to you.  But I didn't get it wrong at all.  You got it wrong.  You, the children, got it wrong.  You wrongly thought you had been abused."  That is a hopeless starting point for a proper relationship. </p>

I&#160;was pleased to see that, in the latest version of the care plan, a referral was to be made by the local authority, of the children and their mother, to the mediation service, which would help them with relationship issues.  I&#160;was told they were currently booked up until mid-January 2003, so that a referral in the New Year would be acceptable.  This service would be free for the children but may make a charge to Mrs. M, dependent on her income. </p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for Mrs. M, of course, also attacks on the other side of the coin the uncertain arrangements which Mr. M puts forward with his parents.  She invites me to view them with grave circumspection.  She points to the fact that Mr. M himself is very critical and, indeed, bitter about Mrs.&#160;M's conduct and cites examples of that.  She says he is ill-equipped to care for two difficult children aged 11 and 14 and the generational difference between the grandparents and the children is likely to present a major stumbling block.  She submits that the children are likely to feel, within a&#160;short time, highly repressed in the grandparents' household, where they have to spend some six to nine months before he is likely to be able to find accommodation of his own.  Currently, they are on their best behaviour and Mr. M and his parents have not seen them at their worst.  She also points out that he works shifts, his parents are elderly and the forthcoming period, the interregnum, will be extremely testing.  She submits that it would take only one part of the equation to collapse (either grandparent, for example, falling ill) for the whole package to fall apart.  Accordingly, she says, in those circumstances, given her client's change of stance, it is reasonably safe for me, and in the interests of the children, to return them to her.</p>

As I&#160;indicated forcefully in submissions, that issue, in my judgment, must be addressed by both the local authority and by Mrs. M.

I&#160;think the message which goes to him about that and the difficulties involved are best brought home if the order is solely to him.  I&#160;do urge him, much as he may think that this can be dealt with by common sense and by instinctive parental reactions, to recognise that it will be very difficult and, therefore, it is essential that he co-operates with the local authority and the work being done at the Centre. </p>

Equally, although I&#160;technically have jurisdiction to keep the guardian in for the duration of the supervision order, I&#160;do not think this is a case in which it is appropriate for me to do so, so the guardian will go as soon as the interim care order is discharged. I express my gratitude both to counsel and to all those professionally involved in the case, for the great care which they have given to it.</p>
