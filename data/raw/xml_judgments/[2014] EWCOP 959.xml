When pressed by me as to the purpose of that exercise, Miss Davidson advised me that this was so that a representative of the local authority could meet with G to establish whether this is really and truly what she wanted to do.  When pressed further, the London Borough of Redbridge indicated it may well (it seemed to me would almost inevitably) want to obtain a capacity assessment to evaluate G's capacity to communicate with the press in those circumstances.  When pressed further still, the London Borough of Redbridge indicated if G&#8217;s capacity to decide on this issue was in question it may want to bring the matter back before the court (within the 48 hours) for a &#8216;best interests&#8217; decision in the event that such an arrangement (i.e. for G to meet the press) had indeed been made.</span></p>

He opposed any restriction being placed on the freedom of the press to interview G.  Ms Hewson, on behalf of C, also opposed any order being made today which imposed any restriction on G's freedom to speak to the press, emphasising powerfully G's right to freedom of speech.</span></p>

After an adjournment for parties to take instructions, the London Borough of Redbridge indicated that it accepted this approach and refined its position to seeking an adjournment of today's application in order to commission a further issue-specific capacity assessment by Dr. Barker.

Until the court can take a clearer view about G&#8217;s capacity to make such relationships with the press it is, in my judgment, clearly in G's best interests that I should make an interim order that she should not make such communications.  It follows that the injunctive order sought by the London Borough of Redbridge, shall be granted (in paragraph 3 of the draft order as earlier recited) until 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> May.</span></p>

The London Borough of Redbridge invites me to direct that C and F shall facilitate visits to G by one of their employees twice weekly.

Importantly, G herself spoke directly to the court on this issue.

I wish to make clear that there is no evidence whatsoever but that the home is well-maintained, comfortable, and that G has adequate food and nutrition.  But, as I have indicated in my judgment (and as is clear from the judgment of Russell J), there is considerable scope for the view that C, and to a lesser extent F, are not just failing to meet G's needs but are actually abusing her within her home.  C and F, it should be noted, strenuously deny this.  Monitoring in those circumstances in the interim period is, in my judgment, vital.  I do not believe that the neighbourhood team proposed by Ms Hewson would adequately or appropriately discharge the function of monitoring as I envisage it should be delivered.
