	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this case is a very sad one.  In October 2020 S&#8217;s older brother, O, aged just five weeks, died in the night from unknown causes, otherwise known as a Sudden Unexplained Death in Infancy (SUDI).  There is a possibility of overlaying, but this would not be anything other than a tragic accident.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A post mortem examination revealed that O had metaphyseal fractures to the medial and lateral aspect of the left distal tibia. At first it was thought that these could have been caused either post mortem or during the delivery. There was an investigation which concluded that, subject to the results of the forensic post mortem, there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding O&#8217;s death.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The full results of the post mortem took a very long time to be obtained (this is undoubtedly the result of a shortage of experts which has been the subject of comment by other judges including the President of the Family Division). No cause of death was found, but Professor Mangham, Consultant Osteoarticular Pathologist confirmed the presence of the metaphyseal fractures. He dated them, however, as having occurred between 2 and 5 days before O died which meant that they could not have occurred during the birth or after he had died. This meant that they occurred in the care of the parents (or one of them).</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once the dating of the fractures was identified the parents were interviewed by the police. This was in March 2022, eighteen months after O had died. As a consequence these proceedings were commenced at S&#8217;s birth.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Proceedings would not have been brought in this case were it not for the dating of the fractures as identified by Professor Mangham. At first the local authority and Guardian considered whether the proceedings should include an investigation as to whether O&#8217;s death had been caused by one other of his parents. After careful assessment of the post mortem, the outcome of the hospital investigation and other evidence they concluded that it should not, a stance approved by the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Rylance, Consultant Paediatrician was appointed to provide a report as to the aetiology and mechanism of the fractures, and O&#8217;s likely response.  The parents have filed statements.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority seeks findings that O suffered the fractures as found by Professor Mangham, and that they were caused by the use of force considerably in excess of normal handling. It is alleged that this would have been recognised as being unreasonable by a carer, and as highly likely to cause distress and injury to a baby.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents are the only possible perpetrators and the local authority does not suggest it is possible to identify either of them as the perpetrator on the balance of probabilities. It does not seek findings (nor would such be justified on the evidence) that there has been any failure to protect by the non-perpetrator or any failure to seek medical attention for O.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s case is that it would intend to work with the family whatever the outcome of this exercise, and to start to stand down the level of supervision of this family. Currently there are social workers in the family home supervising the care of B and S 24 hours a day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both parents deny using excessive force in their care of O, or apart from one incident recounted by the mother, of being aware of any incident in which this could have happened.  In her written evidence the mother recalled an incident when she put O into his chair swing and, as she described it, his leg &#8216;caught the metal bar&#8217; and his leg flopped under him.  She said that he cried after this but was soothed quickly.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Guardian adopted a neutral stance. There was some criticism of the approach she had taken during these proceedings, criticism I do not share. The guardian&#8217;s job is different to that of the social workers and for my part I think it important that the Guardian scrutinises the way in which the local authority frames the case, as well as having an independent oversight of welfare matters.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I will not set out the law in detail in this short judgment.  The burden of proof is on the local authority. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities.  I must have regard to the relevance of each piece of the evidence to the other evidence and to exercise an overview of the totality of what I have heard and read in order to come to a conclusion as to whether the case has been made out.  The role of the court and the expert are distinct, and I must weigh up the expert evidence together with everything else.  I must guard against a belief that it is always possible to identify the cause of an injury to a child. Some things remain unknown.</p>

If it is not, then I must ask myself whether there is a likelihood or real possibility of each of those individuals having been the perpetrator.</p>

I think it is fair to say that the author did observe some tensions in the family dynamic, and she was also concerned about the relationship between the father and B, his stepdaughter.  She felt that B was invisible to him and recommended that the case needed to be reviewed not just from S&#8217;s perspective but also from B&#8217;s. She felt that B&#8217;s needs have been overlooked.  As to the tensions between the parents, the assessor considered that they demonstrated a fragility in their relationship with different parenting styles and assumed gender roles which they had not communicated between them.  She recommended that they receive direct support and modelling to understand what it means to be in rhythm and tune with S as the mother has a somewhat &#8216;romantic&#8217; view of being a parent and the father&#8217;s approach is somewhat simplistic.</p>

This means that the parents have been observed constantly with the children for a period of about six months.  The observations have been almost uniformly positive.  Despite the stress that must come with having people living and observing in the family home all the time there has never been an occasion when anyone has expressed any concern that either of the parents were rough or impatient with either S or B.   Indeed there is no evidence of any anger or aggression involving either parent or the children at all.  The height of any problems are as identified by the parenting assessment.  There was an anonymous allegation made in February 2021 but these were not supported by independent evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical evidence in the case is clear and unequivocal, namely that metaphyseal fractures such as this do not occur in normal or even over exuberant/rough handling.  Someone who was responsible for causing the fracture must or ought to have been aware that they had mishandled O, even if they did not realise he had suffered a fracture. Therefore in most cases where a fracture is discovered the absence of a contemporaneous explanation or an inadequate explanation from a parent is very telling and suggests that they have behaved in a way they wish to conceal. This is not to reverse the burden of proof but simple common sense.  Fractures do not happen in the ordinary course of events and in the case of a non-mobile baby somebody (in this case one of the parents) must have been aware of the event at the time.</p>

Of course memorable events do stay in the mind, but a brief event causing a metaphyseal fracture which did not apparently lead to any worrying symptoms thereafter might not be a memorable event in the light of the terrible shock of O&#8217;s death very shortly afterwards.   It is clear from Dr. Rylance&#8217;s evidence that what I am being asked to consider is a very brief, one off, event when excessive force was used, whether this was by someone pulling and twisting O&#8217;s leg by hand in a moment of frustration or by pulling O thoughtlessly or impatiently out of a chair or swing in a way that causing his foot to be bent and twisted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There will be cases where there is no advantage in proceeding with a fact-finding hearing, as demonstrated by the decision of Lieven J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Derbyshire County Council v AA and others </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2022/3404" uk:canonical="[2022] EWHC 3404 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWHC 3404 (Fam)</ref>.</span>  Each case will very much depend on its own facts. In this case, the matter was already listed for hearing only a few days after the application to vacate was made, with the expert witness booked to attend and counsel instructed.  Some resources might have been saved had the case been taken out at the last minute, but in the overall scheme of things and the resources expended to date I did not consider that an overriding factor. I was also acutely aware of the stress of these proceedings upon the parents, but there was not long to wait for the outcome.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cases where a child has suffered a single injury are worrying, because a single injury may be the harbinger of something much more serious, even in a case where there are no other outward features of anger, ill treatment or neglect.  Decisions such as have been made in this case are difficult, and not risk free. In this case, whilst the threshold has not been met there are some findings about that original injury, even if of a one off episode at the lower end of the scale of force. This will enable everyone to move on and work from here on the basis of the child in need plan.  I hope that this family will now be able to look ahead to a different phase of their lives, as S and B grow up alongside the memories of O.  They will need the assistance of the local authority as they do this, as they have all suffered considerable trauma over the last few years. I wish them the very best.</p>
