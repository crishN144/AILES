On 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> February 2022, KT was undergoing dialysis for end-stage kidney failure when he suffered a large left-parietal intracranial haemorrhage. Sadly, despite undergoing emergency surgery, KT was left with significant brain damage. He has remained an inpatient at a specialist neurosurgical unit where he receives life-sustaining treatment, including haemodialysis and Clinically Assisted Nutrition and Hydration (CANH).</span></p>

The compelling medical consensus establishes that he has no awareness and no scope for rehabilitation. He may have vestigial capacity to experience discomfort and distress and, at least theoretically, some ability to be soothed by his environment. It must be emphasised that this does not equate to awareness. As well as chronic Stage 5 kidney failure, KT also has co-morbidities, namely, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy, and hypertension. His life expectancy is now very limited. The primary pathology, as Mr Sachdeva KC, who appears on behalf of the Trust, has properly emphasised, is KT&#8217;s renal failure. As I have said, he is dependent on haemodialysis three times a week to keep him alive. However, safely dialysing him has become increasingly challenging as his blood pressure tends to drop during dialysis, carrying a risk of yet further brain injury, cardiac arrest, or heart attack. The Trust seek a declaration that it is lawful to receive palliative care only. Should this course of action be followed, it is likely KT would die in consequence of renal failure within two weeks.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">KT&#8217;s wife, JO, and his sister, GT, oppose the Trust&#8217;s application. Their opposition is shared widely within family, some of whom have joined this hybrid hearing from Canada and Nigeria. They are a family of strong Pentecostal Christian faith. They have a fundamentalist belief, both in the power of prayer and in the potential for miracles.  This extends to a confidence in the power of God to cure the sick, however parlous their circumstances may be. Prior to his diagnosis with kidney failure in 2017, KT was a pastor in the Netherlands. He had always been an active member of the Church. There are recordings of some of his sermons. I have watched them, at the family&#8217;s request, and read the transcripts. I had been told that he was a very highly regarded and popular preacher. Before seeing the videos, I had only seen photographs of KT in hospital in his highly compromised circumstances. The contrast is very stark. In the videos, I saw KT as the man who he had been. He was charismatic, gentle, and manifestly committed to his Pentecostal beliefs. In his role as Pastor, he was inevitably proselytising his faith. I emphasise this because it is a clear marker of the depth of his convictions. KT&#8217;s family feel that his faith was such that he would want his life to be sustained for as long as possible, in whatever circumstances and whatever the challenges. While they do not proactively dispute the clinical evidence as to prognosis, the family feel he has a greater level of consciousness or awareness than that described by the Trust. It must be said, however, that their foundation for this view, though instinctive, is on their own account, somewhat limited. They instinctively feel that KT is aware of their presence when they visit him in hospital and say they have, on occasion, observed meaningful signs of responsiveness from him, including his eyes following their movements and his hands shaking, they believe in response to music.</span></p>

There will be a limited number of cases where treatment is futile, overly burdensome to the patient or where there is no prospect of recovery. In circumstances such as these, it may be that an assessment of best interests leads to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the patient to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, even if this may result in the person's death. The decision-maker must make a decision based on the best interests of the person who lacks capacity. They must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person's death for whatever reason, even if this is from a sense of compassion. Healthcare and social care staff should also refer to relevant professional guidance when making decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment.</span></p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221; </span></p>

Dr A explains that successfully dialysing KT has become increasingly challenging as his blood pressure now has a tendency to become low during dialysis. This is likely due to a weakening of his heart functioning, which is a recognised problem for patients on long-term dialysis, especially when they also have a long-standing complications of high blood pressure or diabetes. A sudden drop in blood pressure carries a risk of causing further brain injury, heart attack or cardiac arrest, so it is necessary to modify the dialysis by suspending the fluid drainage while continuing to drain the waste product. This has, from time to time, resulted in KT experiencing fluid retention or intermittent swelling. Dr A explains that it is likely that at some stage later this year, the Trust will be unable to successfully complete dialysis for KT due to his blood pressure becoming too low, leading to fluid accumulation. This will cause KT to experience significant swelling which may become uncomfortable for him. It could also lead to fluid in his lungs, causing breathlessness and discomfort. The risks of dialysis for KT are such that in Dr A&#8217;s opinion, if treatment were to continue, it is highly likely that at some point between now and March 2024, a complication will occur during dialysis which will result, dramatically, in his death.</span></p>

He would rather suffer and hold out for the will of God. He, I accept, was a strong anti-abortionist and strongly opposed to a lay version of euthanasia. This reinforces his likely attitude to his present circumstances. He was, I find, a man who lived his life by the Pentecostal sword and most likely would have wanted to die by that same sword i.e., in accordance with his Pentecostal beliefs. Though neither the Official Solicitor nor the Trust shares my assessment of this, I have, I confess, had little difficulty in arriving at this conclusion. Though he may never have had the conversation about end of life with any of those who have spoken with me, the code by which he lived his life is pellucidly clear and, in my judgement, reflected by his family. </span></p>

On this point, on the framework of the law, there is agreement amongst the advocates. The weight to be afforded to perceived wishes and feelings, varies from individual to individual. Mr Sachdeva has provided a convenient summary of the law which is both helpful and uncontentious and I can adopt it. I have found that KT would have wanted continued life-sustaining treatment, even in the face of a coma with a terminal diagnosis of chronic kidney disease stage 5. It is plain from examining the terms of the Mental Capacity Act that the weight to be placed on any particular factor is a question for the court. </span></p>

The beliefs and values which would be likely to influence P&#8217;s decision, if he had capacity to make the relevant decision, are a relevant factor: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 4(6)</ref>(b) says so.

Accordingly, the balance sheet of factors which P would draw up, if he had capacity to make the decision, is a relevant factor for the court&#8217;s decision. Further, in most cases the court will be able to determine what decision it is likely that P would have made, if he had capacity. In such a case, in my judgment, P&#8217;s balance sheet of factors and P&#8217;s likely decision can be taken into account by the court. This involves an element of substituted judgment being taken into account, together with anything else which is relevant. However, it is absolutely clear that the ultimate test for the court is the test of best interests and not the test of substituted judgment. Nonetheless, the substituted judgment can be relevant and is not excluded from consideration. As Hoffmann LJ said in the Bland case, the substituted judgment can be subsumed within the concept of best interests. That appeared to be the view of the Law Commission also.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Integral to the plan, if treatment were to continue, is that KT should be brought to the hospital three times per week to receive haemodialysis whilst he is in a prolonged and profound disorder of consciousness and dying from end-stage renal failure. The process would last three to four hours on each occasion. Dialysis can achieve nothing; it is both burdensome and futile. The mechanics of the plan put him at real risk on every journey. Even if he were to weather this discomfort for a few months longer, his progressive cerebral atrophy might so compromise his swallowing and breathing to make the plan, ultimately, grotesque to his dignity as a human being. It would require those caring for him, in my judgement, to cause harm without delivering benefit. It would inevitably cause the treating clinicians, nurses and carers, great distress. It would be wrong to expect them to absorb such a level of distress and to act in a way that would inevitably become contrary to their own principles. I have heard sufficient of KT to know that he would be the last person to want to impose such a burden on anybody else. Robust and uncompromising though his beliefs have undoubtedly been, it is plain from all I have heard and read that he was both a kind and gentle man. </p>

I can tell KT, that everything possible had been done. I do, however, think that the family would want to say their goodbyes directly to KT and that he too, had he contemplated such a situation, would want that. Family was plainly important to him. Accordingly, I have concluded that to enable the family to arrange flights, I can properly, and in KT&#8217;s best interests, yield to their alternative suggestion, made by Ms Gardner, Counsel for GT, that the order can be extended to 21 days from today&#8217;s date. I signal that I do not consider it would be appropriate to go beyond this period and I indicate that I do not anticipate receiving any such application. </p>
