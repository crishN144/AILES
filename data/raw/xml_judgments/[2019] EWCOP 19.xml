	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">This is an application by Manchester University NHS Trust for a declaration that DE lacks capacity to conduct proceedings, and to consent to treatment on her left leg, and that  it is lawful and in DE&#8217;s best interests for her to be given blood products if it becomes clinically necessary during an operation on her left leg. This application came before me on an urgent basis during the vacation. I heard Mr Wenman Smith of counsel for the Applicant, and Mr Hallin of counsel instructed by the Official Solicitor on behalf of DE over the telephone. As I explain in more detail below I adjourned the hearing overnight so that the OS&#8217;s representative Mr Beck could visit DE and discuss the operation with her. I then made the order the next morning, the OS consenting to my doing so. I am now giving my written judgment some time later.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">During the hearing I heard oral evidence from Mr Wheelton, the consultant orthopaedic surgeon and Dr Chernik who had carried out the capacity assessment. I was told at the hearing that DE&#8217;s Mother (KE) had said that she did not wish to join in on the telephone hearing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">The background to this matter is that DE is a 49 year old woman who suffers from autism and mild learning difficulties. Mr Wheelton said that she functioned on a fairly high level and I believe that she lives independently, with some level of support. DE and her mother are Jehovah&#8217;s witnesses, and I will set out below in more detail the evidence in respect of DE&#8217;s religious observance and the strength of her beliefs. The application was made because the Trust was concerned that as a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness DE&#8217;s religious beliefs would mean that she would not wish to have blood products, but she did not have capacity to consent.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">On 11 April 2019 DE had an accident by falling down the stairs of a bus. She suffered a serious break to her left femur and tibia. She was admitted to the Applicant&#8217;s hospital. The medical evidence is that she requires surgical fixation of the femur and possibly the tibia. This will involve an operation cutting into her skin and applying a plate and screw to the bones. There is a risk that during the operation DE will require blood transfusion or blood products, I will below refer to these interchangeably as which it is makes no difference to the issues in the case. According to Mr Wheelton the risk of blood products being needed is difficult to quantify but something in the region of a 50% likelihood. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">If DE did not have the operation at all then her mobility would be impaired and potentially seriously impaired.

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Wheelton gave evidence that the operation was urgent, with a window of opportunity of about two weeks before the bone started to reform and therefore the effectiveness of the operation being reduced. He said that if the operation was delayed it became more complex and potentially less successful, he also said that a delay would increase the likelihood of DE needing a transfusion. The evidence was quite clear that the sooner the operation was carried out the better, both in terms of reducing risks of serious consequences but also for the long-term success of the operation.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">The other factor in respect of urgency was that the specialist orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital was available to do the operation over the weekend (the hearing was on Thursday). However he was not available after Monday, and therefore either the operation would have to be carried out by someone with less specialism or it would have to wait for another week. Mr Wheelton explained that this was quite a complex fracture </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Wheelton also gave evidence on alternatives to a blood transfusion. He explained that there were alternatives if there was initial blood loss, however if these were ineffective then a blood transfusion could become necessary and extremely urgent. Ultimately if DE did need a transfusion during the operation, and she did not receive one, then she could die through the loss of blood.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">During the period of her admission to hospital two capacity assessments have been carried out. On 13 April Dr Chernick spoke to DE and assessed her capacity. His evidence was that she told him she was a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness and that they do not have blood transfusions.  She understood that her leg was broken and that she needed surgery. She said that she wanted surgery and she wanted to go home. However, she did not appear to understand that she might need a blood transfusion and that she could die if it was clinically necessary and she did not have one. Dr Chernick&#8217;s view was that she could not process the information that she was given. He concluded that DE did not have capacity to decide whether or not to have a blood transfusion.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">Dr Chernik&#8217;s oral evidence slightly expanded what is set out above. He said that he had met DE initially with her mother and brother and then on her own. She was quite tearful when with the family members, but he had an easier conversation when she was on her own. He was clear that she was not impeded in her understanding by the medication she was on. She had told him proudly that she was a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness, and that they did not have blood transfusions. When he explained to her that she had a broken leg and might need a transfusion she did not appear to understand that she might need a transfusion. He said to me that he did not think she could link the need for the operation with the potential for needing a transfusion. He concluded that she did not have capacity to decide whether or not to have a transfusion if clinically needed.  </p>

Dr Chernik told me that KE had told him DE would not accept blood products.  </p>

She attends services, but her mother described her as not being a practising Jehovah&#8217;s Witness. She can recite the scriptures, but I got no sense of the degree to which she understood them or believed them or the degree to which they played an important part in her life. </p>

The OS&#8217;s position at the hearing was that DE was a woman who had practised her faith for many years and that she had said she did not want a blood transfusion. The OS questioned the level of the urgency for the operation, and suggested that DE&#8217;s wishes and feelings needed to be further investigated. After some discussion towards the end of the oral hearing I agreed to adjourn my decision overnight in order to give Mr Beck time to visit DE. I am extremely grateful to Mr Beck for his efforts on DE&#8217;s behalf, and making the time to visit her in the evening. </p>

His attendance note records that DE said that she was a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness but made it very clear that she wanted the operation to happen as soon as possible. She could not explain why blood transfusions were prohibited under the religion, and the evidence is clear that she herself was not too concerned about having a transfusion.  </p>

B was a 73year-old man with a severely infected leg, without an amputation the inevitable outcome would be that he would shortly die. B had schizoaffective disorder and strongly objected to undergoing the operation. Peter Jackson J found at [34] that B did not have capacity and said that he did not understand the reality of his injury and thought he would get better with proper care. B was having auditory hallucinations and he had said that the Lord did not want him to have his leg amputated. </p>

The Official Solicitor had argued that weight should be given to B&#8217;s wishes and feelings, and value given to his religious beliefs. The Judge found that it would not be in B&#8217;s best interests to force him to have the operation against his wishes [45]. The reason for this conclusion was that B&#8217;s religious beliefs were deeply meaningful to him, and that to force him to have the operation would be to take away his little independence and dignity to replace it with a future he had little appetite for [45]. B had said that he was not afraid of dying.  </p>

I accept Dr Chernick&#8217;s evidence that DE does not have capacity in these regards. It appears from the evidence that although she understands that she needs an operation she cannot understand that one possible consequence of the operation may be that she needs a transfusion, and that if she does not have the transfusion she would die. The evidence clearly suggests that DE cannot retain, use and weigh the information that she is being given about the consequences of refusing a transfusion. This is not an example of somebody making a poor decision, but of not understanding the decision that she is making. </p>

However, the evidence even at the oral hearing was that although DE described herself as a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness she was not someone for whom those beliefs were central to her personality or sense of identity. During the oral hearing I did not get any sense that she would feel deeply upset if an order was made in the form sought, or that she would feel a deep conflict with her religious beliefs. As such she was someone who was in a quite different decision from B in Jackson J&#8217;s decision, where his religious beliefs were fundamental to B&#8217;s sense of who he was. The other stark contrast with that case is that DE had been completely clear that she did not want to die. She is also significantly younger than was B. </p>

It appeared from that visit that DE was not strongly identifying herself with the beliefs of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, and indeed her mother supported the operation going ahead. In those circumstances I have no hesitation in finding that it in DE&#8217;s best interests to have the operation.  </p>
