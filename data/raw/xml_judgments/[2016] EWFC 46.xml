	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This very sad case concerns a little girl, whom I shall refer to as M. She has 8 siblings &#8211; 7 brothers and one sister &#8211; all of whom were subject of care proceedings following allegations of physical abuse perpetrated by their parents on the older children, and sexual abuse by the 2 oldest boys on M&#8217;s sister, Z. After a contested fact-finding hearing, I concluded that the allegations were proved and after further assessments I made orders the effect of which is that all 8 children are now living away from the family home. The eldest boy is serving a custodial sentence following conviction at the Crown Court of sexual offences against Z. The second boy is living in a residential unit under the terms of a community order imposed following his conviction of one offence against Z. The younger 6 children are living in various foster homes under care orders in favour of the local authority. There is contact between the siblings and parents and between most of the siblings themselves.</p>

The parents plainly ought to have exercised much greater vigilance. Much is made of the small size of the family home. In such circumstances, a reasonable parent would have been aware that such abuse was taking place or at risk of taking placed and taken steps to prevent it. Furthermore in the mother&#8217;s case, I find that she knew that Z had blood on her knickers. That ought to have alerted her to the possibility that the child was being abused. Yet she failed to take any action. In my view the evidence is insufficient to lead the court to reach the conclusion sought by the local authority that these parents knew that their daughter was being sexually abused. On balance, however, I find that they ought to have known and ought to have taken steps to stop it happening. To that extent, I conclude that they have failed to protect their daughter from abuse.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">&#8230; the parents were unsatisfactory witnesses. I take into account their circumstances and their cultural background. I recognise that answering questions in court, especially on such sensitive matters about the treatment of their own children, must have been a difficult experience for them. Nonetheless, I found both parents to be evasive and unreliable witnesses. In closing submissions, Miss Cook [leading counsel for the local authority in those proceedings] characterised their attitude at times like &#8216;almost a blind and irrational denial&#8217;. In each case, I conclude that, for one reason or another, the parents are concealing information, both to the allegations of physical abuse and over-chastisement and the allegations concerning sexual behaviour within the home. The mother retreated into saying that the allegations were not possible and that, as she did not see it, so it could not have happened. She also reiterated on several occasions that she had told the children &#8216;boys don&#8217;t touch girls&#8217; bits and girls don&#8217;t touch boys&#8217; bits&#8217;. </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">The father, who gave his oral evidence with the occasional assistance of an interpreter, introduced for the first time a complex conspiracy theory to explain the children&#8217;s allegations. He alleged that they had been encouraged to make the allegations by the social worker and Mrs X [the family member with whom Z was living and to whom she made the initial allegations of sexual abuse]. At one point, he suggested that the social worker and SB&#8217;s girlfriend, were related, apparently simply on the basis that the share the same (very common) surname. He seemed to find it difficult to acknowledge that the older children would have the capacity to think independently. The father alleged that social services had manipulated the thoughts of all the children, older and younger. Asked why SB was saying what he was saying, the father said that it was because he was still a child. As for the sexual allegations, the father&#8217;s explanation in oral evidence was that they had been concocted by Mrs X and the social worker SC. Mrs X had for some reason unclear to me sought revenge against SB. The social worker SC had, according to the father, been against him from the start, and had therefore fabricated the allegations. He said that the social worker had told the foster carers to lie about what had been said to the children. He said SC had done these things to make money and because she enjoys it. &#8230;&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the fact-finding hearing, as recorded in detail in the second judgment, various assessments were carried out. Evidence put before the court demonstrated that all of the children were very damaged and needed empathic and restorative parenting. An assessment by Phoenix Forensic Consultants concluded that both parents were able to offer appropriate care for the children if they were able to engage in some educational work and intervention. The Phoenix assessor gave oral evidence at the final hearing and I also had extensive written and oral evidence from the parents themselves. As summarised in the second judgment, I detected some shift in the parents&#8217; position as to whether any abuse had taken place. Having considered all the evidence, however, I reached the following conclusion:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;84 <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I acknowledge that each parent said at different stages in the oral evidence that they accepted that Z had been sexually abused by her older brothers. These assertions must be assessed, however, in the context of their earlier statements, both in writing and orally, and of their dealings with the social workers and other professionals, and having regard to the conclusions I drew about their evidence in my earlier judgment as quoted above, namely that they were evasive and unreliable witnesses who had concealed information from the court. In all these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the parents&#8217; limited acknowledgment in their oral evidence represents their true opinions and feelings. The father&#8217;s explanation for the reason why he has now, very late in the day, accepted Z&#8217;s allegations &#8211; mainly, that she repeated them to an &#8220;independent&#8221; person, namely her new carer &#8211; was totally unconvincing and implausible. It may be that at some level they recognise that, without acknowledging the truth of Z&#8217;s allegations, it is unlikely that they will be allowed to resume care of their children. That recognition in itself represents some progress, but only to a very limited degree. Both the mother and father are to my mind a very long way from genuinely accepting that the allegations are true. They have not begun to understand the extent of the physical and emotional harm suffered by Z, or the seriousness of the conduct of SB and SM, nor in my judgment have they begun to realise the extent of their failure to protect the children and the harm that has thereby resulted. The father&#8217;s assertion in evidence that any sexualised behaviour demonstrated by his children was caused by the corrupt society in which they now live, and not through any fault on his part, shows the extent of his lack of awareness of his responsibility for what has occurred. In her final analysis, the guardian concluded that the mother and father are unable to take any responsibility for their actions, but, rather, apportion blame to others or minimise the concerns. I agree. Nothing I have heard in the course of this hearing has caused me to question this assessment. </span></p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">Furthermore, it is clear from their written and oral evidence, and from their statements at earlier stages in the proceedings and to the Phoenix assessors, that they do not accept the extent of my findings concerning physical abuse, nor understand the degree to which their failure to manage the behaviour of the children, and their excessive use of physical chastisement, has damaged the children. The father&#8217;s acknowledgement to Mr. Lowe [the Phoenix assessor] that the incident involving SB in the middle of the night involved him fighting with himself rather than his son may well present the start of a process of understanding, but it is no more than a start. The parents have a long way to go before they truly accept and understand the extent of the physical abuse they perpetrated in this case.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">In my judgment, the Phoenix assessment significantly underestimated the extent of the change required in these parents and was manifestly over-optimistic as to the capacity for change and the timescales it would take to achieve the degree of change necessary for these children to return safely home. It is possible that over time the parents may come to accept my findings, and develop an understanding of the degree of harm they caused to the children, and achieve the changes necessary in their parenting. It may be that, with professional help and guidance, they may learn new skills as parents so that they can protect their children from sexual abuse, and manage the behaviour of their children as they get older and face the challenges of growing up in modern society. In my judgment, however, it is likely to take a very considerable amount of time and hard work to achieve these changes.&#8221;</p>

In respect of these two little boys, the local authority plan was for adoption but I concluded, for reasons set out in paragraphs 106 to  115, that the children should instead be placed in long-term foster care, and therefore refused the local authority&#8217;s application for placement orders under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>. </p>

At the conclusion of the Orchard House placement, the assessors recommended that M should not remain with her parents but be placed permanently outside the family. The local authority therefore indicated that they proposed to remove M from her parents immediately once the family left Orchard House. At an urgent telephone hearing on 12 July, I therefore directed a further interim care hearing on 19 July. At the same phone hearing, however, I indicated my preliminary view that M should not be immediately removed from her parents&#8217; care pending the final hearing listed in September. At the hearing on 19 July, the local authority indicated its agreement to M remaining with her parents until the final hearing, and the interim care order continued on that basis.

In assessing the evidence of the parents, as with any other witness, the court must bear in mind their personal characteristics, including their cultural, social and religious circumstances. The court must be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons and the fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything. While appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the other evidence.

In making this decision, I bear in mind the rights of the parents and the children to respect for family life. It is axiomatic that the court will only authorise the removal of a child from the care of his or her parents when satisfied that this is the only way in which their welfare needs can be met. In addition, a court can only make a placement order if, in the case of each parent, the court is satisfied (a) that the parent has consented to the child being placed for adoption with any prospective adopters who may be chosen by the local authority and has not withdrawn the consent or (b) that the parent&#8217;s consent should be dispensed with: ACA s.21. The court cannot dispense with the parent&#8217;s consent unless satisfied that the parent cannot be found lacks capacity to give consent or alternatively that the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with: ACA s.52(1). </p>

She received a high level of emotional warmth and showed positive attachment behaviour towards both parents. The parents demonstrated that they were able to parent together and remained calm and focused on M who benefited from their calm and consistent care throughout the assessment.

To that end, the mother and father attended 10 sessions to explore their understandings of the concerns about the older children. During the sessions, the parents presented as concerned about their children&#8217;s welfare. They acknowledged that they had used physical chastisement, but not that there had been significant harm caused to any of the children as a result. There was further evidence that the parents, in particular the father, thought that there had been a &#8220;conspiracy" and that the professionals had not acted appropriately. The parents reported physically chastising the children by &#8220;a tap on the bottom&#8221;, &#8220;a clip on the ear&#8221; and &#8220;a tap on the hand". Ms Wilson concluded that none of the punishments disclosed by the parents during the assessment reflected the experiences of the children.

They continued to assert, as they had done throughout the previous proceedings, that there had been no opportunity for the older brothers to sexually abuse Z. They reported that the children did not go upstairs unsupervised save to go to sleep. The mother continued to dispute that she had seen any blood on Z&#8217;s underwear. In the sessions in which the Brook traffic lights tool was used, the assessors explained the concept, namely that some behaviours, categorised as &#8220;green&#8221;, were normal and healthy, whereas others, categorised as &#8220;amber&#8221; or &#8220;red" were unsafe and dangerous. The parents were very clear that they had not observed any of the &#8220;green&#8221; behaviour in any of the children, for example normal curiosity about human bodies. The mother told the assessors that she wanted to find out what they had done wrong and wanted to &#8220;make sure it never happens again&#8221;. The father&#8217;s response, on the other hand, was less clear and more conflicted. As the discussion progressed, it became clear that he remained conflicted about the older children and their experiences and that he has found it difficult to demonstrate an understanding of the abuse his daughter experienced, and that his sons abused her. Both parents said that it was "hard to believe&#8221; what they did not see, although the mother said that, despite this, she believed her daughter. In the last session, the father stated that M was &#8220;his priority&#8221; and, when asked how he would keep her safe, stated that he would protect her above his sons.</p>

They stated in their different ways that they believed that Z had been abused but appeared to Ms Wilson to have moved to a position of acknowledging that she was abused without really understanding how and why this happened. Ms Wilson was concerned, however, about the disparity in their various statements about this issue, which suggested that, despite their verbal acknowledgement, they were unable to fully internalise the information that Z had been sexually abused by the older boys. Ms Wilson observed that it was very difficult to match the parents&#8217; assertion that the children were supervised at all times with the evidence that Z was sexually abused without her parents&#8217; knowledge.</p>

She therefore concluded that, in the light of the very significant harm the children in their care experienced, and their continued inability to recognise this, M would be at risk of harm if she remained in her parents&#8217; care.

Ms Wilson says that it is crucial that the parents should own and accept responsibility for what happened. For parenting to change, there has to be some acknowledgement, but there was no such acknowledgement in this case &#8211; in Ms Wilson&#8217;s words, &#8220;it&#8217;s like it never happened". She was unable to go any further in exploring how the sexual abuse had occurred. The parents maintained that there had been no opportunity for the boys to be alone with their sister. It was their case that the level of supervision of the children had been very high and there had been no occasion when the older boys would have been alone with Z.</p>

During the assessment, the parents had presented a consistent narrative &#8211; that they had had problems with SB, that they had therefore involved the local authority and that everything that has happened with the children was attributable to that involvement. In her report, Ms Wilson had used the word &#8220;collusive&#8221; to describe the parents' joint behaviour.

This was, however, inconsistent with the specific physical chastisement which she claimed to have administered. As to sexual abuse, Ms Wilson thought that the parents have an intellectual understanding of the risk of abuse from strangers and the need to keep the children safe, but although they were able to give good answers to questions, she remained concerned that they would be unable to transfer that into day-to-day care. Cross-examined by Miss Howe, Ms Wilson accepted that it would be open to the court to restrict contact between M and the boys, but emphasised that, without understanding the stresses which had led to the abuse occurring in the family, it was not possible to progress forward. It was not tenable to put in work without evidence of any understanding of the need for change. Professionals would be unable to rely upon the parents' self-reporting if the parents do not accept the risk or are not aware of when their parenting is harmful.</p>

My concerns is that the parents&#8217; narrative about how the behaviour was triggered&#8230;is not consistent with the findings made, or the reports of the children. This means that it is not possible for me to establish a clear picture of how such a behaviour might have occurred historically, under what circumstances it might be repeated in the future, or how arrangement/interventions might be arranged to minimize the risk. In essence, the parents&#8217; narrative renders the risk unquantifiable, beyond my conclusion that it is present by virtue of the historical behaviour.&#8221;</p>

The father pointed out that the findings in the family court had been made on the balance of probabilities and that the court should not have made findings if it was only &#8220;probable&#8221;. When Dr Tantam pointed out that SB had been found guilty in the Crown Court, and that the standard of proof for conviction was the criminal standard, the father retorted, &#8220;you have to understand the racism in this country. I have seen it, the jury were racist, a white jury will always a convict a black man.&#8221; He told Dr Tantam that he had analysed all the evidence and believed that the allegations had been made in order to remove SB from the family home so that he could be part of a drugs gang into which he had been recruited. </p>

In oral evidence, Ms Rebbitt described this as a contradiction in the same sentence. The father would not respond to Ms Rebbitt&#8217;s question whether he accepted that sexual abuse had occurred. She detected similar responses to her questions concerning physical abuse. The father told her that the oldest boy SB was the only reason for the proceedings and he was &#8220;motivated by social services&#8221;.

Ms Mole said that she had no concerns about the parents&#8217; current care of M and endorsed Orchard House&#8217;s conclusions as to their care of and attachment to the baby. Like Orchard House, however, she was concerned about the parents&#8217; attitude to the abuse which the older children had suffered. She described how, during her first visit, the father wanted to show her the house and in particular the boys&#8217; bedroom. She thought the reason for this was to demonstrate that the sexual abuse as alleged could not have occurred in such a small house. The mother had been very clear that the children were never left unsupervised and no amount of discussion could shift her opinion on this point. Ms Mole said that she did not believe the mother really thought that Z had been sexually abused. Although the mother said that she accepted that Z had been abused, Ms Mole thought that she showed no insight or understanding as to how this had happened. Ms Mole  noted that the father was still putting forward his conspiracy theory.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M&#8217;s guardian was also the guardian for the 6 younger children in the earlier proceedings. In her report in this case, she confirmed that the parents have demonstrated that they are able to meet the basic care needs of a baby of M&#8217;s age and stage of development and that they have responded to her needs and engaged with the support and assessment process. On the other hand, she also confirmed that there has been little shift in the parents&#8217; views or attitude which would provide M with the long-term protective and nurturing care she requires. It is the guardian&#8217;s view that the parents continue to regard the court&#8217;s findings as incorrect and assert that the children have not suffered harm. The guardian concludes that it therefore remains a very real and valid ongoing risk to M that her needs will not be prioritised and the safety will be compromised. She noted that throughout the parents&#8217; engagement with the courts and professionals, there have been times when they appeared to have changed their view. The guardian accepted, however, the conclusion of Dr Tantam that their acceptance is &#8220;minimal and superficial&#8221; and that, as a result, it is difficult to see how progress can be made to engage with the parents in meaningful work and protective parenting. In oral evidence, the guardian added that she did not get a sense of a genuine belief that Z had been sexually abused, nor any sense of responsibility, nor any acceptance of the physical abuse which this court has found took place.</p>

In oral evidence, the guardian, like other professionals, was of the view that any protection plan would be reliant on the parents being open and honest with professionals. She stated that she did not think one can rely on the parents&#8217; assertions in this regard, for example the mother&#8217;s statement that she would call the police if the older boys returned home. </p>

In her submissions on behalf of the father, Miss Howe acknowledged that the court was bound to reflect on her client&#8217;s evidence.   She asked the court to bear in mind the stress that these parents have endured in two rounds of proceedings concerning their children; the difficulties in expressing oneself in a second language or through an interpreter; the impact of the father&#8217;s religious and cultural beliefs, as exemplified by his reference to Sharia law as quoted above. I accept all of these points. Nonetheless, it is clear to me that neither parent accepts the findings, or acknowledges the harm that their children suffered in their care. They do not accept that their parenting was deficient in any way. The father is frank in expressing these views. The mother has on occasions made some comments that, taken at face value, might indicate that she does accept some of the findings, but looking at the evidence overall I find that in reality her position is not substantially different from her husband&#8217;s .</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, neither parent really accepts that Z was sexually abused by her brothers. It is manifestly clear from the father&#8217;s oral evidence that, although he accepts that the court has made the finding, he does not accept that the finding is justified. This is plain from the attempted appeal against the findings and final order in the previous proceedings, but, more importantly, from the evidence in the present proceedings of Sarah Wilson, Dr. Tantam, the local authority social workers, and in particular the parents&#8217; own oral evidence in this hearing. The father certainly, and also in my judgment the mother,  continue to believe that the origin of Z&#8217;s allegations lay in the actions of Mrs X and in particular her alleged wish to gain revenge on SB. I have clearly concluded that there is no basis for this belief, but the parents persist in holding and asserting it. The mother has on occasions vocalised an apparent acceptance of the findings of sexual abuse whilst at the same time &#8211; and sometimes in the same sentence - asserting that it could not have occurred and demonstrating a firm resistance to considering how that abuse would or could have happened.   Although at times it has seemed that the mother is more willing to accept that Z was abused, it is also plain that she and the father are a close couple and are united in their beliefs. I accept the opinion of Dr. Tantam and Sarah Wilson that there is a clear element of mutual reinforcement in their attitudes. </p>

I see no grounds for believing that any further work would lead them to change their views. Despite strenuous efforts by a number of professionals, they do not really accept that their daughter was abused.

I also accept her opinion that, in the light of their intransigence, there is a real concern as to whether, when the time came, they would have the capacity to keep the boys away. Miss Howe submits that denial itself is not a risk factor and that Dr. Tantam failed to carry out a proper risk assessment because she disregarded findings made in the earlier judgment as to the context of the physical abuse &#8211; a busy household of eight children &#8211; and failed to consider the fact that the current context would be very different. Miss Howe relies in particular on the fact that the parents love M and are devoted to caring for her, that M would be the only child in the house, that issues of physical abuse only arose when the older boys were teenagers, that the parents have undertaken not to allow the older boys to have unsupervised contact with M, and that they have demonstrated the capacity to work with professionals, notably at Orchard House but also elsewhere. Miss Howe submits that both Dr. Tantam and Ms Wilson have failed to give any or any appropriate consideration to these factors or to undertake a sufficient analysis of how residual concerns could be managed, for example under a contract of expectations.  She invites the court to conclude that any risk of repetition is (a) low and (b) manageable, with appropriate planning, monitoring and education.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">I accept that all the evidence, including the evidence from Orchard House, is that these parents have the ability to provide physical care for M, and that there is evidence of a close attachment. But there is nothing in any of the professional reports to suggest that they have really begun to acknowledge the problems that arose in their parenting of the older children. I accept that the parents love M, but they also express love for all their other children and yet serious abuse occurred in their household. I have considered carefully the submission that those problems arose in the context of a large household and will not be repeated if the older children stay away from the family home. In the absence of any real acknowledgement or acceptance by the parents of the abuse that occurred, it is impossible for the court or any of the professionals to understand the reasons for the abuse, or to have any confidence that it will not recur, even if the parents adhere to their expressed intention not to allow the older children to return. Given the strength of feeling that the parents have for their older children, and their refusal truly to accept the allegations of inter-sibling abuse, and the examples of their lack of co-operation with some of the professionals, in particular some of the local authority social workers, I do not accept that the parents can be trusted to adhere to their promise not to allow the older children to return. Similarly, given the parents&#8217; repeated minimising of their physical abuse of the older boys, which they persist to characterise as little more than minor physical chastisement, it has not been possible for the professionals or the court to reach a clear understanding of the reasons why, or the circumstances in which, the physical abuse occurred. In my first judgment, I concluded that they had resorted to physical abuse as a means of exercising discipline, but it is unclear why they did so. As a result, any child in the care of these parents would, in my judgment, remain at an unquantifiable but significant risk of physical abuse.</p>

There is no evidence to suggest that these parents would be frank about the risks and concerns. They believe there was nothing wrong with their parenting. In addition, I find that they would be more likely than not to conceal any concerns from professionals. A crucial question for the court is whether the parents would cooperate with professionals in any care plan for M. Although the parents have cooperated with some professionals &#8211; including the staff at Orchard House and also subsequently after their return home &#8211; they have not in my judgment demonstrated any real co-operation with professionals over the central issues in these proceedings, in particular the abuse of Z by her siblings. At times, they have adopted a defiant and confrontational stance towards social workers. I see little grounds for believing that, if challenged, they would take on board criticisms of their care of the children, or address the deficiencies in their parenting which led to the eight older children being removed. They do not really accept that there was any problem with the way they looked after the children. In my judgment, although the mother has on occasions said things to suggest that she accepts a degree of responsibility for what has happened, the underlying belief of both parents remains as it has always been &#8211; they have done nothing wrong, and are not to blame in any way for what has happened to their family.</p>

It was submitted that the reliability of the expert and professional evidence is undermined by references to unsubstantiated allegations made by the some of the older children subsequent to the fact-finding hearing which have not been subject to any investigation in court and on which (as explained above) the local authority do not now rely. It is of course axiomatic that an expert assessment must be based on facts as found or agreed, not on unproven allegations; see for example <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 FLR 755" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 FLR 755</ref>.

On behalf of the mother, Mr. Davies submits that any risk of similar abuse being repeated is too remote and too far in the future to cross the threshold. He points out that the environment in which the sexual abuse took place is not the environment in which M is or will be living. Miss Howe repeats these arguments and adds that the court is being invited to speculate that M will, in future, pose challenging behaviour at some unknown juncture and that SM and SB will have contact with her in circumstances that will pose a risk to her, despite their sentencing and whatever treatment and support they have and will receive in future.

This puts me in a good position to evaluate the likelihood of harm befalling M should she remain in her parents&#8217; care. In my judgment, there is a strong possibility that M will suffer significant harm in the care of her parents attributable to that care not being what it is reasonable to expect a parent to give. There is in my judgment a strong possibility that, at some point during her childhood, the parents will use physical violence on her, whether as a means of discipline or otherwise. The fact that they do not acknowledge that this is what happened with the older boys means that it is highly likely that they do not recognise themselves that this is what happened or that they do not understand their own propensity to violence. There is also, in my judgment, a real possibility that M will be exposed to sexual abuse at the hands of her brothers. I find that the parents do not really accept that the boys abused Z, that they have strong feelings of loyalty to the boys, and that, notwithstanding their assurances to this court, it is likely that they would allow the boys into the house, and fail to protect M from abuse just as they failed to protect Z. After extensive inquiry by the court and input from a variety of professionals, there is little if any evidence of insight on the part of the parents, and any protection plan would be largely dependent on the parents&#8217; self-reporting. The parents plainly do not trust the local authority, but I find that it is the parents who cannot be trusted to report concerns or risks to social services. I do not agree that the risk is remote or manageable. On the contrary, I find it is real and unmanageable.  </p>

Removing her from home and placing her in foster care would involve breaking M&#8217;s attachment to her parents and thereby cause her a degree of emotional harm. Although it is likely that M would receive high-quality care in a foster placement, there is a risk that this separation could have long-term consequences. Managing this would require skilled, patient and loving care on the part of her foster carers. Secondly, although carefully-selected and supported foster carers ought to be able to meet her religious and cultural needs, there is a risk that this will be more difficult to achieve than it would be were she to remain at home. Thirdly, although contact will to some extent support her sense of identity and enable her to maintain a relationship with members of her birth family, this will inevitably not be as strong as it would be were she to remain in the care of her parents. Finally, a foster placement lacks the security provided by adoption. As a foster child, M would remain a child in care, at risk of the foster placement breaking down and the uncertainty of future applications to discharge the order. She would not experience a sense of belonging to a &#8220;forever family&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">As in the case of long-term foster care, an adoptive placement would provide M, in all probability, with high-quality care under which her physical, educational and emotional needs will be met. By careful selection of adopters, I am satisfied that carers can be found who would be able to bring her up with a knowledge and understanding of Islam and her cultural background. Furthermore, she would be protected from the significant harm to which she would be exposed were she to remain in her parents&#8217; care. Importantly, adoption would bring the degree of security and permanence which is not available in foster care, however dedicated her foster carers may be. If she is unable to remain in the care of her parents, only adoption will meet her needs to be part of a &#8220;forever family&#8221; where she can make permanent attachments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">On the other hand, adoption has a number of disadvantages. It will entail the permanent severance of M&#8217;s relationship with her parents. They are adamantly opposed to her removal from their care and to her adoption. Although M is too young to express any wishes verbally, it is inevitable that removing her from her parents at this point when she is securely settled will cause her great distress and it is likely that the break of her attachment to her parents will lead to a degree of emotional harm. Furthermore, prior to moving to an adoptive placement, M would be placed in short-term foster care and would therefore have two moves over a period of several months, which is likely to be more unsettling and may exacerbate the emotional harm. The local authority hopes that, if these transitions are undertaken in a safe and nurturing environment, she should, given her age, be able to transfer attachments to her new carers with minimal distress. There is, however, no guarantee that this will be achieved. Furthermore, as in the case of foster care, it may be more difficult for adopters to ensure that all her religious and cultural needs are met. In evidence, Ms Mole acknowledged that the interim foster placement to which M will be moved pending placement would not be a placement with a family of M&#8217;s own culture. Finally, as an adopted child, M would lose her identity as a member of her birth family. Contact with her parents will be on an indirect basis only, and although the local authority is committed to looking for adopters who are open to the possibility of direct sibling contact, it cannot be guaranteed that such contact will take place. Thus it may be that all contact with members of her birth family after adoption will be indirect only.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">I have found this a difficult and troubling case and taken time to consider all the evidence again before reaching a decision. To break an attachment between a child and her parents is a very serious step. In the end, however, I have come to the clear conclusion, having regard to M&#8217;s welfare throughout her life, that she should be placed for adoption. If she were to remain in the care for parents, even if under a care order augmented by a contract of expectations, she would in my judgment be likely to suffer significant harm of the sort suffered by her siblings. I find that her parents do not really accept that the older children have suffered harm and have no insight into the manifest deficiencies in their parenting. There is no evidence that M would be any safer in their care than were the older children. I accept that, if M is separated from her parents, she will experience disruption to her security and very considerable distress but this is plainly outweighed by the longer-term risk to her well-being and safety should she remain in her parents&#8217; care. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">In the case of the two younger boys, AH and AW, I reached a different conclusion in the previous proceedings, namely that the balance came down in favour of long-term fostering as opposed to adoption. I concluded that the importance of the boys maintaining established relationships with their family was a decisive factor. In particular, the relationship AH and AW had with their brothers and sister as part of a close sibling group was a fundamental aspect of their lives and of their sense of identity. The boys were aged 6 and 5 respectively at the date of the final order. M, on the other hand, is only aged 7 months. I must of course have regard to the likely effect on her throughout her life of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person, and the relationship which she has with birth relatives. Although M has a close attachment to her parents, she does not have the same established relationship with the sibling group as enjoyed by AH and AW, nor does she have the same sense of identity. At her very young age, the greater degree of security which can be provided by adoption is a decisive factor. I conclude that only an adoption will provide M with the emotional and physical security throughout her childhood and beyond. I have carefully considered the article 8 rights of M, her parents and other members of the family. I conclude in this case that adoption is necessary to meet M&#8217;s welfare needs and is proportionate to those welfare needs. Nothing else will do.</p>

Her parents do not consent to a placement order but, in my judgment, her welfare requires their consent to be dispensed with. Accordingly, I shall make a placement order authorising the local authority to place her for adoption.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The local authority is proposing that M should move immediately into a short-term foster placement while an adoptive placement is found. Although this entails two moves for her, I agree with the guardian&#8217;s assessment and conclude that it is an unavoidable step which has to be taken in her long-term best interests. The local authority proposes that, during her period in short-term foster care, there should be a &#8220;step down&#8221; programme of contact with her parents. The authority has taken on board the guardian&#8217;s criticisms of their proposals as to the speed of the reduction in contact under this programme and has modified its plan in a way which, I am satisfied, is in M&#8217;s best interests.</p>

After adoption, such contact will be on an indirect basis, although in seeking adoptive parents, the local authority proposes to look for adopters who will be open to the possibility of face-to-face contact with the siblings after adoption. The authority is also proposing to look for an adoptive placement that will meet M&#8217;s religious and cultural needs. I regard these two elements of the search for adopters as very important.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">In reaching this decision, I have been fully aware of the devastating impact it will have on M&#8217;s parents. This is not a decision that the court reaches lightly. On the contrary, it is only arrived at after careful consideration of all the evidence. Wherever possible, children should be brought up by their parents. Adoption is a last resort, but in this case I conclude, for the reasons set out above, that it represents the right outcome for this little girl.</p>
