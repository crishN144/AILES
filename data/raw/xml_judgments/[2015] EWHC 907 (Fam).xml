I shall refer to the deceased as Jack in this judgment. The claimant is his widow, now aged 61. She married Jack on 1 February 1997 following 10 years' cohabitation. It was his second marriage, her first. They had two children now aged 15 and 12. The first to fourth defendants are the children of Jack's first marriage to Zehava, who are all now middle aged. The fifth and sixth defendants are Jack's children of a non-marital relationship. They too are middle aged. The seventh defendant is Jack's sister, Violet. She lives in Switzerland and is aged 96, having been born on 18 August 1918. The eighth defendant is the son of the first defendant and is one of a number of grandchildren of Jack. He is aged 31.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Jack's obituaries make interesting reading. He was born in the Chorlton area of south Manchester to parents who had emigrated here from Baghdad and who joined the Sephardic community which made its living on the edges of the city&#8217;s textile industry.  According to the obituary in the Daily Telegraph:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"He was educated at Heaton Moor College, and set to work in the post-war years buying and selling cloth and dabbling in local property, before moving to London. He first came to wider prominence in the early 1970s as the force behind a fast-growing, Knightsbridge-based &#8220;fringe bank&#8221;, Dalton Barton Securities, which he and his business partner, Stanley Van Gelder, sold for &#163;58 million in late 1972 to Keyser Ullmann, the bank chaired by Edward du Cann, MP." </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On any view Jack was phenomenally successful. The Sunday Times Rich List stated that he was worth &#163;580m in 2008, &#163;480m in 2009, &#163;500m in 2011 and &#163;445m in 2012. Based on these, and other, rich lists, as well as on other evidence (to which I will refer), the claimant says that at the time of his death Jack personally held, or ought to have held, a vast fortune.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Jack's will dated 15 November 2006 to all intents and purposes left his entire estate to the claimant<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> It also created an IHT nil-rate trust which is irrelevant for my purposes.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. However the disclosed assets which comprise his estate amount only to &#163;15.4m comprising overwhelmingly realty and personalty. There was only minimal cash and no income generating assets. The claimant says that this is an absurd presentation of the true scale of his personal wealth at his death. If it had shrunk to &#163;15.4m then in the period before his death he must have given most of it away to the defendants without her knowledge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Therefore she commenced this claim on 10 March 2014. Her principal claim is for reasonable provision to be made for her from Jack's estate pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref>. Obviously she does not seek an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> against the actual death estate as identified and declared to HMRC as that was, effectively, left to her alone. She seeks an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> against the deemed "net estate" as defined by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref>. This is not the same as the actual death estate. Sections 8 and 9 treat certain property as forming part of the "net estate" which would not in fact form part of the actual death estate. And <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref>5 defines the "net estate" as not only including property captured by sections 8 and 9 but also to include any sum of money or property which is ordered under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> to be provided for the purpose of making provision under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref>. In this case the claimant's real substantive claim is her application made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref>, as supplemented by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref>.</p>

Moreover, the bad intention to defeat the principal ancillary relief claim is presumed for transactions done within the three year period before the avoidance claim. There is no time limit on attackable transactions. A transaction done 20 years earlier is, at any rate in theory, capable of being annulled. By contrast, a claim under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/10" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref> does not affect the validity of the disposition under attack. If relief is granted then it takes the form of a money judgment against the disponee to pay a specified sum to the estate. There is no presumption as to the necessary bad intention and there is a six year time limit on attackable transactions. If the disponee is a trustee then by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref> the money judgment cannot exceed the value of the disposition left in the hands of the trustee.</p>

The three sets of facts set out in paragraph 2.1 of Practice Direction 4A exemplify the limited reach of rule 4.4(1)(a), valuable though no doubt it sometimes is. The touchstone is, in the words of paragraph 2.1(c) of the Practice Direction, whether the application is legally recognisable. Applications made after the applicant had remarried or after an identical application had been dismissed or otherwise finally determined would be examples of applications not legally recognisable. Since the greater includes the lesser, it is no doubt possible to describe applications which fall foul of Rule 4.4(1) as having no real prospect of success. Nevertheless paragraph 2.4 of the Practice Direction remains in my view an unhelpful curiosity which cannot override the inevitable omission from the family rules of a power to give summary judgment." </p>

Such arguments should be reserved for applications under CPR 24.2. Under CPR 3.4(2)(a) arguments about real prospect of success can only arise in a literal sense, as described by Lord Wilson i.e. a claim which is legally unrecognisable has no prospects of success. </p>

The reason is quite simple: if the respondent's case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success.

It seems to me that the position under the Civil Procedure Rules is somewhat different from what it was under the previous Rules of the Supreme Court. This is because under the Civil Procedure Rules, Part 31.16 enables the court to order disclosure in a case like the present to enable a potential claimant to ascertain whether he has a pleadable claim or not. Mr Purvis says of course the claimants do not apply for pre-action disclosure under Part 31.16 so I should not take this into account, but it seems to me that it is a relevant factor. Even if, which is not the case here in my judgment, the case was not pleadable and was too speculative as in the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">A to Z Couriers</span> and<span style="font-style:italic"> UpJohn</span>, the courts could and would consider an application for pre-action disclosure. In my judgment, there is no reason why, in order to save costs in this case, disclosure should not be ordered now to see whether the claim is doomed to fail as the defendants implicitly suggest.

I will hear counsel on the form of the disclosure order in due course. It seems to me also that the defendant should have an express liberty to apply to strike out the action again should the disclosure demonstrate that the pleading is unsustainable at that stage. I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not in any way pre-judging the issue of what the disclosure may show or what the facts actually are. I am simply deciding two things: (i) that on the evidence before me, as a matter of inference from the facts that the claimants have put forward, I regard the claim in paras 8 to 10 as pleadable with the exclusion of the words I have mentioned in para 10; and, (ii) that for those reasons I do not regard the claim as too speculative to go forward.

Perhaps more significant is that there was a clear understanding between Jack and Guy on the one hand and the lawyers at Mishcon de Reya that there were in existence a number of trusts with the inference that they held large sums. This is hardly surprising.  The letter to Artemis Trustees Ltd in Guernsey to which I have referred above speaks volumes.</p>

The claimant should not have omitted reference to this.

Yet the claimant's case is that from that point onwards vast sums were funnelled by Jack directly to those very children. I suppose this is possible, but it does seem unlikely.

It seems to me that we now operate in a different legal world to that which pertained when <span style="font-style:italic">Hytrac</span> was decided in 1983. This brave new world allows full pre-action disclosure to be made where the applicant can put up a prima facie case which is more than a speculative punt. Mr Vos QC was undoubtedly right in my judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">Arsenal</span> case to say that a claimant can plead a case in a laconic or protean way in anticipation of particularisation following disclosure.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"If one of the consequences of CPR Pt 22 is to exclude the possibility of pleading inconsistent factual alternatives then it will have achieved far more than the prohibition of dishonest or opportunistic claims. It will prevent even claimants in the position of an executor or liquidator from advancing alternative claims based on incomplete but plausible evidence in circumstances where they are not able to choose decisively between the rival possibilities without access to the trial processes of disclosure and cross-examination. A defendant to an honest claim will be able to compel the claimant either to choose between seemingly viable alternatives or to abandon the claim altogether. The former will require the claimant to make a judgment on the basis of incomplete information and in relation to witnesses to whom he may not have ready access and will mean that in many cases the alternative claim will resurface at trial compelling the claimant to make a late application to amend with all the obvious difficulties which that will entail. I do not believe that this is what CPR Pt 22 was intended to achieve. Nor do I believe that it is what the statement of truth requires. If the alternative set of facts is clearly pleaded as such then the claimant is not necessarily stating that he believes both sets of facts are true. In the present case if Parts E1(<span class="scaps">a)</span> and E1(<span class="scaps">b)</span> are properly expressed as alternatives leading to an allegation of undue influence then what the claimant is affirming is his honest belief that on the basis of either one set of facts or the other Bacon was the subject of undue influence in his dealings with the defendants. It is really a matter of drafting but unless it can be said that one of the alternatives is unsupported by any evidence and is therefore pure speculation or invention on the claimant's part he is entitled in my judgment to sign a statement of truth in these circumstances. I reach this conclusion not without some hesitation and those responsible for reviewing the operation of the Civil Procedure Rules should take the earliest opportunity of reconsidering the provisions of Part 22 in order to provide some proper and clearer guidance in relation to alternative pleas." </p>

I think that what he meant was that until and unless the challenged orders authorising service out have been affirmed disclosure cannot be ordered against them. I did not understand him to say that disclosure cannot be ordered against a non-resident defendant who has been properly served out unless that defendant has made an elective submission to the jurisdiction. That would be a very surprising position. As will be seen, I will dismiss the challenge by the second and seventh defendants to the order granting leave to serve out. Therefore the disclosure order is properly made against them. If I am wrong about this then, if these defendants have not submitted to the jurisdiction by 1 May 2015, I authorise, in lieu of the order for disclosure, letters of request pursuant to CPR 34.13. The request will be for those defendants to attend their local court and to produce the documents I have specified above. </p>

An ex parte freezing order is one of the law's nuclear weapons. If improperly obtained it can cause untold and potentially irremediable damage both economically and reputationally. Therefore a very strict and unyielding approach is adopted by the courts. The same cannot be said of an improperly obtained order for service out. If it has been improperly obtained then any harm caused can easily be remedied by orders for costs or damages. In truth it is hard to see what actual harm would be caused, other than costs and some inconvenience, if the defendant improperly served moves quickly to set aside the order.</p>
