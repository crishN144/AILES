Ms B is Emma&#8217;s &#8216;parent&#8217; in all senses of the word (genetic, gestational, psychological); there is no doubt on the evidence that Ms A is every bit as much her other psychological parent: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re G </span>[2006] at &#167;39 below. </p>

The Local Authority, which is represented by Mr Alex Taylor, argues strongly that the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref></span> should be interpreted in such a way as to enable Ms A&#8217;s application to proceed and supports the adoption of Emma by Ms A on welfare grounds.  Mr George acts for Emma, on instructions from the Children&#8217;s Guardian; the Guardian expresses no view one way or another on the interpretation of the law, but is supportive of the application for adoption (if it can proceed) on welfare grounds.    </p>

In that period, they decided to start a family.  They agreed that Ms A should be the biological mother of their first-born child; through a process involving a sperm donor, Ms A became pregnant and in 2015 a son, Theo, was born.  In January 2018, Ms B successfully applied to adopt Theo, and in this way, both Ms A and Ms B became in law and reality Theo&#8217;s parents. </p>

In January 2020, Ms B moved out of the home; the separation was mutually agreed and amicable.  On separation, they agreed to implement a shared care arrangement for the children, and this indeed has been the case for the last 16 months.   </p>

Ms A and Ms B have a very good relationship with each other; they are in almost daily contact with each other, they often socialise together; they plan birthday and Christmas celebrations for the children in a way which enables them to spend the day together.  They help each other out with practical tasks, and on the evidence which I have seen, they flexibly operate this shared care regime to the considerable benefit of both children.  </p>

Significantly Emma views both Ms A and Ms B as her parents, and they regard her as their daughter; all the evidence which I have seen points to the fact that Emma is a much-loved member of this family.  Ms B says this: &#8220;[Ms A] and myself made the decision to have children.  Although we are not in a relationship, our parenting and friendship and caring relationship is united, and [we] unconditionally love both of our children as a family. Although we are not living together we parent our children together as separated parents would. [Ms A] has the most loving, caring, and strong relationship with both children and </p>

This is a loving and devoted relationship, but they do not actually live together; Ms C, who lives about a half-hour&#8217;s drive from Ms A, has children aged 7 and 11 who are in school local to her home, and she is for that reason currently loath to move.  Equally, Ms A does not wish to disrupt the shared care arrangements for Theo and Emma.  In the autumn of 2020 Ms A and Ms C decided to start their own family, though this has not yet come to pass.  I am advised that Ms C and Ms B &#8220;get on with each other&#8221; and there have been social events at which both families have been together. </p>

I believe they will strive to maintain a solid relationship so as to meet the needs of both children. Having met with both parents independently I believe that they share a common goal and vision as to how this will be achieved.&#8221; </p>

Ms A and Ms B are also &#8216;living as partners&#8217; in the sense that they participate in, and co-operate with, a fully integrated shared care arrangement in which the time for their children is split equally; they also plan and enjoy many activities together as a &#8216;family&#8217; of four, including birthday celebrations, days out, and family meals.  He argues, with some force, that the incorporation of the word &#8216;family&#8217; in the statutory phrase is crucial; &#8216;family&#8217; usually denotes a relationship beyond a &#8216;couple&#8217; which often includes children or others linked by kinship to a person or couple.  He argues that had <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/144/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 144(4)</ref></span> simply defined a couple as &#8220;two people living as partners in an enduring relationship&#8221; then there might not be as much scope to argue that a shared commitment to parenting a subject child creates such a relationship or that a shared and enduring commitment to a sibling does so. </p>

This would create an asymmetry in the status of their parents which amounts to an interference in family life.

He pointed to the fact that marriage is a &#8216;status&#8217; and can found the basis of a claim of discrimination (see Lord Hoffman at &#167;6-8 in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2008/38" uk:canonical="[2008] UKHL 38" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] UKHL 38</ref> / <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 1084" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 1084</ref>); he argued that a lawfully married couple who are permanently separated, or civil partners who are permanently separated, would not be prevented from making an adoption application as they do not need to show that they are in an &#8216;enduring family relationship&#8217; (see again <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51(3)</ref></span> and <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51</ref>(3A)</span> above).    His argument is that having different eligibility criteria as between married couples (or couples in a civil partnership) and unmarried couples should not create discrimination in terms of the effect of such criteria where the best interests of a child are concerned; he submits that an unmarried Ms A should be just as eligible to have a court consider her substantive application for an adoption order as much as a married Ms A would be.  </p>

Of course, in this case Ms A is currently <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the</span> partner of Ms C; she is a <span style="font-style:italic">former</span> partner of Ms B.

He points out that had Ms A been married or a civil partner of Ms B, but at the time of the application had &#8220;separated&#8221; and been &#8220;&#8230; living apart&#8221;, in circumstances in which &#8220;the separation is likely to be permanent&#8221;, she would not have been debarred from making the application (see <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/51/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51(3)</ref> / <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/51" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 51</ref>(3A) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref></span>).  Indeed, it would not even have mattered if, having separated in those circumstances, she was at the time of the application in a committed relationship with another person (i.e., Ms C).

The Strasbourg court, as I have said, has never sought to define what is meant by family life. More importantly for present purposes, and this is a point that requires emphasis, the Strasbourg court has never sought to identify any minimum requirements that must be shown if family life is to be held to exist. That is because there are none. In my judgment there is no single factor whose existence is crucial to the existence of family life, either in the abstract or even in the context of any particular type of family relationship&#8221;.  </p>

Ms A and Ms B have for some time been jointly committed to creating a family life with their children, as evidenced by the conception, birth and early upbringing of Theo, and the replicated arrangements in respect of Emma.   I am satisfied that Ms A played an &#8220;equal role&#8221; in the care of Emma while the couple were together, and continues to play an equal role in the shared care regime which the parents have brought about for the children since their separation; I am satisfied that they see themselves as lifelong parents for these two children.  As the adoption social worker has commented, and I accept, Ms A, Ms B and the children are a completely &#8220;integrated&#8221; and &#8220;close family unit&#8221;; Ms A and Ms B are truly &#8216;partners&#8217; in parenting with a strong family ethic.   </p>
