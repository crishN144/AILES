	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Cronin, a consultant paediatrician, noted on admission there was evidence of poor circulation.  Cade looked grey, unwell and floppy.  He had poor head control and a high cerebral cry.  He was treated for possible septicaemia.  A bruise to the left arm was noted.  He underwent a lumbar puncture to check for meningitis.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That afternoon a CT scan was performed.  It was wrongly said to be normal.  Cade remained in hospital, sometimes conscious and sometimes not.  Further tests were carried out.  It included blood and urine testing, an ECG, ultra scan of the abdomen and a chest x-ray.  They proved negative.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">His concerns about Cade related to his persistent vomiting, bouts of irritable crying, and episodes of back arching suggestive of tonic seizures/extensor posturing with developmental regression.  He had lost head control and gone floppy.  This was in contrast to his parent&#8217;s account of excellent head control and being a strong baby before admission.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cade was moved once more, this time to the care of Dr Ramesh at NGH, on 14 August.  The same day an MRI brain scan was carried out.  It showed bilateral sub-dural haematomas.  The earlier CT scan carried out at STDH was re-examined.  It proved consistent with the MRI scan.  Cade&#8217;s symptoms subsequently settled.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the absence of any explanation from his parents consistent with those findings, NGH suspected he had been shaken.  They informed the local authority of the situation on 19 August.  The police became involved.  The parents were interviewed by the local authority and the police.  They denied responsibility.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority refer firstly to the minor injuries to Cade noted at the time of his admission to STDH at the end of July 2002, and an earlier injury to Cade&#8217;s lip.  These were non-accidental injuries they say caused by the father.  He denies this.  They accept his admission that there was one episode of shaking on 30 July 2002.  It may have been brief but significant force was used.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally the local authority say that there were 10 occasions when Cade&#8217;s health deteriorated whilst in hospital between 30 July and 4 August.  Four occurred at STDH and 6 at RVI between 5 and 13 August.  The local authority say there is convincing evidence that 7 of these were non-accidental and caused by the father who save for 1 occasion was alone with Cade overnight.  They arose from deliberate airway obstruction of Cade.  The father denies that there was any occasion on which he deliberately or accidentally obstructed Cade&#8217;s airways whilst he was in hospital.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both at the beginning and the conclusion of the evidence there was discussion about the course the hearing should take.  There was already an admission that the father had caused Cade significant harm as a result of one shaking incident.  The threshold criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> was thus established.  I raised the need for a further hearing in relation to the alleged minor injuries and deliberate airway obstruction by the father.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was unanimity at the Bar that this was a proper course.

	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">They pointed out that these further incidents were significant.  Whilst it was correct that the father was not presently seeking direct contact to Cade, that might change.  There was also the question of any future children he might have, though he has had a vasectomy.</p>

	  <num>23.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The significance it was submitted of these further allegations was important.  It was highly relevant that the father had shaken Cade when he had lost control of himself in the early hours of the morning.  It was quite another thing if the local authority established that he had subsequently obstructed Cade&#8217;s airways deliberately in hospital thereby causing him life-threatening relapses.  If the truth of those matters needed to be established in the future that would be difficult.</p>

That the witnessed fit did not involve any systemic deterioration in the child; this child did not become hypertensive, blue, and did not take an extended period of time to recover.  But the episode that had concerned me throughout, and also concerned Ramesh were episodes which tended to involve a sudden cry, the child being brought to our attention, and the child&#8217;s been looking limp and often cyanosed and taken an extended period of time to recover.</p>

What&#8217;s seen is a child that is either stiff and blue or limp and blue.  Now, therefore, Ramesh and I read through all the details of each of those episodes, we correlated the medical recordings of those episodes with the nursing record of those episodes, and they did not appear to be seizure like episodes.  And as Professor Sibert has confirmed, there is no EEG confirmation of epilepsy in this child, although that obviously is not conclusive, it&#8217;s just informative to the process.</p>
