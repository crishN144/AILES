Currently there is no evidence or information regarding Adeela. For example, how old is she, where does she live, is she married, does she have children, what are her work and other commitments, how much support does she provide &#8211; is it on a regular basis or <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc</span>?</p>

These concerns do not require a deputy order that confers powers in respect of Fahmida&#8217;s property and assets.
