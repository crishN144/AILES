	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr M (H) is 40. He has throughout his life lived in this country where, after leaving university and training as an accountant he began to work as an investment manager in about 1986. As a result of a winning combination of flair and hard work he has excelled. Mrs M (W) is 35. She was born, brought up and educated in America, where all her family still live. She came to live and work in Cambridge in the first months of 1995. In America she had acquired specialised knowledge of the investor and media relations requirements of pharmaceutical companies, and it was for a firm in that industry that she came to work in England. </p>

They never lived together continuously in the same household prior to their marriage, which was childless and ended abruptly when they separated on 23 April 2003, H leaving W in their matrimonial home where she continues to reside. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W now makes application for ancillary relief, a decree absolute of divorce having been pronounced in February 2004. She seeks the transfer of their London home, and of a villa in the south of France which is currently in joint names. In addition she seeks a lump sum to bring her award up to a total of &#163;7.2 million. H's position at the hearing has been that his offer of a lump sum of &#163;1.3 million (on the basis that he retains the French property) is more than generous in the circumstances. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These extremely polarised positions are in the context that the parties agree that H is currently worth of the order of &#163;17.5M, plus whatever value should be attributed to the 200,000 shares which he owns in N Ltd, the fund management company of which he is a director and chief investment officer. In certain circumstances (which cannot be excluded although they appear unlikely) he might be obliged to dispose of his shares for their par value, &#163;200,000. The contentions of the rival valuers from whom I have heard evidence indicate a range of between &#163;12.35M and &#163;18.11M for their value on a notional sale between willing vendor and willing purchaser. But in fact no such sale could take place in current circumstances, for a variety of reasons. There is also evidence that in early 2004 (when, amongst other factors, market conditions were significantly more favourable than they now are) H and the other shareholders had good grounds to hope that their shares might be marketable (admittedly over a period of perhaps five years, and thus subject to price fluctuation meantime) at an initial flotation price of about &#163;130 per share. In H's particular circumstances (having regard to an option which he has given over 75,000 of the shares) this would (at an uncertain future date, over that period thereafter, and subject to post-flotation price movement) net him something of the order of &#163;24.44M. It can, I hope, immediately be seen that valuing these shares raises complex issues. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W's current financial circumstances are in stark contrast. If she paid her outstanding costs she would be more than &#163;300,000 in overall debt. For this calculation I disregard the value of her share in the French house, her car and her modest jewellery, as well as furniture and other chattels which are to be divided. Put another way, if the liabilities which she has assumed to meet her costs are ignored then she has about &#163;100,000 worth of assets of which &#163;46,000 is locked in pension funds. </p>

Despite the illiquidity and the uncertainties regarding the N Ltd shares neither party suggested that W's award should await or be tied to their value when realised. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard submissions and evidence over five days from 11 October 2004. On the first day I ruled that I would not shut out evidence from the parties about the reasons each gave for the breakdown of the marriage, notwithstanding a declaration embodied in the order made after the unsuccessful conclusion of the Financial Dispute Resolution hearing on 6 February 2004. That order recorded that W would not rely upon <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref>(g) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>: that is to say, that she would not assert that H had conducted himself in such a way that it would be inequitable to disregard his behaviour. I gave a short judgment on the question. In essence I took the view that in the particular circumstances of this case (notably the brevity of the marriage) it was not inconsistent with that declaration for W to seek by her evidence to demonstrate that the breakdown was largely if not entirely attributable to an intimate relationship H formed with the woman with whom he now lives, the physical separation between the spouses having occurred the day after he revealed the association to W. However, even if the declaration could be so construed, I took the view that W's evidence could not be circumscribed as to preclude her from airing this issue without which it would be impossible to gauge the strength and impact of the catalogue of complaints about her conduct during cohabitation advanced by H to seek to justify (as I find was his intention) his decision that the marriage had no future and/or to dilute what W asserts was the destructive impact of his adultery. His case is clear: he maintains that his new association was a consequence of an unhappy marriage rather than a cause of its breakdown. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the commencement of the hearing it was by no means clear to me whether or not by its conclusion attribution of responsibility for breakdown would constitute a relevant circumstance which I should take into account in reaching my award. But I was not prepared to take the risk inherent in excluding evidence of W's position on this question with the consequence that H's assertion would not be tested. I was encouraged in that course by observations made by Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-weight:bold">G v G (Financial Provision: Separation Agreement)</span>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 FLR 1011" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 FLR 1011</ref>, where he said:</p>

Mr&#160;Pointer&#8217;s argument, which is lucidly presented, goes thus. The judge considered that there were three respects in which the conduct of the husband was relevant to the quantification of the wife&#8217;s lump sum. One of those was the circumstances in which the marriage had broken down. The judge was highly critical of the husband in this regard. He held that his association with B was the major contributory factor to the breakdown of the marriage, and that the husband&#8217;s attitude to his misconduct merely demonstrated his lack of insight into the distress that it would inevitably cause the wife. The judge went on to say at&#160;31:&#160;&#160;</span></p>

			<p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in"><span style="font-size:11pt">&#8216;However, taking all this into account, in my view it is not appropriate to increase the award which the court would make because of the husband&#8217;s bad conduct in this regard. Rather, I see it as a significant counterbalancing factor to the point made on behalf of the husband that this was a short marriage.&#8217;&#160;&#160;</span></p>

He says that if she is not to be assessed as having an entitlement on the foundation of a 4-year marriage, on what greater length of marriage is she to be assessed?&#160;</span></p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:11pt">[34]&#160;&#160;&#160;The answer to that seemingly well-developed submission is, in my opinion, this. A judge has to do fairness between the parties, having regard to all the circumstances. He must be free to include within that discretionary review the factors which compelled the wife to terminate the marriage as she did. The point was essentially taken as a defensive shield to the reliance upon the duration submission. There must surely be room for the exercise of a judicial discretion between the pole of a wife who is driven to petition by the husband&#8217;s unfeeling misconduct and that of a wife who exits from a marriage capriciously and for her own advantage. It seems to me that the judge was doing no more than taking his bearings as to where he stood along that path.&#160;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with Mr Pointer (who in this case also represents the husband, appearing with Mr Justin Warshaw) that nothing which either spouse alleges against the other remotely constitutes conduct of such gravity that it would be inequitable to disregard it. Nor indeed does it approach the weight of the findings made against the husband in <span style="font-weight:bold">G v G</span>. But that does not seem to me to detract from the 'fairness' point which Thorpe LJ was making. Indeed, as will appear in more detail below, I do as a result of hearing this evidence regard myself as better able to position myself fairly in relation to W's claims than otherwise would have been the case. I am moreover satisfied that H was not put at a disadvantage by this ruling. W did not seek to go beyond what she had already said on the topic in her affidavit evidence. I do not believe that H's case on these issues would have been improved by any more intensive preparation than had already been devoted to it. </p>

But the consideration for the takeover was payable in two tranches, the second of them in December 1999, so that in March 2000 H was paid &#163;20 million gross pursuant to the formula which had earlier been agreed. Meanwhile he had in about 1997 been instrumental in the launch of the J Ltd Hedge Fund, an innovative investment vehicle which proved to be extremely successful. </p>

This led to serious disagreement between them and Mr D, which did not come as an entire surprise to him. I entirely accept his evidence that he had been preparing for what he rightly anticipated might be his dismissal, which occurred in May 2000. To this end he had been laying the foundations upon which he hoped to establish a new enterprise, the rival fund management company which became N Ltd. I am also fully satisfied that, from this perspective, H would be a significant asset if his release by C Ltd could be achieved, not least because he would be likely to bring with him a valuable trio of significant investment funds. I have no reason to doubt that tentative discussions along these lines commenced with H, and with others, from about December 1999 onwards. </p>

True as points out Mr Mostyn (who with Mr Tim Bishop represents W) it could not be immediately operative even if indeed it could be regarded as legally enforceable. Neither participant was in a position to agree other than conditionally that H would move to Mr D's new company, and would in doing so in all likelihood bring with him a personal following of hedge fund investors of very significant importance to Mr D's strategic plans. Mr D could not at that stage make good his offer of employment to H, nor implement the arrangement both men say was made for H to take up 200,000 shares in the company at &#163;1 each. For both H and Mr D were contractually bound by non-competition clauses to C Ltd, and the new company was still on the shelf rather than acquired for Mr D's purposes. But I have no doubt, having heard their evidence, that these were the arrangements they then agreed, and in due course put into effect once Mr D had leased the shackles that inhibited them both. This he achieved when he struck the negotiated settlement of his unfair dismissal action against C Ltd in November 2000. I am not persuaded that the delayed description (in the evolution of the evidence in the case) of this meeting and its effect was contrived, as was suggested on W's behalf.</p>

H may have received them at what may have been the bargain price of par, and if a bargain that may have had as quid pro quo the value H brought to the fledgling company. Or (at the other extreme) they may now be worth hardly more than when they were purchased. This is because of the perception of the parties and their advisors that the outcome of W's claims might be significantly affected one way or the other depending upon whether the share acquisition should be regarded as having taken place before or after the July 2000 marriage; and by what view I might take as to the effect, amongst the circumstances of the case, of the nature of the parties' relationship leading up to their engagement in July 1999, and indeed between that date and the marriage. As will become apparent, I am unable to subscribe to the view that, in this case, such considerations can affect what outcome is fair to both parties as radically as each legal team, in diametrically opposite directions, has so strenuously argued.</p>

H says that W has misconstrued what he wrote, and that although it did indeed constitute an invitation to find such a property to convert into their weekend and holiday home, it in no way suggested expressly and could only by mistake be interpreted to signify that the property was to be hers rather than his or (as it was indeed purchased) theirs. W relied on affidavits from two of her friends who say that they too formed the view from the way that H revealed his intention to make the present that what he was giving was the house rather than the commission to find and convert it.</p>

I have to say that he does not strike me as the most obviously spontaneously generous of men. I think he may have intended and indeed conveyed an ambivalent message. W is more romantic, more susceptible to warm emotion, and thus in my judgment may well have misread H's more tentative intentions. She seeks a transfer of the property to her. He asks to have it transferred to him. Each claims to have the more significant attachment to it than the other. I have no doubt W is right that she was far more absorbed in the grand scheme as well as the minutiae of the property's conversion, albeit with professional help and at H's unstinted expense. But it does not seem to me to be a requirement of fairness in this case that W should have a second property in France worth over &#163;1m pounds gross. As part and parcel to the solution of their financial claims she will transfer the villa to H alone, unless of course they wish to adjust the pattern of the award once they know its overall tally.</p>

The marriage in terms of cohabitation was therefore brief. But two factors are urged by Mr Mostyn which he says should affect the weight to be given to the duration of the marriage as a circumstance of the case to be taken into account when performing the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> exercise. The first is what he asserts was the exclusive and committed nature of the parties' relationship for the 5 years prior to their marriage in July 2000. The second is the factor already referred to, that W was not a wife who capriciously ended their marriage, but rather one whose expectations that it would continue were dashed by H's decision to terminate it.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the nature of the parties' relationship before their marriage, it was undoubtedly close and apparently exclusive virtually from the outset. Their physical relationship was established from the summer of 1995 onwards. There were two limiting factors which take the case out of the ordinary. Until the marriage the parties never co-habited and indeed until shortly before the marriage they did not live in the same city. But I am satisfied that they spent the overwhelming bulk of their leisure time together and were in virtually daily contact. Those were the practical and geographical boundaries of their relationship. Emotionally the position was, in my assessment, more complex. Of course their relationship developed over time until their engagement resulted in July 1999 from a formal proposal made by H. Until then W was hoping to marry H with more enthusiasm than he was demonstrating for that commitment, in my judgment. He had been married before and was wary of repeating the experience. For her part, W says a factor which militated against setting up home together before the marriage was her and her family's more traditional attitudes, which some might call old-fashioned, that marriage is the moment to establish a joint life together. That, she says, explains why even in the period immediately before the marriage, when she had left Cambridge to live in London she stayed with friends rather than move with H into the house they had already bought as their matrimonial home.</p>

Until then their ties were tentative, and their separate expectations did not accord. In this relationship there was no pre-engagement honeymoon to blend seamlessly into marriage. I tend therefore to favour Mr Pointer's submissions and treat this as a marriage of relatively short duration.</p>

She clearly is house-proud, to an extent which then (or increasingly with retrospection) he found irksome. She did not appreciate it when he returned home late from work-related functions. She was sensitive to any suggestion that he might be developing an interest in women other than herself, and this he regarded as unreasonably possessive. He paints her as a woman who threw herself enthusiastically into an idle lifestyle of shopping and self-indulgent social pursuits. He did not find her style congenial when he returned home after a long and hard day's work. He undoubtedly became depressed, but in my view that was in response to a variety of pressures, by no means all related to his relationship with W.</p>

She would prefer not to return to the same sphere of employment, but were she to do so she would need 3 to 5 years to reinstate herself to a comparable position and salary level, upon the basis of evidence from an employment consultant instructed by H. Her preference could be to pursue her interest and what her current part-time employer regards as her flair for interior design, with the hope that after some three years or so further experience as an employee she may be in a position to establish her own consultancy practice. It is certainly not for this court to tell her which course she can and should adopt. It is understandable that H regards the interior design project as a tactical distraction intended to limit her future self-sufficiency or at least to render it more speculative, as well as a support for her objective of retaining their current home with its extra space part of which she could use as an office. Although I shall refer as a point of reference only to a <span style="font-weight:bold">Duxbury</span> calculation I do not propose to decide this case upon the basis of any strict or even tangential reliance upon that to fix the award, and so the disparity between the parties' positions on this is of scant importance in my view. W should be in a position and will be so as a result of the award to choose her own career path.  But that she has and should exercise an earning capacity given her age and aptitude is incontestable, and I take it into account as one of the factors in the case.</p>

On H's side there is every prospect unless some disaster strikes that he will maintain high earnings (including substantial bonuses at least from time to time) and will be able to make savings from his income. In addition there is a good likelihood that at some stage the potential of his shares will be unleashed. If at that or any stage his employment with N Ltd ceases then I anticipate again, barring the small but incalculable risk of corporate or personal disaster, that H's career will not be spent, and that he has at the very least some years of productive endeavour ahead of him even if he does not achieve the longevity of his mentor, Mr D, in this taxing market place.</p>

A major contribution in this context was the planning and oversight she brought to the refurbishment, equipping and furnishing of the French property to which H has become so attached. Neither the modest period during which she was able to make this contribution nor the very considerable scale of H's efforts and the rewards they brought him affect the proposition, which I accept, that incommensurable though these contributions are as chalk and cheese, nevertheless no discriminatory attitude should be allowed to treat them as other than equivalent.</p>

But (in particular in <span style="font-weight:bold">S v S </span>and in <span style="font-weight:bold">Attar v Attar</span>) the court recognised the artificiality and impracticality of that injunction in the context of very short marriage cases.

That is that by virtue of this marriage, taken in its proper setting both in terms of the way it was reached and the way it ended, H gave W a legitimate expectation that she would on a long-term basis be living on a higher economic plane that the rented flat and her &#163;85,000 p.a. job had afforded her when she left them to live with him as his wife at the house he bought for that purpose. It would in my judgment quite simply be unfair to take the view as submitted by Mr Pointer that &#163;500,000 for the purchase of a flat and &#163;120,000 to cover 3 years of revenue shortfall until she could recoup her position in her specialist field would be adequate, and thus that H's &#163;1.3M offer is very generous.</p>

It concerns property acquired during the marriage by one spouse by gift or succession or as a beneficiary under a trust. For convenience I will refer to such property as inherited property. Typically, in countries where a detailed statutory code is in place, the legislation distinguishes between two classes of property: inherited property, and property owned before the marriage, on the one hand and "matrimonial property" on the other hand. A distinction along these lines exists, for example in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/37" uk:canonical="1985 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985</ref> and the (New Zealand) Matrimonial Property Act 1976.</span></p>

It is of course in this connection that the value to be attributed to the shares and whether there is a distinction to be drawn dependent upon their acquisition date being before or after the marriage assume apparent significance as issues in this case.</p>

The statute contains no such imperative whether we like it or we loathe it. Its foundations are deeply settled into what some may regard as the uncertain quicksand of judicial discretion, to be exercised within a reasonable ambit. This does however have the merit not only that when the parties cannot reach agreement the court can tailor-make the solution, but also (as recent jurisprudence shows) that the trend and blend of solutions chosen can adapt to reflect and sometimes even to anticipate that social and economic change of which Thorpe LJ spoke.</p>

Nor is the process of sifting wheat from chaff assisted by the sophistication which experienced counsel bring to the fray, each emphasising what may or may not be the weaknesses in the other's expert's presentation. If I may just put in a word for this judge: I have some pretence to a degree of numeracy and some acquaintance with the basic process of share valuation. But when confronted with expert witnesses of the degree of experience and sophistication in their rarefied specialities as Mr Nedas and Mr Clokey, each apparently as reasonable and persuasive in the witness box as the other, how am I to choose between them, or independently to arrive at my own figure in contradiction to them both?</p>

It is pointless to try to ascribe a single value to them, when the true range is from &#163;1 each to the limits of the sky. But, I repeat, neither party proposed treating W as the beneficiary of the proceeds of disposal of any specified number of shares, no doubt because she is not prepared to await the uncertain event at its unpredictable date; and he may hope to achieve an award to her which is based on an underestimate of whatever may be their eventual proceeds.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But the court was there dealing with what in effect was a joint venture to which the spouses had made unequal contributions over the duration of a short marriage. I do not seek to confine the importance of what was said to the specific facts of the case, but emphasise the defining phrase 'where a substantial surplus had been generated by their joint efforts'. It is always dangerous to second-guess a judge of the Court of Appeal, and even more so one who has moved onwards and upwards, but I do wonder whether the Court of Appeal's decision would have been the same if the same substantial surplus had been generated over the same time by one spouse using his or her pre-marriage assets or on the back of his or her pre-marriage 'fledged' experience. In support of this perhaps heretical observation I pray in aid what Hale LJ said at [21] that the fact, that property inherited or pre-acquired might in fairness lead to the spouse to whom it belonged or was given being able to keep it, was only one of the circumstances of the case which in ordinary course would not carry much or any weight if recourse must be had to it to satisfy the other party's needs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My conclusion is that W should have the opportunity to retain the former matrimonial home for as long as she chooses to live in it. Subject to any adjustment to the form of the order to accommodate her potential exposure to US tax I intend that it should be transferred to her free of mortgage. That will involve H paying off the liability of about &#163;500,000 secured on it or adding it to the lump sum payment to enable W to redeem it herself. The value of that property after deduction of notional sale costs has been taken as about &#163;2.3M. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition a fair outcome to this case is that H will pay W a lump sum of a further &#163;2.7M. If the <span style="font-weight:bold">Duxbury </span>methodology is taken simply as a guide then the computer programme <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Capitalise </span>suggests that for a woman soon to be 36 a fund utilised in accordance with usual principles would generate an initial annual net income of about &#163;98,000. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That is very significantly less than the budget of well over &#163;200,000 which W asserted was the sum of the costs met by H in the last year of cohabitation, suitably trimmed to reflect his departure. She will not be able to afford that standard, but with an income of that order plus whatever she can earn she will be able to live to a very tolerable standard in that house.</p>
