It is clear that there are a number of procedural matters that could be raised.  I&#160;take the view I&#160;should ignore these and deal with the application on the merits.  For example, it is said that the husband never actually made a&#160;claim, but I&#160;consider that I should not deal with this case on that basis.  </span></p>

The wife is aged 51.  She is the Group Brand Director of the R Group.  The husband is aged 42.  As I&#160;understand it, he is unemployed and relying on the assistance of friends.  In 1993 he was arrested entering the United Kingdom and eventually convicted of importing heroin and given a&#160;10-year prison sentence.  He was recommended for deportation.  In March 1999 he unsuccessfully applied for asylum.  He was deported back to Pakistan.</span></p>

They married on 2nd January 2009 in Pakistan.  Initially the husband was not permitted to enter this country as a&#160;result of the deportation order.  The wife paid for a&#160;rented flat in Lahore costing &#163;250 a&#160;month and gave him an allowance of &#163;1,000 a&#160;month.</span></p>

On 15th May 2011 the husband was granted a&#160;spousal visa for 30 months. He came to this country and resided with the wife at her property.  The marriage was clearly not a&#160;success.  I&#160;do not need to go into the reasons for that.  It certainly got into difficulties in 2012.  The divorce petition was presented on 14th August 2012.  There was a&#160;brief attempt at reconciliation thereafter.  The decree&#160;nisi was pronounced on 10th April 2013 and shortly thereafter the husband vacated the matrimonial home.</span></p>

It deposes to net assets of &#163;1,948,695 and an income of &#163;300,000 per annum gross plus bonus.  The husband's Form&#160;E is dated 4th July 2013.  He indicates capital needs of &#163;825,000.  The judgment suggests that he indicated income needs of over &#163;200,000 pa.  I&#160;suppose that depends on how you interpret it.  My reading of the Form E was &#163;23,000 per annum, but it may be that was per month.  In any event, it does not matter very much.</span></p>

There is some dispute as to what actually the Deputy District Judge said, but the attendance note that I&#160;have is that he indicated that he thought that the eventual award would be a&#160;lump sum to the husband in the range of &#163;20,000 to &#163;30,000.  On 1st August 2013 the wife made an open offer of &#163;30,000.  The husband's visa expired on 3rd August 2013.  He decided to appeal.  That appeal, as I&#160;understand it, was heard on 16th October 2014.  I&#160;am told that he has not yet heard the result.  Various people have bandied about various possible outcomes of that appeal.  It seems to me that it is irrelevant to the matter I&#160;have to decide.</span></p>

The case took some five days.  The Deputy District Judge reserved her judgment and her eventual order was dated 8th July, as I&#160;have already indicated.  She rejected both sides' conduct allegations.  She did however indicate that she considered that the husband had been guilty of litigation misconduct in the way in which he had run the litigation.  By then, he was appearing in person although he had previously been legally aided.  She took the view that the indication that had been given by the Deputy District Judge was, colloquially, "spot on".  She decided that as a&#160;starting point:  </span></p>

Mr.&#160;Marshall QC, who appears today on behalf of the wife, tells me that he had put in evidence, on the Wife&#8217;s behalf, of property particulars in Pakistan showing that property could be purchased for &#163;20,000 or rented for something in the region of &#163;225 per month.  Indeed he says that the husband's own property particulars show a&#160;rental of &#163;235 per month.  His case was that the correct order would have been a&#160;rehabilitative order that would either enable the husband to purchase modest accommodation in Pakistan and perhaps have a&#160;few thousand pounds left to tide himself over until his earning capacity was re-established.  The Deputy District Judge found that he could do that in approximately one year.  Alternatively, argued Mr Marshall, he could rent and have a&#160;greater income from the award over a&#160;longer period.</span></p>

She concluded that an award of &#163;25,000 was the right one.  However, the wife had many months earlier made an open offer of &#163;30,000.  It is right to note that the husband has been legally aided.  It was clear that the Deputy District Judge, faced with the wife having run up &#163;150,000 worth of costs, took the view that the right approach would have been to have made a&#160;costs order in favour of the wife to penalise the fact that the husband had not accepted the open offer.  This was particularly the case given the indication from Deputy District Judge Petrou as to the likely award.  As a&#160;result, all the litigation was the husband&#8217;s responsibility and the wife should be reimbursed for as much as was possible.</span></p>

In coming to that conclusion, she relied on the case of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt">M v. M</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> [1995] 3&#160;FCR 321.  This supported the contention that litigation misconduct, although generally reflected in orders for costs rather than in the quantum of the award, could make a difference to the award itself, in an exceptional case, where the husband's strategy had been so extreme that it would be inequitable to disregard it.   </span></p>

He stated in that notice of appeal that the Judge had erred in several ways.  He submitted that it was wrong for the Judge to reflect his circumstances in Pakistan rather than in England.  That ground of appeal cannot, in my view, succeed, regardless of the outcome of his immigration appeal.  The Matrimonial Causes Act requires the court to consider all the circumstances of the case.  The Deputy District Judge, having heard the evidence and having seen the parties over some five days, was entirely entitled to come to the&#160;conclusion that he should in reality return to Pakistan and make his life there.  His needs should therefore be considered on that basis.  If he decided to stay here, in effect, on his own head be it.</span></p>

In my view, that is irrelevant for the same reason.  The third ground was that the case should have been adjourned until the outcome of the appeal.  Again, that fails for the same reason.  </span></p>

Indeed, I&#160;have canvassed yet another ground with Mr.&#160;Marshall this morning.  I&#160;certainly do not take the view that this husband should be denied the opportunity to run a&#160;good point if it is a&#160;good point just because he is in person and has not put it in his notice of appeal.  The two points are effectively as follows.  </span></p>

The matter that I&#160;have raised with Mr.&#160;Marshall today is the effect of the costs order and whether it is appropriate to deal with it in that way if &#163;25,000 was the right figure for the award.  </span></p>

Financial remedy applications involve the exercise of discretion.  The exercise by a judge of this discretion can only be wrong if it was outside the bound of reasonable decisions that the tribunal could have taken.  This used to be described by the phrase "plainly wrong", although it seems that that particular way of describing it has been consigned to history.  The test, however, is still the same.  It is highly unlikely that two different judges will exercise their discretion in identical ways.  That does not mean that one of them is wrong.  I&#160;have to decide if the exercise of discretion was unreasonable.  A&#160;judge has to be fair.  Was the decision unfair?  If it cannot be said it was unfair the appeal must be dismissed.</span></p>

The Family Procedure Rules have been changed to include a&#160;presumption of no order as to costs.  Such a&#160;presumption can have a&#160;terribly serious effect on litigants.  It can almost be that they are effectively blackmailed into making open offers because of the costs of the litigation.  This wife dealt with that.  She made an open offer to this husband a&#160;very long time before the final hearing that was at the top end of what the Deputy District Judge at the First Appointment thought he should be awarded.  He should have accepted that offer without hesitation.  Can it really now be said that it is reasonable for this court to ignore that and give him the slightly lower award anyway after the wife has incurred such huge costs?  </span></p>

M</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:14pt"> in the way that she did.  It just shows how seriously offers and particularly open offers in litigation such as this have to be taken by the parties.  The court can have no truck with litigants who ignore reasonable, well-pitched open offers, proceed to trial at huge cost and then lose.  I&#160;take the view that the fact that the husband was legally aided is irrelevant to that process and the Deputy District Judge was entitled to take the view that she did.  I&#160;further consider that it is impossible for the husband to say that he has a&#160;real prospect of success as a result.  I&#160;have therefore come to the conclusion that this application should be refused.</span></p>

In his oral submissions to me Mr.&#160;S argued that the Deputy District Judge was wrong because she should not have treated the marriage as a&#160;one-year marriage.  It should have been treated as a&#160;four to five-year marriage.  In my view, that is a&#160;misconceived submission.  It is quite clear that the Deputy District Judge did not take the length of the marriage from the date on which Mr.&#160;S arrives here.  She considered it from the date of the marriage in 2009 in Pakistan.  So it is impossible for him to rely on that either.  I&#160;therefore refuse this application. </span></p>
