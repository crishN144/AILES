It was originally listed to be a two day fact-finding hearing with a view to me deciding whether to make an injunction, removing Helen from the house she lives in with her son. However, there was a change of approach the evening before by the local authority, in concert with those representing Helen, and they invited me yesterday to adjourn the matter for a period of six months, to allow Helen to demonstrate that she could keep with the rehabilitation that she claims (and I believe her) that she has started.</span></p>

Experience shows that it is never a good idea to leave any party out of discussions, but when the one left out represents the person concerned, the Official Solicitor, that is &#8216;suboptimal&#8217; practice, if I can put it that way.</span></p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">This case is about Sam M.  He is a man in his 30s.  Until the age of 18 he had a normal, healthy life. Then, in 2018, he was the victim of a serious assault which, with an additional factor of clinical negligence, has led to him being seriously disabled.  He is quadriplegic. He has non-epileptic attack disorder. He has dysphagia. He is constantly at risk of aspiration.  As a result, he is regularly assessed and seen by his speech and language therapist.  He spends his waking hours mostly in an adapted wheelchair.  He communicates, with some considerable difficulty, through a letter board. When I met him, he was assisted by his speech and language therapist in the communication process.  He suffers from a great deal of cognitive damage.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">As a result of the clinical negligence, however, Sam received significant financial compensation, the details of which I do not know and do not need to know. There is a large fund which is managed by a property and affairs deputy, who was appointed by the Court of Protection in November 2011. Since 2015, Sam has lived in a specially adapted bungalow in a town in the North of England.  He shares that home with his team of carers, or at least those who are at the time on duty providing him with the 2:1 care that he needs.  He also shares the home with his mother, Helen.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I emphasise at the outset that Sam is the owner of the home.  It is provided for him out of his compensation because it is the best place for him to receive the care he needs, within the context of his overall best interests.  I would also add that I have visited Sam in his home. That was in April of 2023.  It is a spacious bungalow. He is able easily to move, or rather, to be moved around his house.  There is enough room for him to enjoy his own space and what limited privacy he can have, bearing in mind there are others living there at any given time whose job it is to provide him with care.  When I saw him, he was apparently in a good mood.  He was keen to communicate and to tell me what he wanted to tell me.  He showed me his pet pineapple python and his set of samurai swords (both of which had evaded the risk assessment conducted in advance of my visit).</span></p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I also met Helen and have met her on a number of other occasions, both at court and at home that day.  Unfortunately, and for reasons I shall explain in a moment, it is going to be necessary for me to consider Helen&#8217;s behaviour.  However, I say at the outset that it is clear to me that she loves her son, and he loves her.  He wants her to remain part of his life. As far as Helen is concerned, I have considerable sympathy with her situation.  She was the mother of a perfectly healthy young man, whose life was, if not destroyed, certainly gravely damaged by what appears to have been a senseless attack. That was compounded by negligence on the part of the hospital in failing to determine at an early enough stage how serious his injuries were.</span></p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">What am I being asked to do?  It seems to me that at the beginning of this application, the intention was for me to make an injunction removing Helen from the house that she shares with her son.  However, due to circumstances that came about yesterday morning, there was new evidence about WT, who effectively runs the care at Sam&#8217;s home, and this led to his suspension yesterday.  I was invited to consider those facts, and that he had been suspended, as being such as to call into question the evidence that he had given in his written statement, and he would give orally.  Secondly, it would not be fair for him, perhaps, on the day after he was suspended, to have to address allegations made against him, based upon the same evidence that formed the basis of his suspension.</span></p>

However, I was pressed by Ms Scott, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, to hear evidence before making a decision on the remaining issue, which was whether to adjourn the matter for a period of six months or so, and then to return to decide whether I should make such an order at that stage.  It was implicit that I was being invited at the same time to decide whether it was in Sam&#8217;s best interests for his mother to remain with him now, during the next six months. </span></p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It is worth starting with the basics.  The jurisdiction of this court is to make decisions on behalf of a person who is unable to make those decisions for himself.  I only make decisions that the person himself could make if he had the capacity to do so.  So, what I am being asked to decide is whether it is in Sam&#8217;s best interests for his mother to live in his house. If not, she could be evicted from that house. That is a decision he could make for himself if he had capacity to do so. I am placing myself in his position and I have the options available to me that he would have.</span></p>

She admits being extremely intoxicated in October 2021.  She &#8220;cannot recall&#8221; - and therefore cannot doubt - the evidence that she was intoxicated and behaving in a manner that was not conducive to Sam&#8217;s best interests in September and October 2022.  At the same time, in September and October 2022, it is alleged that she called one of the carers a &#8216;bitch&#8217;.  </span></p>

She also made references to Ms T&#8217;s Jewishness when she was drunk.  I was tempted to regard that as antisemitic. It was certainly a reference to a racial characteristic in an unpleasant way.  Helen cannot recall interfering with Sam&#8217;s personal care in August 2023, although it has been admitted that she did.  She does admit threatening Mr WT, the lead care worker, in October 2023, and admits threatening to cut his fingers and toes off whilst she had been drinking.</span></p>

I can believe that there is some truth in that even from a cursory reading of the text messages that have been placed in the bundle.  Mr WT has not had the opportunity to respond to these, so what I say about them is subject to that caveat. I can well believe that there has been an unhealthy culture in Sam&#8217;s house. That is based on those text messages and the character that they seem to demonstrate on the part of Mr WT.  I can well imagine that such communications and attitudes could lead to conflict, nastiness and a shift of focus away from Sam&#8217;s care.</span></p>

She used the term &#8216;self-medicating&#8217; and that shows both insight into her problem, but it also informs the court of how serious that problem is.  Furthermore, she admitted taking four times the proper dose of mirtazapine.  Mirtazapine is an antidepressant she has been prescribed.  She has taken over the recommended dose on occasion to help her sleep.  This shows that she is suffering from depression, she is stressed, and she has self-medicated, not only with alcohol but also with prescription drugs.</span></p>

She intends to start receiving support with her alcohol addiction - and she now admits that is what it is - and she has told me that she has not had a drink since, I think, this October.  This is described by Mr Willock and Mr Darbyshire as a &#8220;watershed&#8221;.  However, Ms Scott, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, is less euphoric.  She invites the court to conclude that for Helen to remain in the house during a six-month trial period while she is grappling with her addiction problems, as well as depression, is asking too much of her.  Because of that, it is also taking too much of a risk with Sam&#8217;s welfare.</span></p>

I heard the evidence of Mr F yesterday who, I assume, was the decision-maker.  He is obviously an intelligent and thoughtful person, and his evidence was appropriately intelligent and thoughtful.  However, in a case such as this, when concerned with the conduct of a person within a small and enclosed care setting it seems extraordinary to me that he changed the position of the local authority, from suggesting that it was in Sam&#8217;s best interests for his mother to leave the property, to one of her staying for a probation period, without  speaking to anybody who was providing care for Sam at the house beforehand. That calls the value of that decision into question.</span></p>

Leading counsel drafted a detailed schedule, and no doubt there would have been a counter-schedule too.  Eventually, a settlement was reached and that would have been approved by a High Court judge, whose primary concern would be to ensure that the figure was the right figure, and enough to fund Sam&#8217;s care in the future.

Firstly, that the cost of the package was in excess of what it should be.  In particular, the case manager is incurring costs of between &#163;30,000 and &#163;40,000 a year, which is higher than estimated.  In addition, the overall cost of care was high.  This was, in part, due to the need to investigate incidents and safeguarding.  It was also higher because of the high turnover in staff.  Each new staff member has to be trained, which distracts those training that person from the delivery of care.  Furthermore, there is a high use of agency staff because of the high turnover, and that is more expensive.</span></p>

With the added pressures, with a contract of expectation and the local authority checking up on her attendance at therapy, that only makes the situation even more difficult.  </span></p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">Helen&#8217;s knowledge of her son does, at the same time, prove positive in this case, and we have had examples of where her understanding of her son has led her to assist his carers direct their efforts to what he really wants.  However, I am satisfied that historically, for the reasons I have explained earlier, the negative aspects of Helen&#8217;s involvement greatly outweigh the positives.  The primary consideration when determining best interests in this case - the magnetic factor, is the need for Sam to receive optimal care, rather than suboptimal care, as he is presently receiving.</span></p>

This is not happening at the moment.  I am sure presently his care is suboptimal, and his progress is being stunted.  I am satisfied that there is a very high likelihood that this will continue over the proposed six month period.  There is a risk of abject failure and a care crisis that could lead to Sam being placed in residential care.  There is also the continuing draining of the costs coming out of the large but finite fund managed by the property and affairs deputy, as she said yesterday.</span></p>

	    <p class="Paranumbering" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I will stop short, at this stage, unless I am invited to do so, of making an injunction.  I believe that once the property and affairs deputy receives the best interests declaration I am making, she will serve Helen with a notice terminating her licence. I take Helen at her word that she will leave.  And that is what should happen.  She should be given a reasonable period to leave; in my judgment, that should be 14 days.  Thereafter, steps must be taken to ensure that Helen and Sam can have a good relationship together, something along the lines of the restrictions that I have seen so far, but she must not, when entering his house, interfere with the care workers.  It is vitally important that there is a maintenance of stability in the provision of care and that he is not caused the upset and distress that he has obviously been suffering and which is clear from the statements he has made to his legal representative.  </span></p>
