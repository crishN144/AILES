	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant, EBK, seeks the committal to prison of the Defendant, DLO, for contempt of court. This is his second such application. This application is dated 25 January 2024 but has been amended following directions by Sir Jonathan Cohen when he listed the hearing of permission to make the application for contempt before me for two hours on 17 April 2024.  This judgment follows that hearing which was held in open court. EBK was unrepresented. DLO appeared at court and was represented by Mr Foster who confirmed at the outset of the hearing that the Defendant had been properly served with the application and associated documentation. EBK had prepared a helpful bundle for the hearing which included a lengthy Affidavit with appendices. For the reasons given in this judgment I refuse permission to EBK to bring these committal proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">EBK and DLO are parents of a child, N, now nearly seven years old. DLO also has two older children who are under 18 and who live with her. The parties separated in or around November 2017 after which there were protracted proceedings in the Family Court concerning child arrangements orders (&#8220;CAO proceedings&#8221;). In the course of the proceedings, DLO made allegations including of domestic abuse against EBK. Certain findings were made which do not need to be aired in this judgment. Those proceedings, then under case number HD20P00013, were concluded by District Judge Uppal on 9 March 2022 in the Family Court in Huddersfield when he made a child arrangements order by which N would live with her mother and her father but with more time spent with her mother. DJ Uppal made <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s91(14)</ref> orders to last until March 2026 against both parties, preventing further applications in respect of N without permission.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 August 2020, whilst these CAO proceedings were ongoing, DLO wrote a letter to a Member of Parliament in which she repeated allegations of domestic abuse against EBK. She also referred to there having been proceedings in the Family Court and she told the MP that within those proceedings a non-molestation order had been made, that EBK had been ordered to undertake a Domestic Abuse Perpetrators Programme (&#8220;DAPP&#8221;), that following interventions by EBK the judge had then &#8220;dismissed CAFCASS without replacement and has since been making decisions entirely on his own&#8221;, that EBK had made various claims about his employment (with the military) which she claimed were untrue, and that the Family Court had not had contact with the Ministry of Defence. The Claimant was a serviceman and the MOD was his employer. The Defendant ended the letter:</p>

I would be grateful of your assistance in escalating this to the police, the military (as he is bringing them into disrepute) and the Family Court, and finally get the much needed protection and justice we desperately need.&#8221;</p>

At this stage I have no evidence at all from the Defendant. Her Counsel provided a short position statement which focused on legal issues. The Defendant accepts that she wrote the letter to the MP on 11 August 2020. As I reminded DLO at the outset of the hearing, she is not obliged to say anything or to give evidence. For the benefit of the Claimant, I stress that nothing can be read into the absence of evidence from the Defendant.</p>

On 25 August 2020, a police officer of West Yorkshire Police wrote to a Warrant Officer at the Ministry of Defence referring to DLO&#8217;s allegations and &#8220;hundreds of emails&#8221; from EBK. The officer informed the MOD that the police &#8220;would be seeking a charge of controlling and coercive behaviour/harassment.&#8221; The following day EBK was arrested. He remained on bail for well over a year. As I understand it there were no subsequent criminal proceedings and bail was later discharged.</p>

When facing an application that would potentially jeopardise a Defendant&#8217;s freedom, it is very important that the Defendant should know exactly what she is alleged to have done that is alleged to amount to a contempt of court. The Claimant has not clearly set out the alleged contempt but he is not legally represented and so I sought to explore further with him at the hearing what his allegations were insofar as they could amount to a contempt of court. I am afraid that at the end of submissions and those discussions I still find it difficult to articulate precisely what allegations of contempt the Claimant seeks to make. </p>

However, much of the letter to the MP concerns DLO&#8217;s allegations of abuse by EBK which he disputes. However, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AJA 1960</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12</ref> does not prevent a person from making allegations of abuse, including criminal behaviour, to an MP, to the police, or to others solely on the ground that the person has made some or all of those allegations in proceedings to which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AJA 1960</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12</ref> applies. The fact that the Defendant made allegations of abuse to the MP which she had also made in court does not, without more, amount to breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AJA 1960</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12</ref>. Furthermore, the Claimant cannot reasonably contend that it was a contempt of court <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>to publish information relating to the proceedings. If an imbalanced account is given of the proceedings, that might go to the seriousness of any contempt, but the fact that information in relation to the proceedings was not published cannot of itself be a contempt of court.</p>

DLO told the MP that EBK had misled others about his employment and that there had been no contact between the Family Court and the Ministry of Defence, but that is not obviously an account of what had gone on in front of the judge sitting in private.

She was seeking the MP&#8217;s assistance and support having suffered, on her account, serious and continuing abuse. Certainly, there is no evidence that the MP contacted the court. EBK has provided no evidence of such contact but he has in fact produced evidence to show that it is unlikely there was such contact.

It might be said that when the MP passed the letter on to the police they sprang into action, but their decision to write to the Ministry of Defence on 25 August 2020 and to arrest the Defendant the following day surely arose from the provision to them of documents and information by the Defendant herself, not from the letter she had written to the MP as such. More clearly, the parts of the letter to the MP that referred to the family proceedings cannot possibly themselves have triggered the MP to send the letter to the police and then the police decision to arrest the Claimant &#8211; it was the allegations of abuse that must have prompted action. Hence, the letter to the MP does not obviously have the appearance of an intentional attempt to interfere with the administration of justice, nor that the Defendant was without care about whether it did so, nor that it (the letter itself as opposed to other matters which occurred subsequently) in fact led to that outcome.</p>

I hesitate to quote from that letter which relates to proceedings that may yet have to be determined by another court, but the letter quite clearly demonstrates that DLO provided her complaints and documents to the police herself prior to the decision to arrest EBK. The letter in response encloses documents and the MP letter is the first on the list. EBK appears to think that this means it was regarded by the Police the most important document but that is an unreasonable inference. It was the first in time. In any event, for the purposes of a committal application, it is not the fact that DLO alleged abuse by EBK in her MP letter that is relevant, but rather whether she gave any information about what had gone on in front of the judge in private family proceedings.</p>

They have been considered in the CAO proceedings. They have resulted in proceedings against the police which resulted in the payment of damages and a formal apology in the Kings Bench Division. They have resulted in a claim being brought for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. Finally, they have resulted in a previous application for the Defendant&#8217;s committal for contempt of court for which Mostyn J refused permission. The Claimant wishes the Court to revisit the events of August 2020 once more. He only became aware of the letter to the MP in December 2023 but the important events of that week have been given detailed consideration in previous litigation and there is now fresh litigation with the Claimant&#8217;s claim for damages for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. The Claimant has enjoyed redress for the damage caused to him in relation to his employment and reputation and is seeking redress in another court for the loss of his liberty. Those claims for damages were not and are not directed against the Defendant, but the earlier committal application was. </p>

The information disclosed from private proceedings was clearly much more extensive, and the effect on the decision-making of the police much more obvious than the fact that the Defendant had earlier written to her MP. Yet, Mostyn J refused permission to the Claimant to make that application for committal for contempt. He did so even though he effectively found that the Defendant had indeed committed a contempt of court. The grounds for Mostyn J&#8217;s refusal of permission included that the proceedings would be disproportionate, would involve re-litigation of issues already litigated in a separate jurisdiction, would give rise to unjustifiable expense of time and money, and that the Claimant had already received substantial redress by way of compensation and vindication to his reputation.</p>

The letter of 11 August 2020 may not have been specifically scrutinised by the court in previous proceedings, but the bulk of the matters referred to in the letter, the material events of that time, and the consequences for the Claimant, certainly have been.</p>

He continues to be dogged and single-minded in his determination to put the record and other people right. Committal proceedings for breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AJA 1960</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12</ref> do not seem to me to be the appropriate mechanism for doing so. In any event, he has already received redress and vindication in respect of the same allegations through other means albeit from someone other than the Defendant. His second motivation is to seek to prevent the Defendant from repeating allegations of abuse against him. That is why he told the Court very specifically that he would like the court to impose a sanction of a suspended sentence of imprisonment, if contempt were proved. Such a sanction would create a threat of incarceration hanging over DLO as the new CAO proceedings get under way. </p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The making of this contempt application would bring no benefit to the Claimant, no benefit to the child, nor any benefit to the court. The need to protect the integrity of the court is important but the alleged contempt does not come close to undermining that integrity. Litigants must not publish what goes on in front of a judge in private family proceedings, but if the Defendant did that &#8211; which is not obvious to me &#8211; then she gave the MP very little information about what had happened before the judge, as opposed to giving a great deal of information about EBK&#8217;s conduct more generally, as she alleged it to have been. The parts of the letter alleged to have breached <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">AJA 1960</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s12</ref> did not have any adverse effect on the ability of the court to conduct the CAO proceedings and no adverse effect on the child. I stress that the Claimant&#8217;s arrest, which did very arguably have an effect on the proceedings and the child, was not caused by the letter, certainly not those parts that arguably provided information about what had gone on in front of the judge. I can see no public interest served by permitting this application to be made.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">It would be unfair on the Defendant to permit the application for committal to be made. Not only has a long time passed since the events she would have to address, but she has already faced the prospect of committal proceedings arising out of very similar and closely related matters. She had to secure representation and go to court. She has been through this already and it would be unfair to allow the Claimant to make her go through it again so long after the events in question. The court should not allow applications to commit to be used oppressively or unfairly to browbeat a party to family proceedings.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The Claimant has a grossly inflated view of the impact of the letter to the MP. What really counted at the time was the information DLO gave to the police about the Claimant&#8217;s alleged conduct and the documents she gave them. The fact that she may have told her MP something about what had gone on before the judge was not material to the decision to arrest EBK. He was not arrested for what had, or had not, been said in court.</p>

This related to information and documents from the CAO proceedings provided by EBK to his mother who had made an application to the court. It is relevant to take into account this conduct although I do not give it as much weight as the other factors.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Mostyn J addressed the issue of anonymisation in committal proceedings. I have considered similar issues in relation to committal proceedings in the Court of Protection in <span style="font-style:italic">Esper v NHS NW London ICB</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2023/29" uk:canonical="[2023] EWCOP 29" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWCOP 29</ref>. In the present case, the parties have been anonymised in the published judgments of Mostyn J and Johnson J. There are ongoing family proceedings to be held in private involving their daughter, N. Permission has been refused to bring these committal proceedings and no finding of contempt has been made &#8211; indeed I have doubted whether a finding could be made. The Defendant has not sought to put her account in relation to the allegations of contempt and I have decided the issue of permission on the evidence provided by the Claimant. I have referred to the effect on the Defendant of the Claimant making this application. <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Guidance (Senior Courts: Committal for Contempt of Court: Open Court)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 WLR 2195" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 WLR 2195</ref> applies but it does not mandate the naming of the defendant in a judgment nor notification to the national media in the event of no finding of contempt. FPR r 37.8(5) applies and I am satisfied that non-disclosure of the Defendant&#8217;s name is necessary to secure the proper administration of justice and in order to protect the interests of that party. I so find because of the repeat nature of this application, because permission has been refused, and because there are ongoing family proceedings to be held in private. There are also good reasons to anonymise the Claimant because of his involvement in the military. He suggested that that need for anonymity for himself might soon fall away but it is a current factor. Also, his identification could lead to the identification of N in a published judgement. After circulation of the draft of this judgment the Claimant sought to argue for the lifting of anonymity, suggesting that there was a strong public interest in publishing the name of the Defendant. I disagree. The Article 8 rights of the Defendant outweigh the Article 10 rights of others to freedom of expression when it comes to the issue of whether the anonymity of the Defendant should be preserved. Anonymity of the Defendant is required to protect her privacy when the committal application has been brought by her former partner, arising out of events that occurred over three years ago, in the context of other litigation including ongoing CAO proceedings, and when permission to make the committal application has been refused. Since EBK&#8217;s anonymity has been protected previously for reasons of his occupation, and I understand that need is ongoing at the time of this judgment, I shall also order that his anonymity shall be preserved, having conducted the same balancing exercise. In short, I am satisfied that anonymity of both parties and of N should be preserved. </p>
