It is not an order for the return of the child to Algeria because, since her birth, the child has always lived in England and has never lived in Algeria.  It is, in effect, an application for a summary relocation order.  The application is made under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction.  </span></p>

The only formal application is that made by the mother under the inherent jurisdiction, as referred to later in this judgment.  In making his application, the father relies on an order made by the Algerian court.  He cannot seek its direct enforcement under any international instrument, but he relies on the existence and the nature of this order in support of his application. </span></p>

It is her case that any substantive proceedings concerning RB, including in respect of where she should live, should take place in England and that no summary order should be made seeking to require her to move to Algeria with RB.  She wants to remain living here and contends that it is in RB&#8217;s best interests for her to remain living with her in England.  </span></p>

He completed his PhD at Imperial College London in 2005 and obtained employment in England.  He obtained a number of jobs in what he describes as cutting edge engineering companies.

The judgment contains a brief record of each party&#8217;s claims, of the public prosecutor&#8217;s analysis of the law and of the court&#8217;s decision.  It appears clear that the court simply applied the relevant provisions of Algerian law under which a mother has &#8220;priority&#8221; to the custody of a girl until the age of 19.   The mother was awarded custody and guardianship of RB.  In addition, but without any explanation, the father was given contact every Friday and Saturday and during holidays.  The court also granted a divorce and made financial orders in favour of the mother.  </span></p>

The financial award was adjusted slightly but the father&#8217;s appeal against the custody order was dismissed.

Accordingly the father&#8217;s application for an order that the mother must exercise custody in Algeria was &#8220;without basis&#8221;.  </span></p>

If I were to order a stay in those circumstances there would, in effect, be no forum available to the parties to determine any issues concerning RB.  The father would have an order which he could not enforce in England, whilst the mother and RB would continue to live here.  Conversely, if I were to make an order which had the effect of enforcing the Algerian order, it would make no sense not to stay the English proceedings.  This conclusion is probably why both parties agree that I should first consider whether I should make a summary welfare order.  </span></p>

For as long as the Texan order remains in force, his mother is most unlikely to allow, let alone to encourage, him to spend his vacations in America with his father.  Whilst conflicting orders remain in force, he is effectively denied access to his country of origin.  Nor has his mother been exactly enthusiastic about contact here.  The best chance that K has of developing a proper relationship with both his parents, and with the country whose nationality he holds, is for the Texas court to consider where his best interests lie in the long term.  It is necessary to restore the synthesis between the two jurisdictions, which the mother&#8217;s actions have distorted.&#8221;</span></p>

As explained by the Algerian Appellate Court, it is merely because the order was made in Algeria, and did not provide for custody to be exercised outside Algeria, that the mother is required to exercise custody in Algeria.  Both of the parties&#8217; lawyers misunderstood that this was the effect of the Algerian court&#8217;s order.
