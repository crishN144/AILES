Doncaster Metropolitan Borough authority (&#8220;the local authority&#8221;) seeks to put into the public domain aspects of care proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, which, in accordance with normal practice, were heard in private.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in">The local authority&#8217;s principal application is supported by the father of the child and by the child&#8217;s guardian, albeit with the important exception that in any publication of material the prohibition against naming the child herself should be maintained.  This was the prohibition imposed by Baker J., sitting in the High Court earlier this year. During the course of argument on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2011 when I&#160;heard the case it became apparent that differences between the local authority and the guardian on this point could be accommodated, with the result that the order I&#160;propose to make at the conclusion of this part of my judgment will preserve the child&#8217;s anonymity.  I&#160;will amplify my reasons for taking this course later in the judgment.  I&#160;propose, accordingly, to call the child &#8220;X&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in">X&#8217;s mother is Victoria Haigh.  She told me on 15 August 2011 that she now lives in the Irish Republic.  Although it has been held that supervised contact between Ms.&#160;Haigh and X is in the latter&#8217;s interests, Ms.&#160;Haigh has declined to take up the local authority&#8217;s offer of such contact and has thus not seen X since X was removed from her care.  The local authority now has an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.34 (4)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> permitting it to refuse to allow contact between Ms.&#160;Haigh and the child.  The absence of any contact between X and Ms.&#160;Haigh is thus entirely the mother&#8217;s choice and is an illustration of her inability to act in the child&#8217;s best interests.</p>

For the purposes of this judgment it is sufficient for me to say that X will be 8 later this year.  She is currently in the care of the local authority and living with her father, Mr.&#160;David Tune.  This is in accordance with the local authority&#8217;s care plan which has been approved by the court.  X is thus likely to be cared for by her father during the rest of her minority.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in">X&#8217;s case has been before the court on a number of occasions.  Two are of particular significance. The first is a finding of fact hearing conducted by His Honour Judge Robertshaw over a period of 10 days in January 2010.  X was then 6.  The principal issue before the judge was whether or not X had been sexually abused by her father.  In a long and careful judgment the judge found not only that X had not been sexually abused by her father but that the allegations of abuse which she undoubtedly made, notably in two ABE interviews, had originated in the mind of the mother and were false.  As Judge Peter Jones was later to summarise the position, Judge Robertshaw found the following (this is from Judge Jones):</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">&#8220;Put shortly, the learned judge found that the father had not sexually abused X at all, nor had he behaved in a sexually inappropriate way towards her, but allegations of sexual abuse were first made by the mother and not by X.  These were false and the mother knew them to be false.  In 2009, X was coached by the mother to make a false allegation of sexual abuse against the father, which originated in the mind of the mother.  As a result of inappropriate pressures and prompting, X came to make and believe the allegations.  The mother used allegations of sexual abuse manipulatively as part of her irrational and longstanding hostility to contact which she sought to obstruct.&#8221;</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in">As will be apparent, Judge Robertshaw rejected the mother&#8217;s conclusion that what the child was saying represented her own attitude and perception.  He found the mother unconvincing and, at times, evasive as a witness.  He rejected the submission made to him by counsel for the mother that she was seeking to distance herself from the allegations of sexual abuse and was not in fact seeking a finding that Mr.&#160;Tune had sexually abused the child.  He did not, however, change X&#8217;s residence.  She continued to reside with her mother.  Judge Robertshaw concluded his judgment with the following words:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">&#8220;Those who are charged with the task of advising the court as to orders necessary to promote X&#8217;s welfare in the future bear a burden more onerous than I&#160;have had to discharge at this hearing.  The weapon of last resort, changing X&#8217;s residence, will obviously need to be considered and a balance struck between the risks involved in that course against the risk of mother continuing to frustrate and impede contact in a way that will inevitably be emotionally damaging to X. Frustration at her past deplorable conduct must not be allowed to obscure the fact that the issue is welfare and that there are undoubtedly risks in employing the weapon of last resort.</p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">Direct contact will now need to be reinstated in some form.  It will have to be regulated, not because of any risk posed by the father but simply because of the time that has elapsed since it last took place and, for the time being at least, to safeguard him from further allegations of abuse.  Time alone will tell whether the mother is now able to embrace the letter and spirit of the principle that contact with a non-residential parent promotes the well-being of a child of separated parents.  Any indication that she has not must involve the case being returned to me on short notice so that whatever steps may be appropriate, however draconian, can be taken.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in">The second key judgment is that given by Judge Peter Jones on 22&#160;November 2010.  By this time Judge Robertshaw had retired.  Like Judge Robertshaw, Judge Jones gave a long and careful judgment.  At its conclusion he decided that X should be the subject of a full care order and that she should move to her father&#8217;s care.  Once again, the mother did not seek permission to appeal against that order.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.4in">As I&#160;propose to release both judgments, suitably anonymised, into the public domain, I&#160;will give only short extracts from the second judgment:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">&#8220;The mother&#8217;s stance has, of course, severely circumscribed the arguments which could be deployed on her behalf, and counsel, who has put the case fully and in a measured and realistic fashion on her behalf, conceded as much in argument, accepting that the mother had to grasp at any straw in presenting her case &#8230; This is a mother who has been found to have caused her daughter emotional harm by the making of repeated, false allegations of sexual abuse which she knew to be false at the time she made them and, subsequently, to have coached X into making a false allegation which she knew to be untrue.  She has also used those allegations manipulatively in the course of the family proceedings &#8230;</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">Over several years the mother has made a number of allegations against the father, with the result X has been subjected to four medical examinations, police interviews and has had numerous contacts with professionals.  Despite the court&#8217;s findings, the mother accepts no responsibility for this state of affairs, complaining instead of the local authority&#8217;s &#8216;negligence&#8217; and that her treatment has been incredibly harsh &#8216;with no-one really explaining the reasons why&#8217;.  I&#160;am quite satisfied that this intelligent woman knows exactly why X was removed from her care in January 2010 and why the professionals continue to take the view that X would suffer further emotional harm if rehabilitated to her.  In addition, sadly, while professing her concern for X&#8217;s well-being, the mother consistently prioritises her own needs over those of her daughter &#8230;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">I&#160;have carefully considered all the papers.  They make for rather depressing reading.  The mother appears to be convinced that she is the only person in the right and everyone else involved with her and her family are wrong.  As recently as 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2010, she wrote in an email that she had made her decision and no amount of therapy would change her opinion of something she did not believe in.  She accuses the guardian of bias and the local authority of negligence and, as recently as 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, of &#8216;tyranny, scare tactics and bullying methods&#8217;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">I&#160;am satisfied it would not be in the best interests of X to delay making a final decision in this case for further work to be done with the mother or with X and her father.  In the light of the findings of Judge Robertshaw and all the evidence before this court, there are no good reasons why there should be any further delay in X moving to live permanently with her father, who I&#160;am satisfied is fully capable of meeting all her needs, including that for ongoing contact with her mother.  I&#160;am equally satisfied that it would be contrary to X&#8217;s best interests to move either now or in the foreseeable future to the full-time care of her mother, given the harm that she has already caused her daughter and the harm she will be likely to cause if X were placed in her care.  I&#160;believe the mother does need help and she would be well advised to seek it out &#8230;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">I&#160;invite the mother to consider my judgment carefully with her legal advisors.  I&#160;do not believe that my decision will come as any surprise to her, though I&#160;ask her to take time to reflect on the reasoning behind it.  Her intransigent response to the court&#8217;s findings in January 2010 and her intemperate reaction to the local authority&#8217;s involvement provided her with little room for manoeuvre in the context of these proceedings.  I&#160;have no doubt that she cares for X deeply, but she is demonstrating little insight into X&#8217;s real needs and is failing to prioritise those needs over her own.  If she continues on her present course, she runs the risk of alienating her daughter and permanently damaging their relationship.  This would be a great loss for X, as everyone, including the father, acknowledges, and I&#160;hope it is a consequence which the mother, on further reflection, will seek to avoid.&#8221;</p>

What renders the case unique, however, is that Ms Haigh, aided and abetted by one Elizabeth Watson, is not only unable to accept the judges&#8217; findings but has put into the public domain the false allegations that she has not had justice and that X, contrary to both judges&#8217; findings, has been sexually abused by her father.  Those allegations have been posted on the worldwide web and are in the public domain.  In addition, the mother has circulated the allegations to the parents of X&#8217;s school and to Mr.&#160;Tune&#8217;s fellow employees at his place of work. All this, of course, has been done illicitly and in breach of orders of the court.</p>

At eight years of age X has lived virtually all her life in the centre of litigation and conflict.  For the past 18 months, her mother, Victoria Haigh, has conducted an internet and media-based campaign designed to highlight what she now contends is a miscarriage of justice, namely, the court approved decision to place X in her father&#8217;s care.  In consequence of the mother&#8217;s campaign the local community in which X lives has been made aware that Victoria Haigh accuses David Tune of being a paedophile, a rapist and of sexually abusing his daughter &#8230; </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">For X and her father the present situation is intolerable:  (1) the police have been called to X&#8217;s school to protect her; (2) parents at [the school] are concerned about the information they have been sent by the mother and its significance in terms of the protection of their own children; (3) David Tune has been accosted in the street and called a &#8216;paedophile&#8217;; (4) David Tune&#8217;s work colleagues have had material sent to them both in a public forum and on their own Facebook pages, the contents of which have been to render David Tune&#8217;s livelihood vulnerable and therefore his capacity to provide for his daughter.</p>

The local authority is pursuing the mother and her fanatical campaigners by way of injunction and committal proceedings.

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">The present situation is self-evidently damaging to X and her father.  The local authority, however, is also extremely concerned about the future.  It will not be long before X and her school friends uncover the material which is presently on the internet.  X&#8217;s school, her social worker, if we may say so, and her father has all worked tirelessly and sensitively to shelter X from the allegations her mother makes.  They have been broadly successful to date.  However, it is beyond any doubt that if, and, perhaps now inevitably, when, that information comes to X&#8217;s attention it will be extremely distressing to her.  The repercussions are easy to predict.  It is likely to impact on X&#8217;s relationship with her peers and adults.  It may destabilise her security at home with her father.  It will be emotionally very confusing to her.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">Even if the local authority was ultimately to remove the information from the internet, the fact remains that the mother&#8217;s accounts have already been widely circulated and in a manner targeted to cause most damage to X and her father.  This is a situation the local authority finds very difficult to manage.  On the one hand, it seems clear that the false and tendentious material in the public domain must at least be counterbalanced by accurate and truthful information being made available to those who receive the mother&#8217;s account.  On the other hand, it must be recognised that information placed in the public domain cannot easily be regulated thereafter.  There is a risk of widespread media interest that may have the consequence of making life for X and her father even more uncomfortable, particularly in the short term.  Any course the court takes must, in our submission, contemplate both these possibilities.</p>

Ultimately, the local authority has concluded that it would be failing in its obligations to X not to correct the false allegations and rumours that surround her.  The real harm from the mother&#8217;s actions, we would respectfully reiterate, has been to target her campaign, and so specifically, to those directly involved in her child&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

It may be that the court will wish to vary the contents of the document perhaps, even to expand its ambit. The contemplated judgment would be a document in the public domain, and, as such, the local authority recognises it will have no control over its dissemination.  It is proposed, however, that the social worker, the head teacher and Mr.&#160;Tune&#8217;s employer should work together in managing the release of the judgment to those concerned locally in a way that would be most sensitive to X.

They wished to publicise that vindication since they had been the victims of the &#8220;no smoke without fire&#8221; school of thought and had suffered an amount of local abuse.  The matter was dealt with by consent, and the article does not relate what order the judge made.  But, in my judgment, the situation is analogous.

The answer is not, I&#160;think, far to seek, and I&#160;have already touched upon it.  Above all, I&#160;adhere strongly to the principle that children should not be named in Children Act proceedings.  Children are nearly always the victims of their parents&#8217; misbehaviour.  In this case the mother happens to be the abusive parent, but the principle is firm; the child should be protected as much as possible.</p>

In his submission on this point Mr.&#160;Perkins quoted from the Guardian and  his solicitor when submitting the following:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">&#8220;[The children&#8217;s guardian] is instinctively opposed to the release of information regarding X into the public domain.  He has, throughout this case, supported the local authority in fighting to preserve her anonymity by way of injunctive measures and committal proceedings.  He feels strongly that a child&#8217;s interests are best met by her identity being kept confidential and likewise information which would tend to identify her as being the subject of proceedings, as it is enshrined within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">The guardian feels, however, that this case is exceptional.  The campaign conducted by Ms.&#160;Haigh and her supporters has put an erroneous view of the court proceedings regarding X into the public domain.  The impact of that has been immense on X, impacting on her day-to-day life and making her fearful.  It is not clear whether, at the present time, she has any understanding that people in her school have knowledge of her situation, albeit knowledge of incorrect facts, but this could only be harmful to her as she grows up.  The impact of the campaign being run by Ms.&#160;Haigh and her supporters is affecting Mr.&#160;Tune, and X is conscious of that.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">The guardian is also conscious that, in addition to the internet campaign waged by Ms.&#160;Haigh and her supporters, there is evidence that the more mainstream press has shown interest in X&#8217;s case.  A Member of Parliament has chosen to assist Ms.&#160;Haigh by speaking of this case in the House of Commons, having alerted X&#8217;s solicitor to his intentions and to the fact that he could not be prevented from this action.  Again, this makes X&#8217;s case very different from any other case the guardian has encountered.</p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">Due to the very specific circumstances of this case, the guardian has reluctantly come to the position there should be disclosure of the true facts of X&#8217;s case into the public domain.  He has read the document prepared by leading counsel for the local authority and, whilst he would make some amendments to it, as shown in the attached document, he agrees to there being disclosure.  He very strongly argues, however, that X should not be named.  It could be argued that X can be easily identified because the parents are named and that refusing to name the child is therefore illogical.  The guardian would argue that there is no necessity to name the child because clarity is achieved by naming the parents.  Whilst for those familiar with this case it would be simple to identify X, the principle of a child&#8217;s confidentiality should be maintained by those in the family justice system.  Research evidence strongly suggests that children do not wish for their identities to become known, or indeed for their family details to be disclosed.  The guardian would submit that X should not be named so that the document, if it is released by the court in its current form or an amended version, should not, in itself, come back to haunt X in the future.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.62in">The guardian will not support release of the document, therefore, as drafted by the local authority, and if the court were to countenance its release he would wish it to be clear that he has opposed it.  The guardian believes that were X&#8217;s name to appear publically it is important that the local authority takes immediate action to pursue an immediate remedy through the court.  The guardian reaches this position after much thought.  He remains concerned this case could open the floodgates to other breaches of children&#8217;s confidentiality.  He is clear that requests for release of information, as being considered here, should remain the exception, rather than the rule.&#8221;</p>

It does not seem to me that the court should be seen to derogate from the principle I&#160;have enunciated, whilst at the same time it criticises others for doing so.  In one sense this case is no different from others.  There are always people &#8220;in the know&#8221;.  There are always people who know who the parties to confidential proceedings are.  Those people, however, will not be at liberty to publish X&#8217;s name, nor will the media, in any way in connection with these proceedings.  I&#160;propose to release both the judgment of Judge Robertshaw and Judge Jones into the public domain, and both will be placed on the BAILII&#160;web site.  As far as Judge Robertshaw&#8217;s judgment is concerned, the child&#8217;s name, whenever it appears, will be replaced by the letter &#8220;X&#8221;.  The names of the individuals (apart from those of the mother and the father, which can remain) should be replaced with their positions, i.e. the head teacher who is named can be called &#8220;the head teacher&#8221; and so on.  Similarly, the social worker who is named can be &#8220;the social worker&#8221;. As far as Judge Jones&#8217;s judgment is concerned, similar considerations will apply. The named psychologist who gave evidence before Judge Jones can be called &#8220;the psychologist&#8221; and so on.  Amendments will, I&#160;am afraid, have to be made by the local authority.</p>

I&#160;make this statement based on my knowledge of X, who has attended the school since March 2008 to the current date.

Children attending the school come from throughout the local geographical area.  It is a closely knit community, with many of the families of children attending at school knowing each other extremely well, including knowing X and her parents, Ms.&#160;Haigh and Mr.&#160;Tune.

However, X presents as a child who is extremely bright and, in my opinion, should be achieving over and above her age-appropriate milestones.  X has many friends within her school and is a popular child with her peer groups.  X has plenty of friends within school, but I&#160;am unsure as to what friends she has contact with outside of school hours&#8230;&#8230;</p>

For example, I&#160;was informed at a recent Looked After Child&#8217;s review that X had begun to build herself a hiding place in the family home in the event that her mother attempted to come and remove her from home, from her father&#8217;s care.  I&#160;was concerned to learn that a child of X&#8217;s age had the forethought to be able to formulate such a plan, which clearly had been given consideration for some considerable period of time&#8230;&#8230;</p>

I&#160;am clear that X is under a significant amount of pressure at this time.  She appears to be a child who has the weight of the world on her shoulders.  In the light of this, her educational attainments at this stage are not of any particular surprise to me, and I&#160;think she is coping extremely well with her current circumstances involving her mother&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Mr.&#160;Tune himself appears to be under an extreme amount of pressure at the present time and &#8230; struggling to come to terms with the nature and extent of the material which is presently on the internet about him, which I&#160;have observed first hand by looking at the same on the internet.  Mr.&#160;Tune always presents at school as extremely concerned for X&#8217;s emotional welfare and relies on the school for a significant amount of support in protecting her whilst he is at work and X is at school.  Mr.&#160;Tune does talk to me about discussions he has had with X and her views with regard to having contact with her mother, although it has to be said that X herself has not spoken with regard to any of these issues.  I&#160;am aware that a member of the public has recently approached Mr.&#160;Tune and asked him whether or not he is a paedophile, which the internet reports refer.

Since that time Ms.&#160;Haigh has sent presents for X at Christmas, has sent a school magazine with letters written inside, has emailed me photographs of her new baby directly to my email address at school, and packages of clothes, DVDs, CDs have also sent by Ms.&#160;Haigh to be passed on to X.  None of the above had been passed on to X by the school.  They have been passed to children&#8217;s services to assess how and when, if at all, the same could be forwarded to X for her attention.  I&#160;have historically received emails from Ms.&#160;Haigh via her iPhone, making requests for contact between herself and X, contact between her family members and X and making requests to attend school at the various school events, including the nativity play and, more recently, the sports day.</p>

The resources which have been deployed in an attempt to keep the children of the school away from the material on the internet is having an adverse effect upon them, is significant and of monumental importance.

There will, however, come a time when that material will be available to X, which I&#160;am of the opinion is extremely damaging.  The impact of the current situation on Mr.&#160;Tune is clearly impacting on him greatly and in turn his &#8230; his presentation at the present time is also likely to affect X.&#8221;</p>

I&#160;am, therefore, entirely satisfied that an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> is justified, appropriate and proportionate.  The mother is not prevented by it from negotiating contact with the local authority.  If she has a reasonable application to be placed before the court, she will be heard.  Thus, although the order represents a breach of her ECHR rights, I&#160;am satisfied that in the interests of X a respite of litigation is required and the order is proportionate.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Victoria Haigh and David Tune married in May 2003 and their daughter, X was also born in that year.  X appeared to have every advantage in life.  The parents had both enjoyed successful sporting careers, they had a comfortable home and X was greatly loved by both of them.  Sadly, by 2004 the parents began to experience difficulties in their marriage.  In January 2005 Mr Tune vacated the former matrimonial home.  At the early stages of the separation X had the benefit of frequent contact with her father, including overnight stays.   In March 2005 Mr Tune began employment in Brussels but returned each weekend in order to exercise his overnight contact with X.   X and her father also spoke daily on the telephone.</p>

A series of court orders made throughout 2006 sought to restore the contact in line with the expectations of both parents. The attachment of a penal notice to a Court order of 8 December 2006 evidences that the mother was still resistant to the Court ordered contact regime. She in fact assaulted the father at that Court hearing for which she received a formal caution.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On the day of that hearing Ms Haigh also made the first allegation of sexual abuse by Mr Tune against his daughter to Doncaster Social Services, followed 12 days later by a fresh application to the Court for permission to deny contact whilst her allegations were investigated.  Thus began a continuing series of similar allegations. Each was taken seriously by the guardian ad litem, the Local Authority and the Court. Each was investigated by either Doncaster or Nottinghamshire social workers under their Child Protection procedures alongside the Police. Each time a fresh allegation was made by Ms Haigh, X&#8217;s contact with her father was either suspended or only took place supervised by a social worker. On each occasion the investigations provided no evidence of sexual abuse but following the reinstatement of the father&#8217;s contact a fresh allegation was in due course forthcoming from the mother resulting in a further period of contact suspension and a new investigation. In addition, Ms Haigh was invited, on three occasions, to present evidence for her allegations to be investigated by the court but on each occasion she either did not attend or did attend but produced no evidence.    Ms Haigh has, however, not always been consistent as to her own beliefs.   She has in the past told the Court that she was &#8220;totally wrong about the sexual abuse allegations&#8221;, claiming that she may have overreacted to innocent or innocuous behaviour. She now tells me that this was untrue.</p>

At that hearing, which lasted two weeks, the mother was represented by Counsel.  It is important to note that the mother&#8217;s own case was <span style="font-weight:bold">not</span> that  X had been sexually abused but that allegations of sexual abuse, by this stage coming from X herself, were a reaction to the stressful relationships around her.   In terms it was submitted, on the mother&#8217;s behalf, X was saying things &#8220;she thinks the adults want to hear&#8221;.  By the adults, this, of course, could only have meant the mother.  The Judge at that hearing gave Ms Haigh every opportunity to present a case that X had been abused, if that was what she believed, but Ms Haigh chose not to.</p>

He found Ms Haigh had been disingenuous in the way she ran her case.  It was, he said, pursued to achieve &#8216;tactical advantage&#8217;.   The Judge found that Ms Haigh had &#8216;coached&#8217; X into making her allegations of sexual abuse.    Specifically, the Judge concluded that the allegations originated in the mind of the mother and were <span style="font-weight:bold">false allegations</span>. Such was the evidence available to the Judge that he was able &#8216;inevitably&#8217;, as he termed it, to conclude that X had <span style="font-weight:bold">not</span> been sexually abused.</p>

X as the Judge found, had been &#8216;excessively&#8217; and &#8216;inappropriately&#8217; questioned about possible abuse which actually sent unmistakable signals to X that &#8216;disclosure&#8217; would be something that would please her mother.   The Judge found undoubted influence of the mother in some of X&#8217;s statements.   Analysing the chronology of the allegations over a three year period, the Judge found that they correlated closely with the course of the protracted legal proceedings and had been deployed by the mother &#8220;manipulatively to support her case&#8221;.   The consequence, the Judge concluded, was that X had repeatedly incurred unnecessary and &#8216;potentially distressing&#8217; intrusions into her life by professionals.   The allegations had resulted in a cessation of X&#8217;s contact to her father and the process had, in this way, been emotionally harmful to her.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding his findings His Honour Judge Robertshaw did not make immediate provision  to transfer of X&#8217;s care to the father. Rather he adopted a holding position of X living with her grandmother.  Whilst viewing the mother&#8217;s conduct as &#8216;deplorable&#8217;, the Judge was careful to recognise that the paramount concern of the Court was X herself.  The responsibility and privilege of caring for her was not to be determined on the basis of a reward for unimpeachable parental conduct nor withdrawn as a punishment for a parent who had caused harm to a child.   It was to be determined, as it always is in the Family Court, by reference to the welfare criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref> and .1(3) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> where the interests of the child remain the paramount consideration. As the Judge put it, in terms easily accessible to the parties themselves, &#8220;Frustration at her [the mother&#8217;s] past deplorable conduct must not be allowed to obscure the fact that the issue is welfare&#8221;.  The Judge made it clear, however, that X had a right to a relationship with both parents and that ultimately the Court might view it as necessary to transfer X&#8217;s care to the parent who would allow her a relationship with both.  This observation could not have been clearer or more child focused. </p>

However, Ms Haigh has been unable to accept the findings, despite her ambivalence as to their reliability within the litigation itself.  In due course His Honour Judge Jones was asked to determine the question as to where X should live following a full assessment of both parents including a psychological assessment of Ms Haigh.   In his Judgment of the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2010, Judge Jones found Ms Haigh to be &#8216;untruthful&#8217; and &#8216;entrenched&#8217; in her position.  He also found that the mother had continued to influence X and to manipulate her feelings whilst in effect &#8216;placing her own as the priority&#8217;.</p>

The mother, Judge Jones found, had been &#8220;intransigent&#8221; in her response to the Court&#8217;s findings and &#8220;intemperate&#8221; in her reaction to the Local Authority&#8217;s involvement.    He recognised that Ms Haigh &#8220;cares for X deeply&#8221; but emphasised &#8220;she is demonstrating little insight into X&#8217;s real needs and is failing to prioritise these over her own&#8221;.   Foreshadowing the difficulties that were to come, the Judge observed if she [Ms Haigh] continues on her present course, she runs the risk of alienating her daughter and permanently damaging their relationship&#8221;.  The Judge considered &#8220;that would be a great loss for X (as everyone, including the father, acknowledges)&#8221; and expressed the hope that it would be a &#8220;consequence which the mother, on further reflection will seek to avoid&#8221;.</p>

The mother advised the Court that she had sought out and received extensive therapeutic counselling, though no evidence of it was placed before the Court on her behalf.   In her own account in evidence she said that at times during  the litigation she  recognised that she had been &#8220;a very poorly lady&#8221;.</p>

This, of course, reinforces the Court&#8217;s own conclusion that the mother&#8217;s position during the litigation had itself had been disingenuous and tactical.  Following the transfer of X to her father&#8217;s care, Ms Haigh became fixated on what by now had plainly become, in her own mind, a profound injustice.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Despite all that had happened Social Services considered that it was important to try to promote the relationship between X and her mother and provided contact facilities with that objective in mind.  Inevitably, in the light of the Court&#8217;s findings, that could only take place with a Social Worker present.   It requires little imagination to recognise that contact for parents in such circumstances may be very difficult and artificial.   From the child&#8217;s perspective, however, it may prove to be reassuring and comforting.   Parents who are able to appreciate this can, even within these limitations, contrive to ensure that contact is an enjoyable experience.   Ms Haigh was unable to do this and decided that she would not see X at all in these circumstances.   The Social Services wrote to Ms Haigh informing her of X&#8217;s wish to see her mother and her concern that contact was not occurring but Ms Haigh&#8217;s view was fixed and contact ceased.  </p>

She has recruited a number of individuals to assist her in that campaign and there is much information on the internet about X which is in breach of the injunctive remedies the Court has put in place in its concern to protect X&#8217;s privacy.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Perhaps most disturbingly Ms Haigh has caused profound difficulties for X at her school.  The school has informed the Court that some, if not most, of the parents whose children attend X&#8217;s primary school have an understanding of the allegations made by Ms Haigh that are placed on the web.   On the 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011, Ms Haigh emailed several of the parents whose children attend at that school via the school contact list, (which she had obtained) inviting them to visit her webpage.  This is a website primarily devoted to this case.  It directs the reader by hyperlink to X&#8217;s police interviews with the heading: <span style="font-weight:bold">VICKY HAIGH:  REQUESTING HER DAUGHTER TO RETURN FROM HER PAEDOPHILE FATHER AND DONCASTER &#8220;SOCIAL&#8221; SERVICES </span>.  The site also extends it scope to a campaign against &#8220;secrecy&#8221; in the Family Justice System.   Ms Haigh has started a petition on this issue which as of the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July had 594 signatures.<span style="font-weight:bold"/>  It seems some of the parents may have followed the invitation and have gained access to material which includes extracts of X&#8217;s interviews to the police.  The school informs the Court that the resources which have been deployed in an attempt to keep the other children away from the material on the internet has been significant and indeed of &#8220;monumental proportions&#8221;.   Teaching time has been considerably affected as a result of the actions taken by Ms Haigh and great pressure is placed on staff.  The Head Teacher has expressed the view that the current proceedings and actions by Ms Haigh in terms of the material that is on the internet, is extremely damaging for a child of X&#8217;s age:   </p>

In addition to the direct harm that causes to X and her father, it is perhaps important to remember that the material will be read by many different people with differing motivations.    There are those who will read it for their own sexual gratification, victimising X in the process.   The mother seems to be entirely unable to understand or empathise with the consequences to X of these actions.   Her ability to focus on her child&#8217;s needs have, in the Local Authority&#8217;s analysis, been thoroughly exploited by a number of fanatical campaigners with whom the mother has been in contact.</p>

This position has been supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian although he does not agree to X being named.  It is ironic, of course, that the mother has complained about the privacy of the Family Court process and has historically argued for greater openness.   Realising that the professionals in the case would be bound by their respect for X&#8217;s privacy, the mother has utilised this to promote her own distorted view of the case which she has been able to advance thus far, unopposed by the true facts. </p>
