	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my second judgment in proceedings concerning the child Z now 11 years old. There have been other judgments in Family Law Act (FLA) 1996 and Children Act (CA) 1989 proceedings; indeed, as observed in the judgment of this Court in 2017 there have been proceedings in respect of the arrangements for this child since December 2013 and for most of her life, beginning when she was only two and three quarters, she has been the subject of applications brought by her parents. The background and history of Z and her family have been set out in full in the previous judgment and can be seen in <span style="font-style:italic">Z (A Child) (FGMPO: Prevalence of FGM)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/3566" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 3566 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 3566 (Fam)</ref> (06 November 2017)<a class="Hyperlink" href="url:http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2017/3566">URL:http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2017/3566</a>. Z, who was born in England, is of dual heritage. Her maternal background and heritage are white English and Roman Catholic (her mother is not a practising Catholic) and her paternal background and heritage is black African and Islamic, her father, who is a devout Muslim, is from the Fulah community in Guinea, West Africa.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings in respect of Z and her parents originated eight years ago when an application for protective relief was issued by M (Z&#8217;s mother) under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1996</ref> in the Family Court at Bromley in May 2014. It was heard by District Judge Brooks who made findings of domestic abuse against F (Z&#8217;s father); as a result of which an occupation order was made in favour of M who remained living in the former family home with Z. Z has always lived with M and at all times has continued to live in her mother&#8217;s care in England. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> proceedings in respect of the arrangements for Z were originally issued and to place in the Family Court at Bromley. Central to the 2017 applications in The Royal Courts of Justice was the issue of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) first raised in the proceedings in 2014. Z was represented in those proceedings which were transferred to be heard in this Court to deal with that issue and the applications for FGM Protection Orders (FGMPO). The Court heard expert evidence, video evidence from F&#8217;s family in Guinea. Findings were made of the very high prevalence of FGM in that country (around 96% according to the UN&#8217;s analysis and the expert evidence before the Court) and the consequent likelihood that F&#8217;s family will want to have Z &#8220;cut&#8221; or mutilated as a female child of the family.  Z&#8217;s guardian supported there being restrictions on overseas travel with her father in place until Z reaches the age of sixteen and an FGMPO was made in those terms along with an order permitting Z to make an application on her own behalf at the age of 13 should she so wish. The case was transferred back to the Family Court at Bromley where further proceedings took place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F now applies to have the FGMPO set aside to allow him to take Z to Guinea, in much the same terms as he did previously; namely, he says, to allow Z to have contact with the paternal family and her Guinean heritage. He seeks to have his contact with Z increased although this is against Z&#8217;s expressed wishes. His applications are opposed by M and by those representing Z through her Cafcass guardian, Ms Heather Davies. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment will not repeat the history and chronology set out in the previous judgment. Nonetheless, while it has been recurring issue in the proceedings, including those before me in 2017, that F seeks to increase contact these repeated attempts have now become of concern because they are being made contrary to what Z herself has said and include complaints that F is continually seeking to involve her in the proceedings. When considered against a background of F&#8217;s repeated refusal to accept the previous findings of the Family Courts, his continued discussion of those decisions with Z (despite his expressly telling the court he would not do so in 2018) and with his continuous denigration of M, his application to increase contact against Z&#8217;s wishes of M can be seen as part of his emotional manipulation of Z as will be seen below. It is a matter of fact and part of the evidence before this Court that F has repeatedly attempted to go behind previous decision and sought to have the Court reopen or retry the findings in respect of his abusive behaviour towards M. This is despite his attendance at domestic abuse and parenting programmes. The latter have apparently failed to convince F to address the risks of emotional harm to Z by his failure to listen to Z or acknowledge the import of what she is saying; I shall return to this too in greater detail below. Even following the proceedings in 2017 when the time to be spent by Z with F (contact) was set out in an order, including staying and/or holiday contact (which was to increase as she got older) but their were difficulties with contact and the case returned to this Court in 2018.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is part of F&#8217;s case and a longstanding and repeated complaint that he has been side-lined and badly treated, but his complaints have to be considered in in the context of his equally longstanding refusal to accept responsibility for his behaviour towards M. I was reminded by Ms Bradley, Z&#8217;s counsel, of the interim DVIP report filed seven years ago on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2015 which reported (at paragraph 8) that F, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">is invested in presenting himself as a victim of the situation&#8230;He has been observed to project his sense of injustice on to [Z], stating that [Z] is suffering, when in fact, it is he who feels wronged, disrespected or disregarded by his ex-partner&#8217;s actions.&#8221;</span> On 20th May 2015 the final DVIP report filed; while F had admitted pushing M against a wall or the floor on 6 to 10 occasions and having <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;hurt her sexually&#8221;</span> on 3 to 5 occasions F had not considered this to be violence and it was reported that F had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;continued to take this attitude &#8211; despite the material covered in the programme &#8211; that this did not constitute violence. All of the facilitators who worked with the father noted how he brought even unrelated matters back to the issue of finances, effectively portraying himself as a victim.&#8221;</span> This pattern of behaviour has continued and it has remained his position that he has been victimised. F has remained unable or unwilling to accept accountability for his abuse of M and the violence he used against her as being a result of his own behaviour and the report concluded that in respect of any decisions regarding future contact arrangements between F and Z should take, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;serious account of the difficulty [F] has in separating out his interests from those of [Z], and the potential for ongoing emotional abuse and financially controlling behaviour, given that these will carry negative consequences for [Z&#8217;s] emotional and physical wellbeing.&#8221;</span> Having considered the subsequent events and evidence this conclusions contained in this report remain unchanged and relevant in 2022. </p>

When the proceedings were returned to the Family Court at Bromley there were further <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> applications made in 2018, 2019 and 2021. Principally these consisted of cross-applications in respect of contact , by F to increase it and by M seeking to reduce it or oppose his applications. There was an additional application in respect of Z&#8217;s schooling which is no longer in issue before this Court. In fact Z has done very well in her primary school despite the conflict between F and M: F had objected to Z being moved to a Catholic faith school and had wanted Z to attend a non-faith school. In any event she is now due to go to secondary school in September 2022.</p>

There is a degree of hypocrisy in F&#8217;s complaints, he himself has chosen to make England his home and it is where his daughter lives and is being brought up. While it is understandable that he is anxious that Z should be aware of and proud of her Guinean heritage F is now using a legitimate concern as part of the pattern of his controlling behaviour. As her guardian observed F&#8217;s actions and notably his objection <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to [Z] taking part in prayers and religious events in her new Catholic school, have served to override and disregard the child&#8217;s wishes, and he refuses to accept [Z&#8217;s] views as her own genuinely held views, devoid of her mother&#8217;s influence. As such, [Z] feels unable to discuss these matters with her father, anxious about provoking an angry response, as she knows that it is a sensitive issue</span> (for him) (my parenthesis)&#8221; As long as three years ago there was evidence was of Z, then aged eight, propitiating her father&#8217;s feelings and of subjugating her feelings to his and that she felt that she needed to take responsibility for placating him; this manipulation is redolent of controlling behaviour and the clearest example of emotional coercion. </p>

Despite this warning F had demonstrated little, if anything, in his approach to Z and her wishes and feelings to show he heeded Ms Roddy&#8217;s helpful advice. In fact Z is now, in 2022, being so undermined by F that, according to her guardian&#8217;s evidence, Z has become inhibited and compromised in her ability openly to express any view contrary to F&#8217;s. To return to 2018 at the time, on the guardian&#8217;s recommendation the case was adjourned for three months during which Z was to have some supportive work and F was to attend a 6-session parenting programme. </p>

It is notable that on leaving the meeting F was unable or unwilling to make any attempt to greet M who was waiting outside. Whether F&#8217;s expressions of regret and apology made to Z in Ms Roddy&#8217;s presence were genuine or an act of expediency is impossible to say but it is a matter of fact that F has once again tried to re-open past decisions of the court, clearly does not accept the findings that have been made in the past and blames M for what he perceives and claims to be unfavourable and unfair treatment of him in the proceedings. There can be little, if any, doubt that F has continued to make his views clear to Z. She has told this to her guardian, despite his attempts to silence her and to influence what Z says to others. This pernicious behaviour of F has been evident for many years and, from Z&#8217;s perspective, was exemplified in the occasion that he retained Z during her school holidays in the summer of 2020.</p>

Z herself had spoken to her guardian of her memories of F shouting at her mother and the fear that engendered.

Unprompted Z has told her present guardian Ms Davies about going to spend an extended time on holiday with F in the summer of 2020 about which she had worried so much that she became physically unwell. M described in her oral evidence to me that Z had been retching and vomiting at the prospect of this first extended stay. Her mother told F that Z was too unwell to come but F&#8217;s response was to call the both the Police and London Ambulance Service. It was agreed between Police, F and M that he would return Z home the next day and take her out for a few hours, but when F took Z away and she was not returned home for six days. Z had wanted to contact her mother but had had to contact her secretly. Z explained to her guardian that she felt lucky that she had been able to remember her mother&#8217;s phone number and she had had to send a secret text to M which she had then deleted, to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;hide the evidence.&#8221;</span></p>

M said that it took nine months for Z to rebuild some trust in her father and that while the trust Z has in F has improved since 2020, Z still does not feel as safe as she should feel with her parent; her guardian rightly concluded that Z&#8217;s reference to it in the context of these proceedings emphasised the deep pain caused to the child by F&#8217;s behaviour and how it has eroded her trust in him; it remains unrestored. </p>

Cafcass Officers are trained and experienced in assessing whether children are able to speak freely or whether a parent is influencing them. The assessment of Ms Davies was that, unlike the increasingly guarded approach Z has talking about F, Z has been observed to be happy and relaxed to talk about her mother and felt able to criticize M; for example by saying that she was embarrassed by her mother kissing her when she dropped her off at school and that sometimes Z prefers to talk to her auntie about matters that trouble her. Moreover, Z&#8217;s solicitor is a respected and very experienced children&#8217;s solicitor who has had to speak to Z as her legal representative. In fact the objective evidence in respect of concerns of any malign influence on, or interference with, Z&#8217;s ability to express her own wishes and feelings have emanated from F and not from M. When considered in the light of all the evidence (as set out in this judgment) I must dismiss his complaints as no more that part of his attempt to undermine what his daughter is saying and to cast doubt on her veracity.</p>

Z told the guardian she has had to say <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;sorry&#8221;</span> to F for everything that she had shared with her guardian; when asked if she was, in fact, sorry and Z said she did not know. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Most serious were what Z said about being unable to communicate with others, including in particular her own mother, when with F. Z  had told the guardian that she shouldn&#8217;t have said to the guardian that she had sent text messages to her Mum when she was with F in the summer of 2020 and that she is sorry about that, but if Z is sorry there is absolutely no reason at all why she should be made to feel apologetic about the fact that she had contacted her mother to reassure her, in doing so she acted out of concern for M, and F should never had put Z in the position of having to hide it from him. Moreover F did this after he kept Z away from her mother against her wishes, and having told the Police he would return her home within hours. Taken in context of F behaviour towards Z overall there can only be substantial concern about the nature of his conduct as a parent and in respect of Z&#8217;s safety. If, for example, she were to be abroad with F there would be nothing to stop him taking her on to Guinea and the evidence is that his word cannot be relied on when he considers himself to he in the right. If F took her on to Guinea it would be against her will and F has repeatedly demonstrated that he cannot be trusted to listen to, or act on Z&#8217;s wishes, added to which Z does not trust him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From Z&#8217;s perspective and as far as she is aware F has not, cannot or will not, sympathise or empathise with Z&#8217;s feelings or understand things from her point of view. It&#8217;s Z&#8217;s experience that he ignores her wishes and feeling or overrides them. In early 2022 Ms Davies had asked Z whether she thought F could put himself in her shoes and she had said <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;no.&#8221;</span>  Z said that once proceedings are over, if she needs to talk to someone, she has friends, her auntie, her Mum and sometimes F. The guardian reminded her that she could also speak to teachers in school. The Court is concerned that the fact that Z knows that some, if not all, of what she says about F would get back to him, as professionals have had  to disclose what she has said in the past and it has now inhibited her from speaking freely. This inhibition on speaking out is precisely analogous to the emotional threats employed by perpetrators of child abuse.</p>

Far from taking the opportunity so close to a substantive hearing of F&#8217;s own applications to demonstrate to the Court that  he was able to listen to his daughter&#8217;s wishes and consider her feelings F then sought to increase the conflict by drawing the guardian into it. When the guardian spoke to F on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February to ask him to stop talking about the proceedings to Z, F responded by accusing the guardian of telling him not to talk to Z about her paternal family; there is no evidence before this Court on which to base such an accusation. Although F accepted that he had been talking to Z about the court proceedings he denied talking about the contents of the guardian&#8217;s report.

Her guardian told Z that she would need to tell someone and asked if would she feel comfortable telling someone? Z said she could tell her Mum. The guardian said it could be followed up with Court or Children&#8217;s Services, and Ms Davies would speak to Z&#8217;s solicitor. It is most likely that Z was concerned about F repeating his past behaviour and would have been worried who would be responsible for stopping him; and who would be responsible for reporting anything F did contrary to the orders of the court in any event. It was notable that Z had then asked her guardian if she remembered Z telling her something (very minor) during a previous call about school and that Z had asked the guardian not to tell F because she preferred him not to know. Ms Davies told Z that these things were worrying because as Z grows up she will make her own independent choices but she feels she cannot talk to F about them. This had led to a conversation about the importance of having a happy and healthy relationship with F and the possible continued the intervention of Cafcass. This conversation between Z and her guardian as reported by Ms Davies demonstrates more than Z not being able to talk to F; it is evidence that she feels unable to share things with professionals freely and openly because of the ramifications for her if her father is informed of their content.</p>

The rules of procedure apply equally to unrepresented parties, for, as has been observed elsewhere, to do otherwise would place represented parties at a disadvantage. The &#8220;expert&#8221;, said by F to be a diplomat from Guinea holding a post in the United Kingdom, may have been able to give some authoritative evidence to the Court in respect of the Guinean Government&#8217;s position and procedure in respect of FGM nationally but unless suitably qualified could not give any independent nor expert in respect of any specialist area of social and cultural conventions and/or practice specifically about FGM or the law in Guinea.

The issue of FGM had been dealt with comprehensively on a previous occasion and that judgment stands, it was the view of those representing Z, a view with which I must agree, that the predominant issue was now F&#8217;s conduct and his behaviour as a parent. </p>

As recently as 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February F had been adamant that Z should remain with him during the up-coming hearing despite the fact that he would have to attend court (albeit remotely) leaving Z on her own in another room in his home.

Z&#8217;s reasoning was impeccable (and consistent with the s7 Report filed in October 2021) when she said that, although F believed she spends more weekends with M, she herself feels that her weekends are split three ways between M, F and her friends. Even when in her mother&#8217;s care at the weekends much of the time is spent with friends who Z knows from school and live locally. It is clear to the Court that F&#8217;s grievances and his pursuit of fortnightly weekend staying contact have nothing to do with Z&#8217;s feelings and the practicality her life and that he is focussed not on her best interests but on the grievances that he has nursed for years in respect of his desire for shared care.   </p>

Z said that when she travelled to and from abroad once on Eurostar, no one checked in with her at all. These are pertinent observations and are in keeping the regrettable practice of checking inbound rather than outbound travellers. It is a matter that needs attention at a higher level and is not the subject of this judgment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When, unprompted Z told the guardian, about spending time on holiday with F, about the events in 2020 when she was due to have an extended stay with F she described how she worried about it so much she it had made her ill. I find, as a matter of common sense, that it is clear the symptoms she was suffering, which included vomiting and stomach ache, were physical manifestations of the anxiety she was feeling about staying with her father. Far from displaying any concern, let alone sensitivity, F chose to increase the conflict and distress for Z by calling the police and London Ambulance Service. It had agreed been between the police and Z&#8217;s parents that F would return the next day and take Z out for a few hours. It was the guardian&#8217;s view, and it is with one which I agree, that in raising this at that time and in context of these proceedings Z demonstrated that her trust in F has not been restored. On any view, but particularly that of his own child, F failed to keep his word and did not return her, and from Z&#8217;s point of view she had no choice but to stay with him for six days. There can be little wonder that the guardian has since observed this event undermined Z&#8217;s trust in F, the lack of trust is based on an incident which is undisputed on the facts, and the effects of which, I find, remain with Z to date.</p>

F&#8217;s view is that he did nothing wrong, he had kept with him for the days allowed him by the court order, is simplistic and fails to take into account the effects of his actions on Z. It is a matter of fact, as reported by the guardian, and in his evidence to this Court that F has shown no remorse and little or no insight into the impact that this has had on Z. F has failed to recognise that he has effectively undermined his relationship with Z and her trust in him as her father, by his own action.  Or that his behaviour towards Z has become of even greater concern during the currency of these proceedings. </p>

Z was aware that her conversations with her guardian was going to be shared with the Court and with F in the guardian&#8217;s report. By way of explanation Z told her guardian that in the past when she had had participated in direct written work F had become cross or upset with what she had written. The guardian surmised that Z recognised that if something is handwritten or drawn by her she had no way of denying it if F then questioned her about it. Z said that F did not necessarily become angry but he does think he knows better than her and that he sometimes shouts. Z told the guardian that she does not like F saying her thoughts are influenced by M as she does not agree, and that while M does not talk about the court proceedings, F did so often. </p>

It is the Court&#8217;s view a more apposite view in respect of F&#8217;s desired participation in Z&#8217;s upbringing would be that he wishes to have greater control over it and Z herself. Z has described herself to the guardian as half-Christian and half-Muslim. Although Z attends a Catholic primary school she said she would consider her Christian beliefs to be more Methodist, demonstrating her that she has thought carefully about her religion and religious observance. Z has some schoolmates who are also Muslim but the school has only provided a limited religious education and as such, Z said she has learnt more about the Qur&#8217;an from F, but that, as Z told the guardian, she finds it upsetting when F has told her that Christianity is the wrong faith. </p>

I find it more likely than not that F had told Z that Christianity is the wrong faith, but even if he has not the message that he is giving her by his actions are that he is at the very least antipathetic, if not antagonistic, towards the Christian faith because Z has also told her guardian that she was worried that her own ties to Christianity are upsetting for F. The guardian&#8217;s view that this demonstrated Z&#8217;s anxiety around pleasing F, who, in return has not demonstrated that he recognised that Z has dual religious heritage and that his words and actions impact her. I agree and consider it is one aspect of his overriding conviction that he is in the right, while in fact he is again behaving in exactly the way he has accused M of behaving.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The guardian considered that in her describing of her parents, Z had provided and demonstrated balance. Z had been critical of F in terms of how he spoke about religion, the proceedings and her mother, but she had been positive about the time she spent with F. Z said that she did not like it when M deliberately embarrasses her and had she gave some age-appropriate examples, such as M giving her a kiss outside school. She enjoys spending time with her mother and her maternal aunt (Auntie X) and she likes that M does not talk about Court. In this analysis I consider that the guardian has failed sufficiently to reflect an imbalance in that Z is able to talk about her mother much more freely, and crucially does not feel the need to propitiate her mother&#8217;s feelings or tailor her words to avoid later conflict with M. In short it is evidence that Z&#8217;s relationship with her mother is healthier and more child focussed.</p>

More than that F&#8217;s stated view was that as Z will have to have pain and injections in life and she needs to get over it. I find this to be another example of his need to dictate what Z does taking priority over Z&#8217;s welfare. In respect of Z&#8217;s individuality as a person of dual heritage Z is entitled to feel differently on this (and many other) issues from her father. In taking issue over the question and in attempting to dictate what she does using and in using his religion as part of his rationale F has chosen deliberately to ignore Z&#8217;s wishes and feelings and so to over-ride her ability to form her own view as a person of dual heritage. </p>

Regrettably, his actions - borne partly from his frustration - in terms of his objections to [Z&#8217;s] taking part in prayers and religious events in her new Catholic school, have served to override and disregard the child&#8217;s wishes, and he refuses to accept [Z&#8217;s] views as her own genuinely held views, devoid of her mother&#8217;s influence.

This Z has done but she has chosen not told the guardian what happened as she did not want her decision to be disclosed to F; and this is not the only instance of Z not wanting to tell her father, or have him find out, about her life because of his reaction and behaviour towards her when he disapproves. As F&#8217;s disapproval has been a constant theme in Z&#8217;s relationship with him she is more likely than not to choose to tell him less and less as she grows older, thus he will continued to alienate her. While of itself the most serious question or issue un respect of medical treatment it is of concern as illustrative of F&#8217;s belligerent approach to decisions concerning Z more generally and, in particular of his interference with Z&#8217;s rights in respect of what happens to her body.

I find that this is likely given that F had then gone further by making a complaint against the guardian which is strongly suggestive, if not indicative of his an inability to accept any challenge or opposition to his own views in respect of Z. Further evidence of his intransigence can be seen in his short-lived acceptance of the advice given on parenting courses and by previous guardians.

In the guardian&#8217;s view F is unable to see Z as someone independent of himself. Ms Davies recommended supervision as the only way that the weight and pressure put on Z by F could be taken away. A professional contact supervisor would be able to intervene and so release Z from having to exercise that vigilance herself. This vigilance was illustrated by M in her evidence when she described Z as pretending to be someone else when she is with F, and of Z needing to be constantly mindful of the repercussions from F. M said, more in sorrow than in anger, that she does not believe that F gets to see the real Z who never stops talking when with her mother, and yet, because she is so guarded with the information she chooses to give F, she is not her normal self when she is with him. It is notable that the evidence of M is supported by the examples of Z choosing not to tell the guardian about things that might have repercussions for her later with her father such as about the flu vaccine and some other minor matters to do with school. </p>

It is the Court&#8217;s conclusion that F abuses Z&#8217;s care for him and loyalty to him as her father by behaving inappropriately and continuing to discuss the proceedings with her, even after he has been told and ordered not to do so. to try to gain her support in his continuous conflict with M. His conduct amounts to abusive emotional manipulation and it is clear from what Z <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">has</span> been able to say that she has misgivings about the contact and the arrangements; for example the Court was told that in contrast to her previous enthusiasm about travelling to Bournemouth with him she now raises concerns about having to share a room with F and how to deal with it. Z&#8217;s getting older and F&#8217;s recent behaviour demonstrates that as he is unable to recognise that as an older child Z not only should she voice her own opinion but also that this will only increase with her age, based on the evidence before me, F is most unlikely be able to recognise, let alone appropriately nurture, the growing need for independence in an adolescent.

Further, and most worryingly, F has not acted appropriately or in a child-centred way when Z is ill, not only in 2020 when she was physically sick at the prospect of contact with him over a longer period, but more recently when he insisted that he collect her for contact when she was still testing positive for coronavirus and did not feel well. In both instances F chose to force contact to go ahead putting his determination that Z should spend time with him ahead of the child&#8217;s comfort and well-being and so demonstrating, I find, his preoccupation with his own needs, including his need to dominate and control, over the welfare of his child. </p>

F has continually repeated the same pattern, ignoring what Z has said, blaming M, denigrating and vilifying M and seeking to redress and re-open decisions made by the courts over a period of many years, nothing in the evidence before the Court suggests that F would ever give Z the freedom to come to her own conclusions or make her own decisions.

This concern, as can be seen above, was trailed by previous guardians. It is significant, in the guardian&#8217;s view, that while Z has consistently said that she is happy with the time she spends with F to remain the same, she has never expressed any wish to spend more time with him, and the present guardian has concluded that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;this is Z&#8217;s way of taking the path of least resistance, averting any exploration of her wishes and feelings (which could lead to offending her father), and distancing herself from conflict and challenge in an attempt to avoid any confrontation with her father.&#8221; </span>Given F&#8217;s conduct and the unrelenting pressure he has applied on Z, along with his repeated invalidation of her views as those of Z herself, I find that the guardian could not have safely reached any other conclusion. </p>

While I accept and acknowledge that he feels aggrieved and have heard his complaints he has been side-lined, his inability or unwillingness to accept the previous fundings and decisions made by the Court led not only to his failure to address the live issues but also, and more pertinently, have served to undermine his relationship with his daughter and to have caused her hurt, pain, distress and emotional harm. In an effort to place the blame for what his daughter says about contact and about him on M F has repeatedly ignored or overridden Z&#8217;s wishes and feelings, has undermined her growing autonomy and freedom to express herself, thus damaging Z&#8217;s relationship with him and to her having lost her trust in him.</p>

F has been offered counsel by three experienced Cafcass guardians, he has attended a domestic abuse programme, he has attended two courses on parenting, but they have had limited effect as there has been a continuous and repeated pattern of his briefly appearing to acknowledge deficiencies in his parenting and accepting the findings of the courts only to return to the position that he had taken up at the outset of the  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1996</ref> proceedings in 2013.

Instead of taking the opportunity demonstrate to the Court his understanding and care for his child he again insisted that what she was saying should be ignored despite the fact that what she had asked for was sensible and favoured neither parent. Z should have been praised for her approach and not again been made the subject of his disapproval. In his oral evidence F finally acknowledged it would not have been pleasant for Z but he was unable to explain why he had resisted her request to stay elsewhere.

In respect of the latter, when F was asked about going through her bag he was markedly stubborn in being unable to accept that going through her bag and belongings amounted to an unnecessary intrusion into her privacy. Z is now 11 and pubescent, it is easy to imagine that there are items in her bag that she may not wish F to be examining or even see, but he showed no recognition at all of that fact nor to accept that he would have to step back as she grew older. In fact there can be no need at all for F to go through her bag when she visits on a Tuesday after school but he was adamant and refused to accept this in evidence saying that it was his right and duty as a parent to do so.</p>

F proffered no evidence that different from that which he had put forward in 2017; there was no evidence of additional safeguards or from his family. Moreover he gave no evidence to support his claims of being side-lined, all his previous applications had been heard and fully considered by the court, in reality his complaints are based on the fact that he does not accept the courts&#8217; decisions.

When she was a younger child, judging from the earlier guardians&#8217; reports, Z was much more positive and less ambivalent about being with F and had tended to accept his version of events, but as Z has grown and developed her own views (not least about her mother) F has increasing put pressure on her to force her into taking his side. F has been dismissive and undermining both of M and the maternal half of Z&#8217;s dual nationality. From what Z has told the guardian she has now baulked against his accusations that M is putting words in her mouth. When pressed in evidence F stopped short of saying that Z was lying, but that was the import and implicit in his evidence. There is no doubt F has always considers that he should play a much greater part and role in Z&#8217;s life, but the evidence is that in fact he seeks to have the dominate role and is set upon achieving that domination as a parent by attempting to manipulate and control Z. F refused even to contemplate that his repeated assertions that Z is being manipulated by her mother and that she is not saying whet she herself believes while part of that manipulation is undermining of Z as a person. F insistence that Z should spend more time with him despite the fact she has said she does not want to, that he should take her overseas and to Guinea despite the fact she doesn&#8217;t want to go and his rejection the assurance that the FGMPO provides Z are all evidence of his inability to put her welfare before his own needs and wishes.

This is plainly not the case. There are no restrictions on his travel, if he choses not to travel that is his choice alone. The conduct of officials at passport control on entry to the UK is not at issue here, nor is a matter on which this Court can adjudicate. The issue is whether or not the facts and evidence before the Court require the FGMPO to remain as ordered, be varied or be discharged. For reasons expanded on above and below the order will be varied only to discharge that part which allowed Z to apply to travel with F at the age of thirteen. This limited variation in the FGMPO is what Z herself wants and is in line with the guardian&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

The Court has no independent evidence as to whether or not F holds or has applied for valid UK or Guinean passports. If F has no valid passport and does not intend to apply for one, which is what he told to the Court, it is then by his own decision and inaction he will be unable to travel and there can be no inconvenience caused.

The fact that in February 2022 Z&#8217;s representatives had to make an application to the Court, in the face of F&#8217;s intransigence, as a direct result of Z&#8217;s wish to avoid F&#8217;s behaviour and the pressure he would have placed her under at the time of the court hearing is proof of his continuing to discuss the case with Z. At the time she said in striking terms, as quoted above, that she did not want her father to talk to her about court again, ever. When on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2022 the Court ordered F not to discuss the case with Z he continued to do so. Not only has he indicated to the guardian that he spoke to Z about the proceedings, Z herself was aware of the prohibition in the court order and on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2022 she asked her guardian what would happen after the proceedings if F continued to talk about court. From the anxiety expressed by Z it is proper to infer that F not only continued to talk about the proceedings to Z and but also that she thought he would be likely to do so in the future. It led Z to become aware that it was she who would have to, as her guardian put it,<span style="font-style:italic"/>raise the alarm or nothing would happen to stop F.<span style="font-style:italic"/>As the guardian rightly opined, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">This wrongly places a heavy emotional burden on Z,&#8221; </span>It is a burden that had been placed on Z by F.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F has, I find, repeatedly and continuously, over many years denigrated M to their daughter. This finding is congruent with his own evidence to the Court in respect of M. The denigration has extended to the religion and heritage that Z inherits from her mother. Z is very much aware of this and it has caused her upset and distress; she has had to adapt her behaviour when with her father to try to cope with him and contain his displeasure. It is not her responsibility to dealt with F in this way; it is the duty of the adults in her life and ultimately, if they cannot or will not do so, of the Court to protect her. The evidence of the guardians in particular is of a child who has become increasingly wary and over-attuned to F&#8217;s moods. The denigration of M is without foundation. There is no objective evidence that M has responded in kind not that she has influenced what Z has said to others; that has been expressly considered and dismissed by professionals who have assessed this case over a period of years. Z does not feel the need to protect her mother, when she has expressed displeasure at F&#8217;s claim that M influences what she is saying Z has not been seen as taking her mother side rather Z has been annoyed that her words are not being taken as her own. The denigration of one parent by another is well-recognised to be harmful to a child&#8217;s emotional and psychological well-being. I find that the parent who has influenced and restricted what Z has said to other is F and not M.</p>

The earlier reports suggest that Z felt some resentment towards her mother which had been based on what F had told her, as can be seen in Ms Roddy&#8217;s report in 2016. This report (Cf. paragraph 31) supports and corroborates what Z has later told her guardian about F not taking the opportunity early on to teach her any more than a few words in Fulah or about Guinea because of his preoccupation with the proceedings. As time has past and Z has grown older she has become more aware of what is happening so she has expressed resentment that F continues to insist that what she is saying is not reflecting her own views and wishes but has been inculcated by M. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In denying that he discusses the proceedings with Z F has lied to this Court. The Court can place no reliance on any assurances that he gives respect of his future conduct in that regard. F has lied to Z herself when he said he would return her home and did not in 2020. F has systematically over a period of many years sought to undermine Z&#8217;s relationship with her mother and in doing so has sought to interfere with, and influence, what Z felt able to say to others about him and the time spent with him. Z loves and feels loyal to both her parents, but  I find that F has abused her loyalty and her trust by seeking, and succeeding, in inhibiting Z in saying whatever she may want to about him, his behaviour and her wishes and feelings about the time she has spent with F. This has resulted in Z being silenced to a significant degree, she declined to send a letter or message to the Court because she was so scared and worried by F&#8217;s reaction had she done so. This increases the risk of harm to her as she has been inhibited at best, and actually stopped at worst, from contacting anyone for support, assistance or even just comfort while in his care. In controlling her ability to stay in contact with others when Z is with him and in his persistent and pernicious denigration of her mother F has caused emotional harm to Z. This has been exacerbated by him in the continuous denial and dismissal of Z&#8217;s wishes and feelings and an indurate disregard for her health and well being which he has insisted must always take second place to what he sees as his &#8220;rights&#8221;. This has been evidenced by F&#8217;s insistence on compliance with the letter of court orders even when it was not likely to have been in Z&#8217;s best interests. I find that F&#8217;s behaviour has been contrary to Z&#8217;s best interests and betrays a fundamental disregard for her welfare. </p>

This evidence was corroborated by the guardian who reported Z&#8217;s unsolicited reference to the incident. There was nothing in her evidence to suggest that she was seeking to shut F out of Z&#8217;s life, nor in her recent conduct in respect of Z&#8217;s contact with F, nonetheless M was concerned for Z&#8217;s welfare should contact continue unsupervised. M told me that in fact Z had really wanted to write to the Court (part of the direct work suggested by her guardian) but had not done so because she knew her father would see what she had written. Both she and the guardian made reference to matters that Z has chosen to keep private from her father. This included her Catholic Confirmation.

During her oral evidence M was able to display and express empathy and some sympathy for F, saying that she felt he was unable to deal with his situation because, unlike herself, he had no one with whom to talk things through and saying that she thought similar therapy to hers would be of assistance. F reaction was to say was not possible, that he could not afford it and it was not available. When M said that there were charities and other sources F was dismissive saying that he knew the NHS, as he worked for them and that there would have to be a referral by a GP and there was none available.

Girls were  being subjected to FGM at an earlier age in more discrete settings, including in public health clinics.

In addition F has proved to be increasingly unable to accept Z&#8217;s growing independence or to listen to her wishes and feeling and has placed her under unacceptable pressure, effectively coercing her into pursuing his case for him. </p>

This is a case where F has continually spoken to Z about the court proceedings. Z has told her guardians about it over the years (see above) and is increasingly upset and distress by the pressure he is putting her under. F&#8217;s behaviour has compromised Z&#8217;s ability freely to speak to her guardian and those representing her, his intervention and obstruction resulted in Z not writing to the Court and from telling the guardian anything that might &#8220;upset&#8221; her father and cause him to put her under further pressure. According to the guardian from what Z has said to her Z is already  worried about being left to police his behaviour and being put in the position where she would have to report breaches of the court&#8217;s orders for anything to be done to stop him resuming his oppressive behaviour. F has sought to blame M for what Z has been reported as saying and in doing so has both denigrated and vilified M to Z, and has demeaned Z by denying her own views, subjugating her wishes and feelings in favour of his own.</p>

F told the guardian in February 2022 that he was still discussing the proceedings with Z and although he denied discussing the guardian&#8217;s report in talking to Z about the case he was, by his own admission, in breach of the agreement he had entered into with the court. Certainly Z was by then so inhibited that she felt unable to discuss anything to do with F that might <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;upset&#8221;</span> him for fear of repercussion. The fact is that F has always discussed the proceedings with Z with the intention of influencing what she has said and has closely questioned her about what she was reported as saying; everything about his conduct of his case and his behaviour throughout serves to underline that he will continue to do so unless there is someone there to stop him. Contact must be supervised to bring his abusive behaviour, for that is what it is, to an end and to protect Z from further harm.</p>

It is the Court&#8217;s view that supervision is necessary to protect Z form further significant harm and the only way of keeping her safe from further emotional abuse while recognising that she wants to see her father and that there are benefits in their relationship continuing in respect of her needs, her identity and to reassure her that he is all right. </p>

The court considers that, objectively when taking the evidence as a whole, the risks have increased. F&#8217;s need to dominate and control as a parent as has been demonstrated in his constant questioning of Z and his repeated dismissal of Z&#8217;s own wishes and feelings and impose his own are but one side of the effective undermining of Z; this has extended to him ignoring her best interests when she has felt or been ill and insisting on her having a painful flu injection instead of the nasal spray recommended for her age group. The latter instance is of substantial concern as they relate to Z being allowed to make her own decision when it comes to her own body, added to which F&#8217;s insistence that it was on religious grounds raises concerns about his ability to withstand similar conventional pressures in Guinea concerning FGM. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence before the Court is that F has already caused Z emotional harm and has emotionally abused her by repeatedly drawing her into the court proceeding despite being told not to do so and in the face of court orders. F has deliberately and continuously sought to undermine and dismiss Z&#8217;s expressed wishes and feelings. The reports of his conduct to professionals and in the face of the Court (in respect of where Z should be during the hearing) during the latter part of these proceedings part have provided further evidence of his determination to put himself first. Some of his conduct may well have a basis in his determination to vilify M as a parent but some is a deliberate and direct negation of the maternal side of Z&#8217;s dual heritage, Z&#8217;s right to her personal views and opinions and to her right freely to explore both sides of her cultural, religious and social heritage: to undermine Z&#8217;s ability to do so is an assault on her mental and emotional wellbeing. F&#8217;s conduct raises further, and serious, concern about the risk to Z of FGM were she to travel to Guinea with F as he now has demonstrated a thorough disregard for what Z herself wants to happen. In pursuing a dismissal of the FGMPO when Z herself wants it to remain in place is of concern in itself, as is the application to take her to Guinea when she is so clearly saying she does not want to go.  The FGMPO will be varied only to the extent that the part giving permission to Z to apply to the Court herself at the age of thirteen is discharged. For the reason set out above the Court has no evidence before it which would justify the discharge of the FGMPO.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of supervision of Z&#8217;s contact with F, the fact that Z&#8217;s opinions which are increasingly likely to diverge from F&#8217;s mean that it is more likely than not to lead to further conflict with F, as he said, knowing better than Z. That would lead to an increase in the need Z feels to propitiate F and for her to be forced to further compromise her own welfare, safety and aspects of her identity (we have heard of how is already &#8220;not herself&#8221;  when she is with F); none of this would be in the best interests of her welfare and well-being. The self-protective reaction to F by Z has been obvious to professionals for some time, as I was reminded by Z&#8217;s counsel, in 2019, Catherine Garro, Coordinator of the My Space programme who undertook work with Z recorded Z as telling her that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;her dad gets cross if she is upset, or cries &#8211; so she moderates her responses when with him to avoid upsetting him.&#8221;</span> In this way Z and for years has learned to deal with and appease F, but it is ultimately damaging to her emotional well-being. It is also evidence that F has consistently rejected most if not all the professional advice he has been given about Z&#8217;s welfare as he has done nothing to moderate his behaviour when with Z, nor to respect her wishes and feelings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As this anxiety about F&#8217;s reactions has been a part of Z&#8217;s relationship with F for so long that I find that it is most unlikely that she would have felt able to tell the Court directly as she was invited to do, or through her guardian, what she really feels about contact with F.  Although she has given some indications albeit indirectly such as by asking M when she would be old enough to say she did not want to go to contact. Z has also experienced F lying to her and betraying her trust when he said that he would return her and instead kept her with him for 6 days. Most worrying Z has been silenced by F in these proceedings on any subject to do with him, or about which he might be, as Z describes it, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;upset&#8221;</span>; that would have include any expression of a wish to have to spend less time s with F. Z has voiced her anxiety about what would happen if he continued to talk about court after the proceedings conclude, she needs to be protected from that likelihood. The negative effects on Z of unsupervised contact with her father are considerable and go beyond what she has felt able to tell the Court through her guardian. No child should feel physically ill and display the signs of anxiety she did about spending time with a parent; it is an unequivocal sign of real anxiety, fear and distress. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F has attempted to use Z to achieve the dominant role as a parent he considers his due,  Almost six years ago in 2016 (as reported by the guardian at the time) when Z was aware at five years and eight months old she knew that F felt aggrieved so she had said that she should spend more time with him, no doubt with his encouragement. F has a sense of grievance which remains so that once more he is pushing to have more contact than Z has said she is comfortable with in the coming school summer holidays. Once more he is ignoring and dismissing the considered plans of Z herself. By all accounts a sensible, intelligent child Z is starting secondary school in September, a pivotal and potentially stressful time for any child, representing a significant change in their lives which F has failed to consider, choosing instead to override Z&#8217;s wishes and feelings and has again given priority to his own needs and wish to dominate. I do not accept F&#8217;s claim that it is to ensure Z is educated in matters Islamic and Guinean as there is limited evidence that he has ever provided much in he way of such an education, but even if he had that cannot be the priority, which, by law, must be Z&#8217;s overall welfare. </p>

It is F&#8217;s responsibility, but as the evidence is that he has continued to put his own needs before hers and not to act as a responsible parent his time with Z must be supervised. The pressure F puts on Z to spend more time with him is not the only issue for I have found that F has repeatedly denigrated M to Z despite having agreed not to do so, and having had it explained to him on several occasions by professionals (not just the guardians as F has attended more than one parenting course) the reasons why doing so is detrimental to Z&#8217;s well-being. As F&#8217;s frankly expressed view that he knows best has extended to his decisions that Z should suffer pain, distress and discomfort, I have in mind the flu vaccine, contact taking place while she still had Covid and his volte face in failing to return Z home,  I find that his actions are part of his determination to prove his point that he is to be obeyed and his need to prioritise his views and feelings about his role in her life, the Court will make orders to prevent further litigation.</p>

The latter being the only course that protects Z from further emotional abuse while permitting her to continue a relationship with F, there can be no pathway from supervised to unsupervised contact as F has repeatedly failed to apply the lessons that he should have learned on parenting courses nor has he heeded the advice of the Cafcass Officers. </p>
