The case comes down to what the money was for.  The plaintiffs say it was to be applied to a development called Ballygowan to allow them to share in the profit of that.  Ultimately, the money was applied to another development called Kingsway by way of funding a related house purchase at Gilnahirk. The Ulster Bank foreclosed relatively shortly after this investment process in and about 2008 and so by the time the plaintiffs sought their money back the company was in administration.  This is but a brief summary of the facts in the case. There are a number of factual disputes which I will come to but in essence there are really four core questions for determination: </span></p>

The main reason for this is that settlement has been achieved as between the Plaintiffs and the solicitors.  This will entail a payment of &#163;200,000 damages by the solicitors to the Plaintiffs. The main significance of this is that the first two Defendants do not appear to be a mark for damages. This represents the first basis upon which the appeal will be allowed. </p>

The same disharmony applies to the juxtaposition of [94] &#8211; [95] and [103]. For the reasons elaborated briefly below, the effect in law of the judge&#8217;s unequivocal conclusion at [77] that the first and second Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the amount of damages assessed, namely &#163;490,000, is that this liability cannot be diluted or modified by apportionment, or contribution as among these three Defendants. <span style="font-style:italic">Ditto</span> the liability of the solicitors to the Plaintiffs in the same amount, &#163;490,000, subject (in their case only) to the 80% contributory negligence reduction. . </p>

As a matter of well-established principle, where several tortfeasors cause different damage to the plaintiff, each is liable only for the damage he has actually caused (see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Performance Cars v Abraham</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1962] 1 QB 33" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1962">[1962] 1 QB 33</ref>): that, however, is not this case having regard to the judge&#8217;s findings. Quite the contrary: the first and second Defendants were held jointly and severally liable in deceit for the whole of the Plaintiffs&#8217; financial loss, while the solicitors were held severally liable in negligence also for the whole of the same loss. Thus, logically and in principle no question of contribution <span style="font-style:italic">inter se</span> arose and resort to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/47" uk:canonical="1978 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978</ref> was not appropriate. </p>

The &#8220;Addendum&#8221; is in effect a draft order of the court. It is axiomatic that the order of every court must give effect to the principal findings and conclusions of its substantive judgment.
