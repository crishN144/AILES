	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal with permission of Mostyn J against the order of Recorder Willetts made on 25 May 2023 in financial remedy proceedings.  By his order the recorder ordered the respondent husband (&#8220;H&#8221;) to pay the applicant wife (&#8220;W&#8221;) a lump sum of &#163;750k.  In addition he made an order for the payment of W&#8217;s costs by H in respect of a preliminary hearing issue and 50% of W&#8217;s other costs subject to detailed assessment.  He also discharged an interim charging order made in favour of the intervener in respect of the former family home.  The orders were made on a clean break basis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 30 December 2013 H was offered a substantial loan by the church so that he could move to England and escape the threats of a militant organisation in Nigeria.  One week later the first loan agreement was entered into by which the church agreed to lend H Naira 550m by way of loan.  This was transferred to H&#8217;s account in the approximate sum of $1.56m in July 2014 and used to purchase 6 Daisy Close, a 5 bedroom family house in London, in H&#8217;s sole name for &#163;950k.  </p>

As neither H nor the church attended this hearing other than through counsel, I was not able to ascertain H&#8217;s precise status.</p>

H had intended to buy it himself but was the victim of a fraud and needed another &#163;220k to complete.  Within a very short time of applying to the church for a further loan the funds were provided in the sum of &#163;220k.</p>

Less than a week later it sued H in the Nigerian courts for the monies owed under the 2014 agreement.  The church and H very quickly reached settlement and judgment was entered in the Nigerian court for the sum lent.  W was not a party to the proceedings and knew nothing of them.  </p>

The two orders make it clear that the issue for the court to determine was whether the church had a beneficial interest in either of the two properties which were registered in the sole name of H.  The trial process became very extended for reasons that do not matter for the purposes of the appeal and after a 4 day hearing a written judgment was handed down by HHJ Mitchell on 9 March 2022.  </p>

But, if the court took the view that the needs of W and the children required a larger sum, then the church would accept the provision for W of such additional sum by way of a Mesher type order, on the basis that upon the youngest child reaching the age of majority, the surplus that W had received over and above the proceeds of sale of the flat should revert to the church.</p>

It would, however, in my judgment be an exercise of discretion unfairly harsh to the wife and unduly favourable to the judgment creditor to force her at this stage to move to another area, or to a different part of the country altogether, in search of cheaper housing, and to leave behind her mother, her pupils and the schools which have become familiar to her girls, all for the sake of ensuring immediate payment of the bank&#8217;s debt.</span></p>

The guideline makes it clear that the right of occupation to be thus protected is not in the ordinary way to be permanent occupation.  That must necessarily follow from the indication given immediately afterwards in the next sentence of the guideline, that where (as here) the creditor asks, in the alternative to immediate enforcement, for a Mesher type of order, such an order ought not to be refused save in exceptional circumstances.  The circumstances of the present case certainly include unusual features.  The remarkable resilience and determination shown by the wife in recovering from the consequences and shock of the husband&#8217;s business failure is one of them.  They cannot, however, in my judgment be described as exceptional in the sense in which that term is used in the guideline.  I am therefore bound to make a Mesher type of order if that seems appropriate.</span></p>

The necessity to pay off the bank&#8217;s debt in ten years&#8217; time, with the interest that has accumulated in the mean time, may no doubt be expected to involve the wife in a degree of hardship, just as the necessity to wait ten years for its money may be expected to involve a degree of hardship for the bank.  A postponed enforcement order nevertheless represents the fairest balance between the competing claims of wife and creditor, in the endeavour which the court has to make to give some effect to both, and that is the order which I propose to direct.</span></p>

Mr O had next to no knowledge of the functioning of the church and was unable to give any helpful information about its finances.  However, he confirmed that despite having been a trustee, W was never a decision-maker or played any sort of executive role and was not privy to the church&#8217;s dealings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic">The approach of an appeal court to an appeal on a pure question of fact is a well-trodden path with the following well-settled principles: (i) An appeal court should not interfere with the trial judge&#8217;s conclusions on primary facts unless it is satisfied that he was plainly wrong. (ii) The adverb &#8220;plainly&#8221; does not refer to the degree of confidence felt by the appeal court unless it would not have reached the same conclusion as the trial judge. It does not matter, with whatever degree of certainty, that the appeal court considers that it would have reached a different conclusion. What matters is whether the decision under appeal is one that no reasonable judge could have reached. (iii) An appeal court is bound, unless there is compelling reason to the contrary, to assume that the trial judge has taken the whole of the evidence into his consideration. The mere fact that a judge does not mention a specific piece of evidence does not mean that he overlooked it. (iv) The validity of the findings of fact made by a trial judge is not aptly tested by considering whether the judgment presents a balanced account of the evidence. The trial judge must of course consider all the material evidence (although it need not all be discussed in his judgment). The weight which he gives to it is however pre-eminently a matter for him. (v) An appeal court can therefore set aside a judgment on the basis that the judge failed to give the evidence a balanced consideration only if the judge&#8217;s conclusion was rationally insupportable. (vi) Reasons for judgment will always be capable of having been better expressed. An appeal court should not subject a judgment to narrow textual analysis. Nor should it be picked over or construed as though it was a piece of legislation or a contract (post, paras 2, 67, 68). </span></p>

The effect of the order is that instead of the church receiving some &#163;1.1m from Daisy Close, it will receive &#163;370k from the flat and the balance of &#163;420k from the Daisy Close surplus.  This goes a long way to repaying the church. It was always the case of the church and H that as the properties appreciated in value, the sums loaned would increasingly be covered. The effect of the judgment is simply that the church will have to wait longer than otherwise would have been the case.</p>
