	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment concerns a 34 year old man, PN, who has lived in the care of the First Respondent Local Authority for many years due to having significant care needs as a result of his mild learning disability and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). There is no dispute about PN&#8217;s diagnoses or his lack of capacity to conduct these proceedings. Previous declarations have been made that he lacks capacity to make decisions about his residence, care, contact with others, and use of social media and the internet. The issues at this hearing are whether PN lacks capacity to make decisions about engagement in sexual relations, about disclosing information about the risk of sexual harm he poses to others, and about allowing the Local Authority to disclose information about the risk of sexual harm he poses to others (&#8220;the decisions&#8221;).</p>

I agree, for the reasons set out in this judgment, but determination of PN&#8217;s capacity in relation to the decisions has not been straightforward.</p>

I met him there earlier this year and had the pleasure of conversing with him in the company of a carer for twenty minutes or so. He is a big man with a big presence. He has strong views that he sometimes expresses with conviction. He can be unpredictable in his behaviour. He is interested in computer games which he often plays long into the night. He has a brother with whom he spends time once a week. He requires support in relation to many activities of daily living and has one to one care 24 hours a day. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">PN was diagnosed with ADHD when younger but there is no evidence that, as a mature adult, he is affected by ADHD. Dr Ince has advised that the diagnosis of ASD is based upon terminology within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition, and the presence of &#8220;persistent difficulties with social communication and social interaction&#8221; which &#8220;limit and impair everyday functioning&#8221;. PN&#8217;s ASD limits his ability to empathise. In Dr Ince&#8217;s opinion both PN&#8217;s learning disability and ASD are lifelong and will not improve in terms of his global cognitive and adaptive functioning. He further advises that PN has been offered a range of interventions over the years and that he does not believe that &#8220;he will make substantive gains in terms of the internalisation of risk management and self-awareness of risk and &#8211; as such &#8211; the maintenance of the current level of risk is derived from eternal strategies only.&#8221; Dr Ince also advised the court that PN has a full scale IQ of 69. PN has no relevant communication difficulties.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The risks to which Dr Ince was referring arise from PN&#8217;s sexual offending behaviour. PN has a history of offending behaviour, some of it violent, including the possession of weapons. In addition, he has a long history of reported sexual offending. There is a body of evidence confirming this history but PN has largely escaped the attention of the police and the criminal justice system &#8211; he has one &#8220;warning&#8221; in 2006 for &#8220;Sexual assault &#8211; Intentionally Touch Female &#8211; No penetration&#8221;. However, I have been provided with a very long list of incidents of concern stretching back to 2001 which includes multiple examples of sexual assault by unconsented-to touching, typically of women&#8217;s breasts or legs. He has also made sexually offensive remarks, for example in a vape shop in 2018 when he said to a woman working there, &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame you don&#8217;t work at [care home 1] I would pull you by the hair and chuck you around and have my way with you like I do with staff&#8221;. In fact he has not behaved in that way with staff on any occasion but in recent years, his sexual assaults by touching have been against female members of staff and female residents at care home 1. Although PN has denied these past incidents, there is good evidence that they occurred and all parties have proceeded on that basis. The assaults appear to be opportunistic: if he finds himself near a woman, unsupervised, then he may go closer to her and touch her sexually without her consent. Most recently, on 24 August 2023, he was in a minibus on an outing when he grabbed the breasts and leg of a female carer. I have no evidence that he has ever committed rape, nor that he has had sexual intercourse with consent and so his sexual relations have not resulted in a risk of pregnancy, and no such risk is likely to arise in the future. There is no suggestion that he has been involved in intimate sexual relations of a kind that could result in the transfer of a sexually transmitted disease.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I have referred to PN&#8217;s offending history. When he was much younger it included reports of touching children, something he denies. There do not appear to be any reports of that kind for a number of years. He has one police warning, but no convictions. He is an avid consumer of online pornography. I have no evidence that he has experience of a sexual relationship, only sexual encounters which he has initiated without the other person&#8217;s consent, and sexual language used in contexts which have offended or alarmed other people. His sexual interest appears to be with adult women. Given his lack of real life experience of a sexual relationship, and his learning disability, his consumption of pornography is likely to have distorted his view of how sexual activity with women might be initiated or sustained.</p>

He has a good rapport with PN and I was impressed by his thoughtful insights into PN&#8217;s character. He said that whilst PN denied past offending, even offences he had previously accepted, Mr Curran considered that PN was aware of his past offending and that the denials were motivated by embarrassment and fear of the consequences of making admissions. Insofar as he did admit his past offending, PN said, &#8220;I accept I have been accused but none of them were serious.&#8221; He accepted that he had been accused of &#8220;touching female staff between the legs&#8221;. During discussions with Mr Curran about what others might need to know about PN&#8217;s past sexual offending, which I shall address later in this judgment, PN said that someone might want to know his history &#8220;so they can protect themselves&#8221;. </p>

Dr Ince&#8217;s view was that PN was able to use the relevant information but that he chose to touch women even though he knew they had not consented to him doing so. His impulse to touch women in this way was not rooted in his ASD. He was not generally impulsive &#8211; there is no evidence that he acts on impulse in other fields of activity. Dr Ince does not accept that PN is overwhelmed by impulse due to his impairments.</p>

Moreover, the practicable steps which must be taken to help P under section 1(3) MCA may be informed by whether "the matter" in relation to sexual relations may be described as person-specific. For instance, it might be possible to help P to understand the response of one potential sexual partner in circumstances where he will remain unable to understand the diverse responses of many hypothetical sexual partners. Furthermore, if the matter can be described as person-specific then the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another (see section 3(4)(a) MCA and para 73 below) may be different. There may, for example, be no reasonably foreseeable consequence of a sexually transmitted disease in a long-standing monogamous relationship where one partner has developed dementia.

Because of her impairments she could not understand, retain, and weigh or use information relevant to the decision to engage in sexual relations with that man. But if the decision to engage in sexual relations can be person-specific, such that the relevant information can depend on the characteristics of the other person and P&#8217;s ability to understand risk in relation to that other person, then the relevant information might also depend on other circumstances such as the nature of sexual relations in which P is likely to engage.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst Baker LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span> did not endorse that approach and left open the question of whether the relevant information in relation to decisions about engaging in sexual relations must be the same for every case, Lord Stephens judgment appears to me to recognise that the relevant information may differ from case to case. He expressly held that in certain cases the approach should be person-specific and that the &#8220;reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another may be different&#8221; [72]. He gave the example that the risk of a sexually transmitted infection may not be part of the relevant information that has to be understood, retained, weighed or used if the circumstances of the case render that irrelevant. Hence, Lord Stephens&#8217; judgment establishes that there is no requirement that all of Baker LJ&#8217;s relevant information must apply in every case. The relevant information will depend on P&#8217;s circumstances, their sexual orientation, sexual practices and preferences, whether there is an identifiable person or persons with whom they are likely to have sexual relations, and what the characteristics are of that person or those persons.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Similarly, following <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span>, there may be a natural desire to protect those with whom P might want to have sexual relations, in particular in cases where P has a history of sexual offending. Lord Stephens repeatedly refers to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> protecting not just P, but others &#8211; at [92], [106], and [107].  However, it seems to me, although the issue of the consent of others to sexual relations has entered the list of relevant information, the Court of Protection must not allow the desire to protect others unduly to influence a clear-eyed assessment of P&#8217;s capacity. The unpalatable truth is that some capacitous individuals commit sexual assault, even rape, but also have consensual sexual relations. An individual with learning disability, ASD, or other impairment, may act in the same way, but it is only if they lack capacity to make decisions about engaging in sexual relations that the Court of Protection may interfere. If P would otherwise have capacity, then the court should not allow its understandable desire to protect others to drive it to a finding that P lacks capacity, thereby depriving P of the right they would otherwise have to a sexual life. The Court of Protection should not assume the role or responsibilities of the criminal justice system. One of the core principles of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> is that &#8220;a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision&#8221; &#8211; s1(4). Deciding to act in a way that might be a criminal offence would be an &#8220;unwise&#8221; decision. Such decisions might contribute to a determination of a lack of capacity, but P is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because they may make a decision to act in a way that might amount to a criminal offence.</p>

Due to his living arrangements, character, and impairments he is not, has never been, and is very unlikely to be involved in a relationship or even in an encounter where there is a prospect of the other person becoming pregnant or where there is a chance of either contracting a sexually transmitted infection. The decisions he will be making in the future are in relation to touching others. I cannot completely exclude the possibility that PN might find himself having to decide about engaging in sexual intercourse but in reality, paragraphs (1), (4) and (5) of Baker LJ&#8217;s formulation of the relevant information are not likely to be relevant to PN&#8217;s decision-making about sexual relations.

Hence, I am sure that PN understands the mechanisms of sexual intercourse, that pregnancy might result that sexually transmitted infection is a risk of sexual intimacy, and that he is able to consent to sexual relations. </p>

At the hearing, there was a focus on PN&#8217;s ability to <span style="font-style:italic">use</span> the relevant information, in particular in the moment when he initiates sexual activity by touching another person without their consent. After careful consideration of all the evidence but in particular the insights of Mr Curran, the opinion evidence of Dr Ince, and the witness evidence of Mr York, I am satisfied that in the moment when PN feels the impulse to touch a woman without her consent, he remains able to use the relevant information. He has sufficient understanding of the necessity of consent that he retains that understanding even at those moments. He chooses to surrender to the impulse but that does not mean that his ability to use the information is lost. To borrow a phrase used by Dr Ince during his oral evidence, PN knows that he should not touch, but thinks &#8220;Hang it! It is what I want to do.&#8221; In any event, accepting as I do the expert opinion evidence of Dr Ince on this matter, I find that PN surrenders to his impulse because of his character and outlook not because of his impairments. His impairments do not cause him to lose his control in other fields of activity, or his sexual control in other settings. His sexual impulsivity is not a manifestation of his ASD and/or learning disability. There is no pattern of impulsivity due to his impairments of which his sexual offending is a part. When with his brother or others whose disapprobation he might want to avoid, he controls any impulses to sexually touch women. He disregards the need for consent but he remains able to use the information he retains, namely that the consent of the other person is necessary. </p>

However, I have to make decisions on capacity according to the evidence and applying the tests within the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> and for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have considered whether there is further relevant information that I should take into account. The information relevant to a decision whether to engage in sexual relations includes the foreseeable consequences of making the decision. One foreseeable consequence of sexually assaulting another person is that there may be adverse consequences for the perpetrator. For PN this might include retaliatory actions such as an assault on him, or the involvement of the criminal justice system. It would be a very severe consequence for him to be incarcerated or made subject to a hospital order, for example. It is clear from <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span>, that these are reasonably foreseeable consequences in a case where P engages in unconsented to sexual touching: they are part of the relevant information in a such a case. As Dr Ince pointed out during his oral evidence, PN&#8217;s past offending conduct has not had many adverse consequences for him. He has had one police warning but no criminal sanctions. His care home arrangements have not been changed very much as a result of his conduct. Perhaps because of his size and manner he has not suffered any retaliatory actions. Nevertheless, his discussions on assessment, including during the SSKAAT-R, show that he knows that touching another without their consent, in particular sexual touching, is illegal and may result in police involvement. The fact that he does not act opportunistically when with his brother, for example, shows that he is aware of the likely response of an authority figure to sexual assault. His history suggests that he has managed to avoid sexually assaulting others in circumstances where they or another person with them might react violently towards PN. I am quite satisfied, on the evidence provided to me, that PN understands and retains the information that there are liable to be such repercussions from his decisions.</p>

During closing submissions, I raised the question of whether the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the decision to engage in sexual relations by touching a woman sexually without her consent, include the distress and loss of autonomy suffered by the woman. If so, does the lack of empathy which PN suffers as a result of his ASD prevent him from using the relevant information about consent? Can it be said that PN cannot understand, retain, weigh or use information that sexual relations without the other&#8217;s consent will cause distress and harm to that other person? In response, Ms Butler-Cole KC submitted that <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span> decided that whilst the relevant information included the necessity of consent it did not include the reasons why consent was necessary, or the impact on the other person of engaging in sexual activity without their consent. She took me to paragraphs 73, 75 and 93 of <span style="font-style:italic">JB</span>.</p>

These consequences are not limited to the &#8216;reasonably foreseeable consequences&#8217; for P, but can extend to consequences for others. This again illustrates that the information relevant to the decision must be identified within the factual context of each case. In this case there are reasonably foreseeable consequences for JB of a decision to engage in sexual relations, such as imprisonment for sexual assault or rape if the other person does not consent. There are also reasonably foreseeable harmful consequences to persons whom JB might sexually assault or rape.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Lord Stephens therefore acknowledged the argument that the potentially harmful consequences to the other person of sexual assault or even rape should be part of the relevant information P must be able to understand, retain, and weigh or use in order to have capacity to make a decision to engage in sexual relations. He then cautioned against requiring too much of P in relation to envisaging consequences, before concluding at [93] that it was not necessary to include the adverse consequences for others as part of the relevant information. Lord Stephens&#8217; view that the inclusion of the adverse consequences for others was not necessary because they would not arise, is open to argument. However, I am bound to follow the decision of the Supreme Court. The bar should not be set too high. The Supreme Court has determined that understanding of the necessity of consent is sufficient. If P is able to understand, retain, and weigh or use information that it is necessary for others to be able to consent, and to consent in fact to sexual relations with him, then the court need not enquire into whether P has the ability to understand or envisage the ramifications of initiating or continuing sexual relations without consent. </p>

Again, I agree. Mr Curran&#8217;s evidence was the key to these determinations. He has developed a good rapport with PN. It is true that during Mr Curran&#8217;s assessments, PN denied his past offending. He also made the point that he had not been convicted of anything, so why would he have to disclose these matters. Some capacitous individuals might share that view. As to his denials, he has at times simply denied other facts that are patently true. For example, he gave Dr Ince wrong information about his name and age. Dr Ince said that he could be very plausible when giving misleading information. However, at other times he has been more open.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already expressed concern that the natural desire to seek to protect others from unwanted sexual contact or sexual assault must not drive the assessment of P&#8217;s capacity. The second and third decisions in relation to which I have to consider PN&#8217;s capacity, are raised by the Local Authority because if, as is the case, I find that PN has capacity to engage in sexual relations, there are understandable concerns about how both he and others can be protected. Disclosing information about his offending history might be thought to protect others from being victims of sexual assault from PN, and to protect PN from the adverse consequences to him of committing sexual assaults. However, if I were to find that PN lacks capacity in relation either to disclosing information about his offending history, or to allowing the Local Authority to disclose that information, I do wonder what practical steps could be taken to share information with others. I am put in mind of the young David Copperfield being forced to wear a sign on his back warning others, &#8220;He bites&#8221;. A capacitous person with an offending history might struggle with decisions about when and how to share that information with others. Would it be on first meeting, or when a relationship was established? Would the information be given with caveats such as &#8220;I have never been convicted&#8221;?

Counsel could not point to any previous judgment relating to such decision-making. Having determined that PN has the ability to understand, retain, and weigh or use information relevant to decisions to engage in sexual relations, including the need for the other person or persons to be able to consent and in fact consent, then, borrowing Lord Stephens&#8217; wording, it does not appear to be  &#8220;necessary&#8221; to consider whether he has capacity to make decisions about sharing information relevant to consent with others. I understand that the Local Authority are more concerned with the disclosure of information to someone with whom PN might enter into closer relations, which might lead to sexual intimacy or intercourse, but his offending history is not particularly relevant to such a situation. He has never been in a relationship, he has not, it appears, had intercourse, and he has not ever been accused trying to rape anyone or to persist with an assault after his initial sexual contact has been repelled. Decisions about disclosure of information about past behaviour to others are very complex. Many capacitous individuals would struggle with them. It is important not to allow consideration of capacity to make a complex decision on disclosure to deprive PN of autonomy in relation to his decisions to engage in sexual relations for which he does have capacity. </p>

However, for present purposes I assume that the relevant information will include the risks to others that arise from the previous offending, how the disclosure of information might be given so as to allow others to avoid or mitigate such risks and prevent P from committing offences which could have adverse consequences, and the reasonably foreseeable consequences of sharing or not sharing the information. In PN&#8217;s case there are a large number of possible ways in which he might share information, from providing strangers with a long list of previous behaviour, to saying to someone with whom he has formed a relationship, &#8220;I have been accused of touching women inappropriately before, but I will not do so with you.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Here, on the facts of the present case, the determinations of capacity to decide to have contact with others and to engage in sexual relations are not person-specific. Is it inconsistent to find that in general PN lacks capacity to have contact with others but does have capacity to engage in sexual relations with others? On the face of it, those conclusions do not sit easily together. However, on the facts of this case, I am satisfied that there is no inconsistency. Ms Butler-Cole KC reminded me of the past incident when PN entered a vape shop and made sexually offensive remarks, as set out above. He did not initiate any sexual activity but he certainly offended against socially acceptable behaviour in his contact with others. Dr Ince&#8217;s opinion evidence is that PN has capacity to engage in sexual relations but not to decide on his contact with others. PN understands sexual boundaries but he does not understand social boundaries. He sometimes stares at other people and he stares at women&#8217;s breasts. He knows, as I have found, that he ought not to touch them without their consent. He retains that understanding, and can weigh or use the information even when the urge takes him to touch the other person. However, he does not have the same understanding in relation to staring at or speaking to others. He does not understand the foreseeable consequences of speaking offensively to others, but he does understand the foreseeable consequences of touching them without consent. His lack of understanding in relation to non-sexual contact with others is because of his impairments. That was the conclusion of Dr Ince. Mr Curran&#8217;s evidence is consistent with that conclusion. Sexual boundaries are perhaps clearer and so more easily understood by PN even with his impairments, whereas social boundaries are less clear to him and are not understood by him because of his impairments. I bear in mind the relevant information in respect of contact with others as set out by Theis J in <span style="font-style:italic">LBX v K, L and M </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/3230" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 3230 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 3230 (Fam)</ref> and summarised by Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Capacity: Social Media: Care and Contact)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2019/3" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCOP 3" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCOP 3</ref>:</p>

There are no particular issues about PN&#8217;s past decisions about whether to spend time with specific people, such as his brother, but there is a concern that he might wish to have in person contact with someone he has &#8220;met&#8221; online. With PN, his inability to understand social boundaries because of his impairments, means that he cannot understand and weigh or use information about the positive or negative aspects of interacting with members of the public, or other people with whom he does not have a relationship. He cannot foresee the reasonable consequences of interacting with others with whom he has contact when he says offensive things to them or acts in an intimidatory manner. Whereas he understands the disapprobation attached to sexually touching a woman without her consent, he does not understand that he is at risk from adverse reactions to speaking offensively to others. The sexual boundaries are understood by him, the social boundaries are not. Accordingly, a refinement should be made to the previous finding that PN lacks capacity to make decisions about contact with others, namely that his lack of capacity is in relation to non-sexual contact with others.</p>

I appreciate the difficulties those caring for and supporting PN may have in navigating the consequences of findings in relation to capacity. The courts need to try to make decisions that are coherent and that provide clarity for carers and those responsible for acting in P&#8217;s best interests. The more refined the decision-making under consideration, the more difficult it can be to delineate the boundaries between different kinds of decision-making and to implement practical care and support. Rather than seeking to identify yet more specific kinds of decision-making, it might be simpler and of more practical use to focus on the core decision-making areas, such as residence, care, contact, marriage, sexual relations, property and affairs, use of social media and the internet, and conduct of litigation, but to be astute to apply the principles involved in assessing capacity to the particular individual characteristics and circumstances of P. </p>
