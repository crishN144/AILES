Mother and the two children applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as dependants of the father. All four applications were refused by the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The father&#8217;s SEF interview took place on 27 March 2002. It was supplemented by a letter written by his solicitors to the Home Office on 3 April 2003. The same day the Secretary of State gave notice of his decision to refuse the application for asylum and to issue removal directions. The reasons for the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision were set out in letters dated 18 April 2002. The Secretary of State considered that the reason the father had given for claiming asylum was not one that engaged the United Kingdom&#8217;s obligations under the United Nations Convention (1951) and Protocol (1967) on the Status of Refugees (&#8220;the Geneva Convention&#8221;). Paragraph 14 of the letter addressed to the father provided in standard form that &#8220;You are now required to state any reasons for staying in the United Kingdom which were not previously disclosed&#8221;. The same statement was contained in each of the three other letters.</span></p>

By then removal directions had been given for the family&#8217;s removal from the United Kingdom on 18 January 2003. The same day (16 January 2003) the father, by then in custody at a police station, was seen by the local authority&#8217;s worker, JW. She is a support worker in the local authority&#8217;s asylum team who had been working with the family since February 2002, assisting them and helping them to access appropriate services. She describes him as being extremely distressed and unable to think clearly. &#8220;He expressed concerns that his wife was depressed and that she had had thoughts about taking her life.&#8221; He then made various other statements which JW understandably, and as it seems to me reasonably, understood as implying that he would kill himself and his family She tells me &#8220;I have never seen anyone look so fearful as he did at this time.&#8221; JW took the mother to the police station to visit her husband. Whilst there he told her that the appeal process was exhausted JW took mother home Later the same evening the mother took an overdose of paracetemol and benylin and was admitted to hospital. The emergency duty team arranged care for the children overnight with a local authority foster parent &#8212; in fact with JW.</span></p>

She was considered fit for discharge from hospital Arrangements were made for her to be transported to Harmondsworth the next day (18 January 2003) to see her husband with the children. At 8pm that night the local authority made an ex parte application to a circuit judge who granted an interim care order in relation to bath children until 21 January 2003 and also, for the same period, an emergency protection order which, as drawn, was expressed as authorising the local authority &#8220;to prevent the children being removed from . . .&#8221; &#8212; the remainder of the sentence being left incomplete.</span></p>

The local authority filed care plans prepared by KS dated 20 January 2003. At that stage the father and mother were at Harmondsworth and the children were in local authority care.

I need not go into this in any detail. The fact is that if this material goes to any claim that it is still open to the father to put forward (and I express no views at all as to whether or not this is so) it goes to his claim to asylum, or the related claim for exceptional leave to remain, and not to anything that this court has to determine. I accordingly say no more about it. He asserts that the statements he made in the course of the asylum proceedings did not give a full picture of events and (with what justification I know not) that he was advised by his immigration solicitors that the statements should be kept brief. It might be thought that in such circumstances the material would, however belatedly, have been submitted to the Home Office. But when I asked Mr McFarlane whether the additional material now being put forward by the father had yet been submitted to the Home Office by way of further representations I was told that it had not. (Following the hearing, further representations were made to the Home Office on 12 May 2003 on behalf of the mother and children, albeit relying in particular on the father&#8217;s witness statement and Dr Dare&#8217;s report.)</span></p>

She further submits that the evidence now available does not support a finding that the children are likely to suffer significant harm at the hands of either parent and that it does not justify either the imposition of a care order or the continuation of an interim care order. On those grounds alone, says the Secretary of State, these proceedings should now come to an end. The circumstances are simply not such as to require any order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.</span></p>

She submits that it is apparent both from the parents&#8217; witness statements and &#8220;most blatantly&#8221; from the mother&#8217;s position statement that the parents are now seeking to use these proceedings &#8212; impermissibly &#8212; as a means of challenging and/or influencing the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision. Referring to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex p T </span><span style="font-size:10pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 1 FLR 293" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 1 FLR 293</ref> she submits that it is for the Secretary of State alone (subject to appeal to an Adjudicator or the Immigration Appeal Tribunal and/or an application to the Administrative Court for judicial review) to decide whether or not to remove the family to Country X. As she correctly observes, the father&#8217;s claims for asylum and for exceptional leave to remain have been rejected. He has exhausted his rights of appeal. He has never sought to mount any challenge by way of an application to the Administrative Court for judicial review of any part of the asylum process. She emphasises that before taking any removal action the Secretary of State will, of course, have regard to any order made by this court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> and to any findings of this court. Indeed, she indicates that where the court has made findings as to the risks posed to a child by a parent the Secretary of State is likely to attach significant weight to the court&#8217;s assessment. But she submits that even the making of a care order would not prevent the Secretary of State from deciding to remove either the parents or the children. Nor, she submits, does the existence of ongoing proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> of itself prevent the Secretary of State from exercising his powers of removal: in other words, the Secretary of State is not, she says, under any obligation to await the outcome of this court&#8217;s deliberations. That said, she tells me that the Secretary of State&#8217;s usual practice is to refrain from taking any enforcement action against the relevant parties pending the outcome of the family proceedings.</span></p>

He does not differ from Ms Richards&#8217;s analysis of the law and accepts that it is no part of the local authority&#8217;s functions to review decisions arrived at by the Secretary of State in the immigration context. But for his part Mr McCarthy emphasises that this court cannot shirk its duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, and in particular cannot shirk the obligation to evaluate the risk elements encompassed in the section 31(2) threshold evaluation or the section 1(1) and (3) welfare principle and welfare checklist, merely because the Secretary of State is not bound by the view this court may come to in the care proceedings. He submits that there is nothing in Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> which permits the court to refuse to act to protect a child from threatened harm for reasons related to the enforcement of immigration law and policy. If the evidence shows that there is a risk sufficient to meet the test in section 3 8(2), then the court should not be deterred from exercising its powers merely because of the Secretary of State&#8217;s involvement. If, on the other hand, the evidence shows that there is no such risk, then the court has to consider very carefully whether it should allow the proceedings to continue, particularly if there is reason to suspect that the proceedings are being used by the parents as a tool in the immigration process.</span></p>

As a simple illustration, it could not be contended that the judge would have any jurisdiction to order that a criminal ward be transferred from place of detention A to place of detention B, however much the medical evidence before the judge suggested that the ward would be in better health at place of detention B. The reason is that the jurisdiction of the judge over the person of the ward is necessarily restricted by the fact that the law has given that aspect of control over the ward&#8217;s person exclusively to another agency. Similarly the judge would have no right to complain of or countermand a lawful posting overseas of a ward who was in the armed forces. The law refers the military control of the ward to the military authorities. Similarly, any lawful deportation order affecting a ward must be outside the normal position which I have mentioned already, that a ward must not leave the jurisdiction without permission of the judge, indeed, it would override any existing express order of the judge in the wardship proceedings that the infant was not to depart from the jurisdiction ... The wardship of infants, in my judgment, has not and could not in law have any effect on the powers and duties of the immigration authorities so as to hamper them in any way in removing the infants from the jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1962.&#8221;</span></p>

The reasoning seems to me, if I may respectfully say so, unassailable. The judge hearing an application in wardship or under the Children Act is not entitled to have regard to immigration policy. Even if the Secretary of State has been joined as a party to the application, the judge must be guided solely by the interests of the child. It would therefore make no sense for his decision to prevent the Secretary of State from exercising a power based on altogether different considerations.</span></p>

They said that such remarks necessarily implied that if a wardship order were made, it would clog or fetter the discretion of the Secretary of State. It must therefore follow that if, in exceptional circumstances, &#8216;such an order&#8217; was made, it would prevent the Secretary of State from exercising his immigration powers.</span></p>

If he simply paid no attention to such an order, he would run the risk of his decision being reviewed on the ground that he had failed to take all relevant matters into consideration. The remarks in question were in my view directed to my proposition (2)(b), namely that the use of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction merely to attempt to influence the Secretary of State by obtaining findings of fact or expressions of opinion on matters which are for his decision is an abuse of process.</span></p>

		<p class="p66" style="margin-left:1.57in"><span style="font-size:10pt">Mr Scannell also submitted that applications under the Children Act were for this purpose more analogous to adoption than to wardship. In adoption cases it has been held that the order does have the effect of preventing the Secretary of State from exercising immigration powers. Nevertheless, the court is entitled to make an adoption order if in all the circumstances it thinks fit, the first consideration being the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of &#8216;the child: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Re W (Adoption: Non-Patrial) </span><span style="font-size:10pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] Fam 54" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] Fam 54</ref>, [1986] 1 FUR 179. But the reason why adoption orders can affect immigration powers is that they alter the status of the child. They can have the effect of conferring upon the child a right of abode which makes it immune from removal. There is no analogy with Children Act orders, which do not affect status.&#8221;</span></p>

		      <p class="p36" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.03in"><span style="font-size:10pt">&#8220;It therefore appears to be normal policy in such cases to intervene. Such a policy is understandable, having regard to, first, the potential relevance of the court&#8217;s views as a matter to be taken into account by the Secretary of State; secondly, the desirability of comity between executive and judiciary; and thirdly, the desire of the Secretary of State to fulfil this country&#8217;s obligations under Art 8 of the European Convention. But there is no legal necessity for the Secretary of State to intervene and have the application dismissed before he is able to exercise his immigration powers. There may well be cases in which intervention would serve no purpose. The court and the Secretary of State are performing different functions. It does not follow that because the court, applying its criteria of the welfare of the child, refuses to dismiss the application, the Secretary of State should not exercise his powers of deportation or removal. He may therefore take the view that whatever the court may decide about the welfare of the child, policy requires removal or deportation. Provided that such a decision is not irrational or procedurally irregular, the court cannot declare it unlawful.&#8221;</span></p>

There is no answer to the submissions on this point made by Mr McCarthy and Ms Richards. It is suggested, on the basis of what father said to SW on 16 January 2003 about the mother being depressed and suicidal and, more particularly, on the basis of her overdose later the same day, that mother poses a risk to the children. The arguments verge on the fanciful, I have already referred to the medical assessment of mother&#8217;s mental condition on 17 January 2003 and to the outcome of the local authority&#8217;s assessment of the parents. There is simply nothing&#8217; to show that mother poses any risk &#8212; and I note that this is not something even hinted at in her own witness statements. Ms Cover and Mr McFarlane seek to find in Dr Dare&#8217;s report support for the assertion that the children are at continuing risk from father. There may be a risk, but on a fair reading of the whole of Dr Dare&#8217;s report, even when taken in conjunction with the threats uttered by father to SW on 16 January 2003, that risk is no more than theoretical. It is neither real nor substantial. It is certainly not enough, of itself, to justify the continuation of care proceedings. I agree with the considered view of the local authority, arrived at in the light of all the evidence, Dr Dare&#8217;s report and its own assessment, that there are no continuing causes for concern, nothing which satisfies even the &#8216;reasonable grounds for believing&#8221; test under section 38(2),</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt"/><span style="font-size:10pt">let alone the &#8220;is satisfied&#8221; test under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>, and no remaining utility in the proceedings.</span></p>

	      <p class="p38" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.53in"><span style="font-size:10pt">I turn to deal with the question of the risk, if any, to the children if they return to Country X. There are two aspects to this. The first, correctly disavowed by Ms Cover and Mr McFarlane although, as we have seen, it forms the central core of both parents&#8217; witness statements, relates to the physical, social, economic and cultural conditions in Country X and the very deprived standard of living they and the children may expect to have to endure there. I agree with Mr McCarthy when he submits that it is no part of the court&#8217;s function in a case such as this to carry out a comparative analysis of conditions in this country and in Country X with a view to deciding which country might be thought preferable as a place for the children to be living. Such an exercise is, in my judgment outside the proper scope of the present proceedings. The matter can perhaps be tested in this way. Suppose that the parents actually wanted to return to Country X &#8212; the country of their birth and domicile. Could it seriously be suggested that it would be a proper use of Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> for the local authority to start care proceedings in order to prevent the family returning to its own country merely because in the local authority&#8217;s view the children would be better off being brought up in this country rather than in their own country? Surely not. That is not within the legitimate purposes of the legislation. It would constitute a wholly unacceptable interference with the family&#8217;s rights under article 8 of the European Convention. It would be social. engineering on a grand and unacceptable scale. More prosaicaily, any such attempt would surely founder on the language of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>(b)(i) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. Let it be assumed for the sake of argument that conditions in Country X are such as to expose the children to the risk of significant harm, how can it be said that such harm would be attributable to the care being given to the children &#8220;not being what it would be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">reasonable </span><span style="font-size:10pt">to expect a parent to give him&#8221;? Save perhaps in exceptional circumstances it cannot, in my judgment, be an appropriate or even a proper use of care proceedings for a local authority or the court to seek to prevent a family which comes from some foreign country returning there if that is what it wants.</span></p>

	      <p class="p38" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.53in"><span style="font-size:10pt">The other aspect, on which Ms Cover and Mr McFarlane focus, is the possible risk to the children from their parents if the family has to return to Country X. It is said that father may be arrested and thus be prevented from caring for the children. That may be, but it cannot of itself justify the continuation of the proceedings. It is said that both parents&#8217; mental state is such that they will not be able to cope, will not be able to parent effectively, if forced to live in Country X. It is said that mother&#8217;s feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, fear and even terror are&#8217; such, and that the conditions in which she will find herself are so intolerable, that she will simply not be able to cope if left to fend on her own, without the support of either father or the wider family. It is said that father is so paranoid about what may happen to him in Country X, and that his personality is such, that even if he is not immediately arrested he will not be able to cope. Put shortly, the parents&#8217; case is that even if they can parent more than adequately in this country they will not be able to parent adequately in Country X.</span></p>

Nonetheless in my judgment there is simply no sound evidential basis for the assertion that the parents will not be able to cope, or for the assertion that they will not be able to parent effectively. The parents are in the local authority&#8217;s considered view (and I have seen nothing to suggest the contrary) good and caring parents, devoted to their children. The local authority is impressed by their commitment. There is nothing to suggest that this commitment will be any the less fierce if the family is living in Country X. Making every allowance for everything said by the parents in their witness statements and by Dr Dare in her report, and recognising the significance of each parent&#8217;s words and actions on 16 January 2003, there is nonetheless in my judgment no real or substantial basis for fearing that either parent will be, so adversely affected either by being returned to Country X or by conditions in Country X as not to be able to parent their children adequately.</span></p>

Nor, for reasons I have already explained, is there any basis for believing that further inquiries of any kind would tell us anything we do not already know or lead to any significant alteration in the overall shape of the case. The proceedings have no utility, are no longer serving any useful or even legitimate purpose and are conferring no benefit on the children. There is no legitimate advantage to the children in continuing the proceedings Other things being equal the time has now come to bring these proceedings to an end, which I plainly have power to do whether or not the local authority has made any application under FPR rule 4.5. The plain fact is that it is only the parents who are actively seeking a continuation of the proceedings, and that only because of the immigration aspect of the case.</span></p>

I am not entitled to have regard to immigration policy. This court does not act as a policeman for the Secretary of State, nor is it any part of my functions to assist the Secretary of State in the enforcement of whatever powers he may have under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1971/77" uk:canonical="1971 c. 77" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1971 Act</ref> and its associated legislation. But I cannot blind myself to the underlying realities. Nor should I blind myself to the context in which these proceedings were commenced and in which I am now being encouraged by the parents to allow them to continue.</span></p>

They are not necessarily to be criticised for this, for desperate people will understandably resort to desperate remedies. But that is the stark reality. The fact is, as Ms Richards asserts, that the parents are seeking to use these proceedings impermissibly as a means of challenging or influencing the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision. There is no longer in my judgment any genuine dispute concerning these children requiring to be resolved in proceedings under Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. In these circumstances the parents are in truth seeking to use the court as a means of influencing or attempting to influence the Secretary of State and that, as Hoffmann LJ made clear, is an abuse of process. Let me make it clear. I do not in any way criticise the local authority for having commenced the proceedings. Given the events of 16 January 2003 it had little choice. Nor, in human terms, do I criticise the parents. But however understandable their reasons for wanting the proceedings to continue there is no legitimate reason why they should.</span></p>

There is no longer any real suggestion that, were the family to remain in this country, the children should be placed anywhere than with their parents. The parents will be pressing for an order (and an order, moreover, giving the local authority parental responsibility) not because an order is really needed, and not because in truth there would be anything for the local authority to do even if it had an order, but simply to arm the parents with a piece of paper &#8212; a court order &#8212; which they hope might enable them to fend off the family&#8217;s removal to Country X.</span></p>

And I do not criticise the Treasury Solicitor for asking for the case to be listed before a judge of the Division who is also a nominated judge of the Administrative Court. But I should not like it to be thought that there is any need for a care case to be transferred to the High Court, let alone listed in front of one of the Division&#8217;s judges who also sits in the Administrative Court, merely because the parents or the children are subject to immigration proceedings or liable to removal.

	      <p class="p113" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.43in"><span style="font-size:10pt">The final matter is this. Although, of course, the Secretary of State is not obliged to stay his hand merely because care proceedings are on foot, the practical reality is that an illegal entrant s removal from the United Kingdom is likely to be delayed by pending care proceedings because, as Ms Richards confirmed, the usual practice of the Secretary of State is to refrain from taking enforcement action pending the outcome of such proceedings. I do not want to be thought to be saying anything to encourage the Secretary of State to take any different course. But this humane policy comes at a price and the comity between executive and judiciary which Hoffmann LJ referred to in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">ex p T </span><span style="font-size:10pt">requires sensitivity on the part of the court. The jurisdiction, as Hoffmann LJ indicated, is to be exercised sparingly. The court must be alert to the possibility in cases such as this that the local authority and the court are being used by desperate parents for ulterior purposes. Just as every asylum case demands anxious scrutiny, so does every care case. But the court must be alert that it does not allow itself to become complicit in the abuse of its own process by failed asylum seekers who may see in the processes of family law a solution to their problems not available to them within the immigration system or in the Administrative Court.</span></p>
