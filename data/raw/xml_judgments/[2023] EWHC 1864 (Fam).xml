	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case has a long and tortuous history.  It has been before me for at least the last four years.  The case has involved the instruction of a child psychiatrist, Dr Julet Butler, a renowned expert in high parental conflict cases, Dr Janine Braier, who worked in association with a colleague, Ms Karen Woodall.  Dr Braier and Ms Woodall worked for an extensive period of time of at least 15 months with the mother, the father and the children to try and resolve the conflict between the parents.  </p>

It would have an adverse impact on their ability to form relationships with partners and would have an adverse impact on their own ability to parent their own future children.</p>

The police were involved to recover the children.  They then appeared to settle.  There were various applications made on behalf of the mother, including for the children to be joined as parties.  I refused that application on the grounds that given the damage they had suffered, their real and true wishes and feelings could not be established.  Having made that decision, the mother challenged it in the Court of Appeal.  She was once again unsuccessful.</p>

The family travelled to the United States of America.  Towards the end of that holiday, Child B ran away and went to the American police.  He made allegations against his father.  The police secured the returned of Child B to his father and they returned home to this jurisdiction.  Shortly thereafter, Child A went missing and it later transpired that she had bought a mobile phone.  There then followed a series of allegations made by the children against their father.  They mirrored previous allegations which I had found to be untrue.</p>

Once again I refused that application.  The very next day an urgent application was made by solicitors instructed on behalf of Child A and Child B for them to be joined as parties.  They were represented by leading and junior counsel.  There was a full hearing of the application.  The mother, unsurprisingly, supported the application for the children to be joined as parties, the father opposed it.  Having considered all of the submissions made and the evidence in the case, I dismissed that application 22 November 2021. There was no application to appeal that decision.</p>

I was clear that this was not in the welfare best interests of the two children with whom I was concerned. I made orders preventing the local authority and the Metropolitan Police from interviewing the children.  The order in respect of the Metropolitan Police was subsequently varied.  Since that time there have been various applications made by the police, most notably in January 2022, for me to review or discharge my order preventing the Metropolitan Police from interviewing the children.</p>

I acceded to this request. At this without notice hearing I was told that the previous day at a session held by Ms Woodall with the children and the father the children had withdrawn their allegations against the father. Ms Woodall was called to give evidence. She told me that the children explained that they had been approached many times since the Spring of 2021 and put in contact with the mother. The children made reference to being approached by a &#8216;strange&#8217; man on their way to school and/or to sporting activities. For the purposes of this judgment I shall refer to him as an &#8216;unknown male&#8217;. They were given tracker devices by the unknown male and given mobile phones to contact the mother and, more occasionally, the maternal grandparents and were given cash to buy other mobile telephones to have contact with their mother and maternal grandparents. During these conversations the children were told, inter alia, to run away from the father&#8217;s home, told to make false allegations of abuse against and, as time progressed, to make more serious allegations against the father. </p>

Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">&#8230; We start by recalling that the judge read Leggatt J's statements in <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin v Credit Suisse</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Blue v Ashley</span> as an "admonition" against placing any reliance at all on the recollections of witnesses. We consider that to have been a serious error in the present case for a number of reasons. First, as has very recently been noted by HHJ Gore QC in <span style="font-style:italic">CBX v North West Anglia NHS Trust </span>[2019] 7 WLUK 57, <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin</span> is not to be taken as laying down any general principle for the assessment of evidence. It is one of a line of distinguished judicial observations that emphasise the fallibility of human memory and the need to assess witness evidence in its proper place alongside contemporaneous documentary evidence and evidence upon which undoubted or probable reliance can be placed. Earlier statements of this kind are discussed by Lord Bingham in his well-known essay <span style="font-style:italic">The Judge as Juror: The Judicial Determination of Factual Issues </span>(from The Business of Judging, Oxford 2000). But a proper awareness of the fallibility of memory does not relieve judges of the task of making findings of fact based upon all of the evidence. Heuristics or mental short cuts are no substitute for this essential judicial function. In particular, where a party's sworn evidence is disbelieved, the court must say why that is; it cannot simply ignore the evidence.</p>

The relative significance of oral and contemporaneous evidence will vary from case to case. What is important, as was highlighted in <span style="font-style:italic">Kogan</span>, is that the court assesses all the evidence in a manner suited to the case before it and does not inappropriately elevate one kind of evidence over another.&#8221;</p>

It is my view that the risk of harm to the children continues and that the mother is unlikely to gain insight at this late stage in proceedings, particularly in the light of her clear connections to women campaigning against my work and that of others in the field of children's rejection of parents. Currently, the mother is restricted from communications with the children's schools, health services and other areas in which parental responsibility is necessary. This restriction, in my view, must continue due to the risk of the mother attempting to triangulate others into her belief that the children are being held against their will.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In the light of events as they have unfolded since the Judgment of 2020 and the impact upon the children of these events, it is my view that any contact between the children and their mother, until they reach the age of 18, would put them at risk of harm. Whilst I have considered the impact on the children of having no contact at all with their mother, I have balanced this in the light of the fact that any contact which takes place is likely to convince the mother that the children must be <span style="font-style:italic">rescued</span> (encouraging further attempts at interfering with the children's recovery from the harm she has caused to them). Alternatively, it will place responsibility onto the children to find a way to reassure or persuade her that they are not being held captive and that they wish to be able to get on with their lives normally. This is far too great a responsibility for these children, whose lives to date, have been experienced in the crucible of attachment disruption of one form or another. Whilst there is undoubtably some risk of harm from prevention of all contact between the mother and the children until they reach 18 this is, in my view, far outweighed by the clear and obvious risks of contact, in circumstances where the mother simply lacks insight into the harm she has caused.</p>

Whilst Child A can explore the possibility of a WhatsApp group under my supervision, she is also able to express worries that this would encourage her mother to begin her covert campaign of pressuring her again. Each child has expressed a clear wish to be able to live without such subterfuge and the fear and anxiety it creates, and for their mother to understand that they do love their father and they are settled and well in his care. My view, in the light of this, is that an order prohibiting any direct or indirect contact between the mother and the children is now necessary; and</p>

This loss includes the sense of love and closeness, identity and continuity which such a relationship entails. The gains however, in my view, outweigh the loss, in terms of protection from the relentless effort to persuade the children to make allegations, from the belief that the children are the people who want this drama to continue and from the easy way in which the mother uses covert manipulation to achieve outcomes. What the children gain by not having to navigate all of this is a peaceful experience of being parented by their father, their proximity to him which is protected and sustained, the support of Ms A in terms of their everyday lives and the right to live a normal life like other young people. When I consider all of this, in my view the gains outweigh the losses. The children have themselves, each expressed an acceptance that it is not possible to have contact with their mother and they have each expressed acceptance that their mother may suffer consequences for her actions against their father.</p>

She expressed that she didn't feel that there was any need for her to say much at all, that she has trust in the Court to make decisions which are right for her. She finally settled on wanting to say just a few sentences which she described as a victim impact statement, which she hopes may help the Court to understand her current position.

Child B still has a propensity to lie, another feature of his presentation when I first met him, but in therapy, he is now able to understand why his reflexive tendency to tell lies, is so powerful. Child B recognises that living in a situation where he was encouraged to tell very serious lies, could only occur because he had been trained to tell lies easily. He recognises that the life that he lived with his mother, in which she expected him to lie to his father and to other people about his father, laid the groundwork for the bigger lies he was forced to tell in 2021.</p>

Child B continues to feel love for his mother whilst knowing that she has done some very bad things. He loves his father deeply and has completed a process of reparations in which he has sought forgiveness for his part in the allegations which were made against him. Child B recognises that his mother is likely to be unable to change and he also recognises and accepts that it will be a long time before he sees her again. Child B needs protection of his right to enjoy his life uninterrupted by adult matters and in my view, that is all that is necessary to say on his behalf.</p>

As a result of these two very clear positions (the mother's lack of insight or acceptance contrasted with the children's vastly improved wellbeing), I do not believe that there is any route to assisting her to have any direct contact with the children to their majority. It may be possible for there to be limited letterbox contact in the future which is monitored by their father, but the major concern must be the protection of the children from all forms of manipulation by their mother.</p>

She has been the subject of considerable comment and criticism by sections of the press and on social media. I can only comment on Ms Woodall&#8217;s role as an expert witness where she has been instructed in cases before me and, most especially, in this case. I have always found Ms Woodall to be a very experienced, independent, dedicated and effective expert witness. She has faced very great challenges in working with the mother, the father and the children. She and Dr Braier formed the view after some 15 months of intense work with the family that the mother had and, if permitted, would continue to alienate the children from the father. The accuracy of this assessment has been underscored repeatedly over the last three plus years by the actions and behaviour of this mother and the numerous judgments given by this court. </p>
