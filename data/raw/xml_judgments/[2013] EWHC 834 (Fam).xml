	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Wife&#8217;s case is simple.  She says that all the assets were accrued during the marriage.  Each party has made an equal contribution, albeit in different ways.  The assets should be divided equally on a clean break basis.  She then says that the Husband has a significantly greater earning capacity than her.  She argues that he should therefore pay the children&#8217;s school fees and University costs in full along with periodical payments of &#163;20,000 per annum per child.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Husband&#8217;s case is that the assets should be divided 60% in his favour and 40% to the Wife.  He says that there are three reasons for departure from equality, namely special contribution, pre-acquired assets and the fact that by keeping the entire shareholding in his company, Limelight, he is taking on greater financial risk than the Wife who will retain largely risk free assets.  In relation to school fees and University costs, he says they should share the cost in the proportions in which I divide the assets.  Finally, it is his case that there should be no periodical payments order as the care of the children is shared equally between them.  If I am against him in that regard, he argues that there should be an order based on the figure that would be produced by a Child Support Agency calculation. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In early 1992, the Husband decided he wanted to try to start his own business working in computer systems for the fledgling mobile telephone industry.  He proposed doing so to two other employees of Macmillan, namely Terry Webb and Justin French.   They agreed.  The Husband prepared a business plan.  Unfortunately, they had no external financing. Mr Webb therefore resigned from Macmillan to start the new business.  It became known as Vision.  Initially, Mr Webb worked for free.  The other two each invested &#163;10,000 capital and agreed that, if necessary, they would invest a further &#163;5,000 each at a later date.  In fact, this did not prove necessary.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">Mr French continued to work for Macmillan.  I am satisfied that the Husband felt uncomfortable about that given that the new business was, in effect, a rival to  Macmillan.  He had a good job offer from Macmillan Inc in the United States.  Although originally part of the same company, it had become a separate entity following a sale of the parent company. He also thought he might be able to earn more with Macmillan Inc which could help him contribute further to the start-up costs of the new business should that prove necessary.    The Husband therefore accepted the job offer and moved to the USA.</p>

On 24th December 1992, Mr Webb sent a letter to the Husband offering him an option to buy 1/3rd of the shares in Vision at par in January 1995.  The letter says that, until then, the Husband would be, in effect, a sleeping shareholder.  It ended by saying:-</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">In early 1993, Vision got its first customer.  It appears that the job was offered to the UK arm of Macmillan but Macmillan was unable to undertake the work so Mr Webb did the work for Vision.  Thereafter, the company gained a number of other blue chip customers rapidly and began to generate sales and profit. I do not have a copy of the full profit and loss accounts prior to 1996.  I do have the abbreviated accounts for the earlier years. As at 31st December 1993, the company had net assets of &#163;24,853 which had risen to &#163;84,653 by the end of 1994.</p>

In November 1993, the Wife gave up her job in the UK and moved to the United States on a one year visa.  Thereafter, they cohabited.  I accept that their initial period of cohabitation was not without difficulty but, in any event, they became engaged in early 1994.  From then onwards, it cannot be contested that they were in a settled relationship that moved seamlessly into the marriage in the autumn of 1994. </p>

The Husband went to work for Vision on their return and acquired one-third of the shares by virtue of the earlier agreement.  Mr French had also joined by this time.  The company went from strength to strength.  In particular, it developed a particular product with a company called Solar.  Although the product itself did not generate a huge amount of money, it opened doors to a very large amount of business with Solar and other similar companies.  </p>

This generated profits before tax of &#163;193,259.  The turnover rose to &#163;1,832,357 for the year ending 31st December 1997 with profit before tax of &#163;336,194.  During 1997, Mr French decided to retire.  An agreement was reached for the acquisition of his shares which included further pension contributions and on-going salary.  Overall, however, the consideration amounted to hundreds of thousands of pounds rather than millions.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">This was, however, the time of the dot.com boom.  The company began to get unsolicited approaches in which very large sums were offered to acquire the business.  In 1997, they were offered &#163;15 million by a firm called Wenden.  On turnover of &#163;1.8 million and profits before tax of &#163;336,194, this was a remarkable sum of money.  The following year, Moorhen offered &#163;20 million as against turnover of &#163;3.6 million and profit before tax of just over &#163;1 million.  It is clear that the value of the business had risen enormously in only a very short period of time.    </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">The company was eventually sold in the spring of 2000 to Atlantic for &#163;36 million, although this included shares in Atlantic and a significant &#8220;earn out&#8221; related to future profits.  The sale was very timely as it was completed approximately one month before the dot.com bubble burst.  The Husband had to continue working for the new business for several years.  Eventually, he became Chief Executive Officer.  The company continued to do well in much harsher financial circumstances.  By the time he left the business in 2004, he had received total consideration for the sale of around &#163;12 million gross, which was subject to CGT at 10%.  </p>

It is also beginning to establish a presence in the United States.  I accept that it faces certain challenges in the immediate future but there is no dispute that it is a good solid business.  Moreover, I remind myself that the Husband is very keen to retain his shares in it free of any interest in favour of the Wife.  Again, I will return to this in due course.  </p>

The letter stated that the Husband would finance the working capital of Limelight by a loan of up to &#163;250,000.  Mr Jennings would work full-time but would not draw a salary for six months or until Limelight could afford to pay, whichever was the sooner.  Mr Jennings was to receive an initial stake of 10% in Limelight which would increase to 25% subject to satisfactory performance.  Indeed, Mr Jennings did subsequently receive this shareholding, although he has since sold a proportion of his shares.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">Second, it is important to recognise that this Husband had not worked for this business at any point prior to the date of the marriage.  His contribution had been to galvanise Mr Webb into action.  He had done the business plan.  He had not, however, won any customers himself.  He had not performed any services for those customers.  In fact, he had gone to America.  He may have provided some advice but the impression I got was that this was pretty minimal prior to his return to the UK.  As the agreement said, he was a sleeping partner.  He had a right to join the business in the future and to acquire shares at par but he had not done so.  I find it very difficult to see how this set of facts can amount to a pre-marital contribution.  He cannot rely on a springboard because he had not yet arrived at the swimming pool let alone got onto the diving board.  The hard work was yet to come.   </p>

I do not accept her case in this regard.  First, having heard her evidence, it is quite clear to me that she does not want a shareholding in Limelight.  In her evidence in chief she told me that she would like a clean break.  She said she did not want &#8220;any ties&#8221; with the Husband any more.  It was only when pressed by Mr Wagstaffe that she said she would, if necessary, consider it and would be &#8220;comfortable&#8221; if the risk was shared.  This is hardly a ringing endorsement of the proposal.</p>

The Wife has never had any shareholding or involvement in the business.  If she was to have a shareholding now, it would give rise to all sorts of extremely difficult issues in relation to matters such as the Husband&#8217;s salary, the company&#8217;s dividend policy, the approach to the issuing of further shares to employees and the future direction of the business.  Would the Wife be entitled to representation on the Board?  Would she ever see any value for her shares at all, particularly given that the company has no plans in the foreseeable future to sell to a third party?  Any suggestion of further litigation in this regard, whether pursuant to the &#8220;oppressed minority&#8221; provisions or otherwise, cannot be in the interests of anyone.  Neither the Husband nor the Wife wants this and it is not something the court should countenance.</p>

It therefore follows that, although only 50% of the value of Limelight will be attributed to the Husband, pending sale, he benefits from 75% of any profits distributed as dividends.  This is a significant advantage to him that has to be weighed into the balance when considering this issue of risk.  </p>

Coleridge J said in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">H-J v H-J</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 FLR 415" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 FLR 415</ref> that the significance attaching to a particular fraction or percentage was more than merely the monetary value it represented; it goes to the core of the parties&#8217; understanding of fairness.  Even though there would often have to be a departure from equality, once there was such a departure, one party would be left with a sense of grievance and of having been undervalued.

He said that if I was to ask all the senior managers in the company they would all say that his contribution was significantly higher than that of the Husband.  He has been Managing Director.  He has built sales and the organisation to support sales.     He accepted that vision, strategy and forward thinking were all vital as were people management and generating sales.

It is right to note that, initially, the calculation was done on an erroneous basis.  I am satisfied that there was nothing sinister in that.  The correct percentage, after equal division, is, in fact, 50.25%.  There are then various share options but I do not need to trouble myself with them unless I find the value of the company to be in excess of &#163;10 million.</p>

It related to the treatment of the shares already sold by Mr Jennings.  It was suggested that equality should be calculated on the basis of deducting the cash already received by Mr Jennings rather than by reference to the proportion of the shares he had already sold.  If correct, this would have been unfair to the Husband as it would have penalised him for not having sold a similar proportion of his shares at the same time as Mr Jennings.  It would however have reduced the value of his shares for this case.  Quite properly, the Husband accepted that I should not proceed on this basis.  I therefore say no more about it.  The Husband&#8217;s share remains 50.25% although I do remind myself that, pending a sale, the agreement allows the Husband to receive 75.4% of any dividends.

He argues that such a solution is just saying that it does not prejudice the Husband in any way.  He says that, if the Husband only receives 50.25%, there will be no liability to the Wife but, if he receives more than this, it would only be fair to the Wife to share the windfall.</p>

It has led me to wonder whether it is ever appropriate to have a Single Joint Expert accountant in a High Court case.  I do accept that it would be wrong to dictate the position without regard to those High Court cases that settle on the basis of just one Single Joint Expert.  I will therefore say no more about it at the moment.  It may be that there should be some research into this issue.  Moreover, I am making absolutely no criticism of orders for Single Joint Expert accountants in non-High Court cases where such an order is not only sensible but absolutely essential to save costs.

These were done for the purposes of issuing B shares to employees and to satisfy HMRC that these shares had been correctly issued for tax purposes.  Mr Wagstaffe was extremely critical of different approaches in the two valuations, arguing that the Husband had improperly influenced the auditors to obtain a forensic advantage in this case.   I reject that submission.  First, I do not find that the Husband did so.  I accept that he made various points to Cope &amp; Wells but I am satisfied that this was because he thought their initial approach was wrong rather than with this case in mind.  Second, I have to decide this case on the evidence before me.  I have to resolve the issues raised by the three accountants who gave evidence to me.  Cope &amp; Wells did not give evidence.  Once I have decided the issues, it will be clear which of the two Cope &amp; Wells valuations is more accurate.  I am therefore clear that these valuations are largely irrelevant to my enquiry.</p>

Again, I do not agree.  I have to decide each issue between the accountants on its merits.  Once I have done so, a valuation will emerge. </p>

Moreover, the Husband&#8217;s case is firmly that he wishes to retain the shareholding in Limelight free of any claim by the Wife.  This does not suggest that he is concerned that the company is about to fail or to face significant long term problems.  I accept that, in so far as it is correct to factor these difficulties into a valuation, the right way to do so is by reducing the multiplier applied to the level of sustainable profit.  </p>

It should however be noted that this figure is after deduction as a liability of a significant director&#8217;s loan account in favour of the Husband.  At the time, he was owed &#163;1,335,406, although the loan has since reduced very substantially to &#163;214,491.  This loan is, of course, an asset in the case over and above the company valuation.      </p>

The company does a significant amount of work in the Eurozone, Eastern Europe and the United States of America.  Foreign exchange gains and losses are therefore an inevitable feature of the trading.  Any purchaser will have to take them into account.  The only safe way of doing so is by reference to the actual gains and losses as shown in the accounts.   By the conclusion of cross-examination, I formed the view that all three experts were pretty close to agreeing that this was the correct way to perform the calculation.</p>

A purchaser will take account of the amount considered reasonable to run the business after it has been acquired.  Any excess over and above this figure actually paid to the directors is therefore additional profit that the directors have merely drawn out in remuneration.

I based this conclusion on some figures given by Lesley Howe in answer to questions from the Husband as to the median figures for AIM companies.  It is also a feature of this case that both Mr Jennings and the Husband have been attempting to take a less active role in the business.  Indeed, the Husband told me that he was working less than 10 hours per week now.  This is really equivalent to a non-Executive Chairman although I entirely accept that his knowledge of the business will make his input more valuable than a Chairman who has never worked for the company.  Equally, Mr Jennings has recently reduced his hours to around 30 per week.  Any add-back for him must, however, take account of the fact that his earnings include notional commission for the sales he has, until recently, generated.  </p>

In this regard, I have additionally considered that any purchaser might well expect to include a significant element of earn out in a valuation.  In other words, both Mr Jennings and the Husband may have to continue to work in the business after sale for a period of time.  Indeed, this is exactly what happened when the Husband sold Vision.  Earn-out has not been factored into the valuation exercise.  In so far as there is any excess directors&#8217; remuneration, it is, in my view, balanced by this point in relation to earn-out.  </p>

For 2011, this was some &#163;325,000 gross but it has since reduced to &#163;225,000 gross or &#163;124,000 net.  I propose to use this latter figure.  Its importance is that the Husband has this earning capacity over and above the value of the assets in the case because this income has not been used to calculate the value of those assets.  </p>

I have decided that it is too long ago and have not therefore done so.  Second, what weighting should be given to the Management Accounts for 2012?  The issue relates to how accurate the accounts are likely to be.  I heard evidence that, in past years, the management accounts had been very accurate. At worst, they were 3% out.  This would only amount to a maximum of &#163;41,550 on the figures.   I am therefore satisfied that the figures are sufficiently accurate to be relied on fully for the purposes of the valuation exercise.</p>

A purchaser is bound to want to pay close attention to what has happened recently.  I therefore conclude that the correct route is to give a weighting of 1 to 2010; 2 to 2011 and 3 to 2012.</p>

I realise that this leads to a relatively conservative valuation for Limelight.  Looking at the case in the round, I take the view that this is correct given the budgeted deterioration in profit in 2013 and the evidence of Mr Jennings.  If I was to require any additional support for this approach, I find it from the fact that I have rejected the Husband&#8217;s case as to risk.  He will take the full value of the company as part of his half share but on the basis that I have given a relatively conservative valuation to it.     </p>
