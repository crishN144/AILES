In particular, ML was involved in discussions about appointment of the English Deputy. Concerns have been expressed (Exh RSW1) about WL trying to &#8220;shush&#8221; ML even in 2018.  The Polish Guardian has failed to provide information as requested and directed, made repeated observations that directions/orders are illegal (but has made no appeal), and makes unjustified allegations against the English deputy.   If ML&#8217;s funds are to remain in England, a new panel deputy should be appointed in place of Potter Rees Dolan TC, in the interests of a fresh start. On the other hand, if the Court considered it undesirable to have the additional costs and upheaval of a change in deputyship, Mr. Karim thought it likely (subject to taking instructions) that the English Deputy would be willing to continue.   </span></p>

In particular, ML was visited by a Probation Officer in December 2021, which gave him an opportunity to express wishes and feelings. None of the exceptions to the mandatory recognition requirements in fact apply in this matter.

Unfortunately, until very shortly before the hearing date and coincidentally with a change in WL&#8217;s representation, as Mr Rees puts it &#8220;what should have been a relatively simple matter of determining where (and by whom) ML&#8217;s property should be administered has become an unnecessarily heated and complex dispute.&#8221;  The more constructive engagement between the parties of late is very much to be welcomed.

The very fact of agreement is in my judgment an important foundation for more efficient, cost-effective management of ML&#8217;s assets in the future. If key persons in the management of ML&#8217;s estate are agreed on the mechanism of management, the practical issues which almost inevitably will arise have a much better chance of being resolved quickly and without undue cost. Accordingly, when considering whether the agreement, including withdrawal of the recognition application, is in the best interests of ML, I give significant weight to the very fact of agreement. There is a degree of complexity inherent in maintaining dual management systems but, in this matter specifically, I am satisfied that any disadvantages in that complexity are outweighed by the advantages of addressing &#8216;best interests&#8217; concerns which have arisen.  </span></p>

They also seem to me to contain proper safeguards for ML in the light of concerns raised and communication difficulties experienced to date and aired in these proceedings.

On the basis of evidence in the damages proceedings, the English Deputy considers that a three-bedroom apartment would be sufficient to meet ML&#8217;s needs, including for an overnight carer at least initially. The concern seems to be that property details provided by WL were priced at &#8220;approximately &#163;242 200,&#8221; so it is unclear why the considerably larger sum of &#163;600 000 should be allocated for property purchase, &#8220;even allowing for notary fees and budget for furnishing and the like.&#8221; The English Deputy would be content with a maximum budget of &#8220;&#163;300 000 which is the equivalent of 10% of the net damages award.&#8221; </span></p>

Purchase of property renders funds more difficult to realise but it should not remove capital from ML&#8217;s estate if it is properly secured. If a property is purchased which is in excess of ML&#8217;s current needs, there is some prospect of later realising capital by &#8216;downsizing&#8217; if necessary. There is no evidence before me to suggest that capital investment in property in Poland is any less secure than property investment in England. The Polish Guardian will be subject to the supervision of the Polish court as to how she applies the funds transferred to her for property purchase. Moreover, the terms of the proposed agreement additionally include undertakings by WL to the English court and seeking confirmation of the position of the Polish court in advance. In my judgment, that confirmation could and should specifically address how the property purchased would be secured for ML. </span></p>

That additional burden needs to be weighed against possible advantages of facilitating family care arrangements where ML is presently dependent on such. More pressing is the need to be clear about financial arrangements in respect of the running costs of the property. If other family members will be living there, what will be their contribution to household costs? If two apartments in close proximity are purchased, will the family occupants pay rent to ML? Both of these matters are important in considering the merits of the property purchase part of the proposal, not least because they will impact on the sustainability of arrangements because they will impact on how long ML has funds to meet his needs. </span></p>
