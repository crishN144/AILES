By my previous order I adjourned the matter for mediation to take place and ordered further disclosure to be given.  Although formal mediation has not taken place, the parties have attended a joint &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; meeting - in the case of the wife unrepresented, in the case of the husband represented by the solicitors.  That has not led to any kind of agreement.  I do not propose to set out any more of the background.  Anybody reading this judgment should read, first, my earlier judgment of 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> March 2014.  </span></p>

This is admitted by Mr. Warshaw, who represents him.  The disclosure that he has given makes interesting reading.  Although Mr. Warshaw produces a schedule which purportedly suggests he is hopelessly insolvent, the fact is that the husband&#8217;s lifestyle, as demonstrated by where he lives free of charge and how he spends his money extensively, is inconsistent with a person who is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">de facto</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> bankrupt, if not </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">de jure</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> bankrupt.  His credit card statements from Allied Irish Bank show that via a company called Hexstar, which is owned by his girlfriend, he receives substantial sums in cash.  The credit card with American Express, the Harrods American Express card, which is joint to him and his girlfriend, shows a lavish lifestyle.</span></p>

She was able to point out to me that in relation to loans that he receives from benefactors, including people of enormous wealth like Mr. Imerman, he makes representations that he will repay loans very shortly, while at the same time saying to this court and to his ex-wife that he has not got the means to make any payments to alleviate her position.  In relation to an entity called United Capital Incorporation, a company incorporated in Panama, on which he has been granted a loan of &#163;500,000, she was able to point out that, contrary to the schedule put in by Mr. Warshaw that stated that he was indebted to that company to the tune of &#163;478,754, he was in fact indebted to that company to the tune of &#163;231,972 against a facility of half a million pounds; and that while it says on the annual confirmation of the loan agreement that &#8220;as the value of the shares assigned has dropped, we cannot allow any further draw-downs for the time being&#8221; that is not to be taken seriously in circumstances where only a few weeks later on 20</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February, as his bank statements show, he received &#163;10,000 ( less &#163;6 bank charges) from United Capital. </span></p>

I agree he has complied with its financial terms.&#8221; The fact is, however, that he was, until October, paying for her rent (just over &#163;6,000) a month at 4 St. Barnabas Mews, SW1.  </span></p>

The wife, however, believes that if something concrete does not emerge from today, possession proceedings would inevitably follow.  If possession proceedings do follow, in circumstances where neither child is under the age of 18, it is hard to imagine what the wife would do in order to accommodate herself.  She would not be entitled to emergency housing under the Housing Act.  What she would have to do, according to Mr. Warshaw, is take the &#163;4,000 a month which the husband says he will continue paying and go off to some far-flung remote part of the metropolis and find very cheap rented accommodation, and then with the balance of the &#163;4,000 pay for her daily bread.   </span></p>

I want to make it absolutely clear to the husband that this court has available to it a full range of enforcement measures.  Having regard to the fact that the husband presents himself as a man with means but without assets, the likely means of enforcement if he does not comply with this order will be proceedings under the Debtors Act 1869 seeking his imprisonment. </span></p>

Only that interpretation is consistent with her reason, because a stay of the judgment summons procedure generally would not render the appeal nugatory.  The only thing that would render the appeal nugatory would be if a prison sentence were executed.  I, therefore, take the view that is within this court&#8217;s power to hear the judgment summons to determine if the respondent is guilty, and to deal with the question of sentence, but must, in fidelity to the order of Gloster LJ of 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2014, if a prison sentence is imposed, stay execution of the warrant pending consideration of the permission application.

Therefore Mr. Warshaw has conceded that of the principal at least &#163;600,000 is outstanding, although he sought to back-track from that concession saying that that was not an unqualified concession.  It was a concession made for the purpose of the general enforcement proceedings but in any lump sum proceedings, consistently with his client's instructions, he will take every technical point he could think of (and he has not actually told me if he has thought of any) to challenge the figure that derives from his own document, that at least &#163;600,000 of principal is outstanding today.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So I shall leave the appellate proceedings to run their course, but would simply in this judgment make it abundantly clear that, irrespective of the question of interest (as to which Mr. Warshaw seeks to take points under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1980/58/section/24/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.24(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1980/58" uk:canonical="1980 c. 58" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Limitation Act 1980</ref>); irrespective of the question of whether the asserted compliance by Mr. Mann with the compromise that was thrashed out in mediation with His Honour Clive Callman, should or should not lead to remission of all or part of the interest, there can be no doubt that as at today the husband owes around &#163;600,000, probably &#163;650,000 (being Mr. Warshaw's &#163;681,679 less the &#163;33,000-odd that has been paid since February) in principal to Mrs. Mann.  That sum is payable today and I see no reason at all why at the next hearing Mr. Mann should not show cause why he should not be imprisoned for failing to pay that sum of principal or part of it.</span></p>

Of course, in any enquiry under the Debtors Act, the court has to be satisfied that Mr. Mann is in wilful default and there will have to be a close enquiry as to whether his circumstances are as desperate as he says in the affidavit which he made on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July pursuant to my previous order.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In relation to Eaton Place, Mr. Mann has given what seems to me a plausible explanation as to how he was effectively foreclosed in relation to his interest in that property.  He has given what seems to me to be a reasonable explanation in relation to his loan account with United Capital and how that has now run into a cul-de-sac.  In relation to the allegation that he has a secret bank account from which he is paying rent, he has, to my mind, quite persuasively explained how that suspicion is unfounded.  The rent was not in fact paid in full but the deposit was appropriated, leaving arrears in respect of which his girlfriend was either bankrupted or made herself bankrupt.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The other purpose of that hearing is to establish the exact amount of principal and interest that Mr. Mann owes Mrs. Mann.  For this purpose there needs to be a determination by the court of the precise amount of the principal, in circumstances where, as I have said repeatedly, Mr. Mann accepts that he owes around &#163;650,000 but Mrs. Mann says it is rather more.  There needs to be a determination of what the actual interest at judgment debt rate has accrued since then.  There needs to be a determination of whether any part of that interest is unenforceable by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1980/58/section/24/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.24(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1980/58" uk:canonical="1980 c. 58" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Limitation Act 1980</ref>.  Then there needs to be a determination of whether any part of the interest, or principal for that matter, should be remitted in the exercise of the court's discretion.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In that regard, Mr. Mann places considerable emphasis now on the fact that he did in numeric terms pay the compromise that was reached before His Honour Clive Callman.  He says numerically he paid it, he just did not pay it on time.  To which Mrs. Mann, to my mind, makes a compelling riposte, which is that had he paid the sums due under the compromise agreement at the due time she would have bought a house.  She was not able to buy a house and the payments subsequently made only went to pay rent which is, of course, lost/dead money, the result of which is that, although the monies may have been paid, she has not at the end of it got a house.  So it seems to me that the force of Mr. Warshaw's argument is considerably undermined by that good point made by Mrs. Mann.</span></p>

Mr. Warshaw and I have had a dialogue about that and I approve the scheme that he has put forward.  It just needs to have its Is dotted and Ts crossed.  If there are any difficulties about that I will rule on them.</span></p>
