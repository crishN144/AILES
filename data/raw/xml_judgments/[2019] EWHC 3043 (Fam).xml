The judge is only too aware of how heavily invested each of the parents is in the outcome for which they contend. The judges are very well aware of how profoundly the decision will affect the future lives of the children and how difficult it will be for the disappointed parent to adjust to the outcome."  </p>

They involve a binary decision - either the child stays or he goes. There is no scope for any middle way. If the decision is that the child goes, then the left behind parent inevitably suffers a disruption to his relationship with the child, at the very least in terms of quantum and periodicity of contact. If the decision is that the child stays then the primary carer, if not invariably, then frequently will suffer distress and disappointment in having what will normally be well reasoned and bona fide plans for the future frustrated. So the decision, whichever way, is bound to cause considerable trauma.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In fact, as I will explain, a middle way was identified as this case drew to its conclusion. That middle way would allow the mother to relocate internally and thereby to seek to exploit her considerable potential in the employment market. I am satisfied that the middle way is the solution most consonant with the best interests of A, and I will adopt it for the reasons that follow. It is supported by the child&#8217;s Guardian, Mrs Perryman. By the end of the case it was supported by the father. If I reject her primary case the mother accepts the middle way. The practical details of the middle way have been agreed by the mother and the father in the event that I adopt it in principle. Those details are set out below. </p>

It is the application of the principle of the paramountcy of the children's best interests, as taxonomised by the checklist in section 1(3) of the 1989 Act.

In fact, most of the features of that guidance are statements of the obvious. Obviously, if the applicant's case is not well thought out and is not supported by evidence it will likely fail. Obviously, if the applicant's case, or the respondent's defence, is not advanced in good faith but rather is driven by an unworthy ulterior motive, then that case, or defence, will fail. Obviously, the court must consider the impact on the mother if the application is refused as well as the impact on the father if it is granted.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father was born in Hertfordshire and is aged 51. He is English. He is a selfemployed builder. The mother was born in Kazakhstan and is aged 36. She is a Kazakhstan national. She is highly skilled being fluent in Kazakh, Russian, English and French. She obtained her bachelor&#8217;s degree in Kazakhstan in English and French. In 2010 she started work at Nazarbayev University as personal assistant to two Vice Presidents. In 2011 she was awarded the Bolashak scholarship which enabled and funded study abroad. She thus undertook a Master&#8217;s degree at King&#8217;s College, London in education management. Thereafter she returned to Astana and to her employment at the University where she was promoted as a programme manager in the business school. She was working there when she was introduced to the father through a mutual friend in May 2014. At this point their interactions were only virtual; they physically met in September 2014 when the father travelled to Astana. Romance blossomed. They would meet every two months, alternating trips to Kazakhstan and England respectively. In 2015 they became engaged. In April 2016 the mother moved to Devon to live permanently with the father. They lived together in a mobile home within an old barn on a plot of land in Devon owned by the father. In May 2016 the mother fell pregnant with A. She was a planned baby. They were married on 18 June 2016. The mother was granted a spousal visa on 28 July 2016. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Unfortunately, cracks had already formed in the relationship by the time that the parties got married. It is not necessary to go into the details but among other tensions the mother appears to have been resentful of the father&#8217;s close relationship with his de facto stepdaughters from a previous relationship. Things quickly went from bad to worse, so much so that by October 2016 the parties had entered into relationship counselling. I have no doubt that by this stage the relationship was doomed. The father can have had no doubt by this stage that the mother is emotionally labile and fragile. Indeed, I believe that he must have realised that this was the essential trait of the mother&#8217;s personality from a very early stage in their relationship. </p>

Comparisons are of course invidious, but it is my clear conclusion that the mother played the greater role in A&#8217;s life in these early days. Plainly, the fact that she was breastfeeding A meant that the physical and emotional attachment between mother and daughter was very intense. This is not to say, however, that the father was remote, distant or uninterested. He was very involved and conscientious right from the start. </p>

In September 2017 the mother&#8217;s parents visited Devon from Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, the relationship continued its journey to inevitable collapse. By October 2017 the parties were discussing separation, and the mother raised with the father the possibility of her returning to Kazakhstan taking A with her. The parties returned to counselling at about that time. </p>

I told [him] that I was exhausted and that if he was not prepared to work on the relationship, then I wanted to separate and live in Kazakhstan with A. I asked whether he would agree to this and give his consent. He said he would, but wanted me to return to England first so he could have some time with A before she left and deal with the paperwork.

The following day the mother asked the father to send her the notarised letter of consent for A to live permanently with her in Kazakhstan. However, his position was that the mother and A had to return to England first to sort out the paperwork. He explained to me from the witness box that he made an insincere promise as a ruse de guerre in order to get them both back into this country. The mother and A returned on 16 January 2018. </p>

She feels she was duped into returning from Kazakhstan with A on the basis of a false promise. She also feels that a promise of which she had accepted the sincerity has now been broken. Of course, she could only have stayed in Kazakhstan with A had the father consented. Had she retained A at the conclusion of the holiday in the absence of such consent she would have been returned here promptly - of that I have no doubt, Kazakhstan having recently joined, for the UK&#8217;s purposes, in April 2017 the 1980 Hague Convention club (following the authorisation by the European Union of acceptance of its accession in June 2016). </p>

Both sides acknowledged it was over and by early March 2018 they were attending mediation. On 7 March 2018 the mother and A left the family home and moved to the home of a friend of the mother, sharing a single room in that property. That friend asked the mother to pay &#163;400 a month in rent and the father agreed to pay this. In addition, he provided &#163;50 a week in child maintenance. He also paid for her mobile phone charges and provided her with a car. The mother received child benefit of &#163;20 a week. Thus, the mother found herself as a result of the breakdown of the marriage living in a single room in a friend&#8217;s house with an income of &#163;70 a week. This income regime continued until April 2019 when the mother was awarded universal credit, following the grant to her in January 2019 of a 30-month parental visa, with recourse to public funds.  </p>

Now, contact between father and daughter in Kazakhstan is a pallid substitute for contact between father and daughter at the father&#8217;s home in England. It would have to be out of a hotel, or an Airbnb. The mother has proposed that she or her family would provide accommodation to the father but on due reflection I do not consider this to be very realistic. Similarly, the proposal that there should be a very regular WhatsApp video contact is a very poor substitute for the essential human interaction that direct contact allows. It is for these reasons that the Guardian has opposed the mother&#8217;s proposal. She wrote two very thoughtful reports and gave measured and persuasive evidence from the witness box.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have therefore reached the conclusion that the mother&#8217;s application is premature and should fail. Instead the secondary solution should be adopted. I will set out below the terms of that secondary solution. I have considered whether the mother&#8217;s application should be dismissed or stayed. The advantage of staying the application is that continued existence of the application, albeit in hibernation, would incentivise the father to cooperate with and to support fully a reasonable internal relocation plan by the mother. It would also probably assist in the provision of legal aid funding should the mother seek to renew her application. However, while it is true that FPR rule 4.1(3)(g) allows the court to stay the whole or part of any proceedings or judgment either generally or until a specified date or event, it is clear that such a power under that rule is only available for a procedural reason: see the Supreme Court Practice at para 9A-178. My reason for staying the mother&#8217;s application would not be procedural, so that rule is not in play. Therefore, if the application were to be stayed it would have to be pursuant to the court&#8217;s substantive power. The existence of that power is acknowledged in, but does not derive from, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/49/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>. It is an ancient common law power, which the courts have possessed and exercised according to Lord Blackburn from &#8220;early times (I rather think, though I have not looked at it enough to say, from the earliest times)&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Metropolitan Bank v Pooley</span> (1884-1885) L.R. 10 App. Cas. 210, HL, at 220-221).

I can see that it would be permissible to adduce evidence that an existing member of the 1980 Convention has fallen into civil collapse so that the Convention is not in effect working in that country, and one can think of two countries where that could be said to be the case. Equivalently, one can think of the situation where there is strong evidence that a long-standing member of the Convention is simply not complying with its rules. However, a vague and largely unparticularised assertion that corruption is at large generally in a state would not, in my judgment be an acceptable reason for assuming that the country in question would not faithfully apply the Convention when asked to do so. In the European Commission&#8217;s Proposal for a Council Decision authorising Member States to accept the accession of Kazakhstan to the 1980 Hague Convention given on 7 June 2016 it is recorded that there had been stakeholder consultations and an experts&#8217; meeting as to the merit of accepting the accession of Kazakhstan. Further, information had been gathered by the EU delegation in Kazakhstan, as well as from the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and UNICEF. In the view of the Permanent Bureau &#8220;Kazakhstan is a motivated State working hard with a view to implement properly the 1980 Convention.&#8221; In the light of all of this evidence the Council duly accepted the Commission&#8217;s proposal to authorise member states to accept the accession of Kazakhstan and this country duly did so with the Convention coming into force between us and Kazakhstan on 1 April 2017. </p>

Para 21 of the Guidance states that a case of &#8220;complexity&#8221; may be allocated to a judge of High Court level within the Family Court. Was this such a case? Given that Kazakhstan is a Hague Convention country I am quite sure that the criterion of complexity was not satisfied and that was no reason for this case to be heard other than at circuit judge level within the Family Court. Indeed, I struggle to understand why any relocation case, whether or not the destination country is a Hague Convention country, needs to be heard within the Family Court at High Court judge level. While these cases are difficult at a human level they are not legally or factually complex.  </p>
