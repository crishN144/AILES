The mother has not engaged in the proceedings but the father has done so. A Special Advocate has been appointed to seek to uphold the father&#8217;s Art 6 rights. Following closed hearings at which the Special Advocate represented the interests of the father, and open hearings at which the father was represented by his chosen solicitor and barrister, I have decided that FMPOs and passport retention orders should be continued until, in each case, the protected person attains the age of 21. In this open judgment I shall give my reasons for those decisions and reflect on the use of a Special Advocate in these proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant, Sheffield City Council (SCC) seeks Forced Marriage Protection Orders (FMPOs) in respect of two children, A and B, now aged 17 and 15 respectively, whose mother (M) and father (F) are the First and Second Respondents. The mother has not engaged in these proceedings and her precise whereabouts are unknown. The father has engaged in the proceedings and has agreed, on a without admissions basis, to FMPOs being made (albeit not for the durations proposed by SCC) but opposes the making of orders for the authorities to retain the children&#8217;s passports (currently held by the police). SCC has prepared a detailed document, agreed by the police, setting out the arrangements for the retention of the passports and their temporary release to each protected person on request. Those arrangements allow for a risk assessment to be carried out before the temporary release of a passport to allow the protected person to travel abroad. SCC invites the court to make passport retention orders until A and B each reach the age of 21. The Children&#8217;s Guardian supports those orders being made.</p>

A listed hearing of oral evidence had to be postponed because of a development that was fully considered at a closed hearing. At a closed hearing in April 2023, I heard evidence from, amongst others, DC Frost, who has led the police investigations in relation to the matters giving rise to the FMPOs, and from Ms Fry and Ms Bi, social workers. On 26 April 2023, at an open hearing, I heard evidence from F and, again, from Ms Bi. I received written evidence and oral submissions at both hearings. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[37] It therefore follows that, in cases where there is potential conflict between Article 3 and Article 8 rights, the court must strive for an outcome which takes account of and achieves a reasonable accommodation between the competing rights. In this context, I have deliberately chosen the word "accommodation" to reflect the court's approach. The required judicial analysis is not a true 'balancing' exercise in consequence of the imperative duty that arises from the absolute nature of Article 3 rights. Where the evidence establishes a reasonable possibility that conduct sufficient to breach Article 3 may occur, the court must at least do what is necessary to protect any potential victim from such a risk. The need to do so cannot be reduced below that necessary minimum even where the factors relating to the qualified rights protected by Article 8 are particularly weighty. Hence the need to find a word other than 'balance' to describe this process of analysis.</p>

The facts of the present case, in which the judge's order imposes a permanent travel ban upon K leaving the UK, presents the conflict, between the need to protect the individual from serious harm against the individual's freedom to conduct their private life as they wish, in stark relief.</p>

On one view, "proportionality" may seem to be an inappropriate concept when the court is considering an absolute Convention right such as Article 3. However, in cases where there has not yet been a forced marriage, the court will not be dealing with the certainty that future harm will take place but, rather, the assessment of the risk that it may do so. Where protective measures will necessarily limit the freedom of the protected person and others to enjoy other Convention rights, it will be necessary to evaluate, with a degree of precision, the extent of protection that is necessary in each individual case. In this regard, the exercise to be conducted in a FMPO application is broadly similar to that undertaken where the risk of future harm arises from the potential for Female Genital Mutilation "FGM"). In that context, this court (Irwin, Moylan and Asplin LJJ) considered the imposition of a "worldwide travel ban" in an FGM case in Re X (A Child: FGMPO) (Rev 2)&#160;<ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/1825" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 1825" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA Civ 1825</ref></p>

F says that he received an email notice from the UK Supreme Court warning him of fines if he did not ensure that his sons returned to England.

She had received training only from more senior officers at the station. She had not approached this as a potential criminal investigation but as a safeguarding issue. After her initial visit to the Father when passports were seized, DC Frost had further contact with the family after M and the two adult sons returned to England from Bangladesh in late November 2020 when no concerns were expressed to DC Frost on her visit to the family home. She understood that F had used the money saved from not travelling with the girls to Bangladesh to pay for flights for his wife and sons to travel to England, but F told me at the open hearing that he was not refunded any money from the purchase of the unused tickets.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">F said that his children were free to marry partners of their choice at a time of their choice. There was no question of arranged marriage let alone forcing them into marriage. He explained that his wife and sons had travelled to Bangladesh in October 2020 because his elderly father who lived there had suffered a fall in September 2020 when he had broken the top of his leg (I understood this to be his femur or his hip). On seeing his father, his wife had advised that he was very unwell and that he wanted to see F and the girls. F said that the girls wanted to see their grandfather. He only bought one-way tickets because there was a danger that positive covid-19 tests would prevent the family returning on the date pre-booked as a return flight. Also, he did not know whether his father would survive and so could not foresee exactly when it would be possible to return to England. Nevertheless, he denied intending to stay for a prolonged period. His wife and sons returned later in November (only about ten days after his and the girls&#8217; passports were seized) because he had received a notice from the Supreme Court (UK) demanding their return. He told the court that he obtained no refund for the unused tickets he had bought for himself and daughters to go to Bangladesh. He found &#163;4,000 to pay for his sons and wife to travel back to England. Hence, it would have cost him about &#163;8,000 to fly the whole family back from Bangladesh if he and his daughters had travelled there as planned. F&#8217;s evidence as to the source of his funds to pay for the tickets for his sons and wife was unclear. He has said that he had the money in assets in Bangladesh, but also that he had to borrow part of the money from others. He is not employed and is reliant on benefits.</p>

Prior to 29 June 2021, M had connected a domestic abuse charity, Roshni. She also contacted Roshni from Bangladesh in June 2022 alleging that F was arranging for one their sons to be sent to Bangladesh to be forced to marry there. Investigations followed and no action was taken by the police or other authorities against F. He told the court that M had requested that their son travel to Bangladesh so as to then accompany her back to England but F had not wanted his son to travel on his own. He had told Roshni that he had booked a flight for his son but then cancelled it. In answer to the obvious question of why his wife would make up such an allegation against him, he suggested that she may have had mental health problems. She has not travelled back to England and, it appears, is probably still in Bangladesh. However, her precise whereabouts and reasons for remaining in Bangladesh remain very unclear. F told me that his wife contacts him by email only, that she has been kidnapped by a policeman, and that he has tried to recruit the help of the British High Commission to secure her safety. Elsewhere he has referred to the use of &#8220;black magic&#8221; on his wife whilst in Bangladesh and to her having a relationship with another man.</p>

However, it is clear that a short visit to Bangladesh to see his father would not have prevented him from participating in the present proceedings.</p>

He said that when he had purchased one-way tickets to Bangladesh the intention had been to stay there for a short time only &#8211; two weeks or so if they could come back then, and in any event before the start of the next school term in January 2021.  I cannot accept his evidence. I cannot explain my full reasons in this open judgment but they include the following:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">F&#8217;s account of why the visit was needed at that time is not credible. His grandfather had access to help from a large number of close family members in Bangladesh. Not only were M and her two sons there, but F&#8217;s father had many other children and children-in-law in Bangladesh. The grandfather&#8217;s fall and fracture had occurred several weeks before the date of intended travel. There is no evidence that he had deteriorated since his fracture. There appears to have been no urgency. There is no evidence that he was close to death. If a short trip was planned, the father and his daughters could have visited in the school Christmas holiday period which was only about a month away, rather than disrupting the girls&#8217; schooling by flying out in November 2020. Further, I have no evidence that F&#8217;s father was in fact gravely ill and F has had ample time to provide hospital or other medical records to establish the nature and severity of his father&#8217;s condition at the relevant time. Indeed, two and a half years later, F&#8217;s father remains alive and managing without the benefit of help from F or any his children. If he had been seriously unwell, F and M could have made arrangements for F to visit him once F had his passport returned, but they did not do so. F has not, even now, visited his father in Bangladesh, which tends to suggest that his father was not so unwell as F has claimed. </p>

I am sure that these proceedings and the involvement of the authorities prompted him to pay for flights home for his wife and sons, not that email. But for the involvement of the family court, police and social services, they would have remained in Bangladesh.</p>

The previous visit had lasted over three years, which demonstrates that he was prepared to keep his family there for a prolonged period if he considered it best to do so. It is likely that, had it not been prevented by police and court intervention, this visit beginning in November 2020 would have lasted for a substantial period. I am satisfied that F has not been honest about the reason why one-way tickets were purchased &#8211; his evidence on the matter does not withstand scrutiny. I am satisfied that he is lying about the reason one-way tickets were purchased to try to hide the truth that he intended to keep the family in Bangladesh for an extended period as had previously occurred. </p>

That evidence was properly tested at the closed hearing by Ms Guha and the court. As F was informed at the open hearing, the closed evidence did not establish that there had been any plan to force A or B to marry a specific person on a specific date. I have nevertheless found the evidence that A and B would have been at risk of forced marriage on travelling to Bangladesh in November 2020, to be persuasive.</p>

I also take into account the fact that M has not returned to England and her whereabouts and circumstances are far from clear. Her warning that F intended to force one of their adult sons to travel to Bangladesh to marry adds to the concerns about the risk to A and B. I am satisfied that either F deliberately misled Ms Bi in early July 2021, seeking to give the impression that M was still in England when she had already travelled to Bangladesh, or he is lying now by saying M left for Bangladesh on 29 June 2021 when she was still in England. It is suggested that she has had an affair, that she has re-married, that she has disappeared, that she is the victim of some &#8220;black magic&#8221;. I cannot reach any conclusions about her whereabouts save to find that she is probably alive and probably in Bangladesh. Her lack of engagement in these proceedings or with A and B is concerning and consistent with her being coerced into going to and remaining in Bangladesh. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I take into account the evidence received at both the open and closed hearings. The Father&#8217;s evidence gave me no reassurance that the risk of forced marriage has diminished. I conclude that if, as I find, A was at risk of forced marriage as a 15 year old, she is certainly still at risk now, and that B, now 15, is also at risk. If the closed evidence in particular is accepted, as it is, F and M were prepared to take A to Bangladesh and to force her into marriage there at the age of 15. The Father has not been honest about that in his evidence to the court &#8211; he has flatly denied it and I do not accept his denials. I can place no trust in him that his views or intentions have changed at all since 2020. He is a determined and dogmatic man who is not easily swayed. The risk of forced marriage was present then and I am satisfied that it remains. The risk is probably greater now for B than it was then, because she is now older.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I therefore conclude that the evidence establishes that the father has consistently lied about the length of the intended stay in Bangladesh for him and his daughters when he purchased one-way tickets for them to go there in November 2020. He intended that there should be a prolonged stay there. The reason he has lied is to cover up the true reason for the visit to Bangladesh which was not to see his father, but to spend a prolonged period there and, whilst there, to try to arrange for A&#8217;s marriage. He and his wife, M, intended to marry off A whilst in Bangladesh, and would then have considered doing the same for B in due course. F has covered up that intention by lying about the reason for the trip. Those are the underlying facts as I find.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence establishes that the risk of forced marriage for each of F&#8217;s daughters is present if they were to be taken to Bangladesh. I cannot find that there is no risk if they remain in his jurisdiction but it is very much reduced. I would assess the risk of being taken to Bangladesh and to be forced into marriage there as being real and immediate. It is not as high a risk as it is in some cases where specific arrangements have been made and marriage is imminent, but the risk is real and it is present and ongoing. The real and immediate risk of forced marriage is associated with the real and immediate risk of being coerced into travelling to Bangladesh. In the absence of court orders that would have happened in 2020 and I have no hesitation in concluding that there is a significant risk that it would happen now were protective measures not in place. The father has lied about the true reasons for his wanting to take his daughters to Bangladesh in 2020 &#8211; he has maintained that lie for over two years. The circumstances of the girls&#8217; mother are very concerning &#8211; she has lost connection with her daughters, her whereabouts are unknown, and she has reported a risk of forced marriage for A and B&#8217;s sibling. There does not appear to be any family or support network that would prevent F from coercing A and B to go to Bangladesh if their passports were in the family home. There appear to be no protective factors to prevent the father taking the two girls to Bangladesh.</p>

That appears to me to be a reasonable period of time and necessary to afford them protection from forced marriage. As to the retention of their passports to the same age, I have to consider the accommodation of competing rights: the right to be protected from forced marriage, and the rights to family life enjoyed by F as well as A and B. Any interference with their Art 8 rights should be likely to be effective to protect A and B, and must be proportionate to the risk.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The risk of forced marriage on travelling to Bangladesh with their father is a real one for these two young women. The consequences of forced marriage occurring would be fundamental and life-changing for either of them. Retention of their passports until they are 21 would give them significant protection against that risk. The proposed terms of retention allow for the release of the passports subject to risk assessments. A is soon to become an adult whereupon, if not before, her passport should be regarded as her property not her father&#8217;s. I am satisfied that the interference, if any, with the Art 8 rights engaged, caused by retention of A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s passports would be small. Balancing all the factors and taking into account all the evidence, it seems to me to be plain that the passport retention orders should be made and continued until A and B are respectively aged 21. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The passport orders will prevent A and B from being coerced into going to Bangladesh and therefore will be effective in reducing the risk of forced marriage to a low level. The proposed mechanism for the retention of the passports and their release to each of A and B on their request or a request on their behalf &#8211; as happened recently when A travelled on a school trip to Berlin &#8211; may cause some delay and some difficulty on making arrangements to travel abroad, but those are minor inconveniences compared with the effectiveness of the arrangements in protecting the two young women from the risk of forced marriage. I approve the proposed arrangements. I conclude that the FMPOs should continue until A and B are 21 respectively, and that their passports should be retained until that age according to the arrangements proposed by the Local Authority and agreed by the police.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Special Advocate&#8217;s contribution to the just determination of this case has been significant. I am satisfied that the use of a Special Advocate has allowed the closed evidence to be effectively scrutinised. The involvement of the Special Advocate has led to the court, the Local Authority, and the Guardian, to consider with even greater care exactly what may be disclosed to the Father. It has allowed evidence to be given to the court which could not have been given had the proceedings been conducted openly. Indeed, as I observed in my previous judgment, the cost of insisting on disclosure of the withheld evidence would have been the withdrawal of the applications. As I have now found, those applications were well-founded and the FMPOs and passport orders necessary to protect two children from the risk of forced marriage.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, use of a Special Advocate has an impact on the duration and cost of proceedings. When applications for FMPOs and/or passport orders are contested, and there are good grounds for withholding evidence relied upon, then the proceedings may become protracted. The court has to decide how Art 3 rights can be protected whilst accommodating competing Art 6 and 8 rights. Difficult decisions have to be made about what a respondent may be told, what evidence may be disclosed, how withheld evidence may be scrutinised, and how openly the court can give its decisions and its reasons. Nevertheless, unless the courts develop a sound means of dealing with these difficulties, some of those who require protecting from the risk of forced marriage will not be protected. The courts cannot allow the difficulties involved in seeking to protect sources of evidence to emasculate its protective powers. </p>
