Allied Services Trust is not linked to any legal practice - in the terms of the 2018 judgment, it is a &#8216;Category 3&#8217; trust corporation. As foreshadowed in paragraph 65 of the 2018 judgment, the concern of these proceedings has been to identify what information is required for the Court to be satisfied that this type of trust corporation is a fit and proper legal person to hold a deputyship appointment. </p>

The Commission regulates charities and their adherence to charity law, it does not regulate the activities that charities undertake in furtherance of their objects, which are diverse in nature and which it has no expertise. It would not therefore supervise and monitor AST&#8217;s functions as deputy specifically. For example, it would not be in a position to determine whether AST was providing an efficient or effective service when appointed as deputy. Rather, it would focus on ensuring that the trustees of AST comply with their legal duties and responsibilities in managing the charity, including by taking reasonable steps to protect beneficiaries from harm and minimise the risk of abuse.&#8221;  </span></p>

Where the appointed deputy is a charity, it would also <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> be a failure to act in the charity&#8217;s best interests and a breach of trustee duties, causing loss and harm to the charity&#8217;s work, its beneficiaries and its reputation.

	<p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">The availability of compensation is not itself a form of regulation. Rather, it is a means of providing redress to a person who has suffered as a consequence of breaches of regulatory requirements. It is clearly a potential benefit to a protected person whose appointed deputy has misappropriated or mismanaged funds but the potential should not be over-stated. The SRA compensation scheme is entirely discretionary, and the availability of an alternative remedy (such as a security bond) is relevant to the exercise of discretion. </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">The Public Guardian&#8217;s position is that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the absence of any equivalent discretionary scheme for [TWAH] does not render the package of protective measures available to him inadequate</span>.&#8221;  I agree.

	<num>36.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">Does this relative disadvantage nonetheless mean that the security requirement should be set higher where the potential for discretionary compensation is not available?   The factors which are taken into account in setting the level of the security requirement are by now familiar, having been set out by Her Honour Judge Hazel Marshall QC in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span> [2009] COPLR Con Vol 606 at paragraph 55.

	<num>37.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">The Public Guardian&#8217;s position is that the availability or otherwise of a discretionary compensation scheme should not have any impact when the court is assessing the level of security bond. I understand Ms. Stickler&#8217;s argument to be that, since the (discretionary) scheme is no guarantee that any person will be able to recover funds, it should not have any positive (ie reducing) impact on the assessment of the security requirement; and if the availability of the scheme has no positive impact on the security requirement, it&#8217;s non-availability should have no negative (ie raising) impact.  </p>

      <blockContainer>
	<num>38.</num>
	<p style="margin-left:0.52in;margin-right:0.03in">Whilst recognising that potential access to a compensation scheme is desirable, I agree with the Public Guardian&#8217;s position in respect of its impact on the security requirement. The Court has to form a view of the risk of default and set the security requirement accordingly. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span> terms, the weight to be given in that assessment to availability or not of a compensation scheme which is discretionary and itself takes into account the availability of the security bond, is not such as to alter the level of security required. In short, this distinguishing feature of the regulatory/protective regimes of the Charity Commission and the SRA should not itself lead to higher security requirements for trust corporations with charitable status. </p>

	<p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in">Further clarification was sought, and the concerns raised are addressed in the statement of Michael Freeman.

      </blockContainer>
      <p style="margin-left:0.88in;margin-right:0.30in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">"8. In my view, clause 6.7 has to be read in the context of the policy as a whole. The policy is a policy of professional indemnity insurance that covers the wrongful acts of the insured (including the insured's negligence) in the course of business. The Insured's business includes acting as the court appointed deputy for property and financial affairs under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. As I understand it, this is not ancillary to the Trust's business, but a key part of it. In those circumstances, I do not think that the policy excludes claims brought against the Allied Services Trust acting in its capacity as deputy for property and financial affairs on the basis that the Trust is technically acting as a trustee when it does so. </span></p>
      <p style="margin-left:0.88in;margin-right:0.30in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">9. In my view, the exclusion in Clause 6.7 excludes the sort of insurance claims that are made when a principle or employee of the insured also happens to be the director or officer of a company, or the trustee of a pension or charity, i.e. claims against individuals arising out of work which is separate to the main business of the insured. Such liabilities would normally be covered by different policies of insurance, such as standard 'directors and officer's policies. The exclusion at clause 6.7 makes it plain that those claims are not covered by the professional indemnity policy. Our view is that this exclusion does not apply to the work of the Allied Services Trust acting in its capacity as a court appointed deputy. " </span></p>
