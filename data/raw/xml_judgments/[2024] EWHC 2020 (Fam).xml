	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with welfare issues, following on from Hague Convention proceedings, in respect of two half-siblings, D, aged fourteen years of age and K, aged ten years. The Applicant (A) is a New Zealand national, living in New Zealand. A is represented by leading and junior counsel, Mr Hames KC and Mr Marnham. With the encouragement and cooperation of D&#8217;s mother, A sought and obtained a Guardianship Order relating to D on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2018. The First Respondent (M) is the children&#8217;s mother, a British national of Tanzanian heritage, also presently living in New Zealand. M is represented by leading and junior, Mr Jarman KC and Mr Basi. Both A and M have attended the hearing on video conferencing platform. For completeness, the second respondent (S) is the maternal aunt, represented by Mr Gupta KC and Ms Kumar. The third respondent is D&#8217;s father (N), represented by Ms Mellor. The fourth respondent is K&#8217;s father (T), represented by Mr Shama and Ms Halliday. D and K, through their children&#8217;s guardian Ms Demery, are represented by Ms Giz. The proceedings, pursuant to Article 21 of the 1980 Hague Convention, now concern the single but important issue of A&#8217;s application for a Parental Responsibility Order in respect of both children.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">A and M were involved in contested private law proceedings in New Zealand. The New Zealand court had made orders providing for the children to live with the applicant for fractionally more than half of each week. In her resolve to defeat the order, M booked flights for both children to fly to the United Kingdom, as unaccompanied minors, to live with her sister (the second respondent). D had not seen his aunt, at all, for approximately eight years. He would have been six years of age when he last saw her. K had not seen her aunt since she was a young child. There appears to have been a plan that K would be introduced in person to her biological father in the UK. These arrangements, which involved these two young children travelling for nearly 30 hours halfway across the world, were not communicated to D until the day of travel and not communicated to K until she was at the airport. Neither child had any real chance to make arrangements, prepare themselves or say goodbye to anybody. It is a tribute to the aunt&#8217;s care and their resilience that they appear to be coping well at present. K has been introduced to T and that, still fledging, relationship appears to be progressing positively. There can be no dispute that this was an unlawful removal, in breach of the rights of custody vested in the applicant and in the New Zealand court. It requires to be said that it must have been an extremely frightening experience for these children. </p>

Mr Todd KC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, granted that permission. For the reasons set out in his judgment, handed down on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2024, the Judge declined to recognise the applicant&#8217;s parental responsibility in respect of both children. He did, however, give directions as to the extent and manner in which the children should spend time with A. That decision was subject to an appeal, but the appeal has been adjourned generally, pending the outcome of this application. </p>

I note that M has made allegations of domestic abuse against N which are denied and have never been adjudicated. It is a matter of record that in June 2010, the police were called to the couple&#8217;s home. M was alleging that N was trying to take D from her and had grabbed her round the throat. No further police action was taken. The following month, N contacted the local authority, the London Borough of Ealing, and asserted that M was neglecting D (who was 6 months of age). The couple&#8217;s relationship finally broke down completely in around November 2010. N left the home, leaving D with his mother. There was a dispute between the parents relating to N&#8217;s contact, which resulted in him issuing private law proceedings in the Brentford County Court on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the summer of 2013, M began a new relationship with T. The couple were together for approximately 8 months, during which time M became pregnant. In August 2013, D was made subject to a child in need plan, following a report from a concerned member of the public, that D had been hanging out of a first-floor window. When the police attended, they noticed a number of health and safety issues relating to M&#8217;s home. The baby (K) was born in June 2014. On my reading of the chronology of the case, the parents had already separated by that time. </p>

On 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2014, K was born. It is an agreed fact that T took no responsibility for or any interest in his daughter.

A was living in New Zealand and M was living in London. Though they had not met physically, the couple developed a relationship. A travelled to England to spend time with M for a few weeks in summer of 2016. In November 2016, M moved to live with the applicant in New Zealand, taking both children with her. It is an agreed fact that D&#8217;s father was not informed of this relocation. K&#8217;s father was not informed either but, I note, he had chosen to play no part in K&#8217;s life. Indeed, as I understand it, he had never seen her. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Her relationship with A appears to have led to a greater period of stability for M than she had been able to achieve before. On the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2017, A and M were married in New Zealand. The following year, they had a daughter together (Y), born on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2018. In November 2018, A and M made a joint application to the Waitakere Family Court, New Zealand. They were plainly hoping to construct a legal framework around themselves, reinforcing them as a family unit. The application was to secure the appointment of A as an additional guardian for D. During the proceedings, D's wishes and feelings were solicited. He was, by that stage, 8 years of age. It seems that D too had blossomed in this more stable environment. He was plainly doing well at school, happy and engaged in his life. He expressed an unequivocal wish to remain living with his mother, stepfather and sisters in New Zealand. The New Zealand court made, predictably, extensive efforts to encourage D&#8217;s father to engage with the process. No response was forthcoming. In the course of the litigation, M signed a letter, dated 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2018, stating that A was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the only father [K] had ever known&#8221;.</span> This is not only accurate but it requires to be emphasised. For the first nine years of her life, and she is still only ten, K has known only A as her father. He has been fully committed to her and a father in every sense other than the simply biological. Judge VR Kidwell, sitting in the Waitakere Family Court, granted the application and appointed A as a Guardian for D. No application was made in relation to K, as I understand it, because she had no idea that A was not her biological father. In A&#8217;s statement, he tells me that he had tried to persuade M to tell K the truth of her origins but M did not want to do so. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Sadly, in 2022, storm clouds settled over the couple&#8217;s relationship. M&#8217;s behaviour is said by A to have become increasingly erratic. It resonates with some of her behaviours in her earlier relationships. M was plainly struggling to get the children to school on time or indeed at all. She was also charged with an offence of assault against D. These allegations went to trial, in the criminal court, M was acquitted. A contends that M went to Canada, leaving all 3 children with him for a period of approximately two weeks in the summer of 2022. As I understand it, M disputes this. In any event, in August 2022, it is clear that the relationship between A and M had irretrievably broken down albeit that they continued to live together in the family home for a short period. On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023, M left the family home, taking all three children to live with her in refuge accommodation in central Auckland. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">A filed applications to the Northshore Family Court on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023, seeking to restrain Y from being removed from the jurisdiction of New Zealand. On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023, the application was amended to seek care of all three children. On 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2023, Judge Maude delivered an interim judgment in which he recorded being told by the children&#8217;s lawyer that S and K both missed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;their dad&#8221;</span>. D seemed to be most concerned about missing school. He <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;wasn&#8217;t so sure&#8221;</span> about missing A. I sense that D&#8217;s carefully poised answer reflected an unwillingness to be perceived as taking sides. There can be no doubt about A&#8217;s role in K&#8217;s life. Judge Maude&#8217;s approved judgment makes it pellucidly clear that K sees A as her <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;dad&#8221;</span>. The Judge made an interim shared care order, dividing the children&#8217;s week between M and A. Within a month of the Judge making the order, the children were removed in the circumstances that I have described. </p>

What he seeks to achieve is easy, natural video and telephone contact between Y and her siblings as she still continues to see them. He also remains entirely committed to K and D. By his application for parental responsibility, he asks the court formally to legalise that which exists in reality. </p>

In each of those examples, a father with parental responsibility would have the right to be heard on the application.

The Children Act 1989 replaced the concept of parental rights with one of parental responsibility. Section 3(1) of the Act states that &#8220;parental responsibility&#8221; means </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11.5pt">&#8220;all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property&#8221;.</span><span style="font-size:11.5pt"> Clearly, the defining features of the order focus on parental rights.

If the parents are not married, the father may acquire it by a formal agreement with the mother (s 4(1)(b)) or, on the application of the father to the court, an order may be made (s 4(1)(a)). There are no criteria set out in the Act for the granting of parental responsibility but in Re G (A Minor) (Parental Responsibility Order) [1994] 1 FLR 504 Balcombe LJ applied the principles set out in his judgment in Re H (above) to a parental responsibility application made under the Children Act.

In private law, by s.2(7) CA 1989, where more than one person has parental responsibility, each of them may act alone and without the other. Section 2(7) does not however give one party dominance or priority over the other in the exercise of parental responsibility. Each parent has equal parental responsibility, even though the day to day realities of life mean that each frequently acts alone. This applies particularly where the parties live in separate households and one parent is the primary carer. As Theis J put it in&#160;F v F&#160;at paragraph [21],&#160;"in most circumstances [the way parental responsibility is exercised] is negotiated between the parents and their decision put into effect."&#160; As neither parent has primacy over the other, the parties have no option but to come to court to seek a resolution when they cannot agree&#8221;</span></p>

So too has his aunt, in her evidence. Despite the interruption in their relationship, she is obviously extremely fond of him. What emerges is a young man who wants a little time and space to unravel some of the dramatic changes that have taken place in his life. Most strikingly of all he impresses me as wishing to recover some of his autonomy. The circumstances in which he left New Zealand afforded him no respect at all. The experience, which I have read he seems reluctant to speak about, is bound to have been a traumatic one both for him and K. Alongside the shock of leaving his entire life behind, without any real notice being given to him, he was also placed in a parenting role to K. The circumstances that he faced, over a 32-hour journey, would have been challenging to an experienced adult carer. I note that his answers to Ms Demery are frequently ambivalent e.g., wanting to live with his aunt for 2 years and then perhaps live with his father; indicating that he <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;probably&#8221;</span> would not want A to have parental responsibility; indifferent on the question of whether he would want to meet the Judge. </p>

He has always known that A is not his biological father and the nature of their relationship is inevitably different from that of K and A. D strikes me as interested in his birth father but wary of being hurt. He plainly feels safe with his aunt and from the answers he has given to Ms Demery, presents as wanting to give his father the opportunity to prove his commitment. I hope his father hears this message. It strikes me as clear and reasonable. </p>

In his discussions with her, A emphasised that his applications are <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;born out of his love and concern for them&#8221;</span>. He correctly emphasises, as I have done above, that he was, until recently, the only father that K knew. He also points out that he was, in effect, in a paternal role to D since he was six years old. It is obvious that when D engages with him on the telephone to any protracted extent, A is absolutely delighted. He is consistently and instinctively child focused and pleased that D has retained some contact with his friends in New Zealand, despite his abrupt separation from them. It will have been embarrassing for him and must have been extremely difficult for D to explain to his friends what had happened. It will have required a degree of courage. A is also supportive of D&#8217;s birth father. This is not in any way tactical within the proceedings, it is a reasoned and thought-through understanding of how important it is for D to have a father figure and an insightful recognition that it will dilute the pressure on him to assume <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the role of protector to his sister&#8221;</span>. He is highly alert to the fact that, as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the older child&#8221;</span>, D has been caught in the middle of adult conflict. I consider it to be impressive that whilst he understandably worries that the mother might attempt to abduct Y, he nonetheless, instinctively understands the importance of the contact for their daughter Y. It is also of note that A described M as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a good mother when she is in a positive mental space&#8221;</span>. I consider that despite their acrimonious separation, A will be able to present a positive image of M.

Ms Demery considers that D has reached an age and level of maturity where it is appropriate to attach significant weight to his views. I agree but would add to that. The respect to be afforded to his evolving autonomy is, in my judgement, an important consideration. Understanding the significance of it requires an appreciation of the extent to which it has not been respected in the past. I do not think, given D&#8217;s age, the existence of a Parental Responsibility Order in favour of A would either add to or subtract significantly from the quality and importance of their relationship, each to the other. By contrast, to overrule both D&#8217;s consistently expressed wishes and his feelings (resistant to the Parental Responsibility Order) would, I think, generate a sense of disempowerment which, in the light of his experiences, is likely to be inconsistent with his best interests and general welfare. Accordingly, I do not propose to grant the order in respect of him. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is important that I record that A was anxious that the children might react adversely if there was a different outcome to his application in respect of each of them. I find that to be a characteristically healthy and instinctive response but I am satisfied, from what I am told, that the children are unlikely to spend much, if any time, discussing Parental Responsibility Orders. They are far more focused, as they should be, on the day-to-day challenges and activities that forge their world. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The children&#8217;s guardian has not supported A&#8217;s application for parental responsibility in respect of either child. Much of Ms Demery&#8217;s analysis, in her substantive report, was focused on where and with whom the children live. That was the major point of contention at the time. Understandably, less thought had been given to the question of parental responsibility. For this reason, I requested an addendum which was filed on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2024. In her substantive report, Ms Demery made the following observations about the children: </p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[D] and [K] are charming and engaging children who have a good relationship with each other. They have experienced recent seismic changes in their lives, the separation of their mother and stepfather, change of home and country without their sister and their mother who has been their primary carer. They are living in a country which [D] left at the age of 6 and [K] at the age of 2. Before their departure to New Zealand, [D] had already experienced neglect because of his mother&#8217;s poor mental health. The international movement of children, based on unilateral decision making by one parent without consultation with the other is harmful to children. This appears to be one of many harmful childhood experiences that [D] and [K] have borne on account of their mother&#8217;s actions. The information within the court bundle details the serious allegations that the children&#8217;s mother and stepfather make about each other of domestic abuse, poor general care and parenting and lack of stability. These incidences have negatively affected [D] and [K]&#8217;s emotional world and threatened their safety. They may need specialist help to overcome these harmful experiences. [D] was already beginning to access therapy while in New Zealand&#8221;. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In her addendum report, Ms Demery reiterates the concern in her initial report that D&#8217;s answers reveal the influence of his mother. On my reading of the papers, Ms Demery is right to emphasise this, indeed, I consider there is clear evidence of M&#8217;s influence. The following analysis is proffered, on the question of parental responsibility: </p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Turning to the issue of [A] being granted parental responsibility, in my view his desire to be granted such is borne out of his genuine concern for [D] and [K], which I fully understand as he was so involved in their lives during their formative years. I appreciate that he would wish to have this acknowledged and for him to have some input in their lives. It adds an additional layer of complication in agreeing arrangements for the care of the children, given he is in another country, and the communication between him, [M] and [S] is strained. [D] has his own reservations. Nevertheless, I think it is important that he is kept informed of the children&#8217;s progress and wellbeing&#8221;.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is no doubt that in some cases, the making of a Parental Responsibility Order can, as Ms Demery suggests, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;add an additional layer of complication&#8221;</span> in determining arrangements for the children&#8217;s care. However, as King LJ observed, in most cases the <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;day-to-day realities of life&#8221;</span> mean the parents frequently act alone. As King LJ says, this particularly applies <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;where the parties live in separate households and one parent is the primary carer&#8221;</span>. Some parents misuse Parental Responsibility Orders to interfere unhelpfully in their children&#8217;s lives, not infrequently, to exert control over a former partner. Nobody suggests that arises here. On the contrary, the integrity of A&#8217;s application is beyond any doubt. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is a happy feature of this case that K&#8217;s introduction to her father, who had, hitherto, had absolutely no role in her life at all, appears to be going very well. They have strikingly similar interests and personalities. I also have a strong impression that this ten-year-old girl is very much in control of the situation. Like her father, she enjoys video games. She describes him as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;very competitive&#8221;</span>. Though he did not give evidence, he spoke to me from the well of the court. He told me that as far as his daughter was concerned, he had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;got on the ship and would be on it until the end of the voyage&#8221;</span>. Despite the background history, I found his asserted commitment to be spontaneous and genuine. That said, as the guardian points out, the relationship is in its early stages and its history could hardly be described as propitious. It is also significant that A is not only supportive of this new relationship, but, in my judgement, reassured by it. On the other side of the world, he plainly worries about K whom he has long regarded as his daughter. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">When I consider the case law, it strikes me as beyond any doubt that A has shown a lengthy and instinctive commitment towards K. There is no doubt either that she has regarded him as her father, she was led to believe that he was her real father. I am satisfied that there has been a strong attachment which has, doubtless, been buffeted to some degree, both by the traumatic circumstances of her removal from New Zealand and M&#8217;s negativity towards A. He must, however, be a significant figure in her history and an important part of her evolving identity. The Parental Responsibility Order recognises the reality of A&#8217;s status in her life. It may also serve to signal to K that A&#8217;s commitment to her did not waiver on their separation. It strikes me as an Order that has the capacity to reassure K that she was loved by the man she regarded as her father for so long. Inevitably, A and K&#8217;s relationship is changing and will change further. The distance between them may mean that they will gradually recede from each other&#8217;s lives. It is likely, on all the available evidence, that the Parental Responsibility Order will do no more than reflect A&#8217;s status. I do not consider this to be a case where such an Order will add any layer of complication to K&#8217;s life. In this, I disagree with the Guardian&#8217;s hypothesis. There is a great deal of evidence of A&#8217;s real understanding of and focus upon K&#8217;s welfare needs. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is important to highlight that M has twice, unilaterally, removed her children from their habitual residence, without informing her partner. It is entirely understandable that A worries that she might do that again. If that situation arose, A considers that the Order would avail him of the opportunity, if required, to step in to protect K&#8217;s interests. In this, he is correct. I do not, however, consider that would create a layer of complication, on the contrary, it may afford an added level of protection for her. It is clear to me that A regards this Order as recognising responsibilities and not as affording him rights. His entire conduct throughout this litigation is evidence of that. Importantly, this bodes well for the future. I also consider, for all these reasons, that it is in K&#8217;s best interests that the Order should be made and accordingly, grant the application. </p>
