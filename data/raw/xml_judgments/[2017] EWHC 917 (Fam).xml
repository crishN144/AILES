I remain of the view that, allowing for the intervening vacation, a period of 21 days from 12 April 2017 is sufficient and appropriate. Ms Bazley sought a stay for a somewhat longer period, in part because of potential public funding delays. I do not agree. By the time the period of 21 days from 12 April 2017 runs out, almost two months will have elapsed since the judgment was sent to the parties on 6 March 2017. If there is to be any further or extended stay, that, in my judgment, is a matter for determination by the Court of Appeal.</p>
