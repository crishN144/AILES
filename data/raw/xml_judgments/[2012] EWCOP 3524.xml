A limited reporting restriction order dated 27 November is in force.  This prevents the naming of (i) the medical and care staff at the hospital where DJ is a patient, (ii) the hospital itself and (iii) the identity of the NHS trust.  When making the reporting restriction order, I explained that it was necessary in order to ensure that the medical and care staff can continue to look after DJ without interference. The restriction on naming the Trust is necessary because identifying the Trust would identify the hospital.  The Trust did not seek the order for its own sake and it has raised no objection to the hearing taking place in public.</span></p>

The trust has brought the proceedings because there is longstanding disagreement between the family and the doctors about what treatment should be given.  This requires the court to make an assessment of DJ's best interests within the framework of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>.  If that assessment supports the view taken by the doctors, a declaration may be granted endorsing the lawfulness of their approach.  In some cases, such as those involving the withdrawal of life support from a patient in a vegetative state, this statement of lawfulness is necessary.  It must always be recognised that a declaration is not a treatment order but the endorsement of a plan created by others.</span></p>

They must be sufficiently clear for a reliable assessment of the patient's best interests to be made.  Sometimes the patient is in a stable condition, but it may also be possible for an assessment of best interests to occur where future circumstances can confidently be foreseen.  However, it will not be right to make a declaration if this degree of confidence is lacking: otherwise the court&#8217;s endorsement may not be valid and may become a blunt instrument that is not appropriate in future circumstances.</span></p>

That is a judgment for the individual doctor in the particular case.  A patient cannot order a doctor to give a particular form of treatment, although he may refuse treatment.  The court's position is no different.

He and MJ celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in September.  They have three children and three grandchildren and many friends.  Before his illness, DJ spent over 50 years in the music business, continuing to perform from time to time after his retirement and right up to his admission to hospital.  He was a heavy smoker.</span></p>

This was soon resolved, but he unfortunately acquired an infection that was complicated by the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an acute kidney injury and persistent low blood pressure.  On 24 May, he became extremely unwell and was admitted to the critical care unit, where he has remained.  He was found to have multi-organ failure, with respiratory failure, cardiovascular failure and renal failure.  On 27 May, he was placed on ventilator support.</span></p>

However, in early June his condition again deteriorated and he again required inotropic drugs for his blood pressure.  These led to necrosis (blackening) of his toes. Attempts were made to liberate him from mechanical ventilation by placing him on a lesser supported breathing system (Drager CPAP).  During the month of June a tracheostomy was performed.  Despite regular care, he began to develop sacral pressure sores from being confined to bed.  Despite the best efforts of the hospital, he had become severely underweight.</span></p>

He seemed to know appropriately when asked if he was feeling alright by his wife.  She combed DJ's hair, during which DJ smiled.  DJ was given a paper to read by his son.  DJ turned the pages with his left arm.  It is not clear to me whether he was reading any of the articles or looking at the pictures in the paper, however he smiled while looking at the paper.  During this time he put on and took off his glasses.  A nurse put an iPad on a flexible mount attached to a table which DJ could reach.  PJ encouraged his father to play a simulated keyboard on the iPad.  DJ was clearly interested in the iPad and its mount.  He could not play any recognisable tunes on the simulated keyboard, even after his son demonstrated several simple melodies.  PJ then opened a communication program with pictographic representations of moods (for example: happy face/sad face/angry face) with a written description under each picture.  PJ asked his father to show him what emotion he was feeling.  I did not see a consistent response from DJ.  DJ appeared to enjoy watching videos on his son's phone.  I asked whether DJ was having a good day or a bad day.  I was informed that this was a fairly good day, but that he was easily fatigued.</span></p>

In circumstances such as these, it may be that an assessment of best interests leads to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the patient to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, even if this may result in the person's death. The decision-maker must make a decision based on the best interests of the person who lacks capacity. They must not be motivated by a desire to bring about the person's death for whatever reason, even if this is from a sense of compassion. Healthcare and social care staff should also refer to relevant professional guidance when making decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment.&#8221;</span></p>
