The CCG remained neutral, but highlighted aspects of the evidence in closing submissions whilst local authority adopts a strictly neutral position. </p>

Let there be no doubt: that is the devout wish of SJ. In her moving evidence she told me &#8220;I am fighting for the right of my father to die&#8221;. SJ&#8217;s evidence was clear that she did not want her father to die and she was &#8220;fighting for his right to die&#8221; because she believes that is what he wanted. There is no question that she wishes her father to die for her sake or out of her own interests. </p>

Had I reached the opposite conclusion this would have given rise to distinctly complex legal and ethical questions. I would have had to have considered in depth the impact of article 2.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (incorporated by the Human Rights Act 1998). As is well-known, this provides: &#8220;Everyone&#8217;s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally &#8230;&#8221; This is subject to four exceptions, none of which is relevant to this case. Further, I would have had to have grappled with the somewhat impenetrable meaning of section 4(5) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 which provides that &#8220;where the determination relates to life-sustaining treatment [the decision-maker] must not, in considering whether the treatment is in the best interests of the person concerned, be motivated by a desire to bring about his death.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Before I explain my reasons for my decision there are two matters I should mention at the outset. This case was listed to be heard before me in court in Nottingham. But with the onset of the national COVID-19 medical emergency it became clear to me that a traditional physical courtroom trial was likely to be extremely risky to the participants and therefore was unacceptable. Therefore, I decided with the agreement of all participants, at a telephone case management conference on the day before the start of the trial, that the hearing would be by Skype. The organiser and manager of the virtual hearing was Mr Matt Nichols of DAC Beachcroft in Bristol, the solicitors for the GP. I am very grateful for his extremely assiduous work in ensuring that the hearing proceeded almost without a hitch. I am also grateful to all the lawyers and other participants who cooperated so fully so as to enable the hearing to function. There were 17 continuously active participants at the hearing and in addition 11 witnesses were heard. Further, two journalists observed the proceedings. The participants and witnesses were scattered all over the country from Northumberland to Cornwall, Sussex to Lancashire. The only slight problem was that a few of the recording files became corrupted by virtue of their size. The lesson is that a sequence of recordings should be made, none exceeding about 30 minutes. In the current national crisis, it must be expected that hearings will be conducted remotely in this way as a matter of routine practice. </p>

As he put it, it is the right of the past capacitous AF to determine the fate of the present incapacitous AF. His submissions came close to saying that this was in effect the determining factor. The other counsel do not dispute the relevance of this principle but do not agree that decisive weight is to be attributed to it. It is one of a number of factors to be put into the mix when making the holistic best interests evaluation. Of, at least, equal merit or importance is the principle of preservation of human life, as well as the fact that while AF&#8217;s present life is markedly diminished compared to his life before his stroke, it is still a life which has intrinsic quality and from which he appears to derive appreciable pleasure. </p>

All the expert witnesses agreed with me that the workings of a grossly incapacitated mind is a largely undiscovered country. It would be a grave mistake to assume that AF repines and that he makes relativistic judgments about the plight in which he finds himself. As Dr G rightly stated: &#8220;it is very difficult to know his subjective views since the stroke&#8221;.

The evidence was that following the death of his wife he consulted the solicitor in Ireland who was dealing with the probate of her will about the possibility of making a living will, but that he never followed it up. However, given his expressed wishes I doubt very much, had he written such an advance decision, it would have covered anything other than a descent into a vegetative or minimally conscious state. As I will explain, AF is sentient, cognitively active, emotionally aware and possessed of motor functions, albeit grossly impaired physically and mentally.

He enjoys in very modest amounts spicy food from time to time. He enjoys doughnuts, chips, toast and cake, again intermittently. Although he does not drink daily he likes coffee and hot chocolate. There is agreement that of itself the amount that he ingests orally would not be enough to sustain his life. </p>

He would be very pleased when Y lay on his bed and he could hold him and feel his wet nose. I have seen a photograph of AF holding Y on his bed; AF is beaming. I have also seen a photograph of AF beaming when a small Shetland pony was brought into his room. </p>

Nonetheless, he was of the opinion that it was in his best interests that he should be so directed. His evidence was that only one possible conclusion can be drawn from the totality of the evidence available concerning his past wishes and other personal factors, and that is that AF did not wish CANH to be initiated or continued, and that he would still not wish  CANH to continue. In his opinion the totality of AF&#8217;s behaviour is of a man who &#8220;does not want to be here&#8221; but who does not wish to expose himself to more pain or distress by active resistance and does not wish to distress those who care for him by being antisocial or uncooperative. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I do not agree with this view which is as much ethical as it is medical. In writing Dr H appeared to be of the same opinion as Professor W although when he was faced with the awful consequences of the proposal under cross-examination he appeared to shrink from that view, stating that in such circumstances he would not agree with Professor W&#8217;s view and that it was in any event not a medical question. Dr G gave compelling evidence about the possible psychiatric disorders from which AF may be suffering. She was of the opinion were he to be set on the path proposed death would be &#8220;overwhelmingly likely&#8221;. She was clear that the proposal would be directly contrary to his best interests. The dietician, BR, was less sure that the proposed path would inevitably lead to death. This was a &#8220;very difficult question&#8221; the answer to which was &#8220;we just do not know&#8221;. This led me to observe, as I had earlier, that if this were the case then what is being proposed is a macabre experiment. The palliative care consultant, Dr P stated that in the present national medical emergency it would be impossible to provide palliative support for AF either in his current home or in a hospice. That is an additional reason for refusing the proposal. </p>

His oral statements to his family cannot be construed as being applicable to anything more than a descent to a vegetative or minimally conscious or equivalent state. They cannot be construed as being applied to his present condition. Following the stroke AF&#8217;s statements were made at a time when he crossed the boundary into incapacity and cannot be construed as a rational and considered wish for self-destruction. </p>

In that event of course there would not be a case in the Court of Protection. I think it unlikely that if he were granted a brief window of lucidity, he would reach the conclusion that he would be better off dead rather than to continue with the limited life that he presently enjoys. He would recognise that he is not in the grips of a terminal illness leading inevitably to an unpleasant and painful death. I do not think that were he granted that brief window of lucidity he would ask to be taken at once to Dignitas.  </p>

The views of the GP and the carers at the care home are that it is unthinkable that AF should be in effect starved to death. They would not be prepared to participate in such a process which would mean that AF would have to move elsewhere. Even if that were possible at the present time, and it is not, such a move would inevitably cause disturbance and distress to AF. </p>

This may be a diminished life, but it is a life nonetheless which has, as I have said, intrinsic quality and from which AF derives pleasure and satisfaction. </p>
