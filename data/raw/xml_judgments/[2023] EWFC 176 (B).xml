	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This fact-finding hearing was listed for two days. It transpired that the evidence included 2 ABE interviews conducted with the mother and 2 police interviews conducted with the father, in addition the father wished the court to consider two pieces of video evidence. Neither party had provided transcripts of these interviews and it was thus necessary to listen to 8 hours of evidence, all interpreted into father&#8217;s first language. That took the entirety of the time initially allocated to this matter.</span></p>

During cross examination it became clear that Ms White wished to put to the father numerous documents which supported her contention of recent complaint, it was further clear that he had not read those documents and moreover he could not do so as they were in English. The case was subsequently adjourned to allow for those documents to be translated. Evidence and submissions concluded on 7 August; I then adjourned the case to review the documentation before providing a judgment.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">There has been a marked disparity in the quality of representation. The mother has had consistent and skilled representation from Ms White, she has been supported at court by a trainee solicitor throughout the process. She has had the benefit of legal aid and her solicitors have been able to carry out the investigations they saw fit. The father who is from Eastern Europe has had no legal representation. He has conducted the proceedings in a foreign language in the court of a country of which he is not a national. The court has provided interpreters but between court hearings he has had no support.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This case predates the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 and thus questioning has been conducted by me based on the questions provided by the father. Participation directions have allowed the mother to give evidence from the Vulnerable Witness Suite. This has allowed her to provide the best evidence possible. I have endeavoured to fulfil my obligations pursuant to 31G(6) Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 and Practice Direction 12J paragraph 28 and this had led to the uncomfortable position of asking questions on the father&#8217;s behalf and challenging the mother&#8217;s assertion she had been raped. That assistance does not of course extend to outside of the court arena and I have been troubled by the lack of any legal support for the father who faced allegations of the most serious nature. </span></p>

Her testimony included some more background as to the dynamics of the relationship and difficulties that arose in respect of their various children, as well as detail about the father&#8217;s demeanour, what she was thinking and feeling during the incident and a very detailed description of the exact mechanisms of the rape itself, including that she did not scream. She stated she made a conscious decision not to fight as the father was not someone you said &#8216;no&#8217; to and she was concerned for the safety of her unborn baby. She described the brutal nature of the rape and how she had discovered she was bleeding afterwards. The Mother explained that she and the father never discussed the incident and that whilst she was unable to label what had taken place between them, she knew it was not right and was not normal. She was unable to tell the Police the exact date the incident had taken place but explained that the father expected sex every day at least once, saying that it was all he cared about and that he would get angry if they did not do it at least once. </span></p>

He would tell her not to wear certain clothing, she gives him money and that she can only speak to women. On one occasion at school she spoke to a male teacher and the father became very angry and aggressive. The mother told me that she is very frightened of him. She described him as very controlling, and she knows that if she does not do it there will be consequences. She has given him a key and often he would let himself into the house and be waiting for her when she got home even though she had told him that she did not want to see him. The mother told me that she has not been physically beaten but he has grabbed her on a number of occasions on her arm. She then went on to tell me that the father would demand sex every day and if she refused to have sex with him he would get very angry. The mother told me that even when she told the father that she was tired or felt unwell and did not want to have sex he would say to her that she must have sex with him because he had been nice to her for the past two weeks. The mother told me that she would have sex even though she did not want to because she knew what the consequences would be if she didn't.

She said that she felt very frightened, and he then forced her to have sex with him and it was really painful and it caused her to bleed. She went on to say that she didn't scream, and she feels guilty about letting it happen. I asked the mother why she did not report the rape to the police, and she told me that she did not want anybody to know because he was her partner and she felt embarrassed.

She explained she had reported those fathers for the same circumstances. So I said to her, what happened after you called the Police? She said the Police weren&#8217;t able to help her due to lack of evidence. She had accused the two fathers of her daughters also. She also told her that her daughter&#8217;s grandfather tried to rape her, he pulled her trousers down. So there is another story about the friend of her sister-in-law that had tried to rape her. I didn&#8217;t believe it, but all the neighbours warned me about getting involved with her.&#8221;</span></p>

She described struggling emotionally to come to terms with what had occurred and having an initial reluctance to report the incident.

She gave evidence via the video link system but appeared a far less powerful figure. Should the father wish to physically intimidate her, or indeed anyone else below a professional sportsperson he could do so. Why does this description matter? It matters because it is a family court judge&#8217;s responsibility to understand the interaction between these individuals; their behaviours, their fears, and the potential risks they pose to each other particularly in the context of allegations of rape and coercion and control.

In addition, as indicated I determine she failed to portray the elements of the relationship which worked for her at the time. However, the cumulative effect of those discrepancies and shortcomings in my assessment did not undermine the central testimony she gave. A survey of the points in favour of her testimony as set out in paragraph 87 show that there are 19 cogent points which support her testimony. I have reviewed them before reaching a conclusion and they are sufficient in my estimation to determine the truthfulness of her central testimony.</span></p>

This is entirely supported by the description of professionals. When she chose to follow his wishes and give into his demands, she did not need to be afraid hence her relaxed and loving approaches at times. When she was willing to be subservient this was a relationship which functioned. When she was not willing to be subservient problems arose. This appears to me to be the classic coercive and controlling situation. Physical violence is entirely unnecessary. I thus accept the central assertion that the mother experienced coercion and control; I do not regard it as necessary to make factual determinations on each of the allegations made.</span></p>
