On that day I refused F&#8217;s preliminary application to hear oral evidence. I have been greatly assisted by detailed written and oral submissions from Counsel: Miss Amiraftabi for F and Miss Chokowry for M. The parties rely on witness statements from F and M, from M&#8217;s sister, MM, from CA, an acquaintance of M and F who provided advice and informal counselling to M and F prior to Z&#8217;s birth, and from three social workers from relevant Local Authority, LB, JL and YA. I have also been provided with an expert report from Dr Charles Muster, Psychiatrist, provided on joint instructions but led by solicitors for M, and healthcare records relating in particular to M&#8217;s stays at an NHS Mother and Baby Unit and the Jamma Umoja Unit. F exhibits to his statement lengthy text message exchanges as well as emails and confirmation of airline bookings. I also have copies of orders made in the courts in New York State.</span></p>

We have been told by Mr. Scott-Manderson that there is an increasing tendency for applications for oral evidence to be advanced at the case management stage. There should be no departure from the well-recognised proposition that Hague applications are for peremptory orders to be decided on written evidence amplified by oral submissions.  </span></p>

Classically oral evidence will be limited to those cases where the issue for the court is whether or not an agreement was reached between the parents sufficient to establish the defence of consent. I would accept Mr. Scott-Manderson's submission that there is not the same requirement for oral evidence in a case in which the defence asserted is not consent but acquiescence. Although those two defences have much in common, in the sense that they are divided by the time line of the removal, as Mr. Scott-Manderson correctly submits, the concept of acquiescence is altogether more nebulous and there will seldom be one distinct conflict of evidence for the determination of which the judge would be dependent upon hearing from the parties orally.&#8221; </span></p>

She has also been diagnosed as suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (&#8220;OCD&#8221;) manifesting itself with rumination and rituals which have prevented her, at times, from adequately attending to Z&#8217;s needs when he has been in her care.</span></p>

The following day M, F and MM attended on M&#8217;s Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Dr Rajamani, who noted her poor psychological condition &#8211; [pg D 103 of the Core Bundle]. Plans were made for M to join her family in England. After incidents leading to her hospitalisation in late January, including a 4 day period of in-patient care beginning on 30 January 2017, F would not agree to Z joining M during her stay in England, even though Dr Rajamani had advised that Z should be with M who was still breastfeeding. So it was that on 8 February 2017, M left the USA with her sister MM, but without F or Z.</span></p>

The texts written by F are lengthy. I treat them with some caution. They appear at times to comprise a stream of consciousness rather than expressions of considered, settled views. F sometimes becomes irate and then later apologises and shows affection. The use of grammar particular to texting can hinder interpretation and the texts do not represent the whole of the communications between F and M. There were telephone exchanges as well.  Nevertheless the texts are a useful source and, together with the other evidence, they establish that:</span></p>

This was in the context of worrying conduct by M due to her illness.

She wrote a very affectionate text to F on the day after the alleged event including a string of hearts and kisses emojis. I accept that M was suffering mental ill-health at this time. That might account for her failure to disclose the allegation earlier.

As I have found M reached this view after learning in early May 2017 that she was pregnant and after altercations with F about his response to the news of that pregnancy. She communicated this view to staff at the Mother and Baby Unit on or before 19 May 2017 when the Unit made a referral to the Local Authority, as noted by LB in the social work evidence template. F says, and I accept, that he learned of that decision in June when he was told by a social worker. Clearly, as the evidence shows, he had begun in mid-May strongly to suspect that M no longer intended to return Z to the USA as had been planned. </p>

For the purposes of the Convention, removal occurs when a child, which has previously been in the State of its habitual residence, is taken away across the frontier of that State; whereas retention occurs where a child, which has previously been for a limited period of time outside the State of its habitual residence, is not returned to that State on the expiry of such limited period. That being so, it seems to me that removal and retention are basically different concepts, so that it is impossible either for them to overlap each other or for either to follow upon the other. This interpretation of the Convention is strongly supported by the fact that, throughout the Convention, removal and retention are linked by the word &#8216;or', rather than by the word &#8216;and', which indicates that each is intended to be a real alternative to the other.&#8221;</span></p>

Very often that will be the case, but in our view, it is not essential.   We agree with Lady Justice Black's view expressed at paragraph 133 of her judgment that there may be cases at either end of the spectrum. Ultimately however, whether anticipatory retention has occurred is a question of fact to be resolved by reference to the evidence of the circumstances.

If, as the majority in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span> considered, anticipatory breach can occur without communication to the wronged party, then the anticipatory breach occurred, in my judgment, by on or about 18 May 2017. If anticipatory breach requires communication then arguably the date when he knew, as a result of a combination of M&#8217;s words, unresponsiveness and actions, that Z was not going to be returned as agreed was late May or early June.

Alternatively, there was simply a material change of circumstances which meant that the earlier agreement to leave Z in England for a few weeks until mid to late June no longer applied, and both parties knew that everything had changed. There is danger in interpreting agreements between the parents in the present case as though they were commercial contracts. They were not. When, in May 2017, M informed F that she was pregnant and thereafter stopped responding to his requests for reassurances and clarification; and when on 4 June F found out that Z had suffered a head injury, he was entitled to withdraw his previous agreement to Z staying in England. He did so unequivocally by 15 June. By 15 June the local authority had become involved but there were no ongoing restrictions on M&#8217;s ability to return Z to the USA. I find that from 15 June 2017 at the latest, Z was wrongfully retained in England, provided of course that at that date he was still habitually resident in the USA.</p>

If he were returned to the USA there is no evidence to establish that he would be exposed to any risk of physical harm as a result.  The impact on his mother&#8217;s mental health must be taken into account in relation to the question of whether there is a grave risk that his return would expose him to psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation. In relation to that question I bear in mind all the circumstances including the following matters:</p>

Unless there were a change in circumstances there would be no legal bar to her doing so or to having a significant amount of suitable contact with Z. I accept that she has genuine cause to be anxious about returning to the USA and being away from her sister and mother, in particular. However, proper support could well facilitate her return. Whilst he does refer to risk of relapse, Dr Musters does not advise that M&#8217;s return to the USA should be excluded on health grounds.</p>

I am sure that his return will cause him some discomfort and distress. However, in relation to the test under Article 13(b), including intolerability, it is not for this court to weigh up all the welfare considerations for and against return, but to consider whether M has established the criteria set out in the article. She has not done so to my satisfaction.</p>

I have great sympathy for M&#8217;s plight and for Z&#8217;s position. M has been affected by mental ill health after giving birth to Z and she has to manage to deal with another birth in a few months from now. There are no easy solutions for this family. However, for the reasons given the father&#8217;s application is allowed and I shall order the summary return of Z to the jurisdiction of the USA.</p>
