In the top right-hand corner of the front sheet of the prescribed form of application, there are boxes in which a court official inserts the name of the court, the case number, the date the application was received by the court, the date upon which it was issued by the court, and the fee charged or remission ID.   </p>

Neither party has been able to produce to me a copy of this Form D70 which bears the seal of the court or has any of those boxes completed by any court official.  Further, the photocopy of the application in Form D70, which was within the bundle prepared for this hearing by the solicitors for the respondent, leaves blank and uncompleted part 9 of the form on the sixth page of the prescribed form, which is the &#8220;statement of truth&#8221;.  However, the copy of the form which is upon the court file itself does have a name inserted as the name of the applicant.  The inserted name is &#8220;Francis Shara Ogunware&#8221;.  Those are the names of the applicant.  He himself (who acts in person) has told me today that those names are written on the form in his own handwriting.

Within that box, on the copy of the form upon the court file, there is an apparent signature and I have to say, with due respect to the applicant, that it is completely indecipherable and is, frankly,  little more than a few squiggles.  But he has said that that is his genuine signature.  In the box for the date, there is inserted, apparently using the same biro in which the name was written and the signature signed, the date &#8220;06/12/2017&#8221;.  The applicant says that he did personally insert his name and sign the form and write that date, and that he did all of that on 6 December 2017. </p>

Since the form is within the court&#8217;s own file, it must have come from somewhere; and if, indeed, the applicant or somebody on his behalf did lodge it with the court, then, of course, it should have been formally issued by the court.  I will treat that document as the application which is before me today, and it is the only application which is before me today. </p>

In a sentence, he is contending that although the respondent has produced what purports to be a marriage certificate between these parties of a marriage contracted on 30 December 2006, no such marriage ever took place.  Although he does not say so in terms, it must follow that he is asserting that, in some way, the certificate of marriage which has been produced is not authentic but is, in plain language, bogus.   </p>

They state that there was a marriage on 30 December 2006 between Francis Shara Ogunware and Funlayo[sic] Shara Olapeti.

I say nothing whatsoever about that alleged customary marriage, since there is no application before me in relation to it and, in any event, before a court in England and Wales could find that a valid customary marriage had taken place, it would need not only proof of the facts, but also expert evidence that whatever is found to have taken place does amount to a lawful customary marriage under the law of Nigeria.

He certainly does not seek a declaration that the marriage was, at its inception, a valid marriage, since his contention is that there never was a marriage.  The only conceivable subparagraph upon which the application might be founded is (c), namely, for &#8220;a declaration that the marriage did not subsist on a date so specified&#8221;.

If it is not in issue that there was, at a certain time, a valid marriage, then one can use the language of &#8220;subsist&#8221; to describe whether or not that valid marriage was still continuing to exist on some later date.  But, in my view, it is impossible, in ordinary English language, to use the word &#8220;subsist&#8221; in relation to a fact or status which is alleged never to have taken place at all.  The gravamen of the applicant&#8217;s story and claim is that there never was, even for a particle of a second, any marriage at all between him and this respondent, and his claim simply does not fall within the language of &#8220;a declaration that the marriage did not subsist on a date&#8230; specified&#8221; even if the date specified is the very date upon which the marriage is alleged to have taken place.

That is where the alleged event happened, and the courts of Nigeria are far better equipped than the courts of England and Wales, at a distance, to try to get to the bottom of the true state of the marriage register, and whether or not a relevant event took place on 30 December 2006, and, if so, the status and consequences of that event.
