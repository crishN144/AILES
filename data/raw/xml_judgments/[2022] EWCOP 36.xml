	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings concern Srichand Parmanand (&#8220;SP&#8221;) Hinduja, who is represented by his litigation friend, the Official Solicitor. The litigation began, in June 2020, in consequence of an application made by Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s brother, Gopichand Parmanand (&#8220;GP&#8221;) Hinduja. The application was a challenge to the legitimacy and legal status of the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for property and affairs, made by Srichand Hinduja initially in favour of his wife, Madhu Hinduja, and upon her disclaimer, in favour of his daughters, Vinoo Srichand Hinduja and Shanu Srichand Hinduja. Additionally, it was contended by Gopichand Hinduja, along with other siblings, that Vinoo Hinduja and Shanu Hinduja were restricting their contact with their brother. Further, it was strongly suggested that they had deliberately isolated him from the rest of his family. The legitimacy of the LPA was attacked on the basis that having regard to his dementia, Srichand Hinduja would have lacked the capacity to have created a Lasting Power of Attorney at the relevant time. A consultant psychiatrist was instructed to evaluate Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s current and retrospective capacity to make an LPA. It was insinuated, at very least, that Srichand Hinduja had been manipulated and that undue pressure had been applied. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Increasingly, there were significant concerns about Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s health. He had been cared for, at home, by his daughter Vinoo Hinduja and care staff. Vinoo Hinduja was anxious to preserve this arrangement, but the Official Solicitor clearly had evolving anxiety as to whether the true range of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s needs were being met satisfactorily. At the Official Solicitor&#8217;s request, I directed that Ms Lynne Phair, Independent Consultant Nurse specialising in the care of older people and, a Ms Katharine Lees-Jones, physiotherapist, be instructed to survey the full panoply of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s care needs. Ms Phair and Ms Lees-Jones prepared several reports which made helpful recommendations for Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s care and in particular, led to the appointment of Mr Greg McDonnell as case manager. It was the objective of Mr McDonnell&#8217;s appointment to drive all aspects of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s care package, including recruitment of care staff. Srichand Hinduja was living at home at that point. The Court&#8217;s orders of December 2020 and March 2021 emphasise, in entirely unambiguous terms, the need to ensure that Mr McDonnell was regularly updated by Vinoo Hinduja. The Official Solicitor was granted leave to restore the matter to court in the event of any concerns arising relating to Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s welfare. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to the above, it was necessary for me to make orders to permit Gopichand Hinduja and other family members to have contact with Srichand Hinduja to the degree that was achievable against the backdrop of the pandemic, in that period. Unfortunately, Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s health deteriorated, and he was admitted to hospital in March 2021. The Court was told by Dr W, Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s treating consultant, that he had only a very short time to live. Srichand Hinduja has confounded his doctors. The professional consensus is now clear i.e., that the hospital is no longer the correct environment for him. Indeed, it would appear that the acute hospital environment has been the wrong place for Srichand Hinduja now for some time. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Srichand Hinduja is amongst the richest people in the United Kingdom. However, he now suffers from severe Lewy Body Dementia. This is a progressive, fatal disease and there are no treatment options. A private residence with a full care package is likely to be required. This is the best way to achieve peace and dignity for Srichand Hinduja for his remaining months. Manifestly, such a plan requires a financial settlement to be put in place to ensure the resilience of the care package. For many people, that might be a challenge, both administratively and financially. For this family, it could be the work of few days. However, I am told that there are some difficulties with the financial arrangements. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would seem that it is necessary to state that which is obvious. Time is not on Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s side. Every day of delay in finding a suitable care package for him is inimical to his welfare and represents a failure on the part of those who purport to love and care for him. The Official Solicitor has formed the clear view that notwithstanding Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s wealth and the outward respect that is afforded to him, his needs have become marginalised in a family dispute. I agree. Unusually, in Court of Protection proceedings where strong and determined efforts are made to keep P at the centre of the process, Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s visibility has been very low, particularly during the course of the last 12 months. The Official Solicitor considers that Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s wealth and the infrastructure that surrounds it appears to have enhanced rather than reduced his vulnerability. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A hearing was set down, to commence on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2021, addressing the issues I have set out. An enormous volume of paperwork was generated. Highly experienced legal teams were assembled for each of the parties and two weeks of court time allocated to the case. It is perhaps pertinent to note that very few cases in the Court of Protection take more than 3 or 4 days at maximum. However, on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2021, events took an entirely unexpected turn. Vinoo Hinduja and Shanu Hinduja informed the parties that they drew on Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s assets to fund their own costs of this litigation. It was further recognised and acknowledged that they drew on those funds for their own private purposes. This is a family who have repeatedly emphasised and publicly so, that their family code is munificent, bounteous, and open-hearted: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;everything belongs to everyone and nothing belongs to anyone&#8221;. </span>Quite how this principle is realised in day-to-day life is difficult to appreciate, having regard to the complexion of the litigation in this court and its very similar parallel in the Chancery Division, <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hinduja v Hinduja</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2020/1533" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 1533 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 1533 (Ch)</ref>.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In any event, the identified conflict of interest was so flagrant and so manifestly contrary to the fiduciary obligations of the Attorneys, that both Vinoo Hinduja and Shanu Hinduja disclaimed the role. It is important to state, however, that Vinoo Hinduja and Shanu Hinduja had previously been questioned as to the source of their funding and had both expressly stated, through their lawyers, that they were not reliant on Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s assets. I make no further comment on this, other than to say that every member of this family has had the benefit of some of the country&#8217;s most experienced lawyers throughout. In consequence of the disclaimer, it was plainly unnecessary to resolve the substantive issue in the proceedings i.e., whether Srichand Hinduja had the capacity to enter into the LPA or whether it had been induced by undue pressure. I subsequently appointed Mr Andrew Hine, an experienced private client solicitor to act as Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s deputy for property and affairs. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to understand that at this point, it was thought by everybody that Srichand Hinduja was at the very end of his life. That was a phrase used by Dr W following Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s admission to the hospital with pneumonia. I particularly recall that as Srichand Hinduja was thought to be dying, and in accordance with the Covid-19 regulations in existence at the time, the family were able to visit the hospital and say prayers. This was the backdrop against which I reviewed the ambit of the Reporting Restriction Order (RRO).<span style="font-family:'Calibri Light';font-size:10pt"/>At that time the proceedings were subject to a Reporting Restrictions Order in the standard terms provided for by Practice Direction 4C to the Court of Protection Rules 2017 which had originally been imposed at the first hearing in July 2020.  The Official Solicitor had made applications in September and December 2020 to vary and relax the terms of that order, and these fell to be considered by me shortly after Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s admission to hospital.  Recognising the family&#8217;s grief, the suddenness of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s deterioration and the public safety constraints imposed by the pandemic. I decided to continue the existing RRO to protect Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s privacy in those particularly difficult circumstances and made directions for the issue to be restored me for further consideration following Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s death. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Official Solicitor has, for some time, been concerned that the restriction on reporting, partly in relation to the Property and Affairs issues, does not serve Srichand Hinduja well. It is argued that it impedes scrutiny in circumstances where that is more likely to protect Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s interests than compromise his privacy. However, the Official Solicitor has not, until recently, taken the view that the health and welfare issues fall into the same category. These, she has argued, should be withheld from the public domain. Superficially, this was an attractive position, realistically, however, it is unachievable. All the issues in these proceedings are interwoven. When put to the assay in exchanges, Mr Patel QC, acting on behalf of the Official Solicitor, recognised that crafting orders to implement this dual approach in a case in which the issues revolve around questions of capacity, treatment, care planning etc. present a very considerable challenge if the orders devised are to have any real prospect of enforceability. Latterly however, the Official Solicitor has reviewed her position. In their document, dated 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022, Messrs Millar QC, Patel QC and Drapkin state: </p>

And so, on careful reflection, she does not seek, at this stage, to argue for any order restricting reporting of such detail. She reserves the right to revisit this issue a later hearing should it be required.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Rees QC, on behalf of Gopichand Hinduja, advances the opposite case. He contends that the reporting restrictions should remain in place. As a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;fallback position&#8221;</span> he suggests that it continues until Srichand Hinduja has died and should thereafter be reviewed. This, however, has not always been Gopichand Hinduja&#8217;s position. As recently as 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2022, Mr Rees was strenuously arguing for the discharge of the orders. It was expedient to do so at that time because Gopichand Hinduja considered that Vinoo Hinduja was taking active steps to ensure the counter-allegations that she was making about Gopichand Hinduja and his brothers were brought to wide public attention through the Chancery Division proceedings. The tenor of those countervailing allegations is that it is she who is being marginalised within the family. Mr Rees argued that Vinoo Hinduja&#8217;s strategies were serving to provide the Chancery court with <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a partial and incomplete account of events&#8221;</span>. He particularly identified evidence seeking to portray Srichand Hinduja and what Mr Rees describes as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;his branch of the family&#8221;</span>, as victims of a financial <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;squeeze&#8221;</span> by the rest of the family.

Sadly, within the Chancery Proceedings [Vinoo Hinduja] has been taking active steps to ensure that the allegations that she has made about [Gopichand Hinduja] and his brothers are brought to wide public attention. Due to an administrative oversight the most recent hearing in the Chancery Proceedings (a case management conference in May 2021) was listed on an anonymised basis. [Vinoo Hinduja]&#8217;s solicitors recently took the unusual step of writing to the Chancery Court to ensure that the forthcoming hearing on 5 July 2022 is listed by reference to the parties&#8217; names. It is difficult to envisage what purpose this letter could possibly have had other than to ensure that [Vinoo Hinduja]&#8217;s allegations against [Gopichand Hinduja] and his brothers are widely disseminated.&#8221;</span></p>

Demonstrably, both Gopichand Hinduja and Vinoo Hinduja have changed their positions regarding the utility or ambit of the RRO. It is plain that the driver behind their shifting positions has been a calculation of their respective litigation interests. Insofar as it might be contended that these are connected with their evolving perceptions of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s best interests, I am bound to say, I find that connection to be tenuous. </p>

Now that the Chancery Court and other court proceedings have fallen away, it is argued that the need for disclosure of collateral documentation and information to the Chancery Division no longer arises. I remind myself that the basis for that application for disclosure was said to have been to correct a partisan and partial account filed in those proceedings by Vinoo Hinduja. I assume that the pragmatic view has been taken that those partial accounts may now be permitted to wither away unadjudicated and no longer require correction. </p>

In addition, I have written representations by Mr Brian Farmer, Press Association and Professor Celia Kitzinger, Open Justice Court of Protection Project. I also have the benefit of written and oral argument by Ms Clara Hamer, on behalf of Bloomberg News. Bloomberg is a New York based global news organisation, particularly noted for its financial journalism. Mr Jonathan Browning, a senior reporter for Bloomberg, has been at nearly every public hearing and has filed a supporting witness statement arguing for the lifting of the reporting restrictions. Mr Farmer and Professor Kitzinger also contend that the restrictions should be lifted. </p>

Mr Millar contends that reference, by the advocates, to the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction as the source of its power to control the conduct of proceedings before it, should not be conflated with the exercise of the substantive common law jurisdiction in the Family Division of the High Court (eg the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span>).

Frequently, there will be a tension between the two but here, and from Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s perspective, it is submitted that there is no such tension because, on the factual stratum in this case, Article 10 itself serves effectively to promote Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s Article 8 rights. Thus, what is usually a balancing exercise between rights which have an entirely different complexion, generates, it is argued, a confluence of interests pointing clearly to significant benefits for Srichand Hinduja in removing any reporting restrictions. </p>

The evolution of the parties&#8217; respective positions in relation to this application might be said conveniently to illustrate that point. Additionally, the extent to which investigation of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s health and welfare has been marginalised, during the course of the proceedings, troubles the Official Solicitor greatly, as it does me, as I have expressed on a number of occasions. </p>

Something of the above is, in any event, apparent from the judgment in the Chancery Division, which is in the public domain. Mr Millar submits that reporting of these proceedings is required to be <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;fair and accurate&#8221;,</span> under the general principles of media law i.e., if it is to be privileged in defamation. Moreover, it is argued, the fact that Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s interests are protected and guarded by the Official Solicitor, who provides an independent voice for Srichand Hinduja in the court room, creates a bulwark against Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s best interests or wishes being deliberately misrepresented by the parties, in pursuit of their own objectives. There is, to my mind, very significant force in this point. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is further argued on behalf of the Official Solicitor that the impact on Srichand Hinduja of any intrusion into his private life, from media reporting on his medical condition, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;would be very limited&#8221;</span> given his compromised level of awareness. Whilst that is certainly true, insofar as it goes, I do not consider it captures the full ambit of the Article 8 rights engaged by this exercise. Understanding the full range of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s Article 8 rights requires a recognition that the importance of privacy to him can only be evaluated by considering his whole life, not only who he is now, but also to the man he has been. Srichand Hinduja as a successful and pioneering businessman has, where necessary, sought to harness the power of the press in his own business interests by way of interviews etc. Insofar as I can analyse it, from the accounts I have been given, that has been driven by business expediency rather than any temperamental instinct to court the limelight. On the contrary, I consider Srichand Hinduja was instinctively a man who very much valued his privacy. In evaluating the weight to be given to this therefore, it may be that I have attached greater weight to it than contended for by Mr Millar. </p>

Additionally, the feedback to the Official Solicitor as to Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s health and clinical situation has not been effective. Further, and notwithstanding that this is a case where money should not have been a problem, I have been told that there are financial issues and disputes surrounding the financing of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s care. To put that in context, one of the parties in this case has spent &#163;13.5 million in one year on legal expenses. </p>

This may in many cases lead to a protected party receiving a very high level of care and attention. Here, it has made Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s situation unclear, inaccessible, and at times impenetrable. That, in turn, has served to increase, rather than reduce, his vulnerability.

If there was a case in which P was of more modest means, but with comparable issues, for example about family disputes and litigation in relation to P&#8217;s health/welfare and financial interests, the Official Solicitor&#8217;s thinking would have been the same.

There would be no need to. The issues could go into the public domain whilst preserving P&#8217;s anonymity. The point made by Ms Hamer, on behalf of Bloomberg, which I find to be persuasive, is that it is precisely because of the profile of this family that it has been impossible to report the proceedings in the case without risking breach of the reporting restriction orders. Any substantive or investigative reporting of the facts threatens jigsaw identification of the parties. All this is further exacerbated by the fact that some of the key issues in this case have already been ventilated in a public judgment in the Chancery Division. It is entirely illogical for proceedings to be stultified by the withholding of information which is already in the public domain. It conjures an image of endeavouring to force a reluctant genie back into a bottle! From this perspective, it is the principle of freedom of expression which is compromised.</p>

I found those submissions to be clear, well thought through and, if I may say so, reflective of what I assessed to be a sincere and professional commitment to the principles of transparency and public interest. </p>

[Srichand Hinduja]'s relations are some of the wealthiest people in Britain (as reported by The Sunday Times Rich List) and have for at least two years been fighting in the courts over control of [Srichand Hinduja]'s wealth as a result of his incapacity. The Proceedings are closely connected with a dispute about the validity of a letter dated 2 July 2014 signed by [Srichand Hinduja] and his brothers (the &#8216;J14 letter&#8217;) and ultimately the future of [Srichand Hinduja]&#8217;s holdings in the family business empire, which is the main focus of the Chancery Division proceedings.

In an empire of this size, there is, Mr Browning contends, a particular public interest in reporting a dispute for control, when it concerns governance and ownership of a business of this magnitude. Mr Browning also identifies himself with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s assessment that the oxygen of publicity could offer a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;protective layer&#8221;</span> for Srichand Hinduja, for the reasons I have discussed above. In his wide ranging and reflective statement, Mr Browning goes on to consider the public interest in reporting judicial criticism of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s family and their representatives, emphasising the degree to which the case in the Court of Protection <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;appears at times to have been used as a leverage in the commercial litigation&#8221;. </span>The following passage in Mr Browning&#8217;s statement requires to be set out in full: </p>

Reading [Gopichand Hinduja]&#8217;s position statement dated 27 June 2022 alongside [Gopichand Hinduja]&#8217;s position statement dated 12 July 2022 is extraordinary. In the former, little store is put on [Srichand Hinduja]'s Article 8 rights, and it is stated that any [Vinoo Hinduja]&#8217;s objection to lifting the current reporting restrictions 'smacks of opportunism' (paragraph 67.1). At paragraph 67.3, [Gopichand Hinduja] stated that where (as in this case) attorneys or deputies are removed for having acted contrary to P&#8217;s best interests &#8216;there is public interest in these matters being known,&#8217; and at paragraph 64 he said that &#8216;[Srichand Hinduja]&#8217;s best interests and the interests of justice weigh in favour of relaxing the current reporting restrictions so as to permit publication of the matters that have arisen in the Court of Protection proceedings&#8217;. I understand that [Gopichand Hinduja] filed three witness statements in support of his application to lift the reporting restrictions, which presumably set out the evidence as to why he said they should be lifted, but [Gopichand Hinduja]&#8217;s lawyers have refused to provide these to me or my lawyers, so I am not currently able to point to anything in those statements which might support Bloomberg&#8217;s position on this issue. </span></p>

It appears similar games have been played by [Vinoo Hinduja] and [Shanu Hinduja], saying in their 27 June 2022 position statement that they &#8216;agree the reporting restriction order can be relaxed to name the parties&#8217; (paragraph 2(d)) and that they &#8216;do not oppose the relaxation of reporting restrictions, and in particular do not oppose the identification of the parties&#8217; (paragraph 24), but now saying that the public interest in reporting these proceedings can be satisfied &#8216;without need to identify [Srichand Hinduja]&#8217; (paragraph 33 of their position statement dated 12 July 2022). It seems to me from their 27 June position statement that they are particularly concerned to avoid reporting of the embarrassing allegations about them that have come to light in these proceedings, and they are concerned about these allegations infecting the Chancery Proceedings. In my view, the oxygen of publicity is desperately needed to put a stop to this behaviour.&#8221;</span></p>

I have already averted to this (above) and need not repeat it. There are, however, two further important points that Mr Browning identifies. They are interconnected. First is the fact that proceedings have been before this Court, in a way that simply could not have been contemplated in March 2021, for over 2 years. The Official Solicitor first applied to lift the reporting restrictions, or more accurately to vary them, in September 2020. In the intervening period, virtually nothing has been reported. This is Mr Browning&#8217;s second point, namely, the impact of the reporting restrictions. He expresses this as follows: </p>

For example, information about the LPAs and appointment of the deputy is in the public domain on the register of the Office of the Public Guardian, which I exhibit at pages 23 to 26 of JB1. However, we felt that even citing such a public document may infringe the reporting restrictions as they currently are. It is very important to me as a journalist that it is made clear exactly what legally can, and cannot, be published about these Proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>

This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the public nature of the proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also maintains the public&#8217;s confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially. It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties&#8217; or witnesses&#8217; identity concealed. It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely &#8230; Any interference with the public nature of court proceedings is therefore to be avoided unless justice requires it.&#8221;</span></p>

That approach satisfies the extremely important public interest in there being a proper understanding the operation of the Court of Protection and public scrutiny of its practices, whilst protecting [Srichand Hinduja]&#8217;s dignity towards the end of his life, now he is no longer able to protect his own privacy, and at a time when it is vitally important that his dignity be preserved.&#8221;</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The substance of their case, as I understand it, is that the Court ought to take an approach which prevents any identification of the parties in relation to health and welfare issues and in any report which makes any reference to Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s general health and the care provided to him. It is reasoned that such an approach would permit the parties to be identified in relation to the Property and Affairs issues before the Court, excising any description of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s health and care. To this is added a further layer, namely, that in order to prevent any risk of identification prior to the determination of the health and welfare issues, the present reporting restrictions should remain until judgment has been handed down following that hearing. </p>

He submits that Vinoo Hinduja and Shanu Hinduja&#8217;s approach is different from that previously adopted by the Official Solicitor i.e., the reporting of specific details of matters of Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s health and care. It is said that Vinoo Hinduja and Shanu Hinduja recognise that the public has <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;an interest in understanding how the Court deals with matters concerning medical treatment&#8221;</span>. However, he argues these aspects of medical treatment can be satisfied by an anonymised report. I am not entirely clear what is being envisaged but I assume a separate report containing anything which might reveal the identities of the parties is excluded. Mr McKendrick extrapolates that if Vinoo Hinduja, Shanu Hinduja, Gopichand Hinduja and Srichand Hinduja were to be named, this <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;would accord little or no weight to [Srichand Hinduja]&#8217;s important Article 8 rights in relation to these intensely private matters&#8221;</span>. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These identified issues are of varying cogency and weight. It is a fact that very little has been said about family occasions and certainly nothing at all that was negative. Similarly, nothing has been suggested about Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s conduct, either in his family life or his business affairs, which is in any way negative either. On the contrary, it has been entirely pleasant and respectfully unobtrusive. Certainly it concerns the private sphere but, as I have commented already, Srichand Hinduja himself made utilitarian calculations with the press in the past. Mr Rees has identified that ventilation of the Court of Protection issues could prejudice the accord that it is said has been reached and risk derailing the steps needed to be taken to implement it. This is coupled to Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s best interests by the assertion that this is what he would have wanted i.e., to draw the curtains from public gaze and to bring peace to a family who have been at loggerheads. </p>

The chronology of their changing arguments in relation to this application to vary the reporting restrictions is powerful evidence of this.</p>

At present Srichand Hinduja remains in hospital where he ought not to be.  There is a conflict within the family concerning the financing of his care package. Suitable accommodation and appropriate care have not been identified.  I do not consider that this would have occurred if these issues had been ventilated in public and reported.</p>

Here, for the reasons above, publicity is expedient.  Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s Article 8 rights are not in opposition to the Article 10 rights of the press in this case but, in these unusual circumstances, the two are reconciled in the overall objective of promoting Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

Moreover, the sensitivity of the issues before this court, whilst important, should not be overstated.  What now falls to be considered is a practical care plan i.e., identifying suitable property, arranging care and nursing support.  Srichand Hinduja&#8217;s diagnosis and condition are already in the public domain. They require no further exploration in this court.</p>

In different circumstances, historically, I yielded to that suggestion for the reasons I have set out.  Rather than protecting Srichand Hinduja, as it was intended to, the reporting restrictions served to render him more vulnerable.  It is clear that such a risk continues.  Moreover, the concept of freedom of speech incorporates not only the right to comment but the choice as to when comment is made.  For effective journalism, topicality is crucial.
