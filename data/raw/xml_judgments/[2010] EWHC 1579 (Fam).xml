	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I take those judgments as read and do not propose to set out the background. It suffices to record that the first of those judgments set out my reasons for declaring that it was in HM&#8217;s best interests to reside and be cared for at Y and described how, despite that order, her father, PM, removed her to Israel. The second judgment set out, amongst other things, the steps that had had to be taken both in this country and in Israel before HM was returned to this county on 8 April 2010 in the care of her mother, KH, pursuant to orders made by the Family Court, District Court and Supreme Court of Israel. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For that hearing the Official Solicitor, as HM&#8217;s litigation friend, filed a position statement explaining that he agreed with the States of Guernsey, as indeed KH did, that HM should move to Y in accordance with the transition plan proposed by the States of Guernsey. PM set out his position in two emails. In the first, dated 29 April 2010, he made a catalogue of complaints about just about everybody; his essential stance was that HM should not be placed at Y until what he called &#8220;the risk of grave danger&#8221; had been &#8220;properly and independently assessed.&#8221; In the second, dated 30 April 2010, he complained that the Official Solicitor&#8217;s solicitors had not supplied him with certain documents relating to the proceedings. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">One order provided for HM&#8217;s welfare needs. I approved the transition plan for HM to take up residence at Y which, as I am satisfied, not least in the light of all the professional evidence I have read and heard, remains in HM&#8217;s best interests. The &#8220;danger&#8221; to which PM refers exists only in his mind and reflects nothing more than his inability to accept anything which does not accord with his own entrenched views. I also imposed a raft of injunctions against PM which I am satisfied are imperatively needed, at least for the immediate future, to safeguard HM&#8217;s welfare, and her placement at Y, and to control PM&#8217;s seemingly unrestrained and potentially destructive behaviour. Finally, the order directed a further hearing before me in July 2010 for a review and determination of the question of costs. </p>

The unblocking of those monies was foreshadowed in paragraph [52] of my previous judgment. Given that the other parties all consented to my making the order, and consistently with what I had said in my previous judgment, it was plainly appropriate to unblock these funds.</p>

My reason for doing so remained as before, namely that the evidence satisfied me that there is a real risk that PM would seek to place his assets beyond the jurisdiction of the court, thereby prejudicing the claims for costs which both the Official Solicitor and, now, the States of Guernsey propose to make against him (see further below).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The injunctions contained in the order referred to in sub-paragraph (i) above are set out in the Annexe to this judgment. They are in large part self-explanatory and require little further justification given all the matters set out in my two previous judgments. I recognise that they are swingeing in their effect. I regret the necessity which compels me to make them. But PM has now on two occasions (see paragraphs [4] and [18] of my previous judgment) sabotaged or attempted to sabotage the placements which the court had found best met HM&#8217;s needs. I am left with no option but to put in place the protective measures which, I am satisfied, are essential if PM is to be prevented from similar sabotage in future. I recognise also that the injunctions interfere to a very significant extent with PM&#8217;s relationship with HM, his daughter, and in a manner which requires cogent justification if there is not to be a breach of his (and, indeed, her) rights under Article 8 of the Convention. But the immediate imperatives are:</p>

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Official Solicitor, supported by the States of Guernsey, submits that injunctions in these terms are necessary and proportionate in seeking to achieve these essential objectives. I agree. In my judgment they are necessary both to further HM&#8217;s best interests and, indeed, to protect her own Article 8 rights.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I hope that the time will come when PM is able to demonstrate that the regime constraining him can appropriately and, from HM&#8217;s perspective, safely be relaxed. But for the time being I cannot ignore his response to the order I made in September 2009 &#8211; an order which, for all his subsequent bluster and abuse, was much less restrictive of him and his involvement with Y than had been proposed by the Official Solicitor. He has defied the court; he has abused the trust which the parties and the court placed in him by not subjecting him previously to injunctive restraints; he has abused his parental duties and responsibilities to HM and acted in a manner quite plainly contrary to her best interests; and he has twice sabotaged the arrangements that the court has put in place in order to further HM&#8217;s best interests. In the circumstances, and HM&#8217;s safety being at stake, I must err, if at all, on the side of caution. If in the result this all presses hard on PM then he has to realise that he has only himself to blame. My purpose, I stress, is not to be punitive but merely to ensure that HM is safe and happy and able to enjoy the family life with her mother and sister that PM so ruthlessly and selfishly denied her.</p>

I am satisfied that an order in the terms of paragraphs 12 and 13 is necessary in order to protect HM and KH whilst not interfering disproportionately with PM&#8217;s rights, whether under Article 6, Article 8 or Article 10. It will be noticed that the injunctions are not <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum </span>&#8211; they bind only PM &#8211; and that they are limited in their effect. The injunction in paragraph 12 is qualified by the important words in the proviso at the end. The injunction in paragraph 13 is confined to matters which are private to HM and her family and in relation to which they themselves have enforceable rights under Article 8. And it is, of course, open to PM to apply to have these injunctions, like all the other injunctions, discharged or varied if he thinks they ought not to have been granted.</p>

It was a case where a hospital trust was seeking a declaration that it could lawfully discontinue life-sustaining treatment to a patient in a persistent vegetative state. At a preliminary hearing before Sir Stephen Brown P, two questions arose. The first question was whether the President had power to sit in private for the substantive hearing and, if he did, whether he should exercise his discretion to do so. Following <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1913] AC 417" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1913">[1913] AC 417</ref>, the President held that he did have power to sit in private. He went on, however, to decide as a matter of discretion, and having regard to the public interest, that he should sit in public, in open court. It was in that context that the second question then arose, as to whether the identities of the patient, his family and certain of the witnesses should be protected.</p>

The minute of order is based upon the finding that the court has power to order that the hearing should take place in chambers and therefore that it has jurisdiction to decide that issue. Accordingly, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref> will apply and can be invoked in order to protect the position of certain witnesses and parties.

Paragraph 3 was, in form and effect, an injunction. It prohibited the publication of certain information: certain names, addresses and photographs. In contrast to the orders in paragraphs 1 and 2, it was directly addressed to those intended to be bound by it, just as, in my judgment, every injunction must be if it is not to fail on grounds of unacceptable ambiguity: see <span style="font-style:italic">Harris v Harris, A-G v Harris </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 895" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 895</ref> at para [288] and <span style="font-style:italic">Re S-C (Contempt) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/21" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 21" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 21</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1478" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1478</ref>, at para [17].

The first (see the words &#8220;for the purposes of these proceedings&#8221; in paragraph 1), being the manner in which the case was to be shown in the Daily Cause List and in the notice outside the court. The second (see the words &#8220;during the trial&#8221; in paragraph 1 and the corresponding words &#8220;at the trial&#8221; in paragraph 2), being the manner in which certain people were to be referred to during the hearing, paragraph 1 dealing with how they were to be referred to by the advocates, the judge and other witnesses and paragraph 2 dealing, as it were, with how they were to be allowed to refer to themselves. </p>

The purpose and effect of paragraph 1 was not made explicit on the face of the order. But it was a matter canvassed with the President in the colloquy following judgment. As the transcript shows, it was suggested to the President that the effect of paragraph 1 of the order was that the court&#8217;s process and orders should themselves be headed &#8216;In re G&#8217; rather than with the actual name of the patient. The President rejected that suggestion, accepting my submission that &#8220;It is one thing to say the list outside the court should have some suitable anonymous initial&#8221; but that it is &#8220;a nonsense for the court&#8217;s process to be headed with anything other than the proper title to the action&#8221;. The President expressed the distinction as being between &#8220;the listing&#8221; and the &#8220;process&#8221; or the &#8220;actual summons&#8221;, making it clear that paragraph 1 was confined to the former and did not include the latter.

As will now, I hope, be apparent, this is all quite unsound; in particular the assumption or belief that such an order operates as an injunction.</p>

Hence my scepticism when the issue first arose last year. Be that as it may, there can be no doubt about paragraphs 12 and 13 of the order I have now made. Those paragraphs, which are expressly directed to PM, contain injunctions, enforceable as such, which, if he breaches them, will expose PM to all the penalties for contempt of court, including but not limited to committal to prison. </p>
