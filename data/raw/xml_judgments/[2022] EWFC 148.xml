	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the final hearing in the long-running proceedings concerning a little boy called HN, who is now aged six.  I gave detailed judgment following a fact-finding hearing last year which gives the background to the proceedings and to the family, and I am not going to repeat it.  I have reread it for this week&#8217;s hearing.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">HN currently lives with his mother, Ms AN, in London, together with his brother B, who is now, I believe, fourteen.  B has a different father.  HN&#8217;s father, Mr&#160;AH, has applied for an order that HN lives with him and that he has permission to remove HN permanently from England to live in south-west France, which is where he has his home.  Mr AH&#8217;s other two sons, HN&#8217;s brothers live with their mother near Mr AH&#8217;s home and they spend regular weekends and holidays with their father.  Ms AN resists the father&#8217;s application. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The children&#8217;s guardian in these proceedings has changed, which has led to further delay in the welfare part of the case being heard.  Unfortunately, the previous children&#8217;s guardian, Ms R, has suffered from ill health and a new guardian was appointed, I believe in May this year.  The final hearing had been due to take place that month but had to be put off.  Claire Fox is now HN&#8217;s children&#8217;s guardian and she has concluded her investigations and her report.  These proceedings have now gone on for a very long part of HN&#8217;s life and I do recognise that for both parents, as well as for HN and his three brothers, this has been very difficult.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Since the fact-finding hearing before me, contact between Mr AH and HN has been reintroduced and has developed so HN has now spent overnights up to a week at the time with his father since August.  This is all taking place in England and has involved Mr AH in considerable expenditure, both in terms of money and time, and, he tells me, stress.  There is also weekly video contact between Mr AH and HN.  All contact orders have taken place, to Ms AN&#8217;s credit.  I understand that the e-mails to arrange it have all between the lawyers and sometimes have been labyrinthine.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The representation through this hearing is that Ms AH continues to represent himself; Mr&#160;Hames KC and Miss Kumar represent Ms AN; and Mr Ashworth represents HN and takes his instructions from Ms Fox.  There is a useful bundle which has been prepared for the hearing.  The evidence which has been of most relevance has been that of the parents, particularly about how HN&#8217;s time with his father has been managed and how HN has experienced it, the psychiatric report about both parents by Dr Van Velsen, the psychological report about HN by Dr Willemsen, and the children&#8217;s guardian&#8217;s report.  I have heard evidence from Dr Willemsen, the psychologist, from each parent and from the children&#8217; guardian.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The position of the parties in a bit more detail:  Mr AH seeks HN&#8217;s removal to France pursuant to an order that he lives with him there.  He would propose that Ms AN has as much contact as can be managed in France and for longer periods in this country.  He is amenable to HN receiving support in France to help him with the transition from the equivalent of CAMHS in France and he plans to continue to see Dr L, who has been helping him therapeutically for some years.  If HN remains in this country, Mr AH does not think he can come over as often as has been the case to date, but is very keen for contact in France to start as soon as possible.  He would agree to a family assistance order to London, as proposed by the guardian, and to HN receiving help from CAMHS. Mr AH very much wants HN to attend school (at the moment he is home schooled) whichever country he lives in. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms AN asks for HN to stay living with her, pursuant to a child arrangements order, and for Mr AH&#8217;s application to be dismissed.  She wants contact to stay in England for as long as possible.  She agrees to the making of a family assistance order and to HN being helped by CAMHS.  She wants to continue to home school HN, but is prepared to consider sending him to mainstream school at some point in the future.  She is in agreement to starting individual psychotherapy.  If HN moves to live with his father, she wants to have as much contact as possible.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The guardian has found this a very difficult case, in part because she was unable to make a real connection with HN and because she could see grave risks for HN&#8217;s well-being, whichever option the court decides on.  The particular issue that is concerned with here is whether, whichever parent HN resides with, can that parent promote a positive image of the other parent to HN and ensure regular and meaningful staying contact takes place?</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">On balance, she recommends that HN remains living in London with his mother and has as much contact as possible with his father, with that taking place in France after some more time in England.  She wants Ms AN to start individual psychotherapy and for Mr AH to continue to work with his therapist.  She recommends a family assistance order to London, who need to work with both parents as well HN and for there to be a referral to CAMHS.  She remains neutral on whether the court should order that HN should start school if he remains in this country, but can see the benefits.  If HN goes to France, she wants as much contact as possible for Ms AN and for that to include B, where possible.  She wants the equivalent of CAMHS to support HN in the transition.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I am going to go through the professional evidence in some detail, the parents&#8217; evidence in less detail.  This is because the professional input has been the most important and helpful both to my decision making but I think to the family going forward if they follow the advice and analysis contained in it. The parents&#8217; evidence has generally not told me much I did not already know.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">First to summarise the legal position.  I need to apply section 1 of the Children Act and it is HN&#8217;s welfare which is my paramount concern.  I must take account that delay is likely to be harmful to a child.  In this case there has been so much delay already and, clearly, it has made things more difficult for HN.  I will consider my decision against the backdrop of the welfare checklist which is contained in section 1 of the Children Act.  This is a leave to remove application (amongst other things) but the law is the same.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the child&#8217;s welfare which must determine the application.  Mr Hames and Miss Kumar have helpfully pointed me to the recent case of <span style="font-style:italic">WS v KL</span>, which has been of assistance.  I have also considered section 16 of the Children Act in relation to making a family assistance order and my powers under section 11(7) of the Children Act in relation to adding a condition to any child arrangements order I make.  I have taken into account the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span> to which Ms&#160;AN&#8217;s counsel have referred me.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">First, the evidence of Dr Val Velsen about each parent.  Dr Van Velsen is a well-regarded and very experienced psychiatrist.  Her report was made in January this year. The psychiatrist goes through Ms AN&#8217;s background and the various interactions she has had with health and social work agencies, in particular since becoming a mother.  She then details her interview with Ms AN and also sets out parts of what Mr AH had told her about Ms AN during his interview.  Dr Van Velsen gives the opinion that-- and I am going to give a lengthy quote now: </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.98in">328  Ms AN described two relationships with the fathers of her sons, neither of which were marked by stability.  She had a relationship with a much older man at a young age and who had significant difficulties of his own.  Her anxiety about her pregnancy with B was such that she was engaged with a mental health midwife.  She described being terrified of becoming a mother, although fortunately once she had given birth, this changed.  Her relationship with Mr AH never seemed to establish a secure base and there were difficulties from the beginning.  </p>

The basic dysphoric mood of those with borderline personality is often disrupted by periods of anger, panic or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being or satisfaction.  These episodes may reflect the individual&#8217;s reactivity to interpersonal stresses.</span></p>

He thought HN would have been confused by being kept in France by Mr AH and not seeing his mother and brother for many months.  He sees challenges to HN moving to live with his father in France whilst not saying it should not happen.  He would expect HN to find it traumatic in the short to medium term.

He described HN as a confused child who finds it hard to make sense of his life until now, and said it was vital that whichever parents HN lives with promotes a healthy image of the other parent.  He was broadly positive about Mr&#160;AH&#8217;s ability to do this and to promote contact with the mother and more worried about Mr AN&#8217;s ability to do so.  He said that: &#8220;I do think that Ms AN does create in her mind a reality which does not always resonate with what is happening and who the father actually is.

But he considered that Mr AH&#8217;s retention of HN in France caused considerable harm to HN.  Of that, he thought it was unlikely that Mr AH would do it again.  He was asked about Mr AH saying during the assessments that he thought Ms&#160;AN&#8217;s contact should be supervised, a position Mr AH is no longer putting forward.  Dr Willemsen thought this resulted more from Mr AH&#8217;s fear of allegations being made against him rather than anything else.  He thought that, for HN, the absence of conflict between his parents was essential and it was fundamental that HN was able to see the other parent and to see the parents able to communicate with each other. The risks to HN going forward were also from a lack of proper and consistent contact with his mother if he lived with his father, and it could affect his attachment organisation being the third break in his attachment in his young life.  His attachment to his father would provide some mitigation if he saw clear evidence of that attachment, and thought contact was good.

He thought this was a significant risk to HN.  But the issue that worried him even more was whether HN would manage the proposed transition to his father&#8217;s care.

She sets out that his behaviour after contact has been difficult and, indeed, says that since July she says there has been a noticeable deterioration in HN&#8217;s behaviour.  In her view, interim contact has progressed too swiftly.

She told me about how she home schools and then answered the questions I put on behalf of Mr AH in the same manner.  This continued when Mr Ashworth asked her questions, the next day, about how things would be if HN remained in her care.  She was able to say much that was positive about HN&#8217;s time with his father and how she saw the benefits of it.  However, when the questions from Mr Ashworth turned to consideration of HN moving to live in France, her whole demeanour and responses completely changed and she then portrayed Mr AH in the most negative and unrealistic way.  In essence, she said that Mr AH saw her relationship with HN as a threat and she said he was trying to turn HN against her.  Before this complete change in her responses, Ms AN spoke about her commitment to contact and told me all she does to promote Mr AH&#8217;s image to HN.  She was unable to accept any responsibility for the difficulties in her parenting HN and thought it was all Mr AH&#8217;s fault, but told me she wanted things to improve and gave some ideas of what Mr AH could do to achieve that.  She said that HN should have a great deal of contact with whichever parent he was not living with and said that practical arrangements, if HN lived with her, would be manageable.  She had not taken any steps to get referred to psychotherapy since the receipt of Dr Van Velsen&#8217;s report, but was willing to do it. </p>

It is unfortunate that she spent a large part of her statement talking about the need for Mr AH to have various interventions but very little talking about the interventions that she needs, even though Dr Van Velsen considers that she needs various long-term interventions and Mr AH does not.

She says that Mr AH blames her for the lack of progress and delay in him spending time with HN.  He she says that he thinks she is alienating HN from him and making contact difficult, but that is not how Mr AH has put his case.  She says that Mr AH hates her and hates her flat, whereas this is not established; and, in fact, Mr AH comments on how nice her flat in is in his final statement and he told me these are not his views.

She tells me she spends time with Ms AN and the two boys, seeing them each week.  She describes Ms AN as &#8220;strong, resilient and resourceful&#8221;.  I do not give much weight to the grandmother&#8217;s statement as I do not think she is in a position to give me an objective view. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence of the guardian.  Ms Fox has only been the guardian since May and did not have the opportunity, therefore, of observing the fact-finding hearing or of interviewing HN and his parents in the earlier stages of these proceedings.  It has been a disadvantage, but, of course, not of her making.  Her report is dated 2 September 2022 and follows her review of the evidence for this hearing, her interviews with the parties and HN.  She sets out her understanding of the background and the findings this court made.  She says that hand-overs for contact both parents acknowledge have been difficult. She reports that Mr&#160;AH considers that his time with HN has developed positively, whilst Ms AN reports that HN is emotional regressing.  She considers that HN&#8217;s emotional welfare is a cause for worry and believes that these parents are not yet able to co-parent him effectively without the support of an external agency.  Ms Fox has observed HN with each of his parents and describes HN being relaxed with each.  She has no concerns about either of their homes or about the basic care provided by the parent. She has found HN himself difficult to engage with.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">When she spoke with Ms AN, she heard that Ms AN does not believe Mr AH has appropriate parenting skills and she sets out Ms AN&#8217;s distress at the prospect of HN visiting his father in France.  When she spoke with Mr AH, she heard that Mr AH remains concerned about Ms AN&#8217;s parenting and her mental health and would envisage Ms AN having supervised contact.  The level of mistrust between these parents concerns her because of its inevitable impact on HN.  She worries that violence in relationships may not have been explored with Dr L, who has been working with Mr AH, and can see a benefit from understanding the dynamic of domestic abuse further to move forward in a more proactive co-parenting manner.  I agree with Dr Willemsen that these comments summed up by the guardian in her report are unfortunate and misplaced.  Fortunately, they do lead on to any specific recommendation and in her oral evidence the guardian was clear that she was not supporting anything like a DAPP for Mr AH, but thought there should be work within his therapy about interpersonal relationships.  She goes on to say: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Her concerns about the proposed move to France are that HN would struggle in finding himself in school there, which is not something he has experienced, and where a language is spoken which, currently, he does not speak.  She is worried about the supervised contact being proposed by Mr AH, which the guardian considers to be an extreme position.  I have already said that is no longer Mr AH&#8217;s position.  Such a reduction in HN&#8217;s relationship with his mother could have an irreparable emotional impact on him, she says, in court to me.  Wherever HN is, the guardian fears that contact arrangements will not be managed well by them and thinks that the local authority, either here or in France, would have to be involved.  She considers that Mr AH underestimates the impact on HN of his plans and recommends that if HN is to move to France it should take place in a planned way, with psychological support in place here and in France.   If HN stays here, the issues are whether Ms AN can promote HN&#8217;s relationship with his father and the impact on HN of her, at times, fragile, emotional health.  Importantly, having pointed out how both parents continue to make allegations against the other, Ms AN particularly about that Mr AH is abusing her by his application and his conduct of his case, Mr AH by looking for evidence from HN of Ms AN&#8217;s lack of parenting skills, she says this:</p>

She goes on to say that HN should live with his mother and should have regular contact with his father, initially continuing in the UK and then moving to France.  She thinks that psychological support should be accessed for the move to contact in France, there should be a family assistance order to London to work with HN and should include ongoing assessment of the parenting capacity of his parents.  She recommends a family group conference to help with contact and to monitor and to assist.  </p>

She was asked about the home schooling as opposed to primary school and she remained neutral, but could see and she agreed with the positives that Dr Willemsen had set out.  I am slightly surprised she remained neutral on that point, seeing it was so strongly put by Dr&#160;Willemsen.  She told me about the evidence of home schooling she had seen, including about activities outside the home, but agreed there was no independent evidence of HN&#8217;s education otherwise.  </p>

She found Dr&#160;Willemsen&#8217;s evidence &#8220;compelling&#8221;, as did I, and was as worried as he was about the possible &#8220;trauma&#8221; to HN.  She said the parents &#8220;owed it&#8221; to HN to do all they could to make it better for him.  She thought it was very important for HN to have a great deal of face-to-face contact with both of his parents, both of whom he loved and was relaxed and comfortable with from her observations.  She saw the risks to him which Dr Willemsen had identified, but thought he had stability where he currently lives and that all those around him need to try to make that work rather than move him now, which I thought it was well put.  She felt somewhat reassured that Ms AN would allow HN to have the relationship he needed with his father because that is what has been happening.  She was more reassured, having heard the evidence, that Mr AH would make contact work for Ms AN than she had been before.  She explained that the local authority should have the family assistance order rather than Cafcass because of the local authority&#8217;s ability to provide and access services for HN which Cafcass could not.  She was sure that HN needed ongoing professional support and CAMHS (or its equivalent wherever he lived) needed to be involved.  She agreed with there being as much contact to the non-residential parent as possible.  She accepted that there is no difference between Mr AH spending a week with HN in France, so there was no real need for contact to go on in England for much the longer.  </p>

Dr Van Velsen, in particular, thinks that might not be best for HN in the light of her difficulties.  I am quite sure that HN should attend school.  There are many reasons for this.  One of his parents wants him to do so and Mr AH has never agreed to his son not attending school.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In making this conclusion, I take into account the reports of the experts, but also the over-dramatic style in which she gave this evidence.  But the guardian told me that it was clear to her that lot of home-schooling took place.  However, Ms AN has no degree or even &#8216;A&#8217; levels and it must be difficult to educate two children of vastly different ages in the full curriculum, and I have no evidence that this is working well for HN.  The only document from London since HN became eligible for full-time education is a record of a telephone conversation with Ms AN.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">My experience of the local authority checking of home education is that it is very superficial and tends to be more about looking at evidence produced by the parent rather than assessing what the child has learned against what the average child in school would have learned.  In HN&#8217;s case, I have nothing independent at all.  It did seem to me that HN was not getting anything like the thirty hours a week education which he would get if he was at school.  There seems to be a consensus that HN is behind where others of his age are, so it may be that he would do better at education if he was at school.  </p>

Socially, I am sure that HN would benefit from mixing with other children of his own age, children whom he had decided he wants to make friends with rather than arrangements made by his mother.  Ms&#160;AN told me that HN regularly goes to other homes to meet families, but it was all rather vague and I note that HN mentioned nobody in his life other than his brother to Dr&#160;Willemsen.  </p>

The most compelling reason though was what Dr Willemsen said in his evidence about the importance of HN having time away from his mother which ties in with what Dr Van Velsen said which I have quoted from.</p>

Mr Hames suggested that the court should be cautious about compelling a parent in this way, but the evidence for HN to go to school, to my mind, is overwhelming.  </p>

It would involve the loss of his mother whom he is used to having in his life on a daily basis and of B similarly.  For HN, the child I have read about in Dr Willemsen&#8217;s report, I think this may cause significant harm.

Ms AN&#8217;s anxieties are likely to make it difficult for her to take up contact in France.

I do not think she is always supportive of HN spending time with his father, as she claims.  If she was, she would not have referred to him as &#8220;the man&#8221;, which Mx Baker says happened, and I do not accept HN was referring to Mx Baker.  She would not have hovered around during contact and contact hand-overs and would not have spent so many paragraphs being overwhelmingly negative about the father and his time with HN.  I think she has made some progress and can, as I have said earlier, see the importance of HN spending time with his father.  She told me that HN loves him and enjoys his time with his father.  She assured me that she can allow HN to enjoy his time with his father, including going to France regularly, without letting her anxieties take over and ruin this for HN.  </p>

It is equally unhelpful for either parent to take a film of HN at hand-over and I shall prohibit both parents from behaving in such a way.  I do note that Mr AH is able to say positive things about Ms AN, for example, about her home, though he remains critical of most other aspects of her parenting.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Any harm which HN has suffered or is at risk of suffering.  The risk to HN&#8217;s emotional well-being has been a theme throughout this judgment and through the reports of the experts.  Whether he has already suffered such harm is a topic I do not think it would be helpful for me to explore in any depth.  Clearly, I have touched on this in the fact-finding hearing judgment.  From the report, it certainly seems that he is struggling to be in the middle of this conflict.  To encapsulate my findings under this heading, I agree with the views of Dr Willemsen and the guardian that HN is likely to suffer emotional harm if the conflict continues, if they are unable to find a way to endorse the trust and if they are unable to co-parent HN going forward.  I think, on balance, the gravest risk to HN is if the proposed move to France was experienced as a trauma to him, as Dr Willemsen predicts, and that long-term effects on his psychological well-being ensue.  I think he is at risk of harm resulting from being exposed to his mother&#8217;s, at times, fragile mental health, or, if HN remains in her care, she makes it difficult or impossible for him to have a normal relationship or a relationship purely on her terms with his father.  He is at risk of harm if he lives in France if he is able to see very little of his mother and brother.  Being put into a school in France, having been home schooled in England, when he speaks no French, is likely to cause him short-term harm.  I find that the harm he is likely to suffer in the care of his mother is likely to be increased by her hostility towards the father and the harm he is likely to suffer in the care of his father is likely to be increased by<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>his negative view of the mother.  </p>

I accept the views of the professionals, not just about what is said about the other parent but about themselves, can achieve real change for HN&#8217;s sake.  At this stage, Mr AH has developed more insight than has Ms AN, who, as the mother, has a more difficult journey to travel in any event.  However, the situation which Ms AN can offer, which is stability and the continuation of much that HN is used to, is, on balance, a better situation for HN than that offered by Mr AH, in my judgment.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"> How capable each of his parents is of meeting his needs.  Both parents love him very much.  Neither would cause him any harm intentionally.  As I said at the commencement of this judgment, if the parents lived in the same city, or even in the same country, I would have been most likely to make an order for shared care.  It is not possible.  Both can meet his basic needs.  Both have attributes which can meet some of his other needs.  I do not think, however, that either parent can meet all of his needs.  For example, my impression now, over several days of hearing, is that HN&#8217;s time with his father will be a relaxed and enjoyable time in which there will be time spent on outdoor as well as indoor activities.  I doubt, however, that HN will be able to share with his father if he is missing his mother.  That is in part because Mr AH says that HN never asked for his mother when he had him in his dare in 2019, and it seems to me that Mr AH did not pick up cues which HN probably was giving to show that he was missing his mother.  His mother, I can see, is loving and good at stimulating HN and time is spent well on art and cultural activities.  However, I am equally sure that HN would not be able to discuss with his father that he wanted to see more of his father, for example.  Although Ms AN no doubt disagrees, an objective analysis of her evidence shows that such strongly held perceptions of Mr AH is a danger to HN and there is evidence that she has not always been able to keep her anxieties to herself.  I conclude, therefore, that HN would keep such views to himself.  The evidence of the guardian and Dr Willemsen suggests that HN has learned to keep his wishes and feelings bottled up.  This is not just about parents&#8217; capabilities and the risks each present.  It is about the situation HN is in and would be in.  I have found, on balance, that the risk to HN disrupting the stability he currently has by a move to France carries too great a risk of harm to him.  </p>

At the pre-hearing review, I raised the issue of a condition being attached to a child arrangements order in favour of Ms AN so that HN would live with his mother but attend a mainstream state primary school.  This power is contained in section&#160;11(7)(b) of the Children Act 1989 and such condition must be complied with by the person named in the order as the person with whom the child is to live.  Mr Hames has argued against the addition of a condition to any child arrangements order made in the mother&#8217;s favour as an infringement on her parental responsibility, but the father has always argued that HN should be attending school and would support such a condition.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In her final analysis, the guardian recommends a family assistance order pursuant to section&#160;16 of the Children Act.  This section allows the court to make an order requiring the local authority to make an officer available to advise, assist and, where appropriate, befriend.  Those named in the order must consent, and they do in this case.  The court can, in particular, ask the local authority to give advice and assistance as regards establishing, improving and maintaining contact to another person named in the order.  My concerns about the mother&#8217;s emotional and mental health difficulties and the effects on HN are serious.  The reported documents in the guardian&#8217;s report shows a little boy who has anxieties and who displays some unusual behaviours.  It is not all down to Mr AH retaining HN.  The mother&#8217;s anxieties and behaviours are also significant factors.  </p>

I do not think that moving HN to France at this stage in his life would be the best thing for his emotional and psychological health either.  I base this conclusion on the reports of the doctors and the guardian.

It is most likely to afford HN the most healthy, emotional daily life, where he will be able to develop his own sense of identity, his own views, his own friendships, as well receive the best of education.  I wholly reject the suggestion that such a condition takes effect in a year&#8217;s time.  There is no benefit to HN of all that and would only allow Ms AN, if she wished or was unable to help herself, to transfer any anxieties she has in this regard to HN and to have such anxieties entrenched.  She has already identified the local primary schools.  Ms AN and Mr AH should choose which one HN can attend, but it may be that the choice will depend on which school has a place available.  </p>

As HN will be starting school in January, on this occasion I am not ordering half of the Christmas holidays because it will be important that HN is settled back with his mother for that event.  Thereafter, Ms&#160;AN must make HN available to spend half of each of the three major holidays with his father.  So, from Easter 2023, that applies and I am well aware that that may mean that HN spends some three weeks with his father next summer.  In addition, if Mr AH can manage it, Ms AN must make HN available to spend alternate half-terms with his father, so that if HN spends summer half-term with his mother, he spends October half-term with his father.  I think this is preferable to splitting the half-terms as it will enable Mr AH to take HN to his home in SW France if he wishes.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I have been very disappointed at the inadequate e-mail received from London on 29&#160;September in response to the e-mails and the documents sent to London by the child&#8217;s solicitor.  I accept that London have not had a great deal of time to deal with this.  However, the response suggests that none of the documents sent to them have even been read.  I do not feel I can make final orders today as I consider it necessary to direct the Director of the Children&#8217;s Services at London to attend before me, or someone whom the director delegates to attend who is in a position to make decisions, so that I can be assured that what is written in the e-mail is not the position of London.  If the court makes a family assistance order, it expects it to be carried out, which is the opposite of what the e-mail says.  Moreover, this is an exceptional case and this vulnerable child needs the assistance of a local authority, as the children&#8217;s guardian has so carefully set out.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">I considered and dismiss the idea of making a family assistance order to Cafcass as the guardian tells me that Cafcass cannot do the various functions she has recommended.  I will make the order that the social worker appointed under the family assistance order shall, in particular, give advice and assistance in maintaining contact time and ordering and report to the court in six months&#8217; time&#8230;</p>

Then I said the social worker appointed shall, in particular, give advice and assistance in maintaining the contact I am ordering and to report to the court in six months&#8217; time as to the progress of such contact.  I shall ask London to assist Ms AN in getting HN into regular and full-time attendance in school, as set out.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There should be a mirror order in France which the parents should seek, but probably Ms&#160;AN&#8217;s lawyer should take the lead on as this is a legal issue.  However, for avoidance of doubt, this does not need to be in place before HN visits France with his father as I have said retention not a real risk in this case any more.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">There must be a transcript for of this judgment prepared and the public funding certificates of Ms AN and HN must pay for this.  It is vital going forward that the parties and any professionals working with his family know what the court has said and why.  I hope that Mr McGovern  or Mr Ashworth can prepare executive summaries of the two judgments but I do not direct this if it will lead it undue work.  If Mr Ashworth or Mr McGovern can do it, I do not consider it necessary for them to be agreed by the other parties and they can be headed that they are prepared by the child&#8217;s solicitor or barrister as something to assist the professionals, but I am not wedded to that idea.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Willemsen and Dr Van Velsen must be sent copies of the judgment, obviously London must be and CAMHS and any other professionals working with HN must receive them.  So, London, CAMHS and any professionals working with HN must receive the two judgments and the reports of Dr Van Velsen, Dr Willemsen and the guardian and this order, and anything else you tell me you want to go.  Both parents can clearly disclose the reports about them to their own practitioners.  I have some experience of CAMHS refusing to read any documents, but I very much hope in this case that is not the case.</p>
