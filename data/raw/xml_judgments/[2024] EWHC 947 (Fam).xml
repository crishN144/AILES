This hearing follows an application made by the Father on 8 August 2023. The Father seeks shared care of AX, on a 50/50 basis. </p>

There was contact between AX and the Father between 2017-January 2021. In early 2021 the relationship between the parents deteriorated further and the Father made allegations that the Mother had hit AX.  The Father retained AX in his care and there was a prolonged dispute during that year about which parent AX should live with. </p>

The Local Authority reviewed the circumstances in which [AX] had found himself in over the week prior to 21 September and recognised that the private law proceedings had become protracted and, to an extent, ignored. It assessed the emotional impact had been significant upon [AX] and the Father had not acted in [AX&#8217;s] best interests. It was in that context that public law proceedings were issued. The background is not intended to provide a day-to-day account of the history in this case but to give a flavour of the circumstances [AX] found himself in.</span></p>

The matter was adjourned to be considered before Recorder Redmond on 11 and 12 October 2021. This was to allow for oral evidence to be heard from the Father, the Mother, the Social Worker and the Guardian. No public law order was made regarding [AX&#8217;s] interim care. The private law order in place and unsuccessfully appealed required [AX] to be returned to his Mother&#8217;s care on 4 October 2021. The Father confirmed he would comply with that order. The Local Authority confirmed that it would support supervised contact between each parent and [AX] until the next hearing.</span></p>

She goes on to conclude that the Father is currently unable to meet [AX&#8217;s] emotional needs around supporting his relationship with his Mother. She opines that the Father has focused his efforts on &#8220;being proved right&#8221; rather than focusing on supporting [AX] emotionally. The Father is unable to consider how his actions have influenced and impacted upon [AX]. She relies on the assessments done of the Father which conclude that the Father does not respect the Mother as a parent and that he believes her to be a risk. She says that there is no evidence which supports the Mother is the risk the Father believes her to be. Her recommendations remained the same having heard evidence in court from Dr Williams and Dr Gwyer.</span></p>

The Father showed no insight as to the concerns of the Local Authority and did not consider [AX] to be at risk. The Guardian considered that the Father&#8217;s capacity to change was low.</span></p>

I have formed the view that the psychological assessment undertaken of the Father and the parenting assessments undertaken of him are accurate and reliable. Those assessments paint a picture of the Father being unable to reflect on lived experiences of [AX] and to prioritise [AX&#8217;s] needs above those of his own need to be right. I do not accept the Father&#8217;s assessment that [AX] has not been listened to and he does not have a voice. There is expert evidence and professional evidence before the court that have all concluded that [AX] is in the awful position of not wanting to lose either of his parents. He has not for some time indicated a wish to live with the Father although I do not doubt he would wish to move to a shared care arrangement but without the pressure of &#8220;trying to please&#8221;. The court must take into account the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings as far as they can be ascertained commensurate with their age. [AX] is choosing to remain silent. I accept the opinion of Dr Williams that this is [AX&#8217;s] crude attempt to &#8220;manage the unmanageable&#8221;.</span></p>

I consider that it is necessary for the Local Authority to be obliged to advise, assist and befriend [AX] under a 12 month supervision order to ensure that the contact between the Father and [AX] and his half-sibling is maintained and it is my hope that the sibling contact can be arranged over and above the contact the Father has with [AX] so as to promote that relationship. How that will be achieved I do not know, particularly as I have heard that [BX], the half-sibling, is no longer having contact with his Mother and is in the full-time care of the Father.</span></p>

He is highly obsessive about certain matters (for example minor health issues concerning AX); he lacks insight into the impact of his conduct; and he lacks empathy and understanding of other people&#8217;s positions. The Father has made a long sequence of complaints against I think every professional who has been involved in the cases, including social workers, the psychologist Dr Bryn Williams, solicitors, the Guardian and judges. He is convinced that all these different professionals are acting unfairly and contrary to AX&#8217;s interests. He has shown no respect for the Court, being convinced that HHJ Jones, and indeed other judges at Coventry are biased against him.  He is utterly certain that he is the person who understands AX (and his older son BX) and that only he knows the solutions to AX&#8217;s issues. </p>

HHJ Jones then made a recovery order and the police attended and recovered AX in the middle of the night and returned him to Mother&#8217;s care.

The reports of contact have been positive, in the sense that AX very much enjoys seeing his father and has a very strong bond with him. There are however concerns from reading a number of the contact notes that the Father is clearly hostile to the school and is also very quick to encourage AX to worry about minor health issues and other matters the Father is obsessing about. The Father cannot stop himself from asking AX questions about the school, or the Mother, or social workers, that lead AX to not trust any of them, and see them as acting contrary to his interests. Even if the Father does not intend this to happen, it is undoubtedly the effect of his conduct.</p>

Ultimately it does not matter whether this is deliberate on the part of the Father, or inadvertent. The Father cannot deal with views that differ from his own. So if anyone disagrees with him, or does something he does not agree with, he will lodge a complaint and view them as acting contrary to AX&#8217;s best interests. He cannot prevent himself from then seeking to encourage AX in sharing his view of the situation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Equally he cannot see that his actions harm AX. So encouraging AX to believe that the school is not helping him and properly educating him, ultimately harms AX and his education. Leading him to believe that the Mother is not properly caring for him makes AX anxious and sometimes defiant with his Mother. There is absolutely no evidence that the Mother is anything other than a loving and caring parent, who looks after AX very well and always acts in his best interest. The constant undermining by the Father, through ridiculous complaints, such as about AX's clothes not being washed, is bad for AX and wholly baseless. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From having watched the police video from August 2023 I am concerned that AX is being influenced by the Father to reject the Mother and say he wants to live with Father. The evidence seems to suggest that if AX is left alone with the Mother, he loves her very much and starts to become more settled. </p>

I effectively have three options. I could accede to the Father&#8217;s view and order 50/50 care; continue the present situation of limited direct contact; cease contact with the Father for a period.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If I adopt options one or two, I have no doubt that the Father will continue to undermine the Mother and the school and seek more contact and for AX to live with him full time. That would very much not be in AX&#8217;s long term best interests. AX loves his mother and she looks after him very well. He will continue to be placed in the midst of parental conflict, with having to choose sides, and being forced into a position of rejecting his mother. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not think the kind of short term break in contact with the Father doing further &#8220;work&#8221; has any realistic prospect of success. The Father&#8217;s neurodiversity is not going to change, and I have no confidence that his behaviour towards the Mother and AX will change. The F&#8217;s lack of insight is profound, and a few months of a separating parents course is unlikely to achieve significant change. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are no good options in this case, and I wholly accept that stopping contact between the Father and AX will be very upsetting for AX and will cause him harm. However, in the balance of harm, it will give AX and his mother a break, which I hope will allow them to stabilise and strengthen their relationship, without the Father&#8217;s undermining influence. It will also, I hope, allow AX to feel more confident in the school and for his behaviour to improve. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Supervision Order shall be extended for another 12 months. I will continue the Prohibited Steps Order in its current form. I will make an order for no contact, save for limited letterbox contact between the Father and AX, and the Child Arrangements Order shall be varied to allow twice monthly letters from the Father to AX, to be sent to the LA for checking. The LA should also check any letters from AX to the Father, and AX may write to his Father as often as he wishes. I will make a s.91(14) order for two years. That will take AX through transfer to secondary school, and a period to settle in there. It would be appropriate at that point, assuming the Father so wishes, for the Court to consider any new application he wishes to make at that stage.</p>
