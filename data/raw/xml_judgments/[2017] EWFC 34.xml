This would be likely to arise under two separate categories, namely, a policy decision of the court, in the exercise of its right to run its own proceedings within the requirements that there should be a fair trial, and, secondly, the practicalities of service on a potential litigant or his attendance at the hearing.

The starting points are two fold: first, that the father should be entitled to participate in this case; and secondly that the children and mother should not be put at risk of serious harm by the conduct of the proceedings. In considering the first the court should start with full participation then consider partial participation effected in this case by disclosure of redacted documents and then, only as a device of last resort, his exclusion from the proceedings. In considering the second the court must be alert both to risk and to the magnitude of consequences should the risk eventuate and must also consider whether and to what extent that risk can be managed by the courts&#8217; control of its own processes.</span></p>

I have concluded that only his exclusion from the proceedings will realistically achieve that end; although extensive redaction of documents is possible, there are so many documents which would have to pass through so many hands that the risk of accidental disclosure of a crucial piece of information would be very high.</span></p>

The right to receive a copy of Form C6A exists for the benefit of every father whom a local authority &#8216;believes to be a parent without parental responsibility for the child&#8217; irrespective of whether or not that parent has de facto family ties.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> The difference between a father who is able to establish de facto family ties and a father who is not able to do so is that the former is entitled to the protection of Article 8 and Article 6 whereas the latter is not. The practical consequence of that distinction, in my judgment, is that the threshold for determining that it is not appropriate for such a father to receive Form C6A is lower for a parent who does not have the protection of Article 8 and Article 6 than it is for a parent who has that protection.</span></p>

Risk and welfare will be important factors in considering whether to give permission to a local authority not to serve a birth father with Form C6A. </span></p>

Others are aware of the existence of the child and of the fact that they are the child&#8217;s biological father but have thus far shown no interest in the child&#8217;s life. For the children involved it is important that attempts are made to engage with their birth father and perhaps also his wider family. The starting point must be two fold. First, that it will normally be in the interests of the child that her birth father should receive a copy of Form C6A thereby enabling him to apply for party status so that he can participate in the proceedings. Second, that the child and her mother should not be put at risk of harm as a result of seeking to engage the father in the proceedings. It is a matter of balance and that is the case whether or not the father is entitled to the protection of Article 8 and Article 6.</span></p>

As a result, CD is not entitled to the benefit of the rights guaranteed by Article 6. In order to succeed on its present application the local authority does not, therefore, need to establish the high level of exceptionality that would otherwise be the case. </span></p>

I have accepted that she lives in fear of CD finding her and making threats to her. I have noted that CD has a long criminal record and is currently serving a six year prison sentence for an offence of violence. I have expressed doubt about whether those facts would have been sufficient to justify an order that CD should not receive a copy of Form C6A had he been entitled to the protection of Article 8. In light of my finding that CD does not have Article 8 rights with respect to X, are those facts sufficient to justify a decision that CD should not be served with Form C6A? In my judgment they are. I am satisfied that, if CD became aware of these proceedings, that would give rise to a degree of risk to the mother and her family, albeit that I assess that risk and its consequences as being no more than moderate.</span></p>

Circumstances may arise during the course of the care proceedings that may require that issue to be revisited. For example, such a father may by chance become aware of the existence of the care proceedings and may apply for party status or, in ignorance of the existence of the care proceedings, may apply to the court for a child arrangements order.</span></p>

In that situation the local authority may wish to contend that nothing but adoption will do for that child. Before accepting that to be the case the court would have to consider whether the birth father should be given notice of the proceedings in order to facilitate consideration of the possibility that a paternal family member may be a suitable long-term carer for the child. The court may consider that that avenue must be explored before it could properly conclude that nothing but adoption would do for that child.</span></p>
