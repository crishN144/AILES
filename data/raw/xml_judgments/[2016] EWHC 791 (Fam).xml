This is a matter which the GLD helpfully suggested might benefit from further exploration. Having been guided through that process by Miss Fottrell I am entirely satisfied that the necessary counselling was provided by the clinic. I do not propose to go into the details. It suffices to record that my conclusion is based in part on the very clear evidence of X and Y and in part on what was recorded contemporaneously by the clinic in written documents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case raises issues I have not previously had to consider. They arise from the fact that the relevant consents were provided by X and Y shortly <span style="font-style:italic">before </span><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> came into force on 6 April 2009, whereas the relevant treatment commenced, on 6 April 2009, <span style="font-style:italic">after </span><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> had come into force. Forms WP and PP were introduced with effect from 6 April 2009 as part of the new scheme introduced by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. Prior to that, the relevant form used for the purposes of the original scheme under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> was what I have called a Form IC. The clinic&#8217;s mistake was in failing to appreciate, despite all the guidance on the point previously circulated by the HFEA, that, because the treatment commenced on 6 April 2009, it was necessary to comply with the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. Apparently, staff at the clinic believed that the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref> applied only to procedures carried out <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>6 April 2009 and did not appreciate that they applied to procedures carried out <span style="font-style:italic">on and from </span>6 April 2009.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, given the facts and my findings, taken in the context of the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, three issues arise. The first is whether the language of the Form IC, a document signed by X and Y on 27 February 2009, is apt to satisfy the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/36" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 36</ref> and 37 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. The second is whether, assuming it is, the Form IC has that effect notwithstanding the coming into force of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>. The third arises because, as completed, the Form IC showed that what was going to be used was X&#8217;s sperm whereas in fact what was used was the sperm of an anonymous donor.</p>

For present purposes, there are two things to be noted. The first (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>) is that X signed a declaration in the following terms:</p>

I can take the matter very shortly. For the reasons I set out in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, paras 52-53, I am satisfied that the Form IC signed by X and Y is, as a matter of content and construction, apt to operate both as a Form PP and as a Form WP, complying with the requirements of both <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(1)</ref>(a) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/37/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37(1)</ref>(b).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Fottrell makes the very powerful argument that, if the treatment in this case had taken place on or after 27 February 2009 but <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>6 April 2009, the Form IC completed and signed on 27 February 2009 would have sufficed to establish X&#8217;s legal parenthood in accordance with the regime under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37" uk:canonical="1990 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>, just as, if the Form IC had been signed on 6 April 2009 immediately before the treatment was begun, that would have sufficed, in accordance with the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, to establish X&#8217;s legal parenthood in accordance with the new regime under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2008 Act</ref>.

After all, as Miss Morgan points out, neither X or Y ever withdrew their consents. When the treatment began on 6 April 2009, everyone &#8211; X, Y and the clinic &#8211; was proceeding on the basis of and relying upon the consents given on 27 February 2009. I agree with Miss Fottrell and Miss Morgan. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The third issue</span>: It was clear to everyone from the outset &#8211; X, Y and the clinic &#8211; that there was no question of X&#8217;s sperm being used and that the treatment would involve use of the sperm of an anonymous donor. It had, for example, been the subject of counselling involving both X and Y in September 2008. It is, accordingly, clear beyond sensible argument that there is an error in the Form IC as completed and signed, inasmuch as it recorded that what was going to be used was X&#8217;s sperm. Equally plainly, what was meant was that what was going to be used was the sperm of an anonymous donor. The mistake was, in reality, as simple as this, that a <span style="font-family:Wingdings">&#61692;</span> was inserted in the wrong place and, as it were, against the wrong piece of text. It was, as Miss Morgan submits, a simple undetected clerical error. In the circumstances, this obvious mistake can, in my judgment, be &#8216;corrected&#8217; as a matter of construction, and without the need for rectification (see paragraph 4 above).</p>

There was no suggestion that a parental order might be possible. My impression is that the view of the clinic in this case, shared at the time both by the HFEA and by the other clinics whose actions I have had to consider, was based on assumptions, derived from Cobb J&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">AB v CD and the Z Fertility Clinic</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/1418" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 1418 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 1418 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 2 FLR 1357" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 2 FLR 1357</ref>, which were widespread until, in February 2015, Theis J gave judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">X v Y (St Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital Centre for Reproductive Medicine Intervening) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/13" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 13" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 13</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] PTSR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] PTSR 1</ref>. </p>

In her very helpful note for the court, counsel observed that &#8220;it would appear that the couple have been ill advised by the clinic and put to the great distress of making this application which is likely to be proven unnecessary.&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
