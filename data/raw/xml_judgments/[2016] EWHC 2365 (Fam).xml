This is unfortunately not an unusual occurrence, and it calls for a remedy.  </span></p>

Court hearings are already difficult for LIPs, but many, being inexperienced, are hesitant to complain about matters such as late service.  In child abduction cases, the applicant is entitled to unconditional legal aid while the respondent is only entitled to means and merits-based legal aid.  In consequence, it is common for the court to be faced with an applicant, appropriately represented by specialist solicitors and counsel, while the respondent has no legal advice or representation at all and in many cases cannot speak English.</span></p>

In March, Hague Convention proceedings were launched by the father.  The mother defended them on the basis that the child objected to return.  On 23 May, at a hearing at which the applicant was represented by counsel and the mother appeared in person without an interpreter, directions were given for the final hearing.  These included standard directions for the filing of statements and for a Cafcass report.  The final hearing was fixed for two days starting on 28 July.  The parties were to attend and interpreters were to be provided by the court.  Although the directions hearing took place fully two months before the final hearing, no direction was given for timely service of documents on the mother, no doubt because such directions are not usual.  </span></p>
