However, King LJ granted a stay until 4pm on 21 May 2015 and directed that any application for an oral renewal must be made by 4pm on 11 May 2015. At that stage both the mother and the father were acting in person (the father had of course been represented before Pauffley J, as had the mother). The Court of Appeal Office (CAO) was, however, aware of the identity of the father&#8217;s solicitors, Dawson Cornwell, and on 7 May 2015 emailed King LJ&#8217;s order to them. Later the same afternoon, Miss Tazeen Said, the immensely experienced Family Lawyer in the CAO, also emailed a copy of King LJ&#8217;s order to Dawson Cornwell, accompanied by a message helpfully drawing attention to the fact that &#8220;a stay of execution has been granted in order to allow time for any oral renewal hearing, but permission to appeal refused.&#8221; </p>

The application was supported by a witness statement of the father&#8217;s solicitor, Ms Anne-Marie Hutchinson of Dawson Cornwell, and accompanied by a draft order setting out the relief sought. As it happened I was acting as vacation judge, so the papers were emailed to me. Having read the papers I took the view that there was no need for a hearing. I accordingly made an order in the terms sought, save that I amended the opening recital, to read &#8220;Upon written application by&#8221; rather than &#8220;Upon hearing&#8221; and by deleting the words &#8220;at a hearing&#8221; from recital (4). At the same time I made, as requested, a passport order directed to the Tipstaff.</p>

He confirmed that he spoke to the Mother on the telephone yesterday when the officers attended her property. She informed him that it was her understanding that the Court of Appeal had told her that she was to return to the USA by 12 June 2015. We have not been informed of this, nor has our client. Please would you urgently confirm if this is the case?&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dawson Cornwell received no response from the CAO. Later the same day, and apparently as a result of a request from her, the CAO emailed the mother, sending her a copy of the <span style="font-style:italic">draft </span>of the order made by King LJ, saying that it was awaiting approval by the judge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next day, 2 June 2015, King LJ&#8217;s order of 22 May 2015 was sealed. It was emailed to the mother and the father by the CAO at 16.26. That email was not copied to Dawson Cornwell or anyone else. Almost immediately, however, the mother sent the order to the office of the Clerk of the Rules, which helpfully passed it on immediately to Dawson Cornwell. Very promptly, and very properly, Dawson Cornwell emailed the mother&#8217;s solicitors the same afternoon a letter saying: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have set out the unhappy history of the matter in some detail, but the key fact is stark and simple. When I made the orders on 29 May 2015 I was unaware that King LJ had granted a stay until 12 June 2015. That fact alone, irrespective of how it had come about, necessitated the setting aside of the relevant parts of my order. As the order I made on 4 June 2015 recited, I was:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;setting aside the order &#8230; dated 29 May 2015 on the basis of inadvertent non-disclosure of critical information (that being that the Court of Appeal granted the mother a stay of execution of the order of 24 April 2015 until 12 June 2015).&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Paragraphs 7 and 9 of the order of 29 May 2015 were simply inconsistent with the stay. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Had I known of the stay, I would still have been prepared to make the passport order, and the orders consequential upon the passport order, for the basis of that order was the mother&#8217;s non-compliance with the earlier order made on 20 March 2015 by the Deputy Judge, and the need for such an order, in all the circumstances, was not affected by the stay. That is why I have not set them aside. Had I known of the stay I would not, however, have been prepared to grant any other relief. It would have been premature to do so while the stay was in force. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I wish to make it absolutely clear that, in my judgment, no criticism of any kind attaches to Dawson Cornwell, Ms Hutchinson or Ms Chaudhry. Given the terms of the email sent by the CAO on 26 May 2015, especially when contrasted with the language of the earlier email sent by Ms Said on 7 May 2015, they were entitled to assume that there was no longer any stay in place. Certainly, when I read that email on 29 May 2015 it never occurred to me that there might be a stay. After all, King LJ had refused permission to appeal, so there could be no question of a stay pending an application to the Supreme Court. And given the critical significance of a stay, any reader of the email from the CAO dated 26 May 2015 was surely entitled to assume that, if a stay had been granted, the news that &#8220;permission to appeal is refused&#8221; would have been caveated by a reference to the fact that there was nonetheless a stay. Most unhappily, it was not. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one further matter I must place on record. On the afternoon of 22 May 2015, King LJ&#8217;s clerk had emailed the Clerk of the Rules with the information that King LJ had extended the stay until 12 June 2015. Again most unhappily, the information in that email, which of course was unknown to Dawson Cornwell, was not passed on to me when I was dealing with the matter on 29 May 2015. It did not come to my attention until later in the afternoon following the hearing before me on 4 June 2015.  </p>

I am very sorry that it did. I hope that nothing similar happens again. Procedures in the court offices will, no doubt, be tightened up in the light of what this most unfortunate case has revealed.</p>
