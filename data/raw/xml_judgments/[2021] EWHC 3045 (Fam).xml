Further he invited the court to place a number of restrictions on the mother&#8217;s exercise of her parental responsibility given her past conduct and actions.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">The decision in R v Lucas has been the subject of a number of further decisions of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division over the years, however the core conditions set out by Lord Lane remain authoritative. The approach in R v Lucas is not confined, as it was on the facts of Lucas itself, to a statement made out of court and can apply to a "lie" made in the course of the court proceedings and the approach is not limited solely to evidence concerning accomplices.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In the Family Court in an appropriate case a judge will not infrequently directly refer to the authority of R v Lucas in giving a judicial self-direction as to the approach to be taken to an apparent lie. Where the "lie" has a prominent or central relevance to the case such a self-direction is plainly sensible and good practice. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">One highly important aspect of the Lucas decision, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges. It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the "lie" is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration". In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Middleton</span> [2001] Crim.L.R. 251. </p>
		  </content>
		</paragraph>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court. Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8221;.</p>

The later children find out about their origins, the more difficult it can be as the information about themselves then has to be integrated alongside feelings of betrayal and lack of trust. Late disclosure can fracture relationships within families and require significant therapeutic intervention to resolve, both for the individual reworking their identity and for the family relationships around them.&#8221;</p>

Given the context, in time he will have to understand and process issues relating to trust, openness and honesty in relation to each of his parents. Issues following from the deception surrounding the second surrogacy arrangement have the potential to permeate his future. This highly complex situation does not lend itself to easy or simple answers and the process of unfolding is likely to need to be revisited in the future. It is more appropriate to think of the likely psychological effects of actions taken and to consider what are the least damaging of the alternatives.</p>

Ideally, he needs to have a strong bond with both parents. However, the main responsibility for his long-term sense of security lies with his father as the resident parent. In the future he is likely to have to deal with challenging issues with both his parents and he will need avenues of emotional support during these times, including adults outside his immediate family.</p>

She also made serious comments about C&#8217;s wellbeing which led the Police to undertake a welfare check, but they found absolutely nothing to substantiate her concerns. B shows little insight into the consequences of these actions, particularly the impact these were likely to have on her former husband and the implications for communication about C. A&#8217;s position of wanting nothing to do with the twins has become more entrenched, and he does not want C to know of their existence until he is much older. The circumstances have cemented the breakdown of trust between A and B. The only way to achieve a more positive outcome for C is for his parents to change their behaviours, and this appears unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. This severely limits the options.</p>

The parental couple are each caught up in their own grievances about the other&#8217;s behaviour and unless they find a different way forward C will end up carrying these conflicts into the future, and this is likely to cause him emotional distress. C is likely to become increasingly aware of the chasm between his parents and this can be damaging, and potentially leads children to feel that they need to take sides.</p>

This requires that constructive safe and positive contact be supported by both parents. It does not appear that this can be provided by these parents now. A does not take C to handovers and his decision to avoid any direct communication with B appears to be predominantly based on self-protection. If the rift between them continues they would be unable to talk together about how to handle C&#8217;s questions about his conception or that of the twins as he grows older. Furthermore, B&#8217;s actions give little confidence that she will reliably follow agreed decisions.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I would advise caution about starting contact between C and the twins without his father&#8217;s involvement. However, if a decision were taken for the children to meet, given the level of conflict between the parents, I would recommend this be in a neutral space where they can play together rather than in B&#8217;s home. One possibility is that this process be supported under a Family Assistance Order, but this requires both parents to agree. Prior to this, a second chapter should be added to &#8216;Our Story&#8217; [see below], C should see photographs of the twins and then spend time with them in a quiet play space for a short time, outside of his usual time with his mother.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">To place C in a position where he is having regular [even if not frequent] contact despite his father&#8217;s strong objections is likely to create a situation where he would experience his father&#8217;s ambivalence and negativity. It is also likely to make it difficult for a comfortable sibling relationship to develop. If C sees the twins and returns home commenting about them, he would be likely to gain a sense of his father&#8217;s discomfort and disapproval. He would not be able to easily understand this and may feel that he is at fault. This could undermine his sense of security and affect the father/son relationship.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The option to keep the twins&#8217; existence from C would not create an immediately damaging situation. However, it has the potential for detrimental consequences later. Holding a secret for many years requires that lies be told, either by omission or commission. Such secrets in families affect closeness and distance, communication and interaction and there is often a deep sense of betrayal experienced when the information is revealed particularly when the secret makers are parents in whom a child has implicit trust. Furthermore, such secrets are very difficult to contain and there is a tendency for them to emerge by accident when people are not prepared and in a way that does not attend to the feelings of those for whom they are salient. Even if B endeavoured to keep the existence of the twins a secret, it would be very hard for her to lie to C if, when he is older, he asked directly who she lives with, or why he cannot visit her at home.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">If information about the twins was not shared until C is in his late teens [as A would prefer] there is a strong likelihood that C would be angry and/or upset at not being made aware of their existence and not being allowed to see them. This would be in addition to any feelings about his father taking no part in their lives. Furthermore, this may have implications for C&#8217;s connections with other maternal relatives. C may lose trust in his father as a result and this could lead to significant difficulties in their relationship. This might coincide with C having feelings about his mother proceeding with the second conception/surrogacy arrangement without his father&#8217;s consent, and the fact that she too will have had a part in the concealment. Adolescence and early adulthood can be a difficult time, as young people strive to develop a sense of identity and autonomy, and this can also be a time when Donor Conceived and surrogacy born offspring think more about what this means for them and who they are. C will have to accept that, unlike children created with donor gametes in the UK, he will have no access to more information about his donor and that he will not be able to meet her or the half siblings that exist elsewhere. To be told of the twins suddenly in addition &#8211; with all the ramifications of this - is likely to place an immense psychological burden on C.&#8221;</p>

The use of books such as &#8216;Our Story&#8217; with such young children does not mean that they understand the content, but that they grow up with a gradual awareness of the context of their conception rather than it being presented later when they are likely to have made assumptions. This usually avoids feelings of shock and surprise as children feel they have always known and cannot recall being told. It also enables parents to become more fluent and comfortable with the language and ideas that they will need to talk about over the years. A should have a copy of the details of the surrogate and egg donor held by B so that he can answer questions later &#8211; and B should have a copy of the &#8216;Our Story&#8217; that A has personalised, so that she can read this with C occasionally.</p>

It, however, clouds the father&#8217;s thinking and judgment on the issue of introducing C to his half siblings.</p>

However, I fear he is very wary about the prospect of C meeting the twins and is worried about the impact of the same on C but also the impact on him. The fact that the twins, to a greater or lesser extent, will become a part of C&#8217;s life will bring into sharp relief the father&#8217;s approach to and role in the lives of the twins.</p>

Despite telling the parents&#8217; counsellor that he had been having an affair, which he denied saying, the father was adamant he had not had an affair with a female colleague at work. The weight of the evidence, especially his mobile telephone records which disclose a very large number of calls and messaged being sent o and received from his colleague, very strongly suggest there was some sort of liaison. Nevertheless, the father&#8217;s lack of candour on this issue does not materially affect my overall assessment of him being a reliable and credible witness.

In light of C&#8217;s age, it will be a simple and straight forward account of his early life and that of his half siblings. The father will send this narrative to the mother for her comments and observations. Insofar as her comments and observations are in accordance with the court's findings of fact, they should be incorporated into the narrative.

I hope the father will reflect on this decision. Whilst I entirely accept he has ready access to a range of his professional colleagues who treat children and young people, it would, in my judgement, be beneficial for an officer from Cafcass who under the auspices of an FAO could support the parents and, if needs be, to mediate between them to resolve their issues in the welfare best interests of their children. </p>

Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that the breadth and scope of the disclosure sought is justified and/or necessary or proportionate even on the facts of this case. </p>
