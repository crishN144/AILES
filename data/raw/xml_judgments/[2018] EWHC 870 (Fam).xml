	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned here with the Local Authority&#8217;s application for a Female Genital Mutilation Protection Order (FGMPO) to prevent N who is an infant, travelling to the Sudan with her mother.  The mother (M) is a British citizen born in Sudan, habitually resident in the UK where she has lived for over a decade.  The mother has a British passport only.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background history of the case has not been easy to tease out but certain key facts emerge.  The mother gained citizenship following an application for asylum.  The father (F) who is a Sudanese national has, at some point, made a similar application but was unsuccessful in his claim.  M and F lived together in the UK for over 10 years.  They have a large family all of the children having been born in the United Kingdom.  The older children are all boys.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In July 2017 the family travelled to the Middle East during the course of the school summer holidays.  It was, I have been told, the intention that they should return to the UK.  However, the plans changed and the family travelled on from the Middle East to Sudan and to the village where both M and F&#8217;s extended family live.  I have heard different accounts as to why the family did this but have concluded that the motivation really does not matter.  What is however agreed is that at some point, not long after his arrival, F decided that he wanted to remain in Sudan.  Equally clear is that M was passionately resistant to this.  She strongly believes that the UK offers far better life opportunities for her and her children.  She fled Sudan as a refugee and as an asylum seeker.  In her evidence to me she demonstrated a strong enthusiasm for independence, educational opportunity and financial freedom.  She told me that she loved and respected her husband and that what she wanted &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">most of all in the world</span>&#8221; was for them all to live as a family here in the UK.  She explained that F had not always treated her well and that he had in the past been violent towards her.  She considered life in the UK had an educative impact on him and whilst here she claims, and I accept, he behaved respectfully towards her.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is plain that M was deeply uncomfortable about F&#8217;s decision to stay in Sudan.  She told me he was resistant to allowing her or the children to return to the UK.  She asserted that F had taken the boys passports and locked them in a safe so that she would not be able to arrange for them to leave the country.  By this stage the mother was heavily pregnant, expecting N.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M, who is an intelligent and resourceful woman, managed to prevail upon  male family members, as I understand it from both sides of the family, to persuade F to permit her to return to the UK.  The basis of her plea to her husband was that she had suffered difficulties in her labour with some of the boys and wanted to avail herself of the best medical care she could.  Both parents knew that M was expecting a female baby.  It is equally clear that both were delighted about this.  Eventually, though by no means enthusiastically, F agreed to M returning to the UK.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When M returned to the UK she made a number of complaints to the Social Services.  She contended that she felt scared of her husband&#8217;s family.  She confirmed that she had been herself a victim of FGM in the Sudan.  Whilst she (M) was very resistant to the practice she told the social worker that she knew F&#8217;s family wanted this and would force her husband to permit it.  Because F had family members in the UK who M appeared to be concerned about, the Local Authority provided refuge accommodation for her.  In her account to me, as Miss Cavanagh on behalf of the Local Authority was correct to emphasise, M made repeated reference to having <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">escaped</span><span style="font-style:italic">&#8221;</span> Sudan with her unborn baby.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the mother was assessed by the Social Services, on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of December 2017, she made a number of assertions which strike me as significant.  Firstly, she recounted that it was her mother and brother who had assisted her in the purchase of a return ticket to the UK; secondly, she related how on her return the family home had been stripped of all its belongings including furniture, carpets etc.; thirdly, the father&#8217;s family had gained possession of some of M&#8217;s personal documentation including her bank card and had been able to divert the family&#8217;s benefits to Sudan.  All this suggested, and I conclude was intended to, that unbeknown to M, F and his family had planned a permanent removal.</p>

M, who has frequently had to sacrifice the truth in order to negotiate her options in life, has informed F that N is being treated in hospital and cannot yet travel.  I sense that F has not entirely accepted this account.  M told me in evidence that she has sent F a photograph of a baby in an incubator, in order to placate him.  In view of the situation I required the case to be relisted before me expeditiously.  In the event that was only achievable by a change of counsel.  Judicial continuity was however, self-evidently, preserved.  When the case came before me at the end of February there was some dispute about M&#8217;s evidence and I permitted her to be recalled.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It requires to be acknowledged and highlighted that by the time of the February hearing M had significantly modified her earlier evidence.  She now persistently, under questioning, sought to minimise the extent of the risk that F and his family presented to N in the context of FGM.  She claimed that brothers in the wider family were more progressive in their attitudes and claimed that some of the women in this family had not been subject to FGM.  I found this to be entirely unconvincing.  It is significant, in my judgment, that while she has been back in the UK, M and her sons have been communicating via Whatsapp.  It is all too clear that M misses her boys dreadfully.  One of them has contracted malaria in her absence.  M plainly feels that this would not have happened had she been with him and able to attend to his care.  It is equally clear that the boys are missing their mother and are pressing her to return soon.  It is important to remember that each of these boys has only known life here in the UK.  Life in the Sudan without their mother must pose a very considerable challenge for them.  In addition, it has not been possible, I have been told, for all the boys to be cared for in the same household thus responsibility for them has been spread across the wider extended family.  I have no doubt that this separation causes extreme distress to M.  I have concluded that it is her eagerness to return to her boys that has led to her significant change in her account of the risk of FGM to N.  M&#8217;s pain and distress is moving and almost palpable.  She finds herself in a wholly invidious position.  </p>

Here, however, I am required to consider whether M&#8217;s resolve and appreciation of risk is likely to equip her sufficiently to protect from it.

Many of them involve severe pain and suffering and may be considered torture like in their manifestation. Others such as property and marital rights are inherently unequal and blatantly challenge the international imperatives towards equality. The right to be free from torture is considered by many scholars to be jus cogens, a norm of international law that cannot be derogated from by nation states. So fundamental is the right to be free from torture that, along with the right to be free from genocide, it is seen as a norm that binds all nation states, whether or not they have signed any international convention or document. Therefore those cultural practices that involve severe pain and suffering for the woman or the girl child, those that do not respect the physical integrity of the female body, must receive maximum international scrutiny and agitation. It is imperative that practices such as female genital mutilation, honour killings, Sati or any other form of cultural practice that brutalizes the female body receive international attention, and international leverage should be used to ensure that these practices are curtailed and eliminated as quickly as possible.&#8217;</span></p>

All the parties agree this is important and independent information.  I have been taken to the various graphs surveying the prevailing attitudes in the Sudan towards FGM as well as the extent of the practice.   It isn&#8217;t necessary for me to incorporate them all within this judgment but a number of key statistics emerge:  a girl is likely to be at greatest risk between the ages of 5 and 9 years of age; 90% of girls and women in Sudan have undergone FGM; 10% of girls are subjected to the practice below the age of 4, 11% between 10 and 14 and 15% over 15 years of age.  Accordingly, and as M said in her evidence, the greatest risk occurs between 5 and 9 years of age.  It was within this bracket that M herself was subjected to the procedure.  It is also statistically important to note that, notwithstanding the extent of the practice, slightly more than half of women and girls are opposed to it.  This indicates that their own wishes are frequently not able to prevail.</p>

Counsel had submitted that since the Police had available to them the means of stopping the protest and preventing the infliction of inhuman or degrading treatment, the obligation to use the measures at their disposal was in itself absolute, unless they could demonstrate conclusively that if they adopted such measures worse consequences of risk to life or the infliction of inhuman or degrading treatment would be caused to the children or others.

It is in my opinion quite clear from para 116 of Osman 29 EHRR 245 that the obligation placed upon the authorities in an article 2 case is to do all that could reasonably be expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life, once they have or ought to have knowledge of the existence of the risk.  I cannot suppose that the obligation under article 3 is different in kind, and the Strasbourg jurisprudence confirms this, as I set out below. To hold otherwise would be to place an intolerable burden on the state.  In the present case it would have required the police to drive back the protesters by main force and make numerous arrests, irrespective of the consequences which could have ensued and which could have given rise to widespread disorder, loss of life and destruction of property.&#8221;</span></p>

As the European Court of Human Rights stated in Osman v United Kingdom 29 EHRR 245, para 116, the applicant has to show that the authorities failed to do all that was reasonably to be expected of them to avoid the risk to life. The standard accordingly is based on reasonableness, which brings in consideration of the circumstances of the case, the ease or difficulty of taking precautions and the resources available. In this way the state is not expected to undertake an unduly burdensome obligation: it is not obliged to satisfy an absolute standard requiring the risk to be averted, regardless of all other considerations: cf McBride, Protecting Life: A Positive Obligation to Help (1999) 24 EL Rev Human Rights Survey HR/43, HR/52.&#8221;</span></p>

The court held that the state had failed in its positive obligation under article 2 to set up a framework for the protection of persons at risk. Citing, amongst other cases, the Osman decision 29 EHRR 245, it held that the authorities had ample knowledge of the risk and were in breach of their duty to take such operational measures as were necessary and sufficient to protect the persons at risk. There was no suggestion that this was an absolute duty or one which differed in any way from that laid down in Osman.

A v United Kingdom <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1998) 27 EHRR 611" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">(1998) 27 EHRR 611</ref> was decided shortly before the leading case of Osman v United Kingdom <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2000) 29 EHRR 245" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">(2000) 29 EHRR 245</ref>. Av United Kingdom established the principle that the state was obliged to take measures designed to ensure that people were not subjected to ill-treatment by private individuals. Vulnerable people were entitled to be protected by effective deterrent measures. The existence of the defence of reasonable chastisement failed to afford children such protection. Osman took the matter further by establishing a duty to take more pro-active protective measures to guard against real and immediate risk of which the authorities knew or ought to have known.  There was no breach in Osman itself; but breaches were found in both Z v United Kingdom <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2001) 34 EHRR 97" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">(2001) 34 EHRR 97</ref> and E v United Kingdom <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2002) 36 EHRR 519" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">(2002) 36 EHRR 519</ref>. In Z, the authorities had failed to protect children from prolonged abuse and neglect which they knew all about. In E, they had failed to monitor the situation after a stepfather had been convicted of sexual abuse, and so it was held that they should have found out that he was abusing the children and done something to protect them.&#8221;</span></p>

To use her term &#8220;both are absolute but their content is different&#8221;.

It is the only scenario where [N] can meet and have the possibility of a direct relationship with her father.  It is the only scenario where there is a realistic prospect of [N] having a direct relationship with her siblings whilst also maintaining her relationship with her mother.  The issue is therefore the extent to which, if permitting this situation, the Court (as arm of the state) is protecting [N&#8217;s] absolute right pursuant to article 3.  Conversely, does [N&#8217;s] article 3 right require the Court to make an FGMPO with a travel restriction?&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Heaton emphasises that not every claimed risk to life can entail an imposition on authorities of an obligation to prevent risk from materialising.  The duty goes no further, she submits, than that which is reasonable in all the circumstances to protect the individual from a real and immediate risk from harm.  As I have set out, I regard these principles as essentially uncontroversial.  The State manifestly, for the reasons that I have analysed, cannot be expected to bear an intolerable burden in its duty to protect from the actions of third parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important that I make it abundantly clear, if I have not already done so, that I found M to be impressive on many levels.  She brought N to court with her, having no other option.  N was obviously well cared for and M possessed the confidence and calm of an experienced mother with a large family.  It was clear to me that M is determined to reunite her family.  Having managed, with some guile, to leave Sudan, she is hoping to return and to persuade her husband to let her take the boys.  I consider that she feels that the force of her argument will ultimately win the day.  She believes her husband to be an essentially good man who will yield to what she sees as the best option for all the children.  She also considers that she may be able to recruit some of the other male members of the family in support.  She is realistic enough to tell me that she thinks this will take some months.  I have already said that M has been inconsistent in her evidence but I believe the account that I have just set out to represent her genuine objectives.  Moreover, M has intimated that, if necessary, she would remove the children from the Sudan without F&#8217;s permission.  She has, as I have already commented, shown a degree of guile to the extent that I do not discount this as a possibility.</p>

It is obvious from everything I have said that M&#8217;s status as a mother and wife has been subjugated already, in the recent past, to stronger cultural imperatives.  It is also very clear that as a woman, in her family, she does not enjoy equal respect alongside her husband nor is her autonomy valued by the extended family.  The key illustrations of all this I find to be:  F&#8217;s retention of the passports; the wider family&#8217;s imposed &#8220;treatment&#8221; on two of the boys against M&#8217;s wishes (the cutting of R&#8217;s tongue ostensibly to heal a cough); F&#8217;s dismantling of the family home in the UK without informing M; and M&#8217;s expressed anxiety to the social workers concerning F&#8217;s extended family in the UK.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my earlier factual findings (see para 8 above) I considered that N, in common with the prevailing culture in the Sudan, would be most at risk in the age group 5-9 years of age.  This is the bracket in which, statistically, most Sudanese girls are subjected to FGM.  This leads Ms Heaton to argue that the contemplated Article 3 violation cannot here be said to be &#8220;real and immediate&#8221;.  With respect, I disagree.  It is true that M herself was subjected to the process when she was 9 years of age i.e. within the window which is most culturally normative.  However, I very strongly suspect that M&#8217;s views on the practice are known by her husband but may not be shared by him with the same commitment.  M&#8217;s rejection of much that she sees as negative or retrograde in Sudanese culture is clear for all to see.  Thus there is a risk that the family might act precipitously.  This I determine to be a real risk and not merely a speculative one.  Moreover it also has to be remembered that a statistically significant number of FGMs are performed in the Sudan under the age of 4 (i.e. 10% according to the UNICEF figures).  Additionally, the reality and immediacy of the risk to N has to be considered in the context of M&#8217;s ability to extricate herself and her children from Sudan in the future.  Thus it is M&#8217;s re-entry to Sudan which should be regarded as representing the immediacy of the risk if she is unable to negotiate N&#8217;s subsequent removal.  It is clear that M&#8217;s undoubted strength meets with a resistance from the wider family, the force and perseverance of which cannot be predicted.  In such circumstances the risk can logically only be regarded as high and the countervailing measures required in order to protect as substantial.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Here, N faces the real risk of degrading and inhuman treatment from which she has an absolute right to be protected.  The State, through this court, has a duty to do all that is reasonable, not merely to attempt to but proactively to take measures to protect her.  The force of the duty imposed to protect N from her family members and community, whilst it does not extend to that which is unduly burdensome, has nonetheless been characterised by Baroness Hale as &#8220;absolute&#8221; in itself.   It can only be seen here as requiring measures which have a real prospect of protecting N, rather than a strategy that conceivably might.  The latter does not discharge the duty sufficiently or indeed at all.  In the discharge of this obligation it may be that the Article 8 or other rights of the victim and family members become casualties to the greater obligation under Article 3.  Ms Heaton is entirely right to point to the compromise of this family&#8217;s Article 8 rights in prohibiting N&#8217;s return here but the duty on the State is not to avert such breaches entirely (it cannot do so) rather to keep them to the minimum required to protect the identified Article 3 right.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having assessed M&#8217;s determination to protect her daughter in Sudan so positively, I have considered whether the State&#8217;s obligations might, in the context of family life, properly be discharged by placing the responsibility in the hands of a parent fully alert to the risk and determined to protect from it.  Ultimately however, I am driven to conclude that the violation of the individual which results from this practice requires the State to intervene far more positively.  The force of M&#8217;s will, her undoubted determination to protect her daughter, is not in the end enough.  Accordingly, I grant the Local Authority&#8217;s application prohibiting N&#8217;s removal.  I record also that the application is supported by N&#8217;s Guardian.</p>
