	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following their removal to Nigeria, children were made wards of court. Their father is in contempt of court, having breached various court orders: in particular, by failing to return the children to this country and by himself fleeing abroad to Nigeria. The mother seeks the father&#8217;s extradition from Nigeria. For that purpose she seeks a declaration that the contempts of which the father has been found guilty are <span style="font-style:italic">criminal </span>and not merely <span style="font-style:italic">civil</span>. She puts her case on two bases: the contempts, she says, (i) relate to wards of court and (ii) involve interference with the administration of justice. </p>

Prior to July 2013, they had been living in this country with their parents. In July 2013 the children went to Nigeria, where all three remain, in circumstances which were the subject of controversy between the parents. The applicant mother began proceedings on 22 November 2013, when Ms Alison Russell QC (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) made a without notice Tipstaff order directed to the respondent father. Further orders were made by Moylan J on 17 December 2013 and 20 December 2013. On 30 January 2014, Russell J, as by then she had become, ordered that the three children be wards of court, as they remain. On 6 February 2014, the father, who until then had been in this country, left for Nigeria, where he remains. Further orders were made by Russell J on 26 February 2014, 5 March 2014 and 14 March 2014.</p>

First, although the heading refers to the inherent jurisdiction, it is nowhere said that the children are wards of court. Secondly, each alleged contempt is charged as being a &#8220;breach&#8221; of the relevant order, and nothing more. Thirdly, it is nowhere said that the result of any of the breaches has been an interference with the administration of justice, let alone that this was intended or was, or should have been, contemplated by the father.</p>

Given the stance being adopted by Mr Hames on behalf of the father, I have the benefit of rigorously adversarial argument. And, at the end of the day, and despite the scepticism expressed both by the advocate to the court and by Mr Hames, I can see advantage, as indeed do both the Crown Prosecution Service and the Home Office, in the court which has determined the question of contempt also deciding whether the contempt is civil or criminal. As Ms Patel put it in her skeleton argument for the hearing before Newton J on 10 March 2016, the mother can properly seek to invoke the adjudicatory powers of the convicting court to clarify whether any of the contempts in question were criminal rather than civil in nature. Mr Summers went even further, submitting that &#8220;only the convicting court is able to determine the issue.&#8221; Ms White expressed scepticism, which I share, as to whether this latter point can be right, and I make clear that this is not the basis of my decision to proceed.</p>

The Common Serjeant and the Court of Appeal rejected this argument and I agree with them. It is necessary to look at the nature and purpose of the order. It is fallacious to argue that because the order was made by a criminal court, rather than a civil court, disobedience to the order amounts to a crime, whereas it would not have been a crime to disobey a similar order imposed by a civil court. The question whether a contempt is a criminal contempt does not depend on the nature of the court to which the contempt was displayed; it depends on nature of the conduct. To burst into a court room and disrupt a civil trial would be a criminal contempt just as much as if the court had been conducting a criminal trial. Conversely, disobedience to a procedural order of a court is not in itself a crime, just because the order was made in the course of criminal proceedings. To hold that a breach of a procedural order made in a criminal court is itself a crime would be to introduce an unjustified and anomalous extension of the criminal law. &#8220;Civil contempt&#8221; is not confined to contempt of a civil court. It simply denotes a contempt which is not itself a crime.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is sometimes said &#8230; that it is a contempt to interfere with the welfare of a ward, but while this may be a convenient shorthand statement of the position, it is apt to be misleading. Though rooted in the need to protect the ward&#8217;s welfare, the essence of the contempt lies in interfering with the special protective jurisdiction which the court has over its wards. As Cross J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B(JA)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1965] Ch 1112" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1965">[1965] Ch 1112</ref> at 1117:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;Any action which tends to hamper the court in carrying out its duty [to protects its wards] is an interference with the administration of justice and a criminal contempt.&#8221; </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230; Not all acts which may be harmful to a ward are necessarily contempts &#8230; Even acts which directly harm a ward do not automatically constitute a contempt. For example, assaulting a ward may no doubt be harmful to him, yet even if the offender knows that the child is a ward such an act will not, unless intended to influence court proceedings &#8230; normally constitute a contempt.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;While contempts committed by interfering with the court&#8217;s duty to protect its wards are generally regarded as criminal &#8230; disobeying a court order is usually categorised as a civil contempt &#8230; The two types, however, overlap in the wardship context. For example, removing a ward from the jurisdiction amounts to a criminal contempt (see <span style="font-style:italic">R v D </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] AC 778" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] AC 778</ref> at p 791 per Watkins LJ &#8211; not commented upon in the House of Lords.

Authority does not need to be cited for the proposition that it is, in principle, a contempt of court to put pressure on a litigant to abandon the proceedings or to threaten a litigant or witness with retribution for giving evidence. But what is also clear is that such behaviour is not a contempt of court unless the perpetrator intends by his actions to interfere with or impede or prejudice the administration of justice: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney-General v Times Newspapers Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 AC 191" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 AC 191</ref>, 203 (Lord Brandon of Oakbrook), 218 (Lord Oliver of Aylmerton), and <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney-General v Newspaper Publishing PLC</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 WLR 926" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 WLR 926</ref>, 936 (Lord Bingham of Cornhill CJ).

One of the issues in that case was whether the alleged contempt, assuming it was contempt at all, was criminal or civil, for at that time section 47 of the Judicature Act 1873 provided that no appeal lay to the Court of Appeal in any &#8220;criminal cause or matter.&#8221; The Court of Appeal (Cozens-Hardy MR, Farwell, Buckley and Kennedy LJJ, Vaughan Williams and Fletcher Moulton LJJ dissenting) held the relevant contempt was criminal, so the appeal was incompetent: <span style="font-style:italic">Scott (otherwise Morgan) v Scott </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1912] P 241" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1912">[1912] P 241</ref>.

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;If a certain act may be viewed in either of two aspects, the one criminal and the other simply tortious, it is, I think, essential, in order to bring a judgment or order dealing with it within this section, that it should clearly appear on the face of the judgment or order that the act is dealt with in its criminal, and not in its civil, aspect. Were it otherwise a judgment for damages in a case of wilful and deliberate assault could not be reviewed by a Court of Appeal since wilful assault is a crime. Now Lindley LJ, in <span style="font-style:italic">O&#8217;Shea v. O&#8217;Shea and Parnell</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="15 PD 59" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">15 PD 59</ref>, at p 64, is reported as having expressed himself thus: &#8220;There are obviously contempts and contempts; there is an ambiguity in the word; and an attachment may sometimes be regarded as a civil proceeding. For instance, where an order was made by the Court of Chancery in former days there was no mode of enforcing such an order but by attachment. We must not, therefore, be misled by the words &#8216;contempt&#8217; and &#8216;attachment,&#8217; but we must look at the substance of the thing. In the present case I have no doubt that the proceeding is a summary conviction for a criminal offence, and therefore no appeal lies.&#8221; To accuse one, therefore, of being guilty of a contempt of Court does not, I think, necessarily imply that he has committed a crime, nor is the criminality of the act necessarily implied by the added allegation that the contempt consisted in the violation of an order of Court.&#8221;</p>

		  <p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>The far-reaching nature &#8211; what some might think the extravagance &#8211; of this proposition is recognised by Mr Knowles and Mr Perkins when they assert in their skeleton argument that, although the application before me is confined to the contempts in relation to the orders set out in paragraphs 5(i)-(vi) above, if the proposition is correct then the contempts in relation to the orders set out in paragraphs 5(viii)-(x) are also criminal. Those orders required the father to provide certain information and to attend various court hearings. If the breach of such an order is criminal merely because the proceedings relate to a ward of court, it is difficult to identify any even procedural order in wardship proceedings breach of which will not be criminal.  </p>
		</authorialNote> This is elaborated in submissions that &#8220;the father&#8217;s contempts are <span style="font-style:italic">ipso facto </span>criminal in nature because (a) they relate to wards of court and so have hampered (and continue to hamper) the court in carrying out its duty to protect its wards and (b) he committed them intentionally in order to subvert the court&#8217;s process.&#8221; Putting the point even more expansively, the submission is that &#8220;there is a principle of long standing that any contempt in relation to a ward, whether there is a specific order in effect or not, is a criminal contempt.&#8221;</p>

The authority with which privilege of peerage was assumed by the demurrer to come in conflict was that of a city Court; the contempt for which it was alleged that privileged persons could not be arrested was taking away a ward of that Court. The Court of King&#8217;s Bench held that the peerage and its privileges afforded no protection in such a case; and to make the authority more applicable, the Court illustrated the decision by referring to the writ of <span style="font-style:italic">homine replegiando</span> against which, if a peer was refractory, it was held to be clear that he must be committed; that is, if he eloigned the body of the villein or person sought to be replieved. Now Mr Long Wellesley has here taken away and detained the ward of this Court; he has eloigned that ward. Is it saying too much to add that a privilege which could not protect a peer in the time of Charles II against the authority of the Mayor&#8217;s Court, is still less capable in the present day of protecting a commoner against the authority of the Great Seal?&#8221;</p>

The law imposes no duty on the world, or even on family members, to volunteer their assistance to the wardship court, and if it did, which, to repeat, it does not, the duty would be at most a duty of imperfect obligation. Suppose that the wardship judge makes a statement in open court, <span style="font-style:italic">urbi et orbe</span>, enlisting and entreating the assistance of the media and others in locating and procuring the return of a missing ward; and suppose that a family member, knowing perfectly well where the missing child is, does nothing. Is that a contempt? Plainly not, unless the court has embodied its wishes in an order which complies with the irreducible requirements of every mandatory injunction &#8211; that it is directed to an identified individual, or to a defined class of people of whom the relevant individual is a member, and that it specifies with proper particularity precisely what it is that the court requires to be done.</p>

In other words, the grounds omitted these two necessary averments (see paragraphs 32 and 35 above).

Many orders are breached in circumstances which frustrate the court&#8217;s process, sometimes intentionally. In many cases the disobedience is persistent, flagrant and has far-reaching consequences. But that does not mean that such contempts are necessarily criminal, even if the intention is to frustrate the court&#8217;s process. Realistically, Mr Hames does not seek to mitigate the seriousness of the father&#8217;s contempts. The father is, he concedes, &#8220;a bad civil contemnor&#8221;, but, he says, there is lacking in his conduct the extra element required by law to transform his civil into criminal contempts.</p>
