	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings concern a young girl called SK, who is believed to be aged eight, her age is one of the issues that I have to determine.  She has been in foster care since June 2013 and, almost all the time since then, has been in the care of Ms A, who is a party to these proceedings and present in court and seeks a special guardianship order (SGO) being made in her favour so that she can have the necessary legal framework to provide S with the security and stability that she clearly needs.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">A final care order was made in relation to S on 23 January 2014.  Before I delve into the background, I am giving this extempore judgment so that the parties know what the court&#8217;s orders are today.  It will be appropriate for the local authority to get a transcript of this judgment, which I can then perfect and approve, so that there is a record in relation to the basis upon which this court made the decisions that it did, not only for any applications that may be made to other agencies, but also, importantly, for S as being an important part of her history.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings have gone on for some time and I know this had caused some frustration to the local authority, but it has been important for this court to be able to gather as much information as it can in relation to S&#8217;s background, because of the somewhat unusual circumstances.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am extremely grateful to Mr Wahid and Mr Restall who are, respectively, the representatives for the local authority and S&#8217;s Guardian.  They have been thorough in relation to their skeleton arguments that they have put before the court and, in short, the court has had the best information available to enable it to reach its decision.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am also indebted to Ms Kazina the allocated social worker, who has been involved in a lot of the evidence gathering in relation to S&#8217;s circumstances and has, in large part, been responsible for the compilation of the extremely thorough SGO assessment.  I am also indebted to Ms Fitzgibbon, S&#8217;s Guardian throughout these proceedings who has ensured that every opportunity has been given to ensure that all the relevant information is before the court.  Finally, Ms A, who has attended all hearings, without legal representation, but has been able to, helpfully, provide assistance to the parties, and the court, in relation to any missing information.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This hearing concerns, essentially, three applications made by the local authority.  The local authority&#8217;s application is for an SGO in favour of Ms A.  Their initial application issued in January of last year was for a placement order but they recognise, because of the willingness of Ms A to be put forward as S&#8217;s long-term carer, and her reluctance, for a number of different reasons, to not want there to be an adoption order, that they support the position in relation to a SGO.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second application is a declaration in relation to S&#8217;s date of birth, that it should be deemed to be 21 September 2008, not 21 June 2010, that appears on a birth certificate that had been submitted by Ms K, establishing that she is S&#8217;s mother.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The applications are supported by Ms Fitzgibbon, the Children&#8217;s Guardian, with the proviso, in relation to the application for an SGO, that, as there has been no DBS check obtained in relation to a young person called X, who lives with Ms A, and has lived with her for the last 21 years, having been placed there at the age of six months in 1995, and then continued her placement, following attaining the age of majority.  As a result of there not having been DBS checks in relation to her Ms Fitzgibbon cannot give her consent to the making of an SGO.  There is no application to adjourn that order being made today and it is agreed that there should be a recital to the SGO, that the local authority will undertake to obtain the DBS check.  Ms&#160;A has confirmed that X has been in her care for this period of time; that she has an allocated social worker from Adult Social Care; that this is the same local authority who will place S with Ms A and so, if there were any safeguarding concerns, in relation to X, as regards S being placed with Ms A, there would have been the necessary referrals within the local authority mechanisms to alert S&#8217;s social worker to the position.  That has not taken place, so I am satisfied, on the information I have got, that the court has sufficient information to be able to proceed with the SGO.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">For reasons which I will set out in a moment, Ms K has not participated in these proceedings.  S&#8217;s immigration position remains uncertain.  She has been treated by the relevant agency as a trafficked child and has recently been given discretionary leave to remain here, from 12 January 2017 to 13 July 2019.  Any decision I make regarding her future placement is governed by her welfare, which is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  What decisions are made regarding her immigration position are, of course, a matter for the Secretary of State for the Home Department.</p>

The interpreter was called on once or twice only.  She confirmed she went to Turkey on 4 June 2013.  She said she had temporary Turkish passports for herself and S which lasted for one month.  In Turkey she had to obtain another travel document in order to be able to return to the UK.  Once she had this, she waited another four or five days to return.

Her evidence in relation to this raised serious concerns as there appears to be no record of a pregnancy, even though she attended the GP as late as 20 April 2010, before flying to Turkey on 28 April 2010 and S&#8217;s birth on 21 June 2010.  </span></p>

This was especially as S had no valid status in the UK and there were issues regarding her identity documents.  She had a British passport showing a date of birth of 21 June 2010 and Turkish identity documents showing the same date of birth and Ms K as her mother.

There is, arguably, a lacuna in the rules since a person who is alleged not to be a parent is, at the moment, not included as a respondent. The FPR go on at r 8.20 (2) to provide that the application form must provide particulars of every person whose interests may be affected by the proceedings. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.58in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Since S had her age assessment in November 2013, that indicated that she was between five years and five years and nine months, now approximately five years, five months to six years, two months.  The local authority approached the police to ask for advice about changing her official birth date.  The social worker explained to the review that the local authority were told they could not formally change the date of birth but could use another date for age purposes, but consequently it was agreed that S&#8217;s birth date would now be regarded as 21 September 2008&#8217;.</span></p>

In my judgment, it is more likely than not that Ms K is not S&#8217;s mother.  Whilst I recognise Ms K&#8217;s repeated assertions, and the information contained in the birth certificate, that document is inconsistent with other material available to the court.  In particular, the information from the general practitioner regarding Ms K&#8217;s visits in April 2014, when no record of the pregnancy is made, and the blood tests at the time are inconsistent with an advanced state of pregnancy.</p>

That<span style="color:#FF0000"/>confirmed the limits of the disclosure that the police are able to make.  I agree with the submission set out by Mr Restall, at paragraph 43 of his skeleton argument, in relation to inferences regarding the prosecution case against Ms K. One inference is that the DNA evidence shows that she is not related to S.  It is possible the DNA result was inconclusive, namely that the sample was insufficient in some way.  That said, the court is entitled to take into account, that if the result were positive that Ms K was S&#8217;s mother, then it would be likely that the prosecution case would not be what it is, namely charges in relation to entry to this jurisdiction on false documents.  </p>

Again, I factor in the information contained on the birth certificate, and what is said about the Turkish Consulate&#8217;s position in relation to that, but its reliability is called into doubt regarding my conclusions relating to maternity.  I am satisfied, from the evidence the court has that the birth certificate cannot be relied upon and that it is more likely than not, when one stands back and looks at the age assessment information that the court has, that I have just gone through, not only from the radiological evidence relating to the bones, but also the global assessments that have been undertaken, starting from that done by the health visitor in May 2013, through to the two assessments in November 2016, I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that S was born in 2008, not 2010. I agree with the position of the local authority, as supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, that the court should fix the date of birth as being 21 September 2008. The assessments that have been undertaken, when looked at together, demonstrate, on all levels, S is more likely to be aged eight than aged six.</p>
