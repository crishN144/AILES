	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I shall begin my remarks this afternoon by reminding everyone of the events that have taken place today and comparing them with last week and indeed this week. I made it clear during these proceedings that on no account were the proceedings to be discussed with JM; for in no manner of course should any injunction made by this court be breached. Any discussion in JM's presence with a Solicitor is therefore in breach of the rules and a contempt of court. Any wrongful removal of him from the Home other than for the purposes of contact is also a breach of the injunction. Both of these appear to have happened today. I anticipate an application for committal to be made in due course by the Local Authority involved. I will not deal with committal today, though it is tempting, because there appears to have been a flagrant ignoring of the directions and comments that I have made and calm reflection is required.</p>

I think that should be done as a matter of urgency and I trust there is someone in transit.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in">         Planning for the future of an ailing and declining relation is a very worrying and distressing time for all those involved, especially where a loved elderly parent is concerned and there are no real prospects of a recovery. Not only is their state of mind and health alarming, it causes great distress and upset, and it can affect relationships within the family and with professionals. The court has considerable sympathy for those in a family faced with such a problem, though less for those who disobey court orders.</p>

He is now aged 79 and lives at AH, a care home run by SCC. He suffers it is said from Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, from which there is no recovery. I note at this early stage this diagnosis has at times been disputed by his daughter, WM, but at other times she seems also to accept it. She certainly agrees he has a form of dementia. He also has a number of other medical problems, such as diabetes and TB, so he needs to be very carefully managed, and his health management poses other challenges too.</p>

First, on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2010, JM was found collapsed on the floor at his home with hyperglycaemia. Second, he was transferred to a home called SC on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2010. Third, the Local Authority apparently with WM present concluded that 24 hour care was needed, and he became resident at PH Care Home shortly thereafter until August 2010. Fourthly, in August 2010, his family moved him to TM Residential Care Home. Fifth, at WM's request he was&#8230;</p>

Sixthly, the Local Authority became concerned and obtained a Deprivation of Liberty authorisation. On Boxing Day 2010, JM was removed by his sons, EM and IM; and WM<span style="font-style:italic">)</span> took him to Turkey on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December.

Her case is she needed some form of respite from care. He was placed where he now lives at AH in SCC's local area. WM has repeatedly said she wants JM home in the community and indicated that he should be removed back to her or else she could take him to Turkey. She also wished to access his finances. </p>

The Police had to be called and WM was escorted off the premises. Since then, WM has only had supervised contact both by telephone or face to face. Her brothers by contrast have had unrestricted contact. WM has continued to discuss the matter inappropriately say SCC with JM causing him dismay, and as a result I granted injunctions to prevent molestation, harassment etcetera against her and her brothers in the light of the history. I anticipate a contempt application of a breach of those injunctions to follow today's events.</p>

IM did not attend the hearing till Wednesday 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April and then just for that day. He was not represented. His view is that whilst he would support WM in caring for her father, her plans were not formulated, and his father is content and well looked after where he is at AH. However, I was alarmed that during the course of the trial, he is reported to have said he will remove his father if I do not order he can stay with WM.

She makes wild allegations of dishonesty against the Social Worker LW and against the Local Authority in general, though I say at the outset she is yet to justify any such comments in any way or at all. I have tried time and time again to persuade her to be relevant in her answers to questions, and also in the questions she has asked and in her final submissions to me.

I have looked at them even though they have not been subjected to scrutiny by cross-examination, but without any demur from Counsel for the Local Authority or the Official Solicitor, and again they are a motley collection of loose documents and not a plan at all, just vague suggestions, save statements by family members which appear to repeat her evidence. Repeating evidence already given is not tantamount to preparing a care plan, nor is an assertion of the kind of person whom the family will seek to engage to help when nothing has been set up or formally proposed.</p>

And so it is that I first heard from Dr CB. Concern as to the personality and functioning of WM led the court to direct a report to enable me to know her understanding of her father's needs in the short, medium and long term, her duty to work with outside agencies, and her understanding of her own needs and abilities as a carer. </p>

[That is how she approached her evidence in general, and indeed how she has represented herself throughout]. In giving information about her father, CB writes this, "It was difficult to obtain very much information from WM about her father's current needs, as she responded to all questions of this type with a lengthy account of her concerns of the past actions of Social Workers and members of her family and about the current care arrangements for her father. WM simply doesn't anticipate the difficulties in caring for her father. </p>

When assessed, WM showed evidence of confused thinking and extreme suspicion of Social Workers and other professionals.

CB told me she had spent four and a half hours with WM and felt this is a quite sufficient period of time to get to know her. She had administered psychological psychometric testing and assessed her personality and intelligence in accordance with her written evidence and her observations. WM tended to emphasise her ability overly to cope with her father and failed to see things from the perspective of others. She could learn what her father's needs are, but it would be difficult for her to respond to those needs despite the strength of her commitment and determination. To change her approach, WM needed long term therapy, which she could not guarantee would succeed.</p>

The Local Authority relationship with WM has remained a difficult one. She would shout and swear on the telephone. By comparison, IM and EM had it seemed moved on, subject to what I say later in this judgment, and they now have unrestricted contact. IM had had unsupervised contact for a good three months. There had been a risk assessment which had led to that unsupervised contact. She was however concerned to see the notes of AM at the AH home of a recent alleged threat by IM to take the law into his own hands and remove JM from AH, but she wanted WM and indeed IM to continue to have unsupervised contact, though in WM's case it must be after a period of building up and trust. She agreed with the views of Dr J and also of JF, the independent Social Worker, to whom I shall come.</p>

Indeed, I make it clear now at this point in my judgment that any revelation of information in this case is a contempt of court and I will deal with it seriously. </p>

She had been seeking to arrange a reallocation of better accommodation for WM and JM together. A letter had gone to the Housing Department to support that. WM would not accept she had done that and said she had not written, but she had, she said, and I believe her. She then told me that WM had wanted to remove her father back to either his or her address and that had led to a Local Authority intervention, and she recalled WM had been abusive on the telephone.</p>

She dismissed the possibility of a return home because of the progressive dementia illness and the deterioration in his cognitive functioning. She would like him to be living in a supported living environment, but that would not provide the consistent structural routine that he needed, and the return to WM would simply be an unacceptable risk in the wholesale absence of a proper care package, and WM in any event would seek to disengage with professionals. The only alternative in reality, and the best alternative, was an EMI residential home to cope with the significant cognitive impairments of JM and his short term memory deficits. </p>

She had not seen any evidence of rough handling, and if there had been she would have caused it to be investigated, and I note at this point that when IM gave evidence, he said that WM, his sister, was wrong and JM was being well looked after in the home. It was not true to say, she said, that JM was restricted in the home. He had outings, for example to a garden centre and to local gardens, with the home, plus of course a trip to the shops to buy clothing. In addition, he went out with his sons. It was not true that IM and EM had only had two supported contacts and then wholly unsupervised contacts as WM alleged, but she did hope that one day unsupported contact with WM might be possible. What was needed was consistent settled contact with WM with no upset to JM and no form of distress caused to him. She later said she agreed that a good working agreement needed to be drawn up so that contact could progress. </p>

WM accused her of saying she [WM] had learning difficulties, but that is plainly not the case as documents reveal. She was satisfied that JM is settled and content in AH. I find that the questioning and challenges from WM were unjustified, inaccurate, rambling and exaggerated, and even on occasion incomprehensible. LW told Miss Khalique what the new care plan is for JM. I have to say that it seems to me to be entirely proper and well conceived. She also told her about the financial plans for reviewing JM's finances, which seemed to be in accordance with usual Local Authority practice. She agreed that there should be some eight weeks of peaceful contact before WM could begin to have contact unsupervised. </p>

The important points are these: He supports the Local Authority plan for JM to remain at AH and does not consider it in the best interests of him to be placed with his daughter.

Carers must always place the needs of adults with complex needs before their own needs. They must never become frustrated by the behaviour that results from dementia and must relate to them in a way which acknowledges their difficulties. The available evidence thus far suggests WM would have significant difficulty in maintaining these essential aspects of care for her father." </p>

Indeed, such were his concerns, it was he who suggested the psychological report which I have set out in great detail, and having seen that report he believed that the actions of the Local Authority were an inevitable response to the behaviour of WM and JM's best interests were served by being looked after in the safe and caring environment. </p>

She and her brother are important people in JM's life, but JM needs consistency, understanding and the avoidance of frustration. Those with dementia can react aggressively and even be violent. Those caring for those needs need to be passive and reassuring in their reactions. He could not tell what care in Turkey would be like, but he did not think that living with WM would provide the consistency and calm that JM needs.

That made her feel pushed away and frustrated. She was closest to dad. The Local Authority had pushed her too far, but that was not explained, nor her behaviour in discussing matters in front of her father, which she appears to do even today. The Local Authority have brainwashed her father, she said again, but she could not justify that. </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Things had been very different when her father had been with her. Had she not prepared the purported draft Press article pushed through the door at AH and now in the bundle at B340 to 50? "No comment", she said. I had to press her, and eventually she conceded it with a bit of a smirk, saying it was pretty clear she had caused that to be drafted. That leaflet includes the comments, "My father has been kidnapped and held by the Council of S in order to have deputy over his personal privacy, freedom and his assets." It alleges a scam by the Local Authority that it is defrauding people and that they are thugs. It is bizarre, inaccurate, widely exaggerated and continues to make a number of other inaccurate allegations.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>She admitted also she intended to sue the Local Authority Social Worker LW for discrimination, though what form of discrimination I cannot tell. She wanted, she said, to rescue people from this Local Authority. Her evidence became increasingly unbalanced and inaccurate, and I seriously doubt if she is fit to care for any elderly relative under any circumstances. She thought that KJ on behalf of the Official Solicitor had been effectively conspiring with the Local Authority. She had phoned KJ and been cut off. That did not explain her allegation at all. It concerned me that she was unable to see the Official Solicitor was investigating the matter impartially through independent experts.</p>

She was asked about a former violent partner, Mr N, but said she had kept him away. Could she put the past behind her and begin to work with this Local Authority? She could not see her doing that unless there was a new Social Worker. It seems to me on the basis of what I have heard she would not work with any Social Worker under any circumstances. I have seldom heard such a mixture of bizarre, unjustified, illogical and depressingly worrying attacks on the Local Authority, and in addition on the Official Solicitor. </p>

Of all the parties in the case in terms of evidence, she is the only one out of step with everyone else, including her own brothers. I cannot conceive under any circumstances, even a substantial change in attitude, that JM could live safely with her. This lady simply does not listen to advice or take it onboard.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>So I come to the conclusions I must draw as a result of what I have heard. First I am satisfied that JM is unable to take decisions as a result of his mental incapacity arising out of his Alzheimer's Disease and vascular dementia as to residence, contact with his family, his care package and his property and financial affairs. I remind myself as I must that the law is decision specific, so I have considered each point separately. This man is incapable of making decisions in all these aspects. </p>

It is an entirely suitable place and JM likes it. He is made a fuss of. He likes the staff. He has friends. He likes going back there, even after a day out with IM. I am satisfied with the Local Authority's care package, which I have read. It is well constructed and covers the necessary aspects of the case.</p>

I have no criticism to make of the members of the local Pentecostalist church that WM attends. It appears a number of good hearted people were willing to help out with JM. Helping out is not good enough however. JM presents difficulties that will worsen. He now needs 24 hour care, something that WM even now does not seem to appreciate. I have not seen anything like sufficient details of what can be provided, just a jumble of leaflets and possibilities in Turkey.</p>

Likewise, I remain dissatisfied with WM's so-called care plan for JM to remain in the UK. The sad truth is that despite being ordered as long ago as last year in August to do so, she has still not filed a care plan in detail at all. She has persisted to the last in providing leaflets as to possibilities and suggestions; nothing but nothing has been concrete or carefully constructed.</p>

Even though she loves him and is motivated partly by past hurts to care properly for him, her psychological profile renders her unfit to have the care of a vulnerable old man. She has neither the patience nor the ability to plan and be reasonable nor the tranquillity to cope with the increased demands of her father. Her volatility in this case has again persisted to the last. She simply would not be a safe long term carer for him.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>As to contact, the Local Authority proposes to continue the current arrangements for EM and IM to see their father. Up till today, I would say such arrangements are clearly in accordance with his wishes and benefit him. I would have directed they continue. However, today there has been a most alarming development. JM contrary to court orders and contrary to Court of Protection Rule 90 has been taken to see a Solicitor. He has been taken out at a time where I understand he has infections. This can only cause him distress and cannot do him any good at all. So I propose to make it clear, since I have no criticisms of LW, that it is a matter for the discretion of the Local Authority as to what contact can take place, how it can be built up, and when it resumes, and I am prepared to give authority today, and Mr Bowe can draft the order accordingly, for contact to be suspended for all the family whilst the matter is reconsidered and re-evaluated by the Local Authority. That is something I know that would not be opposed by the Official Solicitor.</p>

Whatever WM's business expertise [she has told me she has retired early she has made so much money] she in my view would not be able to resist the temptation to refuse to meet the Local Authority's reasonable home fees and other bills for her father. As they have day to day care of him, a Local Authority deputy is appropriate and I so direct.</p>

I shall continue the injunctions as they are presently drafted to cover violence, threats, intimidation, harassment and pestering of JM and employees of AH and the Local Authority. There should be no removal of JM or encouragement of him to leave AH and no discussion with him, and in particular no removal from the jurisdiction. Having heard WM's threat to 'have' LW for discrimination, it is best to continue all the injunctions in their entirety and to expand them as reasonably suggested by Mr Bowe, and no doubt with the support of Miss Khalique.</p>

I shall direct today all parties to lodge position statements at least 48 hours before the next hearing. </p>

In particular, in evaluating Dr J's evidence, I have applied Section 2 and 3 of the Act. I am satisfied JM cannot make decisions to which I have referred owing to an impairment or a disturbance in the functioning of his mind or brain. In addition, with regard to each and every of the decisions necessary as to residence etcetera, he is unable to understand the information relevant to the decisions, to retain that information, to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision, and to communicate that decision with consistency. </p>

I am grateful to Miss Khalique for alerting me to the judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">K v LBX etcetera </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/79" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 79" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 79</ref>. In discussing whether or not the court which will start from the prescribed starting point of a right to family life, Lady Justice Black said this, "&#8230;a prescribed starting point risks deflecting the decision maker's attention from one aspect of Article 8 (private life) by focussing his attention on another (family life). In its wider form, incorporating reference to both private and family life, there is a danger that it contains within it an inherent conflict, for elements of private life, such as the right to personal development and the right to establish relationships with other human beings and the outside world, may not always be entirely compatible with existing family life in the sense of continuing to live within the existing family home."</p>

He will not be well looked after unless he is with the Local Authority and he would not be were he with WM, whatever else she may say, and I order accordingly. </p>
