	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ayden is the youngest of his mother&#8217;s five children. He has 3 older brothers and one older sister. His mother loves him with a devotion which is hard to put into words.  He is much loved also by his wider maternal family, some of whom live in the United Kingdom some of whom live much further away and have willingly overcome significant practical difficulties to be able to visit him. In August he had his first birthday. His father's name does not appear on his birth certificate and the identity of his father is not known within these proceedings. He has had no involvement either in Ayden&#8217;s life or in these proceedings.</p>

On August 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd </span>2024 I listed the application for case management hearings leading to a final hearing with a time estimate of 3 days to commence 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October 2024.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Self-evidently from the declarations sought, there is at the heart of this case a family faced with a situation of desperate sadness. The youngest member of their family, Ayden, lies gravely ill in hospital. It has been a difficult hearing. Those who love him have had to sit through highly specialised medical evidence which has been distressing to them. It is notable that on occasion it has appeared to me that the evidence has been distressing to some of those medical professionals giving it. There has been a conspicuous effort by all counsel involved first, not to add in any way that it is possible to avoid, to the distress of Ayden&#8217;s family in the way that the case has been conducted, and second, not to lose sight amid the technical evidence and the necessary forensic process of Ayden himself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ayden was born prematurely by induced delivery when restricted intra uterine growth and oligohydramnios (diminished amniotic fluid) was detected as part of his mother&#8217;s antenatal care.  Since at birth he was showing respiratory distress, he was admitted to and spent four days in the neonatal intensive care unit at the hospital in which he had been born. He was then discharged home to the care of his mother. His mother remained worried about his breathing and by the time he was eleven weeks old he had to be readmitted to hospital. There he suffered respiratory deterioration. The respiratory support he needed was increased first from high flow oxygen to continuous positive airway pressure (&#8216;CPAP&#8217;), escalating as his condition deteriorated further, to intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.  When he was not quite 12 weeks old, he was transferred and admitted in respiratory failure to the Paediatric intensive care ward (&#8216;PICU&#8217;) at Great Ormond Street Hospital (&#8216;GOSH&#8217;). He remains there today. </p>

First on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2023 he was extubated from mechanical ventilation to CPAP. His respiratory distress had increased after an hour to the point where ventilation was again needed to address the respiratory failure and rising carbon dioxide levels. A week later on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November a further, and as it turned out less successful attempt was made. Since that short period almost a year ago no further efforts have been made at extubation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ayden's presentation and establishing its likely cause was a focus of very significant concern not only to his mother but to the clinicians who had care of him in GOSH.  The way in which Ayden presented by late November and notably his, by then, very limited ability to move - minimal movements of both knees, small movements of fingers and wrists and movement (described in oral evidence to me as akin to a shrug) of one shoulder &#8211; raised a suspicion of SMARD 1 (Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Respiratory Distress Type 1). The investigations carried out included Genetic testing the results of which, taken together with nerve conductivity results, electromyogram and diaphragm ultrasound established on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2023 that he has SMARD1. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SMARD 1 is an exceptionally rare genetic disorder. It manifests itself across a spectrum of differing severity. It causes profound and progressive muscle weakening. Since this weakening includes the muscles required for breathing it affects the ability to breathe unaided.  Ayden falls at the severe end of the spectrum in respect of SMARD 1. He cannot breathe. Neither can he cough so as to clear secretions. Earlier in his admission to GOSH he had some gag reflex but that is not now present.  He has no movement of any of his limbs.</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The limited movement observed when he was tested for SMARD1 in November 2023 he has lost. He cannot turn or move his head but he is able to fix and follow with his eyes &#8211; though his ability to fix and follow across the full arc is also now diminished since the muscles of his eyes are weakened. The evidence of the medical witnesses as to his condition and prognosis is considered later in this judgment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no treatment for SMARD1, it is degenerative, irreversible and life limiting. Alongside those features of the condition Ayden is, as far as all the evidence indicates, cognitively intact. He can hear. He can see. It is not expected that he will ever be able to speak. The evidence suggests that he had little or no ability to express himself in any way. There are reported occasions when it is said that he smiles, most often in the presence of his mother. There are occasions when touch or voice &#8211;again most often of his mother seems to soothe and console him. Notably there is uncertainty about when he might be experiencing pain since he is not able to do any of the things a child in pain might do to communicate that: he cannot make a noise; he cannot pull away or withdraw from something that is hurting him. He cannot cry out.  One witness Dr ZK, told me in evidence that he sometimes seems to close his eyes as if he doesn't like something being done to him.  Sometimes his heart rate increases in a way which might be an indication of stress but as appears elsewhere in this judgment there is uncertainty clinically about the extent to which that is a reliable indicator of what he may be feeling physically or emotionally.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset of the case Ms Perry KC and Mr Shama made an application for an adjournment.  It was made in the form of a document served on the other parties and provided to me just before the scheduled start of the hearing. It is necessary for clarity of understanding to set out, in outline form, the basis of the application. The application to adjourn centred on what is called T3 data. Ayden as a patient on invasive ventilation in ICU, is linked up to a number of machines and monitors which capture readings of his physiology and functioning including Oxygenation and heart rate. At 5 second intervals, information is sampled from the machines and monitors and those samples captured as data. It is an entirely automated process and does not involve -as does the electronic recording system &#8216;EPIC&#8217; used on the unit- any component of information being accepted, verified and uploaded by a human being. That simplified explanation of T3 I have distilled from the evidence of Professor ZL.  Professor ZL had carried out an analysis of 9 weeks of T3 data. The application to adjourn the hearing encompassed also an application for provision of the T3 data (which does not form part of the bundle of medical records) in order to respond to the analysis evidence of Professor ZL.  It would be necessary, argued those for Ayden&#8217;s Mother either for those representing her to analyse the T3 data or to seek permission for an independent analysis of it by a suitably qualified expert. In either case that would necessitate an adjournment and relisting of the hearing to some future date yet to be determined. There appeared to be, submitted Ms Perry KC &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a difference in analysis between Professor ZL and Dr ZM </span>[Ms Braqi&#8217;s own expert] <span style="font-style:italic">depending on how the reviews were conducted and what questions they asked themselves&#8217;. </span> The T3 data was of particular relevance and interest in relation to the episodes of desaturation which Ayden experiences. Those episodes of desaturation are, submitted Ms Perry, fundamental to the case brought by the Trust in respect of the declarations sought. Ms Powell KC for the Trust who opposed the application, did not accept the characterisation of the episodes of desaturation as fundamental, rather she contended they are but one part of an overall clinical picture which led the Trust to apply for the declarations sought.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I refused the application to adjourn. I was not persuaded at that stage and without hearing the evidence of those clinicians caring for and or providing expert opinion evidence about Ayden that the T3 data was necessary evidence for the court to have to make a decision.  It seemed likely,  at the very least a real possibility, that some of those who were due to give evidence could productively be asked in cross examination about the T3 data, its relevance to the overall clinical picture, and the implications, if any, of its absence in relation to a best interests decision. I recognised that in consequence the time for cross examination of those witnesses would lengthen and furthermore that witnesses who were otherwise not required now might be.  One possibility was that hearing the evidence might have the result that the T3 data was not required another was that it might demonstrate that the T3 data was, as contended, fundamental to the decision, and that carried with it the prospect of adjourning part heard. To the extent that this is properly to be regarded as a risk it was one I was prepared to take. I could not see how I could arrive at a fair and safe decision on the T3 data point on submissions alone.  Recognising that case management is an ongoing process, I made clear in refusing the application to adjourn  i) my intention  to keep the T3 issue under review and to consider whether  having heard the evidence the absence of T3 data represented a gap in the evidence required, and ii) that if Ms Perry wished to renew her application at that point she would be given the opportunity. </span></p>

Those who look after him at GOSH regard him as the most severely affected case of SMARD1 they have encountered.  He has no head control or ability to turn his head to look around.  The muscles in his arms hands and lower limbs are wasted. His fingers and feet are showing early evidence of contractures.  His facial muscles have weakened to the point where he has limited movement of his mouth and some movement of his eyelids. He can still follow movement within his field of vision by tracking with his eyes. The tracking movement seems to some to be less than it was. The weakness of the muscles in his throat which has relevance to his respiratory situation means also that he is not expected to develop speech or vocal communication of any kind.  He is fed through a naso-gastric tube. There are no known therapies to reverse the muscle weakness which has progressed thus far and none which could prevent further wasting.  The deterioration of the musculature associated with breathing has had a devastating impact on his respiratory system as considered later. There has been a marked deterioration in the range of movement he had when he was first admitted to that which he has now. The trajectory is one way.</p>

There are some reported instances of patients in whom the onset of symptoms of SMARD1 starts later and in whom the manifestations are milder and the course of progression likewise milder. Although it is right that there is no curative treatment for SMARD1 in those patients either, there are some management options, which are available within the context of the milder presentation.  Most patients with the severe form that Ayden has, die within a few months of onset. It is known that in the United States of America, there is a trial of novel gene replacement therapy being undertaken. Those looking after Ayden at GOSH, knowing of it, made contact with the trial centre to see whether he might be considered for inclusion. He is regrettably not a candidate for the trial since it did not include infants who had already significant muscle weakness.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Breathing and Respiratory Issues</span> - Since he cannot breathe unaided, Ayden is fully ventilated on PICU. He is completely ventilator dependent. He cannot take any independent breaths. He no longer shows any respiratory effort. He has a nasal endotracheal tube and is delivered high pressure ventilation at a rate of 28 breaths a minute. The pressure from the ventilator keeps his lungs inflated. Since he cannot cough at all to clear his airways he requires suctioning to clear secretions. In line suctioning (i.e. remaining attached to the ventilator) is preferred wherever possible to avoid him losing the positive pressure delivered by the ventilator.  The processes of ventilation, suctioning and, when required, bagging, are not cost neutral in terms of his lungs.  Three lobes of his lungs have collapsed. There is not, I was told, a direct correlation between  their collapse and effective ventilated breathing since the other lobes in effect &#8216;work harder&#8217; and there is some scope for regrowth/ expansion of remaining lung surface. Inevitably however there is an impact on his already compromised respiratory state.  The continued functioning of his lungs &#8211; in the sense of receiving high pressure O<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2 </span>via the ventilator- is supported by specialist chest physiotherapy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Physiotherapeutic needs</span> - Ayden requires chest physiotherapy to mobilise or loosen secretions and then to remove those secretions by suctioning.  For physiotherapy he is disconnected from the ventilator and attached to an anaesthetic bagging circuit. Breaths are given by the bagging circuit and then vibrational force is applied to his chest wall and a &#8216;cough&#8217; mimicked to move secretions towards his tube.  One cycle of chest physiotherapy is approximately 5 of these breath/vibration actions. Then he is reconnected to the ventilator and suctioned. Over the course of each 20 -30 mins of chest physiotherapy, he receives 4 cycles. He is repositioned between each pair.  He requires this physiotherapy twice daily. It is essential to clear and keep his lungs open. It carries with it intermittent desaturations. It can only be carried out within an intensive care setting. Despite assiduous chest physiotherapy, he has collapsed lobes in both lungs. His situation is unusually severe and, in what, from the oral evidence I heard seemed to be a creative approach to trying to find effective ways to work with him, a machine called &#8216;cough-assist&#8217; has sometimes been used, following discussion between his physiotherapist and his lead consultant.  The cough-assist delivers a pre-set programme of positive pressure breaths followed by negative pressure, generating a fast expiratory flow, mimicking a cough (in some ways a more straightforward version of what is delivered by the bagging circuit/vibration/suctioning approach).  Since Ayden needed to have manual ventilation with an anaesthetic bag because he was frequently desaturating, that approach was felt safer and more appropriate than the cough-assist. </p>

When this happens, it can sometimes be corrected by increasing the percentage of oxygen delivered. Or by suctioning. If this does not resolve it, the bedside nurses will call for medical help and immediately initiate &#8216;bagging&#8217; using the <span style="font-style:italic">Ayers</span> rebreathing circuit - a specialised bagging system that is not used outside a critical care setting or theatres. It can only be safely operated by clinical staff who have had advanced training using it. The procedure involves taking Ayden off the ventilator. Within the broad consensus of evidence there were differences as to what level (i.e. numerically) constituted a serious or life-threatening fall. Some pitched it at 80% or below, some in the region of 50% +.  The episodes have been associated with bradycardia. Whilst the desaturations continue, they are not always more recently associated with bradycardia.  Elsewhere appears consideration of the evidence given about his heart rate anomalies.</p>

The fear of the medical staff is that there may come an occasion even in that context when he cannot be recovered from what Dr ZK called &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">the brink of death&#8217;. </span></p>

He has not the physical capacity to express that pain. This is not a child who can move his hand away from a sharp or painful stimulus or cry out to show something is hurting him. There is some small remaining thought that he can screw up his eye a little in response to the hard nasal tube which is likely to cause him pain when he is moved, but there is doubt about whether that is something that is an indicator of pain. As a result, the evidence before me is that it is difficult to assess when he is experiencing pain and discomfort.</p>

With that in mind; mechanical ventilation, is reported as feeling like a forced expansion of the lungs outside the patient's control.  For Ayden ventilation is a permanent condition. The build-up of secretions which can&#8217;t be cleared without suctioning is reported as feeling like <span style="font-style:italic">drowning. S</span>uctioning &#8211; of the sort Ayden needs very often - has been described by those who have experienced it as like a <span style="font-style:italic">knife</span> (children) or a <span style="font-style:italic">hot poker</span> (adult).

It is however the only means to try to assess his pain; second, that the fact that something is done often or as a matter of routine, does not mean that the experience of the pain of it is diminished. The chest physiotherapy which is essential for Ayden and which he experiences twice daily is delivered by a highly skilled and specialist physiotherapist and is painful. The physiotherapist told me, from her experience of delivering physiotherapy to other children, that infants who don&#8217;t have Ayden&#8217;s near complete paralysis of expression, very often start to cry when they see her coming towards them on the ward in anticipation of what is about to happen to them. </p>

Indications such as a raised heart rate, blood pressure or sweating might to put it at a basic level compensate for his lack of vocal expression or ability to show purposeful movement in relation to painful stimulus. Those features are governed by his autonomic nervous system. The evidence was that over the more recent months of his admission he has shown signs of autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic dysfunction is a development which is expected as part of SMARD1 progression. His heart rate for example is higher than normal ranges would allow for. What follows from this is that it has become unsafe for those looking after Ayden to rely on signs such as a raised heart rate or sweating as clear indicators of pain, discomfort or distress.  In relation to Autonomic Dysfunction words and phrases such as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">diagnosis</span>&#8217; and &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">signs of</span>&#8217; were used interchangeably by witnesses.

Whilst he, within the boundaries of a child so badly affected by SMARD1 is offered stimulation, all of that which would be stimulating to at this age, a toddler unaffected is unavailable to him. He does not have the same developmental path. The consensus of all of those looking after him is that the logical consequence to be drawn from his intact hearing, sight and cognition is that, although he cannot communicate anything about it, he has an awareness of all that is going on around him and all that is being done to him.

Dr ZK elaborated on the risk that Ayden may die as a result of a medical emergency or episode in PICU.  She gave that evidence in the context of being asked on behalf of the guardian about the possibility, on his mother&#8217;s case, of Ayden simply being allowed to &#8216;die naturally&#8217;. With noticeable emphasis she responded that <span style="font-style:italic">there is nothing natural about a death on a ventilator in intensive care.  </span> Expanding on this she identified the fear that an episode of irretrievable collapse should it be at night  or in the absence of his mother would mean he would die alone, amid the alarm and urgency of the crash team, subject to CPR, probably frightened,  without the comfort of his family, and without palliative medicine and care he would otherwise have.</p>

She takes a clear delight in him and, whilst there are limited ways she can bring stimulation to his life, she does so. Ayden cannot move his head but as he lies on his back he can still open his eyes, so she has obtained a projector so as to show animation on the ceiling.

The issue of whether there should be a tracheostomy &#8211; which is what Ms Braqi still expresses herself as wanting for Ayden &#8211; is not one which is before me. She said that she understood that.  Neither is there before me any consideration of whether the there was ever an opportunity in those early weeks after he was placed on mechanical ventilation for Ayden to have surgery for a tracheostomy. What Ms Braqi&#8217;s own comment tells me however, as confirmed by Ms Perry when I later asked her during submissions, is that the opportunity she believed there to have been she recognises is not now available. Without it, she knows he cannot leave ICU. In unambiguous terms she told me that on the PICU &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">he is alive but at home he would be living</span>&#8217;.  Knowing there to be no other option for him, she believes it remains in his best interest to continue to have Life Sustaining Treatment and to remain, for as long as his life may be, on a ventilator in the PICU.</p>

His mother did want me to visit him and so arrangements were made. Regrettably by the time intended for the visit, seasonal virus infection made it impossible for me to enter a paediatric care unit and it was agreed by all that I would not visit. The matter was not revisited until during the time I had set aside for judgment, an enquiry came from Ms Braqi&#8217;s solicitor as to whether I intended to visit. As things turned out the question was overtaken by the events of the postscript to this judgment. The end result was that I did not visit Ayden. That is a matter of regret to me - primarily because since his mother had wished me to do so and had wanted me to see him, I would not willingly have done otherwise. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of Ayden&#8217;s desaturation episodes has been the focus of much attention at this hearing. They are a marker so far as his clinicians are concerned of his lack of stability. Although on behalf of his mother clinicians were referred to entries in the medical records where he is described as &#8216;stable&#8217; and (as relevant in relation to pain) &#8216;comfortable&#8217; the response from each witness asked was that has to be seen in the context of being a child in intensive care requiring constant invasive ventilation. The evidence I have heard and accept from all of those clinicians is that whilst he continues to have episodes of desaturation it is impossible for him to be stepped down from PICU, not even to a high dependency unit and thus certainly not home.   His instability is also a component of the reasoning which leads those whose evidence written and oral on which the Trust relies are not prepared to carry out surgery for a tracheotomy. </p>

Dr ZK when asked about how frequently desaturations occurred and  responding to the suggestion that it was being overstated by the Trust replied that it did not really much matter if there were 2, 20 or 200 a week, it only needed 1 from which he could not be resuscitated to have the result that he would die.  I have heard ample evidence at this hearing from those looking after him of the continuing desaturations and I accept that evidence. I suspect, although I do not need to reach a firm conclusion about it, that the fact that he is nursed and looked after in so specialised a unit in which  episodes of desaturation and the response to them promptly and  before escalation, is so much  part and parcel of day to day life that it may have the effect that the extent is masked.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At Dr ZK&#8217;s direction the nurses were asked to record on paper episodes of desaturation and the steps needed to resolve it. The document was provided for this hearing being formally produced in evidence by senior nurse ZP. It is an interesting record. The mother says it shows that the desaturations are not as frequent as suggested. The witnesses for the Trust suggest that there is under recording: partly as intensive care units are busy providing the intensive care, partly as it is human error to overlook recording; and also because &#8211; in a reflection of what I heard from Professor ZL in another context there is a tendency to under record events. I treat that last with a little caution given the circumstances in which the lead consultant directed this document. The essential point about it for me at this hearing however is this:  Even were I to take what appears on that document as the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">only</span> instances of spontaneous desaturation  requiring interventions to recover Ayden &#8211; and I do not -  that alone would be sufficient to establish unequivocally that he continues to experience life threatening desaturations which i) require intervention to prevent his death and ii) mean he cannot be stepped down from ventilation in PICU.</p>

I could not easily understand reading that observation how it came to be made by so dedicated and committed a paediatrician whose anxiety to make things better for Ayden to improve his comfort, and whose worry that she and her team could not be sure whether he was in pain was palpable. It was a surprise to me that she had not  appeared  in writing at least to consider  for Ayden that the touch of his mother&#8217;s hand the sound of her  voice, the ways in which his family found to make his experience of  being a member of that family  a warm and loving one, as very real benefits to weigh against the all too apparent burdens. After hearing her oral evidence, I did not think she had simply dismissed or discounted them. Asked if she thought he took pleasure from being with his mother and having her proximate she did not instantly say yes but responded after a pause &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I really hope so&#8217;</span> . At the time I heard Dr ZK&#8217;s evidence I had yet to hear Ms Braqi&#8217;s. I was very forcibly struck by the resonance with what Dr ZK had written when I heard Ms Braqi give her unprompted view that in PICU &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">he is alive but at home he would be livin</span>g&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I came to the view that for Dr ZK the impossibility of knowing what he was feeling or appreciating was overwhelmingly worrying.  I was reinforced in this view by her answer to Mr Chisholm when he asked whether Ayden was intact as to cognition hearing and sight &#8211; she seemed almost startled that anyone would ask that and clearly took that for granted, and thus also that he could hear, see and feel his mother with him. Families, she told the court are at the centre of the way in which GOSH PICU operates &#8211; there is no concept of visiting time. It is &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a given&#8217; </span>that time with family is a benefit and an important one for all their patients and Ayden was no exception.  Ms ZN<span style="font-weight:bold"/>likewise in speaking of the difficulties of moving Ayden and the worry that it was something that caused him at least discomfort, perhaps pain, was clear that the benefit to him of being in his mother&#8217;s arms was very much prioritised. My impression of her evidence was that to the extent that it might cause him pain and or discomfort, that was warranted by the benefit to him of moving to his mother for what is called cuddle time. I do not in any sense weigh lightly in the balance the benefits to Ayden of that part of his life he spends with his mother, his siblings and his wider family. His life has inherent value to his family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I infer also, and I regard it on the evidence as an inference I can draw, that he will have an awareness that his mother does not do the things to him which are necessary to keep him alive but which cause him pain, but that she is a soothing presence  to him, when those interventions have been done and staff withdraw. Also that she does the more ordinary things like changing his nappy, brushing his hair away from his eyes wiping his face to cool it which make him more comfortable. In short it is more likely than not that his experience of being with his mother is associated with feeling  better. It is, I am satisfied, reasonable to conclude this, even though just as he cannot express pain, neither is he able to express pleasure.  I recognise that this is in contrast with the rest of his life in PICU which the lead consultant for him, who has worked for many years in the unit described starkly as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">pretty miserable&#8217;. </span> It is also relevant to my assessment of benefit that I am quite sure that Ayden knows that he is loved.  What I described earlier as a moment of tenderness captured in the video clip illustrates, I agree, the bond between mother and son. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Guardian, whose evidence I have not detailed but whose thoughtful and detailed report gave a vivid picture of Ayden, recounted in her report that at the time of her visit: <span style="font-style:italic">His bedside had silver and blue &#8216;happy birthday&#8217; banners and bunting up from his first birthday the week before. His mother explained they had a photographer come in, family and staff sang him happy birthday and that she brought a cake, with battery powered candles appropriate for the ward. The d&#233;cor and posters up around Ayden&#8217;s bedside reflect the love and care of his family. There are family photographs, drawings and cards from his brothers and sister, and art the family have made with the on-site play team, such as an Easter themed painting, with Ayden&#8217;s footprints in paint. He also had his birthday cards and a banner on display, including ones in Ayden&#8217;s eyeline on the ceiling, showing how attentive his mother is to what he can see and experience.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">I give very considerable weight to the preservation of life. It is a strong factor in favour of continuing the ventilation which Ayden needs to keep him alive. He has not had the time to develop his own religious beliefs but in thinking about the strong presumption in favour of the preservation of life, I hold in my mind the evidence to which I have alluded earlier that his mother is a woman of strong religious belief.  Had he lived at home with his brothers and sister he too would more likely than not be growing up within that faith. It is relevant that it is a Faith which has as a central tenet that life is God-given and sacred. Neither aspect means that the very powerful presumption is irrebuttable. </span></p>

I accept the evidence of those careful and dedicated medical professionals from whom I have heard that doing the best they can by reference to their experience of other children there are some things that they know must cause him pain. </span>Pain and discomfort are on occasion used almost interchangeably by the medical professionals from whom I heard. It was my impression having asked Ms ZN about it that more often what is described as discomfort might better be understood by the rest of us as pain, but on any view a good deal of what Ayden can reasonably be expected to be experiencing  as a result of what is necessary to keep him alive, is known objectively to be painful. The Trust does not suggest that Ayden is in pain all of the time &#8211; thought the case advanced includes a recognition that it could not be detected if he were. It does however submit, and I am satisfied on the evidence, that he is often, repeatedly and unavoidably in pain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I recognise that different patients have different pain thresholds and that there is no reason to think that that is any different for children. I am none the less satisfied that pain falls heavily to be considered as a burden. As I listened to the evidence of the sensations of drowning and suffocating being akin to what is experienced from secretions, suctioning and desaturations, I formed the view that alongside pain, and discomfort in the weighing of burdens, so too fear should take its place. The impossibility of identifying whether things are or are not causing a child pain was clearly something which strongly affected all those from whom I heard about it. </p>

Not only the pain to which I have just referred but the experience of what was described to me in evidence as a place that can often, despite the efforts to keep it calm, be noisy and frightening &#8211; alarms go off, crash teams rush in, day and night patients are resuscitated or patients die. All of this Ayden experiences. Sometimes his mother will be beside him and he will sense things are &#8216;OK&#8217; . Sometimes he will not. </p>

She told me that she agreed that he was sometimes in pain. I accept that in some respects she is likely to be better attuned to his cues.  I do not accept however all of her own conclusions about pain, most notably her belief that he sleeps through the suctioning procedures. I prefer on this the evidence of the clinicians rooted as it is in experience of other patients. Very sadly the fact that his mother sees no sign that he is in pain is, I have concluded, reflective of his inability to express it, even to those who know him very well. </span></p>

Assessment of those best interests embraces a wide welfare and social aspects of his life. Those are important and very significant aspects, and they are benefits which can displace in a determination of best interests the countervailing burdens in the analysis.</span></p>

The burdens of his underlying condition and the demands of the clinical treatments within the intensive care setting to keep him alive, drive me to the conclusion that it is not in his interests to continue to bear those burdens where I accept the unanimous view, supported by his guardian whose evidence I also accept, that there is no hope of meaningful recovery and an inevitable prospect of deterioration.</span></p>

Prolonging his life prolongs also for him the burden of bearing those benefits.  He has had and I have no doubt would continue to have the very best of care at GOSH. I have taken account of the views of his mother that he should continue to have that care and her strong wishes in respect of this application. I must however take an objective view of Ayden&#8217;s best interests from his own point of view and from the point of view, in the widest sense, of his welfare.</span></p>

In this case, it is not expected that Ayden will live longer than minutes following  extubation. I have been referred as set out above by those representing Ayden to the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re NR</span>.  The children for whom decisions have to be made by the courts in respect of life sustaining treatment are all individual children whose situations, whilst having a common thread of desperate sadness and tragedy in the proper sense of that word, are factually specific to them.  So whilst I realise that what happened in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re NR</span> may affect the hopes of Ayden&#8217;s Mother in this case, those circumstances do not affect the way in which I have reached a decision on best interests for Ayden. I have reached the decision on the evidence before me.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the conclusion of submissions I made known my intention to provide a written judgment in draft during the week of 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November with formal hand down by the end of that week.  I indicated that the draft should not be expected before the end of the day on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> . On the morning of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November, I received an update from the Trust that Ayden&#8217;s condition had unexpectedly deteriorated. He had developed a condition thought to be necrotising enterocolitis for which he was receiving treatment. Whilst no application was being made, the change in his condition was sufficiently marked that it was notified to all. Shortly after noon, my clerk received a further communication from the Trust&#8217;s solicitor to the effect that Ayden&#8217;s condition had now deteriorated to the point where an immediate and urgent application was made and a hearing requested in relation to ceilings of care. <span style="color:#000000">The e mail included the following &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Due to the quickly developing case, I have not been able to put the other parties on notice of this application</span><span style="color:#000000">.&#8217;  and copied in solicitors.</span> I directed that the parties should be given notice at once and indicated that I would hear Counsel as soon after 2pm as they could be present. By that time, I was able to provide the parties with a sufficiently finalised draft of this judgment and the decision I had reached on the declarations sought. For reasons it is unnecessary to detail here I made also declarations in relation to ceilings of care in the event of a further sudden deterioration. </p>
