They were born on 28 January 1984 and 22 March 1978 respectively.  They are not married and have now separated.  The local authority, Lancashire County Council made an application for a care order in respect of R on 18 August 2006 and R is represented in these proceedings by a children&#8217;s guardian, Mrs A-G.  The precipitating circumstances that led to the local authority&#8217;s application are not in dispute and are as follows.</span></p>

He was born by emergency caesarean section following a failed ventouse delivery.  He was subsequently noted to have developed neonatal jaundice together with some scalp swelling and a superficial laceration related to the attempted ventouse delivery.  R was described as being irritable and unsettled and was given oral paracetamol.   Mr G the Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist described him as making an &#8220;uneventful recovery&#8221;.  R is referred to as a well baby in his obstetric notes and was discharged home on 7 June 2006 with no requirement for follow up treatment.</span></p>

His parents took him for a walk in the afternoon and returned home at approximately 5:00pm.

Neither parent describes any arguments, displays of aggression or tension during the evening.  In the general context that R was &#8216;grouchy&#8217;, mother&#8217;s evidence up to the point where she left to go outside is not in issue and is as follows:  N had R in his bouncy chair in front of him and N was watching television and talking to R.

I tried his usual thing in his bouncy chair and it wouldn&#8217;t calm him down and I picked him up, had him in my usual position arm under him and then he was just crying a lot you know really hard as if he was in a lot of pain, and then he arched his back with his arms up&#8230;.. he just looked like he was in that much pain and erm&#8230;.

(N) was stood in the lounge doorway.  He looked worried and said something was wrong.  He was holding R with one hand supporting him in the back and one under his bottom.  R&#8217;s back was arched and his arms were in the air.  His head was back.  I ran to him and when I looked at R&#8217;s face it was greeny/grey in colour and his eyes were in slits&#8221;.

The court may have direct evidence of the primary fact and/or evidence of secondary facts which if found enable proper judicial inferences as to the existence of the primary fact to be made.  It is in the consideration of all of the circumstances and the way in which they inform each other that the judicial fact finding function is based.  Split fact finding hearings of necessity should be limited to discrete or serious issue cases where the proceedings can be expedited or delay contained by the separation of the key issues into separate hearings.  To do otherwise undermines the fact finding process by removing important contextual material from the court&#8217;s consideration.</span></p>

One of the reasons for that is that the absence of a reasonable standard of parental care need not imply that the parents are at fault: </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">Lancashire County Council v B</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt"> (supra) per Lord Nicholls at 162C.   Another is that all too frequently the court is unable to identify which of the child&#8217;s carers was responsible from the &#8220;fog of denials, evasions, lies and half truths&#8230;&#8221; (per Lord Nicholls at 165E to 166B).  The consequence is that parents who may be wholly innocent and whose care may not have fallen below that of a reasonable parent face the possibility of losing their child (Lord Nicholls at 166G).  No judge in this field of work can ever forget that dilemma. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">The corollary is that uncertain perpetration does not mean that the child concerned is not at risk.  It should not be forgotten that in these cases harm has been found to have occurred and the court has considered the scientific and observational evidence both as to how the harm was caused and if appropriate by whom.  There is often an inescapable interaction between the evidence as to cause and perpetration, the one informing the other by the questions which are raised.   Accordingly, where the court concludes that there is both harm and an uncertain perpetrator or perpetrators of that harm, it is able to proceed on the basis that each of the possible perpetrators is just that, a possible perpetrator.  This is necessary as a matter of legal policy to prevent a self defeating interpretation of the legislation.

Quite simply, it would be grotesque if such a case had to proceed at the welfare stage on the footing that, because neither parent considered individually, has been proved to be the perpetrator, therefore the child is not at risk from either of them.  This would be grotesque because it would mean the court would proceed on the footing that neither parent represents a risk even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of the harm in question.&#8221;</span></p>

A clear distinction is to be drawn between the relevance and admissibility of evidence which describes the harmful circumstances in which a child is being cared for and the same evidence when it is used to suggest that a person has a propensity to commit a particular act.  In other words, the evidence will be very relevant to harm or its likelihood in section 31(2) and the court&#8217;s assessment of risk in section 1(3)(e) of the 1989 Act but not necessarily to perpetration.  It may be forensically unwise for the court to attach much, if any, weight to this evidence if it is directed only to the question of propensity.

Nothing in what I have said above is designed to inhibit the local authority from putting in at the first stage factual evidence relating to the history of the case and the background of the parties, or relevant evidence of observation. Such evidence is usually necessary for a proper understanding of the case. Equally, the local authority will, as the case progresses, be carrying out a continuous assessment of the parents and their behaviour.&#8221;</span></p>

Where it is both practicable and in the interests of the child (having regard to the child protection imperative in each case) such assessments can and should be prepared pre-proceedings and in any event as soon as possible after the commencement of proceedings.  Having said with as much force as a court can that necessary child protection interventions must not be delayed by the completion of paperwork, no matter how necessary that paperwork may be to the recording of the basis for the decision, the availability of the evidence that is contained in such assessments is important to the working of inter-disciplinary child protection professionals groups acting in accordance with child protection procedures and to the court in determining child safety issues particularly at or around the commencement of proceedings.  The court will normally direct such an assessment where for whatever reason it has not been completed and regardless of whether a split hearing is being contemplated.  The necessarily provisional assessment of professionals who are awaiting the conclusion of the court as to the facts is a commonplace which does not prevent them disclosing in that assessment evidence about the &#8220;width of the range of (relevant) facts&#8221; referred to by Lord Nicholls in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">Re H</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt"> (supra) at 591E&#8211;G.</span></p>

To assert otherwise is to provide an intellectually flawed lifeboat for poor practice which is not in the interests of children.  To leave a child in danger is just as unacceptable as to remove that child from home without good reason.  Timely and informed decision making are the essence of the system.  Child protection demands sufficient resources for speedy enquiry </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt">and</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:10pt"> inter-disciplinary disclosure of information and co-operation such that the relevant agency with a statutory duty can assess and act.  Where that agency is a local authority with responsibility for children&#8217;s services the decision will be that of social work practitioners who will base their decision on a social care assessment informed by other specialist assessments where appropriate.  Furthermore, the key social worker or team leader can expect to be tested on that assessment and the decision in court.  To assert that a local authority can delay or in any sense hide behind the need to produce the paperwork records of their assessments and decisions before they take a necessary child protection step and/or apply to the court is not only dangerous but wrong.  If it is happening it must stop. Fortunately for R, in this case the professionals acted together and appropriately.  Having said which, the reason for this digression is that there was obvious surprise when I intimated that the key social worker should give evidence in this case.  Even where a social worker relies on medical opinion it is he or she not the doctors who has the responsibility to make the decision which, if challenged, needs to be explained so that the court might decide whether it was appropriate in all the circumstances.</span></p>

In my judgement, none of the medical experts failed to consider the research data and in each case their opinions were both reasonable and within a range of opinion held by a respectable body of clinicians in their specialist field having regard to the research data that exists.

In deference to the previous case management difficulties which there had been, I did not direct the parties against their will.  With the benefit of hindsight and now that I have had the opportunity to assess mother and father I am firmly of the view that it was appropriate for them to give evidence first and that to have done so would have been far better in the context of being able to direct questions to the forensic experts based upon what they were actually rather than theoretically saying to the court.

He would hold his child like a china doll.  He was careless rather than careful.  He did not have the experience to know how to care for a child and gave all the impression that he gained no experience and rather lived with a feeling of rising panic.  He even demonstrated a sense of panic in his recollections of his care of R.  He conceded his rough handling.  He conceded that he caused accidental bruising to R and he gave two different and elaborate accounts of how he came to injure R on 11 August 2006.</span></p>

It remains concerning that having separated from father and with no apparent intention to reconcile with him she should choose to make patently false allegations.  I have come to the conclusion that she did so because she believed she was saying what others wanted to hear rather than to cover up her own failings i.e. knowing that she had not injured R on 11 August 2006 she elaborated her story to ingratiate herself with the local authority and others rather than to deflect blame on to father for her own acts and omissions.  This is consistent with her general approach to evidence and her re-telling of the history of this case.</span></p>

Mother thought father handled R roughly but as I have concluded this was not unusual and is not to be taken on its own to be indicative of deliberation but rather inexperience, fear and a pre-occupation with his own needs or wishes.  I accept that mother was limited in her mobility by the effects of the caesarean section and that she was in fact dependent upon father to hand her R.  I have also come to the conclusion that as time went on she played on her wish for support and she enjoyed challenging father as part of her controlling nature.  Father was meanwhile pre-occupied with his own attempt, futile in the event, to calm the child.  He passed R round the corner of the bed and turned awkwardly with the consequence that R landed roughly on the bed. On this occasion he was no more than careless. Mother&#8217;s exaggeration of the whole incident after the event is summarised by her description of her distress which on the basis of her oral evidence I do not accept and her comment to the police that she felt she needed to &#8220;get R out of it&#8221;.

In my judgement to have caused a bruise on R&#8217;s bony prominence by the mechanism described that became obviously blue / turquoise would have necessitated a knock against R&#8217;s face equivalent to hitting a hard surface.  I do not disbelieve father but I have no doubt that he must have been sufficiently rough as to have been reckless.

I do not accept the invitation to try and age the bruising from photographs: a notoriously unreliable practice, but I do accept that it is unlikely that the bruise which was then described by father as a black eye was caused on the same day that it was first seen by the paternal grandparents. It is only mother who says this and both grandparents disagree with her.  Yet again she tailored her evidence, but on this occasion I am clear that she did so to hide the fact that she had known of the bruise for a day or perhaps two and had not questioned its existence or brought it to anyone&#8217;s attention. </span></p>

Father says that the mechanism of accidental injury was the same.  Father repeatedly tried to explain to the court his slightly unorthodox methods of holding R away from and facing himself like a rugby ball.  I came to the conclusion that he had never handled a rugby ball but rather more importantly that he had no confidence in holding R and that this together with his rough style of handling, which was conceded, predisposed R to injury.  If the first eye injury was reckless and the second careless it speaks volumes about father&#8217;s insight into the quality of care he provided. Again the court&#8217;s judgement about this mark accords with the opinion expressed by Dr Smith.  Father did not appear to have gained any experience as he went along.</span></p>

Father says that he does not know how it was caused but speculated that it might have been the car seat buckle.  It appeared to be more than a temporary skin crease caused by clothing.  None of the evidence was convincing and I have to conclude that the cause of the mark is unknown.  Yet again mother&#8217;s protective response was equivocal. </span></p>

The mother said to the police in interview that she had had &#8220;her suspicions&#8221; about the causation of the injuries.  I do not doubt that this was correct but she did nothing about it at the time.  She did not display any overt protective mechanisms.  It is all the more concerning that mother did not take the opportunity to mention her suspicions or relationship difficulties with the health visitor or the general practitioner at the time, particularly as (a) they knew of the background of domestic abuse and mother knew that they knew and (b) there were occasions when she was on her own with professionals when she could have done so.  They had given her specific advice about what to do, but she did not follow it.  Mother went so far as to tell the health visitor on 25 July 2006 that &#8220;things were OK&#8221; and that her relationship problems were in the past when this was not true.</span></p>

Whereas there is nothing known (or rather nothing made known to the court) which demonstrates why a birth related SDH is any more or less likely to develop into an chronic SDH than an acute SDH of any other aetiology, the appearance of this chronic SDH is such that it is unlikely to have developed from a birth SDH. </span></p>

The other experts did not support such a comparison, commenting on the different structures and vulnerabilities of the skull and brain as between neonates and the elderly.

This was the most positive expression of that possibility.  Over time Mr May came to regard the hypothesis as theoretical and unlikely.  The balance of opinion otherwise expressed ranged from &#8220;very, very unlikely&#8221; (Dr Stoodley), and &#8220;highly unlikely&#8221; (Mr Richards) to &#8220;extremely unlikely&#8221; (Dr Chapman).  </span></p>

They were of the opinion that the time-frame for the breakdown of the SDH would be two to three weeks following the causative event.  As the plates of the child&#8217;s skull are only loosely connected at this young age, the sutures allow for expansion of the head circumference, although some modest ventricular compression is possible.  If a causative event occurred shortly before 7 July, then the head swelling would begin at the end of July and the presentation observed would be within the &#8216;radiological dating&#8217; predicted by Dr Chapman.</span></p>

They both concede rough handling and father conceded accidental bruising.  I do not believe that the incident where father dropped R in the bath through the careless use of baby oil is likely to be the causative event.  Although theoretically possible as a causative event, the dating of the incident is only two to three weeks after birth and according to the experts advice that would be too early by two weeks.  I accept that there is a fine dividing line as between an unknown cause and an established cause which was not and is not known to either or both of the parents where an event of this nature does not lead to florid symptoms.  There is nothing which indicates that mother was ever reckless in her physical care of R whereas there is in relation to father.  However, as respects this event there is insufficient evidence to conclude that father&#8217;s care was deliberately harmful.</span></p>

There is no doubt in my mind that the reckless handling was rough and beyond that which was acceptable.  Having regard to the suspicions mother expressed but did not act upon (which did not include this event), I do not think mother observed the event which caused the first SDH and is not to be held responsible for a specific failure to protect in respect of this incident although I do think she exhibited a general failure to protect as set out earlier in judgment. </span></p>

It is helpful in putting into context the discussions which did occur about  &#8216;lesser degrees of force&#8217; which might have been appropriate to cause a fresh acute bleed at the site of a chronic SDH.  As Dr. Stoodley confirmed, the distribution of the bleeding assists in understanding the causation.
