The applicant was surprisingly vague about the detail, bearing in mind this was an important part of his case. According to his oral evidence, following the applicant&#8217;s first meeting with X in the spring of 2009 at the maternal grandparents home in country C until December 2010/January 2011 they met on three further occasions during relatively short visits to country C lasting one or two weeks (one 3 &#8211; 4 months after the first visit in 2009, over Christmas/New Year 2009/2010 and at least one occasion in 2010). The next time the Applicant saw X was</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">around the time she started at the school in country B. The applicant stayed in his home in country B for about a week to settle her in. Thereafter, during each school holiday X either stayed with a teacher in country B or returned to the maternal grandparents in country C, save for possibly Easter 2011 when the Applicant said he stayed with her for a week at his home in country B, followed by possibly a short period in the summer 2011, again in country B.  X went to the country A at Christmas 2011/New Year 2012. This was her first trip there.  In 2012 the only occasion the applicant could specifically remember was a trip in October 2012 with X and her mother. X spent all the 2012 summer holidays in country C and he thought during the 2012 Easter holidays they may have spent some time staying in country B.  The shorter half term holidays were generally spent by X staying with a teacher in country B. He emphasised that the mother had only limited holiday time from her job, which curtailed her opportunities to visit her daughter.  He said X had not come to country A any other times as both he and X&#8217;s mother work full time, so she would have spent a lot of time on her own. X has not been to the UK. She did not accompany the applicant on his recent trips back to the UK. One occasion was for the wedding of his adopted daughter from his previous marriage. He said it would have been insensitive to have brought her with him. The second time he came back here clashed with her exams.</span></p>

He attached to his statement some copies of the email exchanges between them. They are affectionate and familiar in tone. There is a letter from X&#8217;s school dated 20 February 2012 which confirms that the applicant makes all financial arrangements and all matters regarding X&#8217;s travel and medical matters are through the applicant.

It is equally applicable to the adoption of a child of school age or a young man or woman of 20. To suppose that the legislature could have intended that no order could be made in any case in which the infant in question had within the past three months attended a school would be foolish, although, while at school, the child would be subject to the discipline of the school and would be more literally in the care of the school authorities than of the prospective adopter. It would be equally unreasonable to suppose that an applicant would be prevented from obtaining an order if he or she had on any occasion in the past three months left the child for a short time in the care of a servant, relation or neighbour or if the infant had paid a short visit to a friend. It would no doubt be unwise to attempt to define what is meant by the words "continuously the care and possession of the applicant" in this section and I shall make no such attempt&#8221;. </span></p>

The reality is the applicant and X have spent very little physical time together, either in country C or country B since 2009. At most there have been three or four relatively short periods in country C and the same at the property in country B, with one trip to country A (contrary to what is set out in the applicant&#8217;s statement). She has not been to this jurisdiction with the applicant. The evidence in relation to the six months preceding the application in October 2012 is that they did not spend any physical time with each other, save for possibly a short stay in the property in country B in April 2012. The applicant&#8217;s oral evidence was clear in relation to the summer holidays in 2012; X spent her whole time in country C with the maternal family. </span></p>

In his third statement the applicant proposes spending 4 weeks during the summer holidays in 2013 with X at his property in the area of the Local Authority.  These proposals were adjusted in his oral evidence to effectively be the summer holidays in 2013 and then the major holidays thereafter (Christmas, April and Summer 2014). Due to the fact X&#8217;s mother had very recently changed her job she was going to be unlikely to be able to spend more than a week in this jurisdiction with them until after April 2014. The applicant, in his oral evidence, was not even certain about that. The Local Authority does not consider this will give them sufficient opportunity for them to see X and the applicant in the home environment. The written evidence from the social worker, who has responsibility for this case, indicates that the time proposed of 3 &#8211; 4 weeks in the summer is not sufficient to undertake the assessment. He said such assessments generally take 6 weeks and time can be extended in more complex matters. He set out at paragraph 2.2 the enquiries he would expect to undertake, including meeting the mother.</span></p>

The evidence, in my judgment, establishes (contrary to the position set out in the applicant&#8217;s statements that each long school holiday since January 2011 had been spent with the applicant) that prior to October 2012 the applicant has spent only very limited physical time with X.  Even adopting a wide lens, as Ms Cronin invited me to do, at most it has consisted a three or four relatively short periods spent in country C (two in 2009 and Christmas 2009/2010 and one occasion in 2010), four relatively short periods spent in the applicant&#8217;s home in country B  (the first in January 2011 was to be on hand for a week or so when J started school, followed by a week or so Easter and Summer 2011 and possibly Easter 2012), one period in country A (Christmas 2011). In the context of the six month period prior to October 2012 it consists, at most, of possibly a week or so in country B, but the applicant&#8217;s oral evidence on this was somewhat vague. He thought he &#8216;may&#8217; have spent some of the Easter holidays in 2012 with X in country B. So the factual position is that in the six months prior to this application X had, at most, spent only a week or so with the applicant in any home.</span></p>

It is difficult to see how that gateway requirement has been met on the facts of this case.</span></p>

I take that to mean not limiting the analysis to the six months, but to look at the modus operandi of the family outside that time period to inform the picture within the six month time frame. That, in my judgment, does not assist as the picture on the evidence is of intermittent times being spent together in different locations, the longest being no more than two weeks. It was revealing when asked where he thought X would think her home is, the applicant replied country B, more specifically her boarding school.</span></p>
