At the outset I had very helpful Position Statements and Case Summary from the parties.  Throughout the hearing they have kept their questioning of the witnesses to those matters only that would assist the Court and treated all witnesses in matters which included the utmost sensitivity in a dignified and compassionate way.

The Specialist Unit is undertaking work with the whole family, the Children and the parents.

It may cover the structures and drivers of the Children&#8217;s behaviours, what protective factors may be able to be put in place and indicators of why and in what circumstances that risk would be heightened.</p>

This was not a Social Worker who came to make excuses or offer platitudes: she came to help the Court with understanding the Care Planning for the Children. </p>

That had found its way into minutes and been repeated.  It is one of those occasions when something is said and then picked up as a fact or &#8216;concern&#8217;.  I make it clear, there is not a drop of evidence that would seek to point to anything in the way of coercive or controlling behaviour in the relationship between G and H.  There is no evidence of such and so I am satisfied that there are no issues whatsoever in relation to domestic abuse of any kind, or evidence to support such a concern, in the relationship.  There is no evidence, no &#8216;smoke&#8217;, no hint.  There is no domestic abuse between them.</p>

Well, in answers to questions of the Guardian in relation to the father&#8217;s future Criminal trial, the Psychologist said that &#8220;in terms of therapy that would be continuing beyond [then], definitely beyond that.

	    <p class="2Paragraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Proceedings, also, will have been painfully slow for them.  At times in cross-examination by the Local Authority, H clearly felt that the Local Authority were challenging her personally, and &#8216;twisting&#8217; her words.  H was defensive at times in her evidence.  Given her experiences, from her perspective, and the questioning she had to deal with in cross-examination, it is perhaps of no surprise.  The sadness is that the process of Court proceedings is adversarial and seems almost designed to pitch parties against each other &#8211; it does not lend itself to an inquisitorial approach.</p>

H had said at one time that she was always supervising the Children with A&#8217;s door open.  That was similar to what was recorded in the Foster Care log.  In evidence, though, we were told (and it may have been for the first time as I understand) that G had been in the bedroom throughout and H had joined 10 minutes or so into the film.</p>

That was the first time anyone knew that B had a social media account.  It transpires that A has too but no-one knew.  Again, whilst raised by the Guardian, this was not a criticism of the Guardian towards G and H but rather a paradigm example of the vigilance, above and beyond what many carers have to do, that A and B needed.  Again, &#8216;things&#8217; that are not &#8216;things&#8217; in the vast majority of households have the capacity to become harmful with these Children.  The worry, in particular, for the Guardian in this case is that that Social Media platform may become a pathway that might lead to grooming by strangers or private communication between the Children.</p>

They, as other witnesses before them, had asked about the level of contact between the Father and the Children.  The Mother is to have, effectively, monthly contact with the children as an overview, the Father six weekly to tie in, broadly, with school holidays.  The Guardian considered that there were so many children and the arrangements would take considerable time out of each of the Children&#8217;s regular arrangements that the levels of contact proposed were in the Children&#8217;s best interests together and for each of them.  The Father had much to deal with in the forthcoming months, including any work recommended by the Unit (as has the Mother of course) but also has his criminal trial to face.  Video contact should be allowed to continue with the Mother (and that is accepted by the Local Authority until further decisions at future review meetings) and it may be possible with the Father.  But the Guardian&#8217;s view in relation to contact was aligned with the other professional witnesses asked about it, namely four weekly for the Mother and six-weekly for the Father.</p>

Any delay in decision-making by the Court would therefore be without any indication of when the Court will be in a better decision to make Orders (save that therapy is likely to take us past the current date trial date in the Criminal Proceedings).

	    <p class="2Paragraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I have no doubt that G and H can offer either A or B first-class care.  And, when the risks are better understood and therapy undertaken, there may very well, and we all hope, there will come a time when A and B can live together.  The difficulty is that with the risk of harm, and the effect of that risk happening being so enormous, no-one is able to manage those risks and consequences if they happened: that is not a criticism of G and H &#8211; to the contrary.  There are few who could provide the care to A that they have.  It is just that the risks of them A and B being together are too large, the consequences of the risk happening so mighty, that the benefits of the two being together, at this time, are not demonstrably ample enough to outweigh those risks.  I have no sufficient evidence that enables me being able to envisage any person or family being able manage them. </p>

	    <p class="2Paragraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I have struggled with this.  But I agree with G and H that the orders should be the same for A and B for now.  Not being able to know now that B will join them, I cannot, having regards to the Welfare of B, make an SGO in her favour.  An SGO for A would give parental responsibility for A to G and H, but that would provide different orders for A and B. That is not determinative, but the support the whole family needs will need to be undertaken with the Local Authority who will be providing the most intensive of packages of support.  And for that they will need to share parental responsibility.  I do take note of paragraphs 50 and 51 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re F &amp; G (Discharge of Special Guardianship Order) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/622" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 622" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCA Civ 622</ref><span style="font-style:italic"/>and consider that, as set out in that judgment, that the correct order is the making of the Care Order now with the expectation in the future of there being an SGO for A and, we would all hope, for B.</p>

Accordingly, I am satisfied that the infringement of the parties&#8217; and children&#8217;s rights under, in particular, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights is both necessary and proportionate.</p>
