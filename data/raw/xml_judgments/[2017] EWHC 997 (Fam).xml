It was agreed from the outset of the hearing that I would not determine these Human Rights Act claims at this stage of the proceedings, primarily because there was insufficient court time and it was, properly, the view of all that I must first determine fundamental welfare issues in relation to A.  Moreover, and in any event, the court will not yet be in a position to determine what, if any, loss A has suffered.  I make clear from the outset, however, that I find the local authority to have been in egregious breach of its duties towards the mother, the father and A and I am completely satisfied that many (if not all) of the pleaded claims against the local authority or breaches of article 6 (right to a fair hearing) and article 8 (right to family life) are made out.  Only speculation, which is of course always to be avoided, could fuel consideration of what orders the court might have made had proper and timely steps been taken by this local authority in relation to A&#8217;s welfare.</span></p>

His mother is M, who lives in Northamptonshire, as does his grandmother.  The grandmother has lived with SG since 2011 who, although not a blood relative to A, is in effect his maternal grandfather.

What is agreed is that this uncertainty must now end.  A was placed into the care of his grandmother and SG at the end of August 2013 and yet the local authority did not issue care proceedings until mid-February 2016.  In the intervening period, some nine or ten different social workers have been involved in this case.  The circumstances in which A came to be placed with the grandmother are troubling.  Whilst this court has nothing but praise for the grandmother and SG for the care that they have provided to A, the fact is that the legality of the placement is in serious doubt.  A had no independent reviewing officer between August 2013 and January 2014, even though he was a Looked After Child.  The local authority took a major role in making arrangements for A to be moved to his grandmother and it seems certain that it was exercising its powers and duties as a public authority, and in this regard I have been referred to the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">London Borough of Southwark v D</span><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 2181" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 2181</ref>.  Indeed, in the local authority&#8217;s initial statement it was actually admitted and averred that they placed A with the maternal grandparents as carers.</span></p>

The health visitor felt that the mother was too trusting of the men that she was meeting on social media to the extent that she was inviting them home and allowing them to have contact with A, without being assessed.  A was only nine weeks old when these  concerns were first raised with social care.  Furthermore, the health visitor felt that although the mother was A&#8217;s sole carer, she was only managing this with a lot of support from her parents (by which I think we should take to mean her mother and SG).  The mother was provided with support via a common assessment framework where she was referred to various agencies for support around her parenting and lifestyle choices.  It was said at the time that she did not engage with the support offered such as Home Start and nor did she attend team family meetings.  Given where we now are, there is limited merit in analysing these historical issues which the local authority has not pursued at this hearing.</span></p>

It had been her expectation that she was unable to conceive, and she described the knowledge that she was pregnant as a shock, but a very happy one.  However, after A was born the mother suffered from what she described as a low mood and anxiety.  The mother was haunted by memories and trauma of the abuse which she had suffered and she described with great emotion how A was so precious to her that sometimes she simply could not comprehend how she could possibly protect him.  The mother does not deny that she agreed on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'CG Times'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt"> August 2013 that A could stay for a short while with the grandmother.  She knew that A would be safe and secure with her mother but at the same time she felt that her mother was constantly judging her.  However, there is nothing in the papers before me to suggest that there was a risk of harm on that day.  Threshold has to be considered on the day when the protective measures were instigated, in other words 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'CG Times'">th</span><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt"> August 2013.  From the mother&#8217;s perspective, leaving her son in the secure environment on her mother&#8217;s home suddenly became a placement and she felt unable to challenge it, unaware as she was that the local authority had specific duties, which it signally disregarded (and was to continue to disregard for some time still to come).  There is no doubt that at some point shortly after A went to the maternal grandmother the mother made her opposition clear.  She was unable to secure Legal Aid because there were no public law proceedings, yet the local authority behaved as if there were.</span></p>

It is common ground among all parties that what governs the court&#8217;s decision is the &#8216;paramountcy&#8217; principle, in other words how is A&#8217;s welfare best served?  Since the inception of the section 20 arrangement the local authority had declared a stated intention to work towards rehabilitation to the mother, although in reality this was not actively pursued.  Happily, A continued to have substantial contact with the mother.  At a Looked After Child review on 8</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt;font-family:'CG Times'">th</span><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt"> July 2014 it was noted that the mother had made progress, including completing cognitive behavioural therapy, attending a parenting programme, taking up unsupervised contact, an improvement in home conditions and management of debt.  The local authority noted, however, that by the end of 2014 &#8220;substantial difficulties had resurfaced&#8221;.  These are said to have included financial mismanagement.  I note that the mother is currently expected to manage on &#163;130 per fortnight (with deductions being made for, I think, arrears of council tax and other debt) and, as I observed to Mr Horrocks during the proceedings, counsel for the local authority, while he was seeking to criticise the mother for financial mismanagement, it would be hard to see who would not find managing on such a sum almost impossible.  In any event, as I have said above, there were no proceedings and the &#8220;placement&#8221; with maternal grandmother was only valid for as long as the mother consented to it.</span></p>

There was some suggestion that A had fallen and sustained injuries whilst in the mother&#8217;s care which was stated to be the result of inadequate supervision while she was using her mobile telephone.  Once again, this issue has not been explored at this hearing and I have not been asked to make findings.  Whilst I note some of the headline criticisms of the mother as an essential part of the history of this case, I make it clear that, in the absence of findings, allegations are not made out.  The burden of proof is on the local authority.  If an allegation is ultimately not pursued then as a matter of record the allegation is not established and the fact alleged did not happen.  The standard of proof is, of course, at all times the balance of probabilities.</span></p>

Yet the local authority failed to provide any of the recommended support, such as multi agency support, appropriate planning and collaboration between agencies.   Astonishingly, the chair of the LAC review wrote a report only a month after this assessment and made no reference at all to the recommendations.

She was quick in her praise of the mother and said that there were lots of positives about her, in particular, she volunteered that the mother had benefited much from the Freedom Project.  She said that it was evident that the mother had taken on board much of the learning from the programme and that she was able to understand the differences between her many difficult and abusive past relationships and her current and more stable relationship.  The most notable part of her evidence, however, was in respect of boundaries.  Ms Clark noted that A has been living between three adults (the grandmother, the mother and the father) who were all different in their approach to parenting.  She expressed real concern that A needs consistency or he will feel unsafe and she said like most children he will be used to a particular style of parenting.  He needs to be able to trust what the adult is saying. He finds his mother unpredictable.  Whether she can move on and put into practice she said would be hard to answer.  When asked about her reaction to placing A into the sole care of his mother, she said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can put a timescale on it, it will be taking a huge risk to move him from the place where he is flourishing and settled, to a placement with his mother which is not yet good enough.  He needs to know what his future holds.  This should not be put off indefinitely.&#8221;  She stressed the need for long-term stability and expressed her very strong view that A is more stable with the maternal grandparents.  Regarding Mr B, Ms Clark said that he saw himself as a playmate for A, he did not see himself as a father figure.  Furthermore, she observed that the mother seems to change her view and that there are queries at times as to what part Mr B would  play.</span></p>

The mother finds, for example, that she is being criticised for turning to her own mother for help.  What young mother, I ask, would not from time to time turn to her own mother if she could for help with parenting skills?  It is an extraordinary tribute, in my judgment, to both mother and grandmother in this case that they have been able to remain not only on very friendly terms but quite exceptionally close and supportive of each other, yet at the same time be on the opposite sides of contested proceedings.  When the mother tried to turn to her own mother for help, she found that she was being criticised and that her every move was being watched.  I noticed in this court that, even as I gave my decision and set out a brief summary of my reasons on that Friday afternoon, the mother turned to her own mother for comfort and they hugged each other as the tears flowed.</span></p>

Mr B, it seems to me, is in a quite different category and I can well understand why the mother may have obfuscated as to the extent to which she wanted to admit that he was an important and maybe permanent part of her life.  I was asked to agree to let him come into court to support the mother on the day when she was giving evidence.  Although I did not hear any evidence from Mr B I was able to observe the sensitive way which he seemed to be able to understand the mother&#8217;s needs and emotions and to help to calm her and to look after.  I have no reason to believe that their relationship is anything other than one of commitment and that they offer each other mutual support.</span></p>

She admitted that it is clearly a massive disadvantage to the mother that she has not had A in her care for some years.  It was in many respects, in my judgment, unfair to compare the mother&#8217;s care of A with that which her own mother could provide.  Her own mother is an experienced parent and grandparent whereas the mother has had her own ability to experience parenting taken away from her for many years.</span></p>

I have already commented on the volume of social workers in this case and the adverse effect that this must have had upon the mother and A as well.  The court has been extremely lucky, however, to have had the evidence of Jennifer Millington who is the social worker that was appointed following the May 2016 hearing.  As I observed during the course of the hearing, it is extremely rare in these cases for the allocated social worker to have the trust and support of every party.  At least one good consequence of the dreadful catalogue of failures by the local authority is that from June 2016 onwards, when Ms Millington started work on case, A and his mother have been well served by a truly excellent social worker.</span></p>

She was ready and willing to criticise the actions of many of the social workers who had previously been allocated to this case.  This included a remarkable moment when it was disclosed that one of the earlier social workers openly discussed A&#8217;s wishes and feelings about his various family members in front of those very family members.  There was one occasion, I was told, when the social worker asked A to draw a picture showing which family members were within and which were without a particular circle, all of this in the presence of the very family members being discussed.  As this social worker was not in court to defend or comment upon what was being said of her, I have decided that it would be inappropriate to name her in this Judgment, although her identity is clear from the evidence and was discussed in this court.  Ms Millington apologised for the fact that many of the various recommendations made over the months and years had not been followed.  She paid many tributes to the way that the mother has endeavoured to and largely succeeded in improving herself.  Examples, which I have already given, were undergoing the cognitive behavioural therapy and Freedom Programme. She acknowledged that the mother has &#8220;sorted her home, got her finances straight, developed a social regime and appropriately cared for A for some of the time&#8221;.   She recognised that the mother&#8217;s finances are extremely tight.  She sensitively and tactfully dealt with criticisms of the mother, referred to by me above, but, as with Ms Clark, the overwhelming impression I had was that it would be a risk to move A out of the care of the grandmother.</span></p>

The father told me that he had changed his mind in relation to the special guardianship order, and it was evident that the father was supportive of the local authority and the Guardian&#8217;s position in this regard.

In ultimately determining disputes about residence and contact, there can be no dilution of its importance by reference to extraneous matters such as whether one placement was with a natural parent and one with a grandparent.  Lord Kerr said, at paragraph 37:</span></p>

This is the paramount consideration.  It is only as a contributor to the child&#8217;s welfare that parenthood assumes any significance. In common with all other factors bearing on what is in the best interests of the child, it must be examined for its potential to fulfil that aim.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">In my judgment, the mother justifiably complains that &#8220;this is a woeful tale cataloguing a chronic lack of proactive social work for the child to be reunited with mother&#8221;.  (That is a quote taken from the mother&#8217;s own counsel&#8217;s position statement.)  One of the most poignant moments in this case, in my judgment, came during the cross-examination of the mother by counsel for the Guardian, when the mother said: &#8220;Every day I was frightened that they might stop me seeing A, I was always under scrutiny.  I wanted the world, I had lost all that time.  It was anxiety from being assessed and it was making up for lost time.  It was like there was a Big Brother camera on me.  I always felt that I had be the perfect mum, not just a good enough mum.  I feel like I've failed.&#8221;  Then, at the conclusion of her cross examination, she said that she would think about the possibility of A going live with her mother.  It seemed to me that, in her heart, the mother knows that A&#8217;s best interests are served by his remaining with her mother and SG.  This poor mother, who suffered so much, as a very young child, is now the victim of a catalogue of failures by a local authority.  It is impossible for me to know how these difficulties might have been resolved had they been addressed in good time.  However, it is completely clear to me that A&#8217;s welfare lies with remaining with the maternal grandparents and that any other course would pose an unacceptable risk.  This finding is based on all of the information that I have set out above and, in particular, based on the analysis presented to the court so effectively by Ms Millington and Ms Clark.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">Mercifully, the parties are largely in agreement in respect of contact.  I invited the parties&#8217; respective advocates to try and agree a schedule of contact on the basis of the various orders that I might have made. Moreover, the maternal grandmother made it clear that she would operate what she referred to as an &#8220;open door policy&#8221; so far as the mother (and I think the father) is concerned.  In other words, the mother can visit A at the grandmother&#8217;s home as often as she may reasonably wish.  (I understand that she lives a short driving time away from her mother.  The father, of course, lives much further away.)  It is agreed that A should spend either a Saturday or a Sunday with his father one weekend a month.  It is agreed in respect of the school holidays that A should spend Monday to Thursday in respect of his half terms alternately with the mother and with the father.  It  is agreed that A should spend four days each Easter holidays respectively with his mother and his father; and finally, four days each Christmas holidays respectively with his mother and his father.  It is agreed that A spend Christmas this year (2017) with his father.  It is agreed that A should spend one week of the summer holidays with each of his mother and his father, with balance of the long school summer holidays reverting to term-time contact thereafter.  The only issue between the parties, so far as I can tell now, relates to the frequency of the mother&#8217;s weekend contact.  The strong view of the Guardian and the social workers to whom I have referred, is that A should have staying contact with his mother one weekend in four.  The mother&#8217;s preference is to have staying contact each alternate weekend.</span></p>

However, in the view of the professionals involved A needs a weekend off at what is to be his home.  I have no hesitation in agreeing with what has been said to me by the professionals in this regard, which is also supported by the maternal grandmother.  I have no doubt that, in accordance with the grandmother&#8217;s clear and helpful statement that she would operate an open door policy, the mother will be able to visit A on the intervening weekend.  Furthermore, in due course, it is possible that the arrangements may be altered.  For the time being, however, my order is that contact with the mother will be one weekend in four, subject, as I have said, to any further agreements or submissions.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times';font-size:14pt">The local authority ask me to make a special guardianship order in favour of the maternal grandparents.  This application is supported by the maternal grandparents, the father and the Guardian.  It is opposed by the mother.  In considering the application, I have regard to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 14</ref>A to 14F of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  I am in no doubt at all that I must make a special guardianship order in this case.  It gives parental responsibility to the maternal grandparents.  It means that ongoing professional support will continue.  It has an added advantage of extra funds for the maternal grandparents, although that factor does not guide my decision.  Crucially, it also recognises the central role of the maternal grandparents.  As the Guardian so effectively put it in her oral evidence: &#8220;It means that the grandmother can make a decision rather than negotiate and go round in circles&#8221;.</span></p>

Whatever failures this local authority may be guilty of in the past, I make clear that, in Mr Horrocks, they have been represented at the best possible level, and I have said that already in relation to Ms Millington.  So with the expertise that they now have they should take steps to make amends in so far as they can.  There is plenty of reported authority about damages in these cases that the lawyers will have access to.  I am going to reserve this case to myself and fix a date when I shall deal with the issue if it cannot be agreed.  I shall hear submissions as to the appropriate time estimate and the period of reflection needed to enable sensible negotiations to be undertaken, perhaps with the benefit of an experienced mediator or lawyer familiar with these types of cases.</span></p>
