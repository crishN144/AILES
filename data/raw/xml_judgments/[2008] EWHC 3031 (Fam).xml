Both served a Schedule of Deficiencies. The husband replied to the wife&#8217;s Schedule on 23 November 2007; the wife to the husband&#8217;s on 11 January 2008, at the same time as the husband replied to the wife&#8217;s Schedule of Continuing Deficiencies. In the meantime, two things had happened. On 31 August 2007 the District Judge made an order, by agreement of the parties, for the sale of the former matrimonial home. That order has never been implemented. And on 30 October 2007, the wife had applied for maintenance pending suit. </p>

One, purportedly dated 2 September 1998, was an agreement expressed to be between, and signed by, the husband and the mother-in-law for the loan (&#8220;I &#8230; lend you&#8221;) of &#163;30,000 by the mother-in-law to the husband &#8220;so that you can purchase [the matrimonial home]&#8221;.

In all the husband claims to have lent &#163;517,532 to the father-in-law.

In reply to a question requiring the husband to state the extent of his interest in a property known as The Orchard, his only answer was that he had no interest in the property. In reply to a question referring to the wife&#8217;s belief that the husband might be involved in a deal relating to another piece of land, and which required the husband to &#8220;provide full details and supporting evidence of any other property transaction with which he is connected in any way&#8221;, his only answer was &#8220;the husband has no interest in this property&#8221; &#8211; which was not, of course, an answer to the question at all. </p>

On 11 December 2007 the District Judge made three orders: first, she ordered the father-in-law to attend an inspection appointment on 28 December 2007; second, she ordered the husband to respond by 8 January 2008 to the wife&#8217;s Schedule of Continuing Deficiencies; third, she adjourned the wife&#8217;s application for maintenance pending suit, the parties having agreed (as recited in the order) that the whole of the monies (including interest) repaid by the father-in-law to the husband was to be held on joint deposit in the names of the parties&#8217; solicitors.</p>

The order further recited the parties&#8217; agreement that there should be paid out of the monies in the joint account (i) &#163;53,856.97 to the wife&#8217;s solicitors and &#163;48,048.40 to the husband&#8217;s solicitors in respect of their respective costs, (ii) monthly thereafter (a) &#163;2,500 to each party&#8217;s solicitor on account of future costs, (b) &#163;2,500 to each of the parties in respect of their maintenance and (c) &#163;500 to the wife in respect of the children&#8217;s maintenance, and (iii) as and when they fell due (a) the outgoings (including the mortgage payments) on the matrimonial home and (b) the school fees and &#8216;extras&#8217; for the two children. (The fine detail of this order has been varied from time to time; the details do not matter for present purposes.) By the end of October 2008 over &#163;370,000 had been withdrawn from the joint account in accordance with the orders of the court. The remaining balance as at the date of the hearing before me was only &#163;168,701. The monthly drawings from the account (taking one month with another) are, I was told, something of the order of &#163;19,000, so that, at the current rate of dissipation, the fund will be exhausted within 9 months!</p>

At about the same time the wife applied for an order that the father-in-law be joined as a respondent, the grounds of that application being set out in an affidavit sworn by her solicitor, Mr Jonathan James, on 6 February 2008. On 7 February 2008 the District Judge made an order joining the mother-in-law as an intervener. At the same time she made an order joining the father-in-law as second respondent, the father-in-law being given liberty to apply within 14 days of service of the order for it to be set aside. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, on 26 February 2008 the father-in-law applied for the setting aside of the order joining him. On 17 March 2008 he applied for permission to appeal out of time from the orders affecting him made by the District Judge on 11 December 2007 and on 28 December 2007 &#8211; essentially on the ground that the District Judge had been wrong to order the disclosure of privileged documents.</p>

In the first place, she said, the order of the District Judge, properly construed, did not require the disclosure of any privileged documents. So, she said, the appeal was misconceived. Secondly, however, she said that, the contentious documents having in fact been handed over, for whatever reason, the appeal was not best calculated to achieve the father-in-law&#8217;s real objective &#8211; which was, presumably, that the privileged documents should not be used &#8211; and that if his objective was to be achieved he would have to persuade the court to grant an injunction of the kind considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Al Fayed v The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2002/780" uk:canonical="[2002] EWCA Civ 780" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWCA Civ 780</ref>, (2002) Times 17 June. So, she said, the appeal was pointless. Various other points were taken which I need not take up time rehearsing. In the upshot, the father-in-law was left to go away and consider matters. Holman&#8217;s J&#8217;s order provided that the matter, including the adjourned appeal and any application by the father-on-law for an injunction, was to be listed for hearing by me on 17-19 November 2008.</p>

I knew nothing of the case beyond the fact that it was an ancillary relief case listed before me for a three-day hearing starting three weeks later on 17 November 2008. I examined the court file. I was perturbed by what I discovered. In particular, I was concerned that the directions given by the District Judge on 8 September 2008 had seemingly not been complied with and that, in consequence, the very sensible case management arrangements the District Judge had put in place had been completely subverted. Nothing at this stage &#8211; it was by now 29 October 2008 &#8211; had been put before me and no-one had sought any case management directions from me. Most fundamentally, there was still, seemingly, no document setting out the wife&#8217;s case in relation to the father-in-law.</p>

Reading this material only increased my concerns. Although I did not at this stage have copies of the trial bundles, I was left with the distinct impression that the case had become bogged down in interlocutory wrangling, that little clear thought had been given to what one might call the strategic issues in the litigation, that the case was far from ready for trial (though to be fair to all concerned it had by now emerged that the hearing before me was not intended by anyone to be the final hearing) and, in particular, that it was far from clear exactly what I was supposed to be doing at the hearing on 17 November 2008 &#8211; and all this against the background, as it now emerged, that the assets were, on any view, very modest in the context of the general run of &#8216;big money&#8217; cases and that the costs already incurred were, on any view, very substantial.</p>

The email made it clear that I was not prepared to allow matters to drift and that the immediate question was how best, and without continuing excessive expenditure of costs, to get the case into some kind of order before the hearing on 17 November 2008. I suggested that a meeting between Leading Counsel (all of whom were in London) might be appropriate to discuss, amongst other matters, how to get the litigation as quickly and cheaply as possible to finality. In the event that meeting took place on 5 November 2008. In a further email sent by my Clerk on 7 November 2008 it was made clear that whatever else was done at the forthcoming hearing I would be giving comprehensive directions designed to ensure the most effective disposal of all the matters in issue between the parties, including both the wife&#8217;s claims against the father-in-law and the mother-in-law&#8217;s claims.</p>

I pointed out that the wife admitted that the &#163;30,000 had to be repaid, that it was unrealistic for her to imagine that she would succeed in proving that the loan was intended to be interest-free, and that the interesting questions in relation to estoppels and constructive trusts were really neither here nor there since, even if the mother-in-law had nothing more than a claim in debt against the husband, she would in principle be able to obtain a charging order against his interest in the former matrimonial home. So, one way or another, the &#163;30,000 and at least interest at the statutory rate was almost bound to be removed from the matrimonial &#8216;pot&#8217;. </p>

The husband&#8217;s case, mirrored, unsurprisingly, in all respects by the father-in-law&#8217;s case, was simple. The only money the husband had ever provided was the &#163;517,532 he <span style="font-style:italic">lent </span>to the father-in-law as evidenced by the loan agreement dated 1 February 2007. Moreover, he was throughout acting on behalf of the father-in-law pursuant to a Power of Attorney given to him for that purpose in 2003. It was the father-in-law who otherwise provided the necessary funds or the security on which money was borrowed from other lenders.

He submitted that the wife had always had good grounds for bringing the father-in-law into the proceedings and that her withdrawal of the claim arose not from perception, let alone recognition, of any weakness in her case but for purely pragmatic reasons. The money put into the ventures by the husband had all been recovered. The profit from the first transaction had been rolled over into the second transaction, which, it had recently transpired, had unhappily made a substantial loss. So there was no financial benefit to be obtained in continuing to pursue what was otherwise entirely sensible and potentially productive litigation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, and essentially for the reasons given by Mr Moor and Mr Le Grice, this is a case where the father-in-law is, in principle, entitled to his costs. In seeking the joinder of the father-in-law, the wife, in my judgment, embarked upon an exercise which, not least on the basis of what was known to her at the time in January 2008, was fraught with difficulty and, I have to say, improbability of success. She had in her hands the document signed by the father-in-law. She knew that the money advanced to him by the husband had been repaid and was sitting safely in the joint account. How, then, did she think that she could get her case off the ground? She had &#8211; still has &#8211; no basis for impugning the document which, on its face, spelt out that the relationship between the husband and the father-in-law was that of creditor and debtor, and even if she might previously have harboured some hope that cross-examination might bring to light some different relationship, it is difficult to see how that would have got her very far once the money had in fact been returned, as it was in December 2007. I have already commented on the difficulties in the way in which Mr Turner put his case. The reality, I fear, is that the wife and her advisers were so beguiled by what they found in the documents produced by the father-in-law that they never really addressed what in my judgment was always the highly significant issue of who &#8211; the husband or the father-in-law &#8211; was actually funding or procuring the funding for these transactions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment this is not the kind of case where, a good claim having become academic in the light of changed circumstances, it is appropriate to order that there be no order as to costs. Nor is it the kind of case where the practical difficulty of assessing the intrinsic merits or demerits of the claim similarly propels the court towards the default position of making no order for costs. I have more than adequate material upon which to base an informed view as to the wife&#8217;s prospects of success against the father-in-law. And that view, I am afraid, is stark and unhesitating: the wife embarked upon, and persisted for far too long in pursuing, a claim that in all probability was always flawed and which never stood any very great prospect of success. She chose to sue the father-in-law. She has failed. Costs should, in principle, follow the event. The father-in-law is in principle entitled to his costs.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before passing from this issue I should mention one other matter relied upon by Mr Turner. He said that the father-in-law was to be criticised for bogging down the proceedings for over 6 months in an appeal and an application for an injunction which were devoid of merit, which had served no useful purpose (had, indeed, served only to delay matters and increase costs) and which had in the event been abandoned. Granted the premise, I do not see how it bears upon the matter in issue. The adverse order for costs to which Mr Moor has very properly submitted is the appropriate compensation for the wife in this respect. There is no reason why she should obtain any further benefit at the expense of the father-in-law. It was, after all, she who brought him into the litigation in circumstances where it might be said &#8211; as, indeed, both Mr Moor and Mr Le Grice said &#8211; that rather than criticising the father-in-law for his inappropriate conduct of part of the proceedings from March 2008 onwards she is more justly to be criticised for her failure adequately and appropriately to assess the merits of seeking his joinder at a time &#8211; in January 2008 &#8211; when she had obtained the relevant documents and could, and they would say should, have realised the many difficulties that stood in her way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the other two questions, which can conveniently be considered together: If the father-in-law is entitled to his costs, is he entitled to an order against the wife, or should the order be against the husband? If he is entitled to an order against the wife, is she entitled to an order over against the husband?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I entirely accept that there may be ancillary relief cases where, in circumstances similar to this, the appropriate form of order would be that suggested by Mr Turner. It might, for example, be appropriate to leave the third party to his recourse against the husband if the two of them were in cahoots, if the husband or the third party had been guilty of significant non-disclosure and if the wife had, perhaps because of non-disclosure, been led to believe, with justification, that there really was a good case against the third party. But this, in my judgment, is not such a case. By the time the wife applied for the joinder of the father-in-law she had the documents &#8211; not least the documents disclosed by the father-in-law himself &#8211; and was in a position to make an informed decision about whether to proceed against him. In large measure she went into things at that point with her eyes open. Though the husband, in my assessment, must bear some measure of responsibility for the wife&#8217;s decision, it was not the major or predominating part. The father-in-law is, in my judgment entitled to look to the person who brought him into the litigation &#8211; the wife &#8211; for the costs to which he is entitled. </p>

I have already referred to his inadequate responses to the wife&#8217;s Questionnaire &#8211; responses which, at least in some respects, were so contemptuous, so brazen, as to be calculated to arouse the deepest suspicions. But I return to the point I have already made: by the time the wife secured the joinder of the father-in-law she had obtained the relevant documents and, as Mr James&#8217;s affidavit shows all too clearly, had had every opportunity to examine and analyse them. In the circumstances she cannot, in my judgment, throw all the blame, all the responsibility, for the consequences of her decision onto the husband. Both, in my judgment, bear the blame, the responsibility, and both must bear the appropriate share of the consequences. </p>
