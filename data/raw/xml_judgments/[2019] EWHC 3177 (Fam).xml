The mother told the father to stop and not to ejaculate inside of her.  I find that he did not do so, and by then the sexual act had ceased to be consensual.  In failing to stop and failing to withdraw before ejaculation against her wishes, by the definition in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, the father perpetrated a rape upon the mother.&#8221; </p>

For the purposes of the hearing under review now, the Judge heard evidence from the parties themselves; she had read an extensive print-out of the sequence of text and WhatsApp messages passing between the parties over many months; she had viewed the Achieving Best Evidence interview of M, and she had listened to the audio recording of the police interview of F.

The specific issue of fact to be determined was whether the act of sexual intercourse between F and M in 2016 had been an assault; integral to this question was whether the sexual act had been consensual or not.

The mother met the father at a fast-food outlet in Newcastle, where he worked.   In the days which followed their meeting they exchanged text (SMS) and WhatsApp messages.  F invited M to his home for a meal.  Text exchanges at the time suggested that this may develop into a &#8220;sex session&#8221;.  M indeed went to F&#8217;s home as arranged.  F cooked a meal.  M ate little.  It is common ground that after the meal F and M had sexual intercourse.   </p>

F, for his part, denied that M had ever asked him to &#8216;stop&#8217; while engaged in sex; his case is that prior to the initiation of sexual intercourse they had agreed that he would not ejaculate inside her vagina, but that otherwise M said nothing during the act of sex.  It is of course accepted that F did ejaculate inside M&#8217;s vagina. </p>

He complains that the Judge had failed to consider adequately or at all the inconsistencies in M&#8217;s accounts of the events in question (when comparing her accounts to the court and in the Achieving Best Evidence interview), and in particular the oddity of her case (which as I say he denies) that they had gone on to further sexual activity after the alleged rape.  He submitted to me in oral argument at this appeal hearing that M&#8217;s case &#8220;does not add up&#8221;.   F&#8217;s case was and is that M had consented throughout the sexual intercourse; he maintained before the Judge that ejaculating inside the mother was &#8220;an accident&#8221; and complains that the Judge made no determination of whether he had accidentally or intentionally ejaculated inside the mother.

She contends that the Judge has considered all relevant matters and that she was entitled on the evidence to reach the finding that F had &#8220;raped&#8221; M.   Ms Brissenden argues that the Judge&#8217;s clear finding that M had told F to &#8220;stop&#8221; part-way through sexual intercourse materially converted the consensual activity into non-consensual activity; she relied on the fact that rape is defined as the intentional penetration of the vagina without consent (and where the person does not reasonably believe that the other consents) and that, importantly, &#8220;penetration is a continuing act from entry to withdrawal&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic"/>(<span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/79/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 79(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sexual Offences Act 2003</ref></span>).  She submits that the evidence concerning F&#8217;s ejaculation was not in fact relevant to the finding of rape, and that in granting permission to appeal, Cohen J must have misread or misinterpreted the Judge&#8217;s judgment in this regard; she points out that Cohen J had apparently read the judgment as indicating that at the point of ejaculation the sexual activity was otherwise &#8216;consensual&#8217; whereas the Judge&#8217;s conclusion was that at that time, the sexual activity had &#8220;ceased to be consensual&#8221; (see [2] above).    </p>

The Judge rejected M&#8217;s evidence about when she first knew what rape was (i.e. more than a year after this incident; M had said that she had previously assumed that rape was always associated with threats or violence). The Judge recognised that she found aspects of M&#8217;s evidence difficult to reconcile, and highlighted its various internal inconsistencies.   The Judge found that it was surprising that M had alleged, somewhat against her own interests, that there had been a second or third sexual act (i.e. after the rape) which F denied.  The Judge fairly recorded that &#8220;[M] really has nothing to gain by admitting that there was a second sexual event&#8221; and recorded that in admitting this further event, in fact it somewhat &#8220;adds to her credibility&#8221;. </p>

Having focused on the evidence specific to the act of sexual intercourse, the Judge analysed thoroughly the contextual evidence, including the communications between the parties, for some indicators of the truth.  The Judge was, it appears, particularly struck by the consistency of M&#8217;s repeated references over a period of time (in SMS/WhatsApp messages) to the fact that she had pleaded with F to &#8216;stop&#8217; when they were engaged in sexual intercourse.  She was equally unimpressed with F&#8217;s denial of this.  While acknowledging that &#8220;the Court will never know precisely what took place in [F]s bedroom on [date], only the parents know that&#8221;, she reached conclusions which, in my judgment, corresponded with a strong consistent strand of the evidence. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In this regard, it may be a timely opportunity to revisit what the Court of Appeal said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re R</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2018/198" uk:canonical="[2018] EWCA Civ 198" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWCA Civ 198</ref>.  This was a case in which all parties before the court readily accepted that the structure and substance of criminal law should <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> be applied in the Family Court, a view with which the majority of the Court of Appeal agreed.  McFarlane LJ said at [65-67]: </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.09in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[65] &#8230; criminal law concepts, such as the elements needed to establish guilt of a particular crime or a defence, have neither relevance nor function within a process of factfinding in the Family Court. Given the wider range of evidence that is admissible in family proceedings and, importantly, the lower standard of proof, it is at best meaningless for the Family Court to make a finding of 'murder' or 'manslaughter' or 'unlawful killing'. &#8230; </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.09in;text-indent:0in">[66]. Looked at from another angle, if the Family Court were required to deploy the criminal law directly into its analysis of the evidence at a fact-finding hearing such as this, the potential for the process to become unnecessarily bogged down in legal technicality is also plain to see. In the present case, the judge's detailed self-direction on the law of self-defence, and the resulting appeal asserting that it was misapplied, together with Miss Venters' late but sound observations about the statutory defence of 'loss of selfcontrol', are but two examples of the manner in which proceedings could easily become over-complicated and side-tracked from the central task of simply deciding what has happened and what is the best future course for a child. It is also likely that the judges chosen to sit on such cases in the Family Court would inevitably need to be competent to sit in the criminal jurisdiction. </p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1.18in;margin-right:1.09in;text-indent:0in">[67] &#8230; it is fundamentally wrong for the Family Court to be drawn into an analysis of factual evidence in proceedings relating to the welfare of children based upon criminal law principles and concepts. As my Lord, Hickinbottom LJ, observed during submissions, 'what matters in a fact-finding hearing are the findings of fact'. Whilst it may not infrequently be the case that the Family Court may be called upon to re-hear evidence that has already been considered in the different context of a criminal prosecution, that evidence comes to the court simply as evidence and it falls to be evaluated, in accordance with the civil standard of proof, and set against whatever other evidence there may be (whether heard by the criminal court or not) for the sole purpose of determining the relevant facts.&#8221; </p>
