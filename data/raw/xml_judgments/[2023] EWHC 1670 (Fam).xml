There are substantial aspects of their joint history about which they agree but there are some important aspects where there are disputes of fact.  I will attempt to set out my understanding of the key facts in this case.  The events described below are taken from the written evidence of the parties and the relevant documents.  Most of the matters set out below are accepted by both parties as being accurate.  Where I consider that a dispute of fact is material, I will refer to it.  There may be disputes regarding other matters, but I do not regard those disputes as material to the decision in this case.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">EF was born on 10 April 2016 and is now aged 7 years 2 months.  Both the Mother and the Father are Portuguese nationals.   The Mother and the Father have never married but they commenced a relationship and decided to move to the UK so the Mother could work as a nurse in about February 2015.  EF was born in the UK in April 2016 and the Father is named on the UK birth certificate.  Her birth was also registered in Portugal and EF has Portuguese nationality.  It follows that, for the purposes of UK law, both the Mother and the Father have parental responsibility.  I have not been provided with any expert evidence concerning parental rights of unmarried fathers under Portuguese law but it is accepted by both parties that, for the purposes of this case, there is no material difference in UK and Portuguese law in relation to the acquisition of parental rights by unmarried fathers.  It is also common ground that, under Portuguese law, it is a breach of the rights of one parent for the other parent to move a child to live in another country without the consent of the left behind parent. </p>

In about June 2016, the Mother, EF and the Father all moved back to Portugal.   After arriving back in Portugal, EF lived with her Mother but the Father had regular contact with her.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother moved back to Portsmouth with EF in about June 2017.  She explained in evidence that she did so to return to work because her maternity leave came to an end.  During the time the Mother and EF were living in England, the Father commenced proceedings seeking an order from the Portuguese court to enable him to have a greater level of contact with EF.  I have been provided with a translation of the order made at the end of those proceedings which provided for them to be dismissed on the grounds that, at that point, EF was habitually resident in the UK.  Notwithstanding the outcome of his Portuguese court action, the Father travelled to Portsmouth regularly to see EF and at times stayed in the Mother&#8217;s house and provided support to her in caring for EF whilst the Mother was working. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December 2019 the Mother decided to move back to Portugal, but she continued to work as an agency nurse substantially in the UK.  She explained that she went to the UK for periods of time of a few weeks, leaving EF in the care of a combination of her mother, the maternal grandmother, with care for EF also being provided by the Father.  During this time, the Father came to stay in the Mother&#8217;s house in Portugal from time to time and took EF to her regular nursery.  My impression from the evidence is that the bulk of the care for EF appears to have been provided by the maternal grandmother but I do not need to make any findings about the exact division of time EF was cared for by her Father and by her maternal grandmother during this time.   The Mother gives examples of her working pattern during this period including the period between 11 September 2020 and 23 October 2020 when, during those weeks, the Mother was working in the United Kingdom and EF was being cared for in Portugal by a combination of the Father and the maternal grandmother.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Free movement to the UK ended for EU citizens when the UK left the European Union and, to protect her ability to work in the UK, the Mother applied for settled status in the UK.  She was granted residence rights under the EU Settlement Scheme in January 2022.    The Mother also applied for settled status for EF.  In October 2022, whilst that application was being considered and the Mother was in the United Kingdom as explained above, the Mother emailed the Father to ask him to take photographs of EF which were needed for EF&#8217;s UK settled status application.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It thus seems to me that the Father must have known by October 2022 at the latest that the Mother was working to ensure that she had the legal right to live with EF in the UK.  However, neither the Mother nor the Father suggest that there was ever a clear plan agreed between them for the Mother and EF to leave Portugal and move on a permanent basis to the UK.  Thus, the most that I can read into these documents was that both the Mother and the Father knew in October 2022 that the Mother was laying the ground for a possible move to the UK, albeit nothing had been agreed.</p>

During the meal I needed to use the bathroom. EF was adamant she was going to show me where the bathroom was. I asked the respondent to keep EF at the table with her, however she refused and therefore EF came with me. I instructed EF not to touch anything in the stall, but to my surprise she touched my &#8220;penis&#8221;. I tried to defuse the situation and explain to EF that that was not allowed and encouraged her to go tell the respondent.

He then came back to the living room and sat on the sofa eating. At this point I was extremely nervous and I demanded that he give me an explanation of exactly what happened.

The Father does not dispute that, when first confronted about this event, he was not truthful to the police.  However, I am not satisfied that this lie is particularly relevant for the purposes of this case albeit the lie may have affected relations between the Mother and the Father.  The fact that a person lies about one matter does not mean that I should assume he or she is generally lacking credibility or is lying about other matters:  see Uddin v Secretary of State for the Home Department <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2020] 1 WLR 1562" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] 1 WLR 1562</ref> per Ryder LJ at paragraph 11.

It also suggests that there may be further matters to be investigated.  I should also record that the Father has strongly denied that he has abused his daughter and asserts that what happened in the toilet of the restaurant was not at his instigation, as EF said at the time, and denies any other allegations of abuse.  </p>

In that text she informed him that they were only intending to stay in the UK for a month.  She admits that was a lie because she intended to relocate to England on a permanent basis.  I do not know precisely when she told the Father that she intended to stay with EF in the UK on a permanent basis.  However, just as I need to treat the Father&#8217;s initial lie about what happened in the restaurant with caution, I do not draw any particular inferences from the Mother&#8217;s lie about her intentions.  </p>

He made that application on 7 July 2022 because he was concerned that the Mother would attempt to relocate to the UK with EF and wished to secure an order preventing this happening.  The Father is understandably suspicious that the Mother left Portugal on 8 July because she was aware of the application and sought to leave before an order was made.  She says that she was not informed about the proceedings until later in July and thus left before she knew that there were court proceedings.  Whilst I understand the Father&#8217;s suspicions, it is not necessary for me to make any finding on this issue.</p>

The possibility of the Father making an application in England for a return order was raised and it appears the Father agreed to make this application.  The Portuguese proceedings have effectively been stayed whilst the Portuguese court waits for this court to decide whether to make a summary return order.</p>

EF has been enrolled in a local state school and is progressing well.  She appears to be mastering English, has settled in her new life in England and has made friends.  The Father has been having contact with EF via a video link but this does not appear to be going terribly well.  It is not necessary for me to express any view on whether the difficulties are because contact is being sabotaged by the Mother or whether EF genuinely does not want to have contact with her father in this way.  I should also mention that there was an unfortunate incident on 24 December 2022 when the Father travelled to England with his mother in order to attempt to see EF.  He turned up at a local Catholic Church and there was a scene when he attempted to see EF.  Whilst I can understand the Father&#8217;s frustration at not seeing his daughter in person, I consider that this unilateral attempt by the Father so have contact with EF at Christmas was ill judged as it was only ever going to result in distress for EF and further conflict between the Mother and the Father.</p>

Given that the Mother is and always has been EF&#8217;s primary carer, any separation from her Mother would clearly be challenging for EF and, if a return order were to have that effect, it seems to me inconceivable that the Mother would not have referred to it as the primary consequence for her daughter of this court making a return order.   Further, as this case was about the Father&#8217;s request for a return order, if the Mother had not made her mind up whether she would return with EF or not, I think she would have referred to this as one possible consequence of this court making a return order.  The fact that the Mother is silent about the potential separation of EF from her mother means that this paragraph can only be read as implying that, if a return order was to be made, the Mother was intending to return to Portugal with her daughter and was looking at the consequences for her daughter of that happening.</p>

That common ground is supported by the Court of Appeal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Children) (Republic of Ireland) (Child's Objections) (Joinder of Children as parties to appeal)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/26" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 26" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 26</ref> where Black LJ (as she then was) said at paragraph 39 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The word 'objects' imports a strength of feeling which goes far beyond the usual ascertainment of the wishes of the child in a custody dispute&#8221;.</span>  I accept that, as EF is an intelligent 7 year old, she is of an age where some weight should be given to her views.

It seems to me that Ms Cull-Fitzpatrick&#8217;s evidence is the best evidence on the issue and she has the advantage of both being entirely neutral and having substantial relevant experience in drawing out the real feelings of a child about a possible return.

First, the Mother relies on the extant investigation by the Portuguese police into the allegations of sexual abuse by the Father.  In my judgment the fact that there is an investigation without more cannot, of itself, amount to a risk to EF.  On the contrary, she would be far more exposed to risks if there was no investigation and thus no impediment to the Father having unsupervised contact with her.

I have to assume that no contact will be permitted by the court in Portugal unless the court is satisfied that such contact is in EF&#8217;s best interests and takes place under conditions which provide that she will be safe.  I accept that EF&#8217;s present state of mind is that she does not want to spend time with her father but I do not accept that the possibility that, having conducted a welfare assessment, the Portuguese court might come to the conclusion that some level of contact is in EF&#8217;s best interests.  I cannot accept that this future contact would expose EF to a grave risk of harm or would be intolerable for her.  On the contrary, it seems to me that a combination of the undertakings offered by the Father and the involvement by the court in Portugal means that any contact will only happen if either the Mother or the court are satisfied that contact is in EF&#8217;s best interests.</p>

As Mr Jarman KC rightly said, it is possible that EF will return with her maternal grandmother and live with her.  EF is very familiar with her maternal grandmother as she already lives with her in England and the maternal grandmother provides a significant level of childcare to EF at the moment, and did so whilst the Mother was dividing her time between Portugal and The UK after December 2019.  </p>

In that unlikely circumstance I accept that a decision will have to be made concerning the child arrangements for EF in Portugal.  At the resumed hearing Mr Jarman KC proposed that he file details of EF&#8217;s great paternal aunt, who knows EF and against whom no allegations have been made to date, as a potential carer for EF.  I do not criticise the Father for not filing this evidence to date because, as mentioned above, the change of position by the Mother only occurred just before the trial of this matter.</p>

To so conclude would be to place on the words of Art 13(b) a gloss which they cannot not bear.

However, it is not a principle articulated in the Convention or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and should not be applied to the effective exclusion of the very defence itself, which is in terms directed to the question of the risk of harm to the child and not the wrongful conduct of the abducting parent. By reason of the provisions of Arts 3 and 12, such wrongful conduct is a 'given' in the context of which the defence is nonetheless made available if its constituents can be established.&#8221;</span></p>

Within this context, it is important again to bear in mind that Art 13(b) looks to the situation as it would be if the child were returned forthwith to his or her home country and that the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to ensure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when he or she gets home. The significance for the situation the child will face upon return of a parent's refusal to return must in each case be evaluated in the context of the protective measures that can be put in place to mitigate the impact of the same&#8221; </span></p>

It seems to me highly unlikely that this will occur but, if it does, I consider that a welfare assessment should be made by the Courts in Portugal to determine where EF should live and whether, pending any final decision, she should continue to live with her Mother in England or should go into foster care in Portugal.  I accept that this is a less than ideal solution for a 7 year old but I do not accept that it will result in the situation becoming intolerable for EF.</p>

However, in the context of this case, all parties accept that &#8220;forthwith&#8221; does not mean &#8220;immediate&#8221; and that EF should finish her school year in England before returning to Portugal.  I am told that school term will finish on 25 July and thus I anticipate that a return should happen immediately thereafter.</p>

I would hope that is a relatively short period.  Prior to the resumed hearing of this case on 20 July, I raised a number of possible scenarios with the parties.  I made it clear that I was not prepared to make a return order if the consequence was that EF were to return to live with her father for that interim period.  It seems to me that there is evidence which suggests that the Father may have been responsible for sexual abuse and, whilst that evidence may well not be proven if the matter were to be examined at a fact finding hearing, EF may be exposed to unacceptable risks if she were to resume living with her Father at this point.</p>

The parties should file their positions well in advance of that hearing, supported by any evidence upon which they rely to support their proposed arrangements for EF&#8217;s return and, if no order has been made by the Portuguese Court, for arrangements to apply in the period before the Portuguese Court makes child arrangements orders.  If the parties cannot agree on arrangements for EF&#8217;s return and her living arrangements until an order can be secured from the court in Portugal, it seems to me that I may be called on to make orders under article 11, including an order to require the Mother to take EF back to Portugal and to live with her there until a child arrangements order is obtained from the court in Portugal or EF is taken into foster care.  Mr Miller has accepted that I have that power, albeit that I would be reluctant to exercise the power given its coercive nature.</p>

Hence although I have made a return order, if there is no way of returning EF which is consistent with her reasonable safety whether supported by Article 11 orders or not, I would have the power to re-open the question as to whether to make a return order.  It seems to me that this is a power to be used very sparingly and that the hearing on 20 July must be used to focus on how EF is to be returned not whether EF should be returned.  </p>
