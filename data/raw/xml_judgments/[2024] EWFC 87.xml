All of the parties agree that they should do so.  The primary issue concerns the appropriate legal structure under which C&#8217;s home with Mr and Mrs D should be underpinned.  The parties&#8217; positions on this issue can be summarised as follows:</span></p>

They contend that C should remain living with Mr and Mrs D, pursuant to either a long-term fostering arrangement or under a special guardianship order (or possibly a combination of the two).  It is the mother&#8217;s wish (supported by the father) to resume the care of C in due course; despite this the parents are prepared to agree to the court making an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, preventing either parent from making applications without the permission of the court for a period of two years. </span></p>

This is opposed by the other parties.  Mr and Mrs D (supported by the local authority and guardian) propose that there should be a so-called &#8216;wish you well&#8217; contact; thereafter there would be no further direct contact for at least a year, after which they have agreed to keep the question of contact under review.  As for indirect contact, Mr and Mrs D propose that there should be reciprocal letterbox contact.  They initially suggested it should take place once a year, but are prepared to agree to it being twice yearly.</span></p>

[C] is slightly shorter than most children her age but not noticeably so. She has beautiful strawberry blonde hair which she takes pride in having styled and worn nicely with clips or plaited. Her disability presents itself in 'seen' and 'unseen' ways; so [C] has one central top incisor tooth, internal nasal cavity changes which can impact on breathing when she isn't well. She also has (not noticeably) shorter arms and legs than most children. Her CIS means she has pronounced features, one central incisor tooth and a slightly pronounced forehead; this and her pituitary gland issues has meant that it has never been fully clear how [C] will develop around her learning, gross or fine motor skills. Thankfully she continues to surprise those around her and loves hobbies which help her development; dance, swimming, trips to the park and soft play. She is also a keen artist and cake maker!</span></p>

The arguments against were said to be: (1) that C would not be cared for within her birth family; (2) that long-term foster care did not offer permanency; (3) that Mr and Mrs D could end the placement at any time, a risk which was of greater consequence here because of the potential for ongoing disruption to the placement from the mother; and (4) that C would remain a looked after child and subject to the intrusion and stigma that attached to a child in care.

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8220;To sum up, there was strong evidence to support the view that it was in the interests of C's welfare to remain with Mr and Mrs D. She is settled there, receiving high quality care. She has formed a close relationship with her carers and members of their family. It is the only home she has ever known. She has very complex and demanding medical and therapeutic needs which Mr and Mrs D are able to meet. She is highly vulnerable to suffering a serious, possibly life-threatening, adverse reaction to stress from disruption to her routine. She is expecting to go to a local school in the vicinity of the Ds' house. Although there have been difficulties with contact, remaining with Mr and Mrs D would allow her to retain an element of direct contact with her birth family. In my view, long-term foster care was an option which should have been considered and evaluated alongside the other options in accordance with case law, as part of "a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared, side by side, against the competing option or options." For the reasons set out above, however, the judge's analysis of the realistic options for C's future care was flawed. She failed to deal clearly with the option of long-term foster care with the Ds, to the extent that at the appeal hearing the parties were unable to agree whether it had been treated as a realistic option or not.&#160;</span></p>

It seems clear that Mr and Mrs D are no longer saying that they cannot continue to care for C unless they receive support at the current level. Even if the option of long-term foster care with the Ds was not a realistic option at the time of the hearing, it has unquestionably become so now.&#8221;</span></p>

There were other options before the judge and further realistic options may emerge. For example, as anticipated in the recent emails, Mr and Mrs D may decide to proceed with their own adoption application. Although we were not addressed on this at the hearing, it seems to me that they could initiate this process by serving notice on the local authority under s.44(3) of the 2002 Act.

At a pre-trial review in early September, the final hearing was adjourned to dates in December 2023, after the court was made aware that Mr and Mrs D might seek to pursue their own adoption application.  A lack of judicial availability resulted in that December hearing being vacated and re-listed before me in January and February 2024.</span></p>

As Lady Hale said (para 198) it is "necessary to explore and attempt alternative solutions". What are these options? That will depend upon the circumstances of the particular cases. They range, in principle, from the making of no order at one end of the spectrum to the making of an adoption order at the other. In between, there may be orders providing for the return of the child to the parent's care with the support of a family assistance order or subject to a supervision order or a care order; or the child may be placed with relatives under a residence order or a special guardianship order or in a foster placement under a care order; or the child may be placed with someone else, again under a residence order or a special guardianship order or in a foster placement under a care order. This is not an exhaustive list of the possibilities; wardship for example is another, as are placements in specialist residential or healthcare settings. Yet it can be seen that the possible list of options is long. We return to the implications of this below.</span></p>

No doubt the court will not, except in the most exceptional case, impose terms or conditions as to access to members of the child's natural family to which the adopting parents do not agree. To do so would be to create a potentially frictional situation which would be hardly likely to safeguard or promote the welfare of the child. When no agreement is forthcoming the court will, with very rare exceptions, have to choose between making an adoption order without terms or conditions as to access, or to refuse to make such an order and seek to safeguard access to some other machinery, such as wardship. To do otherwise would be merely inviting future and almost immediate litigation stopped"</span></p>

Was there a proper basis for taking that extremely unusual step? In our judgment, there was not. The judge found that the adoptive parents were genuine when they express their concerns, so what was the justification for imposing on them something they conscientiously and reasonably objected to, particularly when, as we have seen, they say that they have not ruled out the possibility of letting the natural parents have photographs in the future? As we have said, they are not to be saddled with an order merely because a judge takes a different view. The adoptive parents are J's parents; the natural parents are not. The adoptive parents are the only people with parental responsibility for J. Why, unless circumstances are unusual, indeed extremely unusual - and here in our judgment they are neither - should that responsibility be usurped by the court? We can see no good reason either on the facts or in law. On the contrary, there is much force in the point they make, that they wish their status as J's parents to be respected and seen to be inviolable - not for themselves but in order, as they see it, to give J the best chance for the adoption to be successful."</span></p>

The strain which Mrs D feels about being subject to constant critical scrutiny was apparent to me when she gave her evidence.

The undisputed evidence about C&#8217;s medical conditions and the potentially life-threatening consequences for her of being subjected to stress are quite plain.  The mother&#8217;s inability to recognise this in the context of her persistent ambition to secure C&#8217;s return to her demonstrates that she finds it challenging to prioritise C&#8217;s needs above her own.  It is also surprising that she told the guardian that if C were to live with her, she would support C seeing Mr and Mrs D&#8217;s children but not the foster carers themselves as often.

I do not have up-to-date figures, but note from the original SGO assessment that at that time there was a surplus between their income and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">basic </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">monthly expenditure (by &#8216;basic&#8217; I mean excluding items such as clothing and social activities) of approximately &#163;1,400 per month.  Making an SGO at the time of the original proceedings would have led to an immediate reduction in their income of about &#163;1,000 per month, with ongoing support after two years being means tested.  They did not believe they could commit to an arrangement which would have such a detrimental impact on their ability to provide a good quality of life for their family.  In my view, their position in relation to finances has been entirely understandable and I do not consider any of the criticisms levelled at them over this issue to be justified.  The level of care which they need to provide for C has had an impact on their respective abilities to work and in particular to undertake overtime.  It is entirely reasonable for them to consider their overall financial situation and to have regard to the needs of their family as a whole.</span></p>

These all stem, in my judgement, from the mother&#8217;s inability fully to accept and respect the role which Mr and Mrs D play in her daughter&#8217;s life.  Although the mother was ruled out as a carer for C in 2021, she has never been able to accept this.  Her wish (understandably from her perspective as a mother) has always been and remains to resume the care of C as soon as possible.  The limited involvement she now has in C&#8217;s life causes her feel marginalised and, in my judgement, resentful of the parental role which the Ds fulfil.  The more she perceives C to be close to her foster parents, the more it threatens her own position as a mother and her ambition to resume C&#8217;s care.  These are human emotions which are easy to understand and with which one can sympathise.  The problem for C, however, is that it is led to her being caught in the middle of a very tense adult dynamic about which she is becoming increasingly aware.  The mother, as I was able to observe when she gave her evidence, is forthright and direct in her manner of communication.  It has been difficult for her to conceal from C her disapproval of the foster carers or to restrain herself from intervening to assert herself as C&#8217;s mother, even though from C&#8217;s perspective Mr and Mrs D are the people she considers to be her &#8216;mummy&#8217; and &#8216;daddy&#8217;.</span></p>

Food that might be considered a treat is strictly rationed or not allowed at all.  C is encouraged to drink water and not sugary or flavoured drinks.  It is not difficult to imagine that it must be challenging and no doubt stressful for Mr and Mrs D to ensure that C adheres to this diet and forgoes food and drink which other children with whom she comes into contact (perhaps even her own foster siblings) are allowed to consume.  For Mr and Mrs D, therefore, it is important that the boundaries they have set around the consumption of food should be respected and not undermined when she has contact.  This has been made clear to the mother more than once.  Nevertheless she has on occasions brought to contact flavoured water to drink or given C more than one snack (cake, plus raisins to take home) despite being advised that she should not do so (e.g. the notes of contact on 14.6.22 record that the mother was clearly advised that for medical reasons C should not be given more than one snack and that even showing C raisins to take home could upset her if she was not allowed to have them; she was also advised to bring healthier snacks instead of chocolate, such as yogurt or fruit; see also the review notes dated 27.3.23).</span></p>

This perspective was reflected in the observation of the contact supervisor to the guardian when she wondered whether Mr and Mrs D could respond better and be more lenient about C coming back to them with drinks or snacks as the contact is infrequent and time limited.  If I was concerned with a child who did not have a serious medical condition, I would have complete sympathy with this observation.  In C&#8217;s case, however, I consider this criticism of Mr and Mrs D to be unwarranted.  It is entirely understandable that they should be hyper-vigilant to ensure that the risks to C of suffering an episode which requires hospital treatment or worse are minimised.  Part of this involves ensuring she follows a strict diet which, as I have observed, must be challenging for them to enforce.  Undermining the boundaries which the Ds have set around the consumption of food and drink places C in position where she is encouraged to disobey rules set for her at home; this in turn will increase the challenges her carers face in enforcing those rules.  It also creates a conflict of loyalties for her and undermines the parental role fulfilled by Mr and Mrs D.  </span></p>

I have sympathy for the upset which the mother must feel hearing her daughter use a term which she will perceive as undermining her status as a mother.  Nevertheless, the terms used by C reflect the world as she experiences it.  Her foster carers are, as she sees it, her mummy and her daddy: they cater to all of her day-to-day physical and emotional needs as parents do.  She knows that her mother is the person from whose &#8216;tummy&#8217; she came into the world; she is able to enjoy spending time with her, but she does not relate to her in a parental capacity.  The mother&#8217;s inability to restrain herself from correcting C inevitably creates tension and confusion for her and undermines her relationship with Mr and Mrs D.  An example of this is recorded in the notes of the contact on 18.10.22 (the mother corrected C&#8217;s use of the term &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">daddy</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217; saying &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">you know he is not your daddy don&#8217;t you</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217; to which C initially looked puzzled before quickly saying &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">my foster carer</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;).

In my view, it was wholly wrong for the local authority to arrange this type of contact prior to the matter having been determined by the court.  It meant that C had to go through some work to prepare her for the difficult experience of saying goodbye to her birth family.  When the parents failed to attend C displayed symptoms of distress over several days; Mrs D&#8217;s oral evidence was that her dysregulation was more extreme than she had previously encountered it to be in connection with contact.  This is likely to have been connected to the work which was done with her in anticipation of the contact.  The session will have been built up as having special importance and as a last opportunity to see the parents for some considerable time (not &#8216;forever&#8217;, as Mrs D made clear in her oral evidence).  Mrs D&#8217;s evidence, which I accept, is that C did not become upset when the purpose of the contact was explained to her; her reaction occurred after the contact failed to take place.

C became unwell during the contact.  Following her return home with the foster carers her condition became so serious that she was taken to hospital.  It is alleged that the mother failed to observe the warning signs during contact that C might require urgent medical attention.  The contact notes record that C was shaky on her legs after taking part in some painting.  She fell asleep for 25 minutes and upon waking she vomited (an indicator that medical attention may be required).  The mother then cleaned her up and changed C&#8217;s nappy before she was returned to Mr D, who was waiting in the car outside the contact centre.  By the time C returned home she had become so lethargic that Mr and Mrs D gave her a double dose of her usual medication.  Nevertheless, she had a high temperature and became sick again.  At this point Mr D administered an emergency injection and called an ambulance to take her to hospital.  Fortunately, her condition stabilised and she was discharged from hospital at approximately 10.30pm. </span></p>

Its analysis, especially when set out in tabular form, appears to start from a position in which the different options are treated as having broadly equivalent intrinsic merit.

My criticism &#8211; and it is not a criticism of Ms EW personally &#8211; is the local authority&#8217;s failure to analyse the option of adoption through the lens of exceptionality.

Whilst this may be correct in a generic sense, on the facts of this case Mr and Mrs D have made clear their unwavering commitment to C and that they will continue to care for her whatever the legal structure.

One of the reasons for Mr and Mrs D&#8217;s reluctance to become long term foster carers has always been the unwillingness of the local authority to continue to fund them at the same rate, its stance being that as long-term foster carers their allowance would be cut by approximately &#163;1,000 per month, a very substantial reduction in income for a family for whom finances are tight.  The local authority has managed to come to a financial agreement with Mr and Mrs D in the event that an adoption order is made; I struggle to understand why it has been unable to come to a similar agreement in the event that long-term fostering is deemed to be the most appropriate outcome.   The guardian considers that the local authority has not been &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">fully truthful</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217; in maintaining that finances did not play any part in its planning rationale for C and I can understand why she has formed that view.</span></p>

There is a risk that C will miss seeing her parents and brother; she has some understanding of her biological links to them and having her contact terminated may cause her anxiety as she wonders how they are and why they no longer see her.  Having no contact may also have an impact upon her self-esteem and lead her to question her own self-worth.  She may come to feel that she is no longer loved by her birth family or alternatively to form the view that the people whose biological genes she shares are deemed unworthy of having a relationship with her.  She may develop unhealthy and unrealistic fantasies about them and her anxieties may come to manifest themselves in behaviour issues which place a strain on her placement or put its continuation in jeopardy.  If C later desires to rekindle her relationship with her parents, she may feel senses of betrayal, resentment and loss at having been denied the opportunity to maintain those relationships.  She may wonder, for example, how it came to be that out of all her biological siblings she was the one singled out for adoption whereas the others were permitted to remain within their wider family and to continue a relationship with their parents.

It would confer upon Mr and Mrs D the freedom to act as her parents.  They alone would hold parental responsibility for C.  They could make plans without fear that their decisions might be vetoed by the parents or the local authority.  They would be unburdened of the need to act in consultation with the local authority and relieved of the feeling that they are subject to constant scrutiny by an authority with whom they have a poor relationship.

Special guardianship confers enhanced parental responsibility, allowing the special guardians to make a range of decisions for the child without reference to the parents.

The parents&#8217; inability to accept C&#8217;s placement with Mr and Mrs D poses real risks for her as I have identified above.  Under a special guardianship order, Mr and Mrs D would not have the level of support they presently enjoy now.  They would need to deal directly with the parents, a prospect which fills them with dread to the extent that they are unable to perceive any overall advantage in this legal structure over long-term foster care.  In my judgement, they are justified in their apprehension.  The mother&#8217;s disapproval of C&#8217;s placement with them is entrenched, despite the many hours of counselling she has been through.  I consider that there is very little prospect of her modifying her view. In one instance, the mother&#8217;s mistrust led her to make an allegation which resulted in C being taken unnecessarily to hospital. In my judgement, it is likely that under a special guardianship arrangement she would continue to criticise Mr and Mrs D and that during any periods of contact she had with C she would continue to undermine her placement and jeopardise her stability.  Without local authority support, I consider that contact is likely to become a flashpoint to which C will be exposed.

Her proposal that she be subject to a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order for two years is viewed by Mr and Mrs D &#8211; rightly in my view &#8211; as a statement of intent to make an application once that period has elapsed.  </span></p>

The insertion of a leave filter in the process would to some extent mitigate the prospect of future litigation but it would not eliminate it.  It would certainly not eliminate the anxiety which Mr and Mrs D would feel that another application was around the corner.  C has been subject to litigation since she was 16 months old.  I share the guardian&#8217;s view that the prospect of further litigation is likely to be destabilising for her.  The guardian&#8217;s level of concern is such that she said in her oral evidence &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">we cannot leave the door open for further proceedings</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;.

This would be advantageous by comparison with special guardianship in the management of any contact with the parents.  It would, however, mean that C was living in a home in which her primary carers lacked parental responsibility for her.  They would be unable to make significant decisions without consulting the local authority (with whom they have a poor relationship) and without input from the parents whose position is likely to remain that C should not be living with them at all.  C would be subject to regular local authority reviews.  Her different status within the household would be apparent to her and is likely to undermine her place in the family and her sense of security. I accept Ms EW&#8217;s evidence that for some children being a looked after child may carry a certain stigma, although I do think Ms Dunn makes a valid submission that in modern Britain children grow up under a wide variety of family structures. In common with special guardianship, long-term foster care would not have the effect of severing C from her birth family and would thus remove the risks associated with this.  This leads the parents to suggest that it entails &#8216;the best of both worlds&#8217; for a child.  The converse to this, as Ms EW accepted in her evidence, is that it can leave a child feeling stuck in &#8216;no man&#8217;s land&#8217;.</span></p>

Such an arrangement would be highly unusual and is unlikely to be appropriate save in rare circumstances.  It would enable Mr and Mrs D to hold parental responsibility for C whilst maintaining input from the local authority who would act as a buffer between them and the parents.  The effect of a care order, however, would be to undermine Mr and Mrs D&#8217;s enhanced parental responsibility as special guardians.  The local authority would have the overriding power to take decisions about C including potentially removing C from their care.</span></p>

She is a child who requires more than adequate care.  Exposure to stress poses a danger to her health to the extent that it may be life-threatening.  Were her placement with Mr and Mrs D to break down, I consider that the impact on C is likely to be severe and enduring.  As she grows up, C will be acutely aware that she is different from other children and this has the potential to cause her anxiety and harm her self-esteem.  It is all the more important, in my view, that she should enjoy the benefit of feeling a sense of belonging to her family that adoption can bring.  It is especially important for C that everything be done to support her placement and to minimise the risks of it being undermined or, in a worst-case scenario, breaking down altogether.</span></p>

I accept their assurance that they will work with the local authority in keeping the question of contact with the birth family under review.

It will be enormously challenging for them to be able to accept this and it is impossible for me to predict whether they will manage to do so.  I accept that Mr and Mrs D will be astute to promote C&#8217;s interests going forward and that this will include facilitating contact if they judge it to be beneficial for her.

As I indicated to them during the course of the hearing, I consider it important that they send regular updates and photographs to the parents as a means of maintaining a link between them and C, even if the parents choose not to send communications in return (which they may find difficult to do).  I very much hope, however, that the parents will feel able to participate in the letterbox contact and make it a two-way process.  The decision I have come to will be devastating for them, but I hope they will take solace from the fact that the love and commitment they have shown thus far for C will be important for her as she develops through her childhood.  Although they will no longer be C&#8217;s parents as a matter of law, they will always be her birth parents.  If they are able to accept C&#8217;s new status they can remain important figures in her life and play a part in enhancing her identity during childhood and beyond.</span></p>
