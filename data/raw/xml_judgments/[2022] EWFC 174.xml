	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">This Judgment is further to the Judgment I gave on the 25th February 2020. [Reported at [2020] EWFC B22]. Two years have passed, and I am only now able to conclude this matter. In part, this is caused by the difficulties of Litigants in Person dealing with complex issues and the attempt to obtain a Pension Report dealing with the issues. I have now at last been able to understand the positions of the parties within the uncertainties of predicting the future.</p>

There have been a number of abortive hearings and directions hearings in an attempt to obtain a Pension Report. The former matrimonial home was sold, and all but &#163;10,000 of the value was taken up with paying off the mortgage and costs. In practice, neither party has any capital. The Wife has substantial debts, but entered into an arrangement which requires her to pay &#163;128 per month for many years.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have seen correspondence with Mr Richard Nobbs of Excalibur Actuaries which has assisted my understanding. He has not conducted a pension report as he concluded that this would not be appropriate but has spent considerable time investigating the matter. He has waived his fee save for answering further questions. I am grateful to Mr. Nobbs. He has also attempted to deal with the Husband&#8217;s Benefits position, but points out that this is outside his area of expertise.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Wife has two pensions, in the Police Pension Scheme 1987 and the Police Pension Scheme 2015. The details I have seen are out of date, but I am more concerned with the projected future benefits so this does not matter as much as it might.  The most recent CTV is &#163;137,000 but for the purposes of this case, it is the income they produce that is the real issue. She is now 52 years old. The projections show that if she remains working in the police, at age 55, she could either take lump sums of &#163;67,426,97 and a pension of &#163;9.775.39 or a total pension of &#163;12,032.98 a year. At age 60 she could either take lump sums of &#163;94,060.36 and pension of &#163;14,549.20 or a total pension of &#163;20,853.72 a year. I consider it unlikely that she will remain in the police until she reaches 60, given her health issues, but in any event she will not qualify for her state pension until she reaches the age of 68, when she is projected to receive &#163;9.141.60 a year. Between her retirement and her state pension age she will almost certainly need to take another job to meet her expenses.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">She has produced a spreadsheet of her expenses at various dates, putting these at &#163;2,546 a month at present (which she can cover by her present take home income of about &#163;2,500). The main expense is her rent of a 2 bedroom property for &#163;1,500 a month. It includes &#163;128 debt management. The figures for 2025 and 2030 are in proportion.</p>

He also receives, I accept, Personal Independence Payment (PIP) of &#163;60 per week though this was not made clear to Mr Nobbs. In consequence his present income is &#163;&#163;258.60 a week, or &#163;13,442 a year as well as Housing Benefit which pays the rent on his flat of &#163;600 a month, or &#163;7,200 a year. He is 62 now. When he reached the age of 65 he will receive Pension Credit of &#163;177.10 per week, not including PIP. Housing Benefit or Council Deduction. His PIP has to be reviewed and is not guaranteed, though given the severe nature of his difficulties, I consider that on balance it is likely to be renewed. This will leave him with &#163;237.10 a week, a reduction of &#163;21.50 a week, or &#163;1, 118 in a year. </p>

It is also said that she is likely to inherit from her mother, though I explained that this is not likely to be a consideration unless imminent, as her mother could leave her assets elsewhere or spend them all. It was also questioned whether the debt repayment would last until she is 71, but she said it is clear on the agreement. </p>

It would require the Wife to commute one or other of her pensions to fund a lump sum. Any periodical payments would be swallowed up by deductions from benefits.</p>

It does seem clear that the Husband will be worse off when he reaches retirement age.

I accept that in recent times her contribution to the finances of the marriage, and sorting out the problems was greater, and cannot overlook this. Her Mother has supported her in the past, but there is no guarantee that she will inherit, and no evidence that she will cohabit. I do accept that when she leaves the police, if she has no other source of income, she could take a lodger, and she accepted this.</p>

It would not count against his Benefits but any larger sum up to &#163;16,000 would reduce them. I think that it is likely that the Wife will retire at 55, but I would not wish to force her to do so. When she does, she could clearly take a Lump Sum from the 2015 pension and pay a Lump Sum from it without compromising her future finances. I think that she will have the means to afford to pay this sum and balancing their respective needs and taking account of all the Section 25 criteria, I consider that it would be right to order her to do so.</p>

I consider that this is appropriate in all the circumstances.</p>
