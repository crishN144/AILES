	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The applicant, AB, is the mother of M.  She is represented by Ms Charlotte Baker of counsel. The mother is a Lebanese national.  She has permanent leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  On behalf of the mother, Ms Baker asserted that it is the mother&#8217;s intention to remain living in the United Kingdom, although at present she does not have secure accommodation or employment.  The mother contends that this court has substantive jurisdiction in respect of M by reason of Art 10 of BIIa or in the alternative under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court or in the further alternative under the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction of the High Court based on M&#8217;s British Citizenship (the mother arguing that this is a case in which the exercise of this jurisdiction is required to protect M in circumstances where the mother alleges she has been the victim of domestic abuse, M has been removed to Egypt, her </p>

If the English court accepts it has jurisdiction, the mother further contends that the jurisdiction of England and Wales is the most convenient forum for determining the welfare issues in respect of M and that the court should order the summary return of M from Egypt to this jurisdiction. The mother submits that the English court the order of the Beirut court of 6 February 2019 is not capable of recognition by this court and should not prevent the court making the orders sought. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The respondent, EM, is the father of M.  He is represented by Ms Claire Renton of counsel.  The father is also a Lebanese national.  He has permanent leave to remain in the United Kingdom and intends to apply for British Citizenship when he becomes entitled to do so in May of this year.  Ms Renton confirmed that as part of the good character declaration on that application the father will be required to declare his breach of a location order in these proceedings and his subsequent arrest.  Through Ms Renton, the father informed the court that upon gaining British Citizenship it is his intention to reside in Egypt with M.  The father submits that this court does not have jurisdiction in respect of M on any of the jurisdictional bases identified by the mother or otherwise.  In the alternative, the father contends that if the English court does have jurisdiction then it should stay these proceedings as the Lebanese courts are the most convenient forum.  Finally, were this court to determine that it has jurisdiction in respect of M and that this jurisdiction is the most convenient forum, the father submits that it is not in M&#8217;s best interests to order her summary return from Egypt. The father submits that the English court can and should recognise the order made by the Beirut court on 6 February 2019. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">M is a British Citizen.  She is currently in Egypt having been taken to that jurisdiction by the father on 30 April 2019, and is said by the father to be in the care of her paternal relatives.  The father contends that this step was entirely lawful, having been taken pursuant to the terms of the order of the Beirut court dated 6 February 2019.  As I have alluded to, the mother contends that this removal from the jurisdiction of England and Wales took place without her consent and was wrongful for the purposes of Art 10 of BIIa.  At the present time, whilst M is said to be in the care of family members, there is no one in Egypt who has parental responsibility for her in that jurisdiction, both of her parents being in England.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">For the purpose of answering the questions set out above, the elements of the background to this matter which are central to the court&#8217;s determination concern the factual situation of M prior to her removal from the jurisdiction of England and Wales on 30 April 2019, including the course of the proceedings commenced by the mother in Lebanon, and M&#8217;s circumstances following that removal.  It is those elements of the background on which I intend to concentrate in this judgment.  Ms Renton makes clear in her Skeleton Argument that the dates of travel by the mother and M to and from the jurisdiction of Lebanon prior to M&#8217;s removal from this jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of Egypt on 30 April 2019 are not in dispute.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is right to note that the parents allegations against each other range far more widely than this.  The mother makes extensive allegations of domestic abuse and controlling behaviour against the husband, alleging that he has beaten her, monitored he electronic devices, accompanied her to the GP and attempted to remove M from her life entirely as punishment for ending the marriage.  The father, in a five hundred and seventy seven page statement filed well out of time, accuses the mother of fabricating allegations of domestic abuse to disguise a number of affairs during the course of the marriage.  Given the nature of the issues before the court, it is not necessary for me to adjudicate at this stage on the parents&#8217; numerous competing allegations against each other for the purposes of determining the legal question of jurisdiction and, if applicable, summary return.  Most regrettably however, it is right to note that the father stooped to including as exhibits to his statement naked pictures of the mother taken from a video, albeit with her breasts and genitals blocked out.  Whilst Ms Renton sought to contend that those pictures, (which have, by reason of the father&#8217;s actions, now been seen by the father&#8217;s legal team, the mother&#8217;s legal team, this court and court staff, in addition to the lawyers in Beirut in December 2018), are somehow relevant to the mother&#8217;s &#8220;credibility&#8221;, I received no adequate explanation of how such deeply personal material was relevant to the legal and welfare issues before the court.  I deprecate in the strongest terms the father&#8217;s conduct in exhibiting to his statement the private images to which I have referred.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Finally, the mother also asserts that the agreement she entered into with the father in Lebanon regarding custody and access in respect of M, and approved by the Lebanese court and embodied into the Lebanese court order dated 6 February 2019, was obtained by means of duress.  Ms Baker submitted that, given what she contends are the manifest barriers to the court recognising the order made by the court in Beirut, it was not necessary for the court to hear oral evidence in respect of the allegation of duress, the mother relying on her statement as evidence of the same and alleging in particular that the father threatened to disseminate embarrassing material (including the photographs I have mentioned) to the mother&#8217;s family.  Against this, the father relies on evidence before the court that he submits undermines the mother&#8217;s assertions of duress, including the fact that it was the mother who commenced proceedings in Lebanon, that the mother&#8217;s Lebanese lawyer drafted the agreement incorporated into the Lebanese order, that the mother benefited from legal advice throughout the process and signed the agreement having taken legal advice, that the agreement was ratified by the court in the presence of the mother who was legally represented before the court, statements made to the UK Border Agency in January 2019 and what the father says is a transcript of a voicemail left by the mother the tenor of which is that she was content with the agreement.   </p>

The mother joined the father in London and M was born in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2015.  The parents decided that M should be born in England in order that she could become a British Citizen based on the father&#8217;s then immigration status.  In September 2015 the mother returned with M to Lebanon in order to obtain a spousal visa for the United Kingdom, and remained with M in that jurisdiction for a period of little under a year whilst the father continued to work in London. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The mother returned with M to the jurisdiction of England and Wales in August 2016 having received her spousal visa and authorisation to travel.  At that time M was two years old.  The family lived together with the paternal grandfather in London.  Between March and May 2017 the family visited Lebanon in order for the father to receive medical treatment for a heart condition.  In December 2017 the mother travelled to Lebanon with M and remained there until February 2018, a period of some three months.  On their return to the United Kingdom, the mother and M again lived in the property of the paternal grandfather as the family home. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is of note that at all times during these extended periods in Lebanon, and prior to the removal of M to Egypt in April 2019, M&#8217;s family home remained the same, with no indication that either parent intended this arrangement to change.  Within this context, I note that in his claim before the Beirut court dated 16 November 2018 to revoke the mother&#8217;s custody of M, the father pleaded that the family &#8220;has resided in London, the United Kingdom quietly where the marital house exists&#8221;.  In September 2018 M was enrolled in nursery at the local Primary School.  She attended nursery from September 2018 save for a period between October 2018 and January 2019 following her paternal grandfather&#8217;s death.  She continued thereafter to attend nursery until 30 April 2019 when she was suddenly removed.  I note that, even at that stage, M&#8217;s childminder anticipated that she would resume her role with M in the United Kingdom and that the intention, as communicated to the nursery, was that M&#8217;s absence would be, as previous absences had, only be temporary, a letter from the nursery indicating: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The father contends that in March 2018 he discovered that the mother was having an affair.  The mother alleges that she was thereafter placed under pressure by the father to continue the marriage.  The mother once again travelled to Lebanon on with M on 29 October 2018 as a result of the sudden death of her father.  The father purchased airline tickets for the mother and M with a return date of 5 December 2018. The father contends that whilst he consented to M being taken to Lebanon, the mother thereafter wrongfully retained M in Lebanon by failing to return by the date she had stated she would, namely 5 December 2018.  Within this context father characterises the mother&#8217;s departure for Lebanon at the end of October 2019 as a decision to leave England with M permanently, following her becoming &#8220;fed up&#8221; with life in London.  He contends that on 1 December 2018 he found a handwritten note from the mother that he took as confirming her intention to leave the United Kingdom permanently.  Within this context, I note that that when the mother spoke to the police in this jurisdiction on 16 April 2019 she was recorded as describing herself &#8220;living in Lebanon&#8221; and that in her application to the Family Court sitting at Barnet made on 24 April 2019 the mother alleged that the father was seeking revenge on her because &#8220;I asked for a divorce and that I didn&#8217;t agree to get back to London to live there&#8221;. </p>

In that claim the father alleged that the mother had unlawfully retained M in Lebanon and had engaged in acts that &#8220;violate morals and decency&#8221; comprising marital infidelity and adultery such as to justify the revocation of custody under Art 24 of the Family Code. On 16 November 2018 mother also made a claim in the Lebanese court, for an order banning M from being removed from the jurisdiction of Lebanon.  Within this context, the father exhibits a WhatsApp message from the mother&#8217;s sister where her sister advised that the parents should keep discussions between lawyers, rather than communicating directly.   </p>

As I have noted, the mother alleges in her statement that the father threatened to send embarrassing electronic material to her family and that he would kill the mother and her family.  Within this context, and in the context of what she alleges was serious and persistent domestic abuse by the father during the course of the marriage, the mother asserts that she felt scared and intimidated and accordingly signed the agreement. </p>

The mother concedes in her statement that her lawyers advised her to sign the agreement and that she did so.  She has not sought to file evidence from her own lawyers on the allegation of duress.  In addition to these matters, which are set out both in the statement of the father and in an account provided by the father&#8217;s lawyer in Beirut detailing the circumstances in which the agreement was reached, the father also relies on what he says is a voicemail left by the mother in which she discusses the negotiation process.  On its face the transcript indicates that the mother indicates that she never wanted to make any amendments to the agreement, that her key concern, and that of her sister, in respect of M was to make the contact provisions more specific, that she was aware of and discussed the issue of relocation to Egypt with the father&#8217;s lawyer, that she objected to any apology being incorporated into the agreement and that she had agreed to go to Egypt but could not spend two months </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The precise date of the agreement reached between the parents is unclear. In the chronology prepared for private law proceedings it is suggested that this agreement was reached in September 2018 although there is no copy of an agreement with that date.  The mother suggests the agreement was signed by her on 31 December 2018, although as I will come to the document she exhibits to her statement in these proceedings to evidence that fact is actually a copy of the court order, albeit dated 31 December 2018, ratifying the agreement between the parents and recording their signature thereto.  The father exhibits the same order to his statement in the private law proceedings, which in translation is dated 6 February 2019, and asserts that the agreement between the parents was embodied into that order by the Lebanese court on that date.  It would appear the explanation for the discrepancy is that the mother signed what we would term a consent order on 31 December 2018 at her lawyers&#8217; offices and the court formally approved the order on 6 February 2019 in the presence the parties lawyers at court (the father being in the United Kingdom at this point).  The mother does not dispute that an order was made by the Lebanese court.  The father asserts that the judge asked the mother whether she agreed to the order and that the mother signed the order in front of the judge.  The mother contends she was not at the hearing. </p>

The mother has not provided a detailed explanation for the delay in issuing proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction although she states that she believed over the Summer 2019 that M would be returned to the United Kingdom in time to start school in September 2019 and that she needed to find a new solicitor, make an application for legal aid and prepare her statement in support of the application.  I note that the Form C66 makes no mention of the proceedings in Beirut or any consequent court order.  The mother&#8217;s statement in support describes the commencement of the Lebanese proceedings and the agreement entered into.  The father further asserts that the mother was well aware as at 6 December 2019, when the matter came before Judd J at a without notice hearing, that M was in Egypt pursuant to the order of the Beirut court and misled the High Court in this regard to obtain a location order with its associated passport provisions. On 6 December 2019 M was made a ward of court and a location order was granted.  The matter returned to court on 13 December 2019 when Francis J urged the father to return M to the jurisdiction of England and Wales voluntarily, which request the father declined, being prepared only to facilitate contact between the mother and M in Cairo and only if supervised by the paternal family. </p>

Within this context, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 FLR 1132" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 FLR 1132</ref> the Court of Appeal considered the proper interpretation of Art 10 of BIIa, which provides a scheme for retention of jurisdiction in the Member State from which the child has been allegedly abducted, but also includes provision for the retained jurisdiction to come to an end where the child has acquired a new habitual residence in another Member State and certain other conditions are satisfied. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re H</span> the Court of Appeal concluded that that part of Art 10 which governs the circumstances in which jurisdiction is lost by the Member State from which the child has been abducted must be read as applying only to another EU Member State.  </p>

As such, Art 10 will operate not only in respect of a child wrongfully removed to, or retained in a Member State, but will also operation in respect of a child wrongfully removed, or retained in a non-Member State.  In such circumstances, and subject to the qualifications set out in Art 10, the courts of England and Wales will retain jurisdiction even if the child thereafter becomes habitually resident in the nonMember State.  In such circumstances, the Court of Appeal has suggested that it will not be necessary to invoke the inherent jurisdiction where the court retains jurisdiction based on habitual residence under Art 10, although that latter point was not fully argued (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Jurisdiction)</span> at [54]). </p>

It is not necessary for me to descend to detail. The legal structure for these issues in an international private family case is plain. The court first determines whether or not the court in England and Wales has jurisdiction. It does so, depending on the countries involved, with or without reference to various international provisions. In a case such as this, which is not one between Member States of the EU, the approach is straightforward. The court decides jurisdiction and decides it with regard to the habitual residence of the child at the relevant time. That determination in this case has been made and is not open to review or challenge and was not open to review or challenge at the hearing before Newton J. </p>

The same is not true for foreign custody orders.  In declining to be bound by foreign custody orders, English courts are prompted by two considerations.  The first is that a custody order by its nature is not final and is at all times subject to review by the court which made it.  The second is that by statute the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration.  This has been interpreted to apply not only to domestic English cases, but also to cases involving a previous custody order made by a foreign court.  This approach has disadvantages: it can create uncertainty, and also instability in the life of a child, and it can encourage litigation as a parent, denied custody by a foreign court, seeks a more favourable decision in England.  A different approach is winning favour.  The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> gives effect in English law to two international conventions providing for the recognition of foreign custody and access decisions in certain cases.  The Rule will, however, continue to describe the approach of English courts to most custody orders made by courts outside the United Kingdom.&#8221; </p>

An order made very recently, no relevant change of circumstances being alleged, will carry great weight.  It is persuasive effect is diminished by the passage of time and by a significant change of circumstances, for example the removal of the child to another country or the supervening illness of one of the claimants.  The status of the foreign court, and the nature of the proceedings in and the legal approach taken by the court, may all be taken into account.  The effect of the foreign order will be weakest when it was made many years ago and has since been modified by consent and the child has nearly attained the age of his majority and so can decide for himself with which parent he wishes to live.&#8221; </p>

It follows that the strength of an application for a summary order for the return of the child to the country from which it has been removed, must rest, not on the so-called &#8216;kidnapping&#8217; of the child, or an order of a foreign court, but on the assessment of the best interests of the child. Both, or either, are relevant considerations, but the weight to be given to either of them must be measured in terms of the interests of the child, not in terms of penalizing the &#8216;kidnapper&#8217;, or of comity, or any other abstraction. &#8216;Kidnapping&#8217;, like other kinds of unilateral action in relation to children, is to be strongly discouraged, but the discouragement must take the form of a swift, realistic and unsentimental assessment of the best interests of the child, leading, in proper cases, to the prompt return of the child to his or her own country, but not the sacrifice of the child's welfare to some other principle of law.&#8221; </p>

A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle. But if he is already familiar with this country, has been here for some time without objection, it may be less disruptive for him to remain a little while longer while his medium and longer time future is decided than it would be to return.&#8221; </p>

For as long as the Texan order remains in force, his mother is most unlikely to allow, let alone to encourage, him to spend his vacations in America with his father. Whilst conflicting orders remain in force, he is effectively denied access to his country of origin. Nor has his mother been exactly enthusiastic about contact here. The best chance that K has of developing a proper relationship with both his parents, and with the country whose nationality he holds, is for the Texas court to consider where his best interests lie in the long term. It is necessary to restore the synthesis between the two jurisdictions, which the mother&#8217;s actions have distorted.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">M was and is a United Kingdom national.  Indeed, her parents specifically arranged for her to be born in the United Kingdom in order that she could benefit from this status.  Both her parents intended her to be a British national.  Within this context, the reason for M being in the United Kingdom was specifically to ensure she was a British citizen. English is M&#8217;s first language (although she is now learning Arabic successfully following her move to Egypt on 30 April 2019). Whilst M spent periods outside England and Wales, the evidence indicates that on each occasion she returned to what was considered to be the family home in London with her paternal grandfather.  The family home has been at same address in England throughout M&#8217;s life.  Between November 2018 and January 2019 her father actively sought her return to the United Kingdom. Within this context, in his claim before the Beirut court dated 16 November 2018 to revoke the mother&#8217;s custody of M, the father pleaded that the family &#8220;has resided in London, the United Kingdom quietly where the marital house exists&#8221;.  Indeed, as I have noted, there is evidence, in the form of the letter from the child minder, that even upon her removal from the jurisdiction on 30 April 2019 it was anticipated that she would return to the family home. When M commenced nursery, she did so in the United Kingdom in September 2018 and attended thereafter save for the period between October 2018 and January 2019.  There was no indication prior to 30 April 2019 of an intention on the part of either of her parents that she would be educated in any other jurisdiction. M returned to school in England on return from Lebanon in January 2019. Indeed, as I have again noted above, there is evidence, in the form of the letter from the nursery, that even upon her removal from the jurisdiction on 30 April 2019 it was anticipated that her absence from educational provision in England would be temporary.  </p>

In particular, there is no evidence to suggest that on these occasions her parents intended her habitual residence to change. The period between September 2015 and August 2016 was expressly for the purpose of the mother securing a spousal visa that would allow the mother and M back into the United Kingdom to live as a family in this jurisdiction, as was the mother&#8217;s intention at all times during that period.  The period in 2017 was in order for the father to receive medical treatment.  As I have noted, the period between November 2018 and January 2019 was one in which the father was actively seeking M&#8217;s return to the jurisdiction of England and Wales based on his assertion that M had been wrongfully retained by the mother in Lebanon and with the assistance of the FCO.  Save for the trip for medical treatment, M&#8217;s father remained in England during her absences. Again, throughout each of these periods M&#8217;s family home was considered to be in London.  </p>

I am satisfied that M had developed and maintained durable ties to the jurisdiction of England and Wales that constituted some degree of integration in a social and family environment in the jurisdiction of England and Wales in the period leading up to 30 April 2019.  Notwithstanding periods in Lebanon, prior to that date, M&#8217;s centre of gravity was in England, as was the centre of gravity of her parents.  Her family home was situated in the jurisdiction, she was being educated in the jurisdiction, both her parents had permanent leave to remain in the jurisdiction and her father was working here.  Members of her wider family also resided in the jurisdiction.  Accordingly, on balance, I am satisfied that as at 30 April 2019 M was habitually resident in England and Wales. </p>

In the circumstances, whilst Ms Renton asserts that, selfevidently, between 30 April 2019 and 26 November 2019 M was in Egypt, there is very little evidence before the court to demonstrate the degree to which she was, during this period, integrated in a social and family environment in the jurisdiction of Egypt.

That question is complicated in this case by the existence of the order made by the Beirut court on 6 February 2019, incorporating as it does the agreement reached between the parents that the father would have custody of M and would reside with M in either the United Kingdom, Egypt or some other location of his choosing.

Further, whilst the court does not have the benefit of expert evidence in respect of the law of Lebanon, I have borne in mind the information provided by the father&#8217;s Lebanese lawyers.  That information indicates the Lebanese court would have jurisdiction to entertain an application by the mother in respect of M under Art 75 of the Code of Civil Procedures based on the Lebanese nationality of the parents and M, notwithstanding M is plainly not habitually resident in that jurisdiction.  The letter states that the timescale for the determination of any application with respect to M would be no more than three months and would result in an immediately enforceable order, including by way of committal, subject to any stay granted by the Lebanese Court of Appeal.   The lawyer&#8217;s letter further asserts that any order made by the Lebanese Court would be enforceable in Egypt according to Part V of the Riyadh Agreement for Judicial Cooperation.  I have also considered carefully the fact that the father offers an undertaking not to enforce the penalty clause provisions of the order which place a penalty of $100,000 on the mother making an application to vary that order, the father&#8217;s submission the mother has a clear remedy in Lebanon, namely an application for the return of M from Egypt to Lebanon and for custody, and the father&#8217;s assertion that the Sunnite personal law tradition in Lebanon is that mothers are awarded custody of a daughter up to the age of 12. </p>

The mother has had no substantial contact with M since January 2019.  At present, the mother is having no contact with M despite the provisions of the order of the Lebanese court dated 6 February 2019.  Within this context, as matters stand, M is a British child who is not being afforded a proper opportunity to develop a relationship with her mother.  Having regard to the terms of the order of the Lebanese court regarding contact, for the father to simply state that the mother could travel to Egypt is no answer to this.  Within this context, on the evidence currently available to the court, and without making any findings at this stage, like Francis J I consider that without a judicial determination of the issues between the parties, the prospects of the father facilitating the level of contact contemplated by the Lebanese court order, and likely in any event to be in M&#8217;s best interests, is slim.  Indeed, given the current lack of contact, on its face the father&#8217;s statement that a child needs both parents rings hollow in the ears of this court.  As matters stand, the father is not affording the mother consistent, good quality indirect and direct contact with M, this notwithstanding that prior to January 2019 the mother was M&#8217;s primary carer.  This situation is fundamentally undermining of M&#8217;s relationship with her mother and will impact on her identity in circumstances where she is being deprived of a full relationship with her mother.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In addition, I am satisfied that there is a further important reason why it is in M&#8217;s best interests to order her return to this jurisdiction.  At present M is in a jurisdiction in which there is no one with parental responsibility for her.  The father has deigned to provide only limited information regarding M&#8217;s circumstances in Egypt, further exacerbating the disadvantages of such a situation being allowed to pertain.  I am satisfied that, in particular given her age, it is in M&#8217;s best interest for an order to be made returning her to the jurisdiction in which those with parental responsibility for her reside. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In reaching my decision, I have of course given very careful consideration to the fact that the Lebanese court made an order on 6 February 2019 dealing with the issue of custody, access and the locations in which M would reside.  Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, foreign custody orders are to be accorded respect by this court.  I am not however persuaded in the particular circumstances of this case, that the existence of that order can or should prevent this court ordering M&#8217;s return to this jurisdiction.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is plain that the level of access between M and her mother contemplated by the Lebanese court order is not taking place and, for reasons I have rehearsed above, is not likely to take place until a court has determined the welfare dispute between the parents.  In the circumstances, matters have moved on significantly since the Lebanese court made its order a little over a year ago.  As the authorities make clear, a custody order is, by its nature, not final.  This, together with the fact that M&#8217;s welfare is paramount means, as the authorities again make clear, that this court, if it has jurisdiction and is the most convenient forum, can form an independent judgment on the welfare issues now arising, giving such weight as is appropriate to the foreign judgment.  In that latter regard, the Lebanese court order expressly contemplates the United Kingdom as one of the countries in which M will live and gives specific authority for the same.  In the circumstances, an order for the return of M to the jurisdiction of England and Wales is not in any way outwith the circumstances contemplated by that foreign custody order.  Further, if having heard the matter this court determined that the mother should resume contact with M, it would be doing no more than the Lebanese order sought to achieve in February 2019 by expressly recognising and endorsing the agreement between the parents.  Were the court to go further and amend the custody arrangements as between the parents, this would be simply a reflection of the fact that the circumstances that pertained before the Lebanese court in February 2019 have changed in the twelve months since that order was made.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Having regard to the domestic authorities that deal with the wide nature of this courts discretion regarding the extent to which a foreign custody order is taken into account by the court, I do not consider it necessary to deal with the wider criticisms levelled at the order by Ms Baker nor, at this stage, with the allegations of duress raised by the mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In conclusion, and for the reasons I have given, I am satisfied that this court has substantive jurisdiction in respect of M.  Further, I am satisfied that the jurisdiction of England and Wales is the most appropriate forum to determine the welfare issues between the parties in this case.  Finally, I am satisfied that it is in M&#8217;s best interests to order her summary return from the jurisdiction of Egypt to the jurisdiction of England and Wales and I so order.  I will invite counsel to submit a draft order for my approval. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Finally, as I have noted, the father informed the court that he will shortly be making an application to the Home Office for British citizenship.  It should go without saying that this court will expect the father to comply with the orders made by the High Court of the nation in which he seeks now to become a naturalised citizen.  In circumstances where the court intends that the Tipstaff shall retain the father&#8217;s travel documents until M is returned to the jurisdiction of England and Wales, to achieve this the father will need to facilitate M&#8217;s return via an appropriate third party, as he was prepared to do, and did in January 2019.   </p>
