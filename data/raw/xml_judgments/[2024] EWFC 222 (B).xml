There were no findings of intended malice.  However, my reading of the judgment is that the father lacked the parenting skills to manage, at times, L&#8217;s challenging behaviour and, on occasions, reverted to overly physical intervention and acted out of frustration when L was misbehaving.  This caused some physical harm to L.  A summary can be found at paragraph 54 of the fact-finding judgment.</span></p>

The result is, sadly, that there was a gap of around two years without any direct contact between the boys and their father and it appears that this was for a number of reasons.  This gap has not been beneficial, and probably harmful, to the children and both parents.</span></p>

He will be able to meet some of the day-to-day needs of the children, be active in their lives and support them.  There is a strong support network in the UK with the maternal and paternal families.  The father has the support of his employer, he has flexible working, and he could assist more with the children.  They will remain in a country they know and have strong ties to, including school, health needs, and they will have some certainty.  They will build their relationship with their father and retain friends and support networks.  They, of course, will still be able to travel to Australia for holidays and spend time there.

The mother and the children really wish to go to Australia and, of course, if they remain here, that is likely to have an impact on all of them.

If they stayed here, they may need to be moved from the current location.  They may move more than once.

There is no application before me, there is still a great deal of uncertainty around financial proceedings and where the children may live, and I have no details before me in order to make a decision on schooling.  However, both parents share parental responsibility, and if they do not agree on any new school, that will have to be decided by the Court.  I note that the current school is just meeting the children&#8217;s needs, in particular L&#8217;s needs.  He is likely to require special school provision.  The father in his evidence told me how hard they fought to get L into this particular school.</span></p>

There is, of course, no application for a change of surname before me, nor any opinion about that from Cafcass.  However, the mother told me that she does not seek to change the children&#8217;s surname at all and is not intending on making any application to do so.  The children should not be known by the name of H, as the mother says, because they are both known as D.</span></p>

I emphasise to both parents that this is decision of the Court and certainly not one of the father.  My decision must not impact on the children&#8217;s relationship with their father.  However, I of course remain worried about the impact of my decision and how this will be communicated to them.  It is really, really important that it is done with great care and consideration.  </span></p>

I remain content to do so, if the parents so wish.  I have also indicated that I would be happy to see the children to explain my decision if that will help.  However, in light of their age and understanding, my preliminary view is that it would be better if I write a letter to both L and N for them to read when they are a bit older, or they might have some assistance in understanding it.</span></p>
