The application for registration is made pursuant to the provisions of the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention (the full title of which is the Convention&#160;on&#160;Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children) (&#8220;the 1996 Convention&#8221;).  </p>

Given that the mother agreed to the Order being registered, I determined the application at the hearing.  This is my approved judgment.</span></p>

Under the Order the mother is given permission to relocate the residence of the parties&#8217; child to the United Kingdom as from December 2013.  There are included within the Order a number of provisions stipulating what time the child will spend with the father and what other forms of contact will take place following the child&#8217;s relocation to England.</span></p>

In addition, pursuant to my responsibilities as one of the two judges for England and Wales (with Lady Justice Black) designated to the International Hague Network of Judges (&#8220;the IHNJ&#8221;), I was made aware of the Order in this case by Justice Bennett (who is, with the Honourable Chief Justice Bryant, designated to the IHNJ for Australia).

These were caused by a number of factors including, but not limited to, establishing whether any fee would be payable in respect of the application for registration and whether the application could be made by email.  It was surprising that the process appeared to lack clarity, given that a registration process for orders has been in existence for many years, and it certainly did not create the appearance of being a &#8220;simple and rapid procedure&#8221; as required under the 1996 Convention (as referred to below).  It was ultimately determined that no fee is payable and I made arrangements for the application to be accepted by email.  </span></p>

However, even though served with the application, r. 31.8 provides that submissions cannot be made by the respondent or any child at this stage of the process.  The opportunity to challenge recognition or registration is provided later in the process, namely by appealing the decision to recognise or register the order.  The absence of any right of challenge prior to this could be said to increase the obligations on the court.  However, in my view, this does not undermine the need to apply the provisions with a light touch by reference to whether the court has sufficient information for the &#8220;essentially administrative&#8221; purposes of recognising or registering the order.</p>

One of these is the issue of an application for the recognition or registration of an order under the 1996 Convention.  Given that no fee is payable in respect of such applications, it has been agreed that, at present exceptionally, such applications (in Form C69) can be submitted by email.
