	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">First, the oral evidence and the argument occupied six long days in court.  With the complete agreement of both parties and all their legal teams, and of the three non-party witnesses, I heard the whole case, and now deliver this judgment, live in an ordinary and public courtroom at the Royal Courts of Justice.  There were many twists and turns in the evidence, and indeed during the course of the hearing several original (not photocopy) documents had to be produced or prepared.  In my view, it would have been impossible to have a fair and effective hearing of this case by any "remote" or "hybrid" means, and I am very grateful to all concerned for their willing participation. </p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">I expressly recorded on the face of my order that day the following: " &#8230; the court today, in discharge of its duties under FPR rule 1, very strongly urged both parties to make a determined and open minded attempt to settle this case before substantial further costs are expended, and to avoid the destructive effect of a contested hearing."  At that stage, the combined costs of the parties were recorded on the face of the order as being about &#163;256,000.  The projected combined additional costs to the end of a final hearing were recorded as being about a further &#163;227,000.  That has come to pass, and the combined costs are now, in round figures, at least &#163;500,000, and probably more, because the hearing over ran. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">At the outset of the main hearing itself, I again implored both parties to find some compromise basis for settlement.  I warned them that a contested hearing could be very damaging to their relationship, as it has proved.  I pointed out to them that their open positions were, as they remain, very polarised.  The wife sought, and still seeks, &#163;5 million or even &#163;5.5 million.  The husband, relying on an alleged post-separation agreement which was substantially implemented, offers her nothing.  I pointed out that in that situation there is huge litigation risk for both these parties, and that wise people (which these parties essentially are) would strive to settle on some common ground between these two extremes. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Despite my very clear urgings, both at the outset of, and repeatedly during, the hearing, and despite my rising for an hour or more at the outset to enable the possibility of settlement to be further explored, there has been no settlement.  I deeply regret that fact, and the huge costs which have now been incurred, and the damage which has been done to this whole family. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Third, I have been immensely grateful to Miss Ann Hussey QC on behalf of the wife, and Miss Alexis Campbell QC on behalf of the husband, and to their juniors and the solicitors on both sides, for their sustained presentations and argument on behalf of their respective clients.  That does not make the central decision which I have to make (namely, whether to give decisive weight and effect to the alleged agreement) any easier, but the presentation of the case in the courtroom was a masterclass to behold.  I hope that both parties will feel, as they should, that their legal teams could not have done more for them. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In this narrative, and generally in this judgment, I will incorporate my findings of fact on the many disputed issues.  I make clear, therefore, that when I do make findings on disputed issues of fact, I do so on the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probability.  Although they have been separated for over ten years, the parties are still legally married to each other, there being a decree nisi of divorce but no decree absolute.  I will therefore refer to them as the husband or the wife, or at times as Ciaran or Sharon. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Both parties originate from, and were brought up in, the Republic of Ireland.  The husband was born in June 1968, and the wife in April 1969.  He is now fifty-two, and she is fifty-one.  Both migrated to England to work.  The husband was employed as a carpenter.  The wife was a trainee nurse.  They met in England when he was about twenty-one and she was twenty.  She was living in nurses' accommodation.  There is a sterile dispute about the precise point when staying overnight with a girlfriend merged into living together, but from some point during 1992 they were living together.  They were still young.  They each had modest incomes as a carpenter and a young nurse.  They had no other capital or money at </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The parties married in April 1994.  They bought their first home with a mortgage in 1995.  Also in 1995 the husband began to work, still as a carpenter, on a self-employed basis as a sole trader.  In 1998 he incorporated a company, Horohoe Construction Limited ("Construction" or "the company").  It began as little more than the husband and an occasional self-employed subcontractor carpenter; but it later grew, and it now flourishes.  </p>

The family spent Christmas 2009 together in Ireland, but in January 2010 the husband left again, never to return.  The duration of the premarital cohabitation and the marriage itself was thus about seventeen to eighteen years.  It makes no difference whatsoever whether it was a year or so more or less than that. </p>

The husband lived in temporary, and he says at times very makeshift, rented accommodation.  The children spent time with both their parents.  In late 2010 the wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, for which she received surgery, then chemotherapy and then radiotherapy.  I fully accept her account that the year 2011 was a very difficult year indeed for her.  She was receiving the painful and debilitating treatment; she was still caring for the growing children; and she renovated and moved into a new house, which remains her home, in Uxbridge Road, Hatch End.  This purchase was facilitated by a pay-out of &#163;1,076,500 which the parties received from a critical illness insurance policy as a result of her cancer. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The husband clearly has an eye for property development opportunities, and by 2012 the parties owned a desirable, if modest, portfolio of mixed residential and commercial properties.  The legal titles to some of these were embedded in a second company, Horohoe </p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">Properties Limited ("Properties"), which was also owned by the parties jointly and equally.  Additionally, the husband says, and I accept, that in the years following the near collapse of the western banking system in 2008, Construction had a very difficult period.  The main activity of the husband personally, and of Construction, had been (and again now is) carpentry and similar fitting-out work for other builders and developers.  This largely dried up during the post 2008 recession.  So, in order to keep trading, and to keep his subcontractors employed, the husband diversified for a period into buying properties which he and Construction renovated at cost, and then sold at a profit.  There was, therefore, a period of property trading by Construction which featured in the accounts of the company at that time, but which later ceased when the mainstream business of working as a contractor or subcontractor for other builders and developers resumed. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The husband says that it was only in about 2013 or 2014 that the company began to pick up again in this mainstream activity.  The husband says, and I accept, that in about 2012 the only direct employees of the company were himself and the wife, who was the company secretary.  Everyone else was a self-employed subcontractor or part-time office staff.  There was, he says, a lady called Marian, working three days a week in the office.  Marian had become his girlfriend, and by 2012 they were, as they remain, living together.  Another lady called Ann provided part-time, ad hoc, book keeping services through her own business.  </p>

In addition, there are six or seven full-time, but subcontracted, quantity surveyors and estimators, and approximately ninety on-site workers (a number which has increased, without generating any extra income for the company, by the need to employ marshals to supervise on-site during the COVID 19 pandemic). </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In 2012 the parties, who by now had been permanently separated for over two years but who remained amicable, clearly jointly contemplated separating out their assets, which at that time were almost entirely jointly owned.  The wife says that the husband said that it had </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">become urgent to do so if they were to avoid stamp duty on property transfers between the two of them.  There were discussions between them.  In addition, they have both known for many years a man called Maurice Cahill whose own business was then (he has since retired) that of an independent financial advisor.  He had been the financial advisor to both the husband and the wife for many years, including arranging their many mortgages, and indeed arranging the critical illness insurance policy from which they had benefited by over &#163;1 million. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Mr Cahill also considered himself to have been a personal friend of them both.  Having recently been through a very expensive divorce himself, Mr Cahill offered to assist the parties in their negotiations in order to avoid, or minimise, expensive legal costs.  The tragic irony is that an expenditure of perhaps a few thousands of pounds of legal costs in 2012 might well have saved and avoided the catastrophic expenditure of over &#163;500,000 now.  But hindsight is easy.  I heard oral evidence from Mr Cahill, and I do not doubt his sincerity and good intentions in 2012.</p>

Although Mr Cahill was later to use and amend these spreadsheets, he was adamant in his oral evidence that he could not personally have created the spreadsheets as he lacked the technical computer skills to do so, although he </p>

Mr Cahill said, and I accept, that the person who first prepared and produced the spreadsheets and schedules was the wife, and indeed there is an email from the wife to the husband dated 15 March 2012, now at bundle page H190, to which she clearly attached a number of documents which she had prepared.  Although the husband is clearly a shrewd and successful businessman, he has no accountancy training of any kind, and I am quite clear that as between the two of them, the wife was the more numerate. </p>

Goodwins complained to Aisling Collins that she had previously advised the wife in 2012 on a matter (namely the asset split) which was obviously still germane to any financial remedy proceedings between these parties.  By a letter dated 23 April 2019 Aisling Collins stated that the paper file from 2012 had been destroyed, and that she now had no recollection of the meeting with the wife in 2012.  She stated that she had considered the code of conduct and consulted with the Professional Ethics Team, and that the firm could see no basis to justify their declining to act for the husband.  So, EM Collins &amp; Co (whose name appears later to have changed to Collins &amp; Hoy) continued for a period to act on behalf of the husband, although they now no longer do so. </p>

Miss Alexis Campbell QC, on behalf of the husband, has not sought to argue that the letter of 11 October 2019 constitutes a waiver of privilege in relation to the whole letter of 10 September 2012, or that the whole letter of 10 September 2012 must now be disclosed.

Mr Cahill recalled that, being top copy letters, he had posted and not emailed them.  This recollection gains support from an email which the husband sent to the wife on 26 September 2012, now at bundle page H208, in which he told her that Maurice had told him that he was "sticking a copy in the post to both of us today". </p>

I intend, therefore, to refer in the rest of this judgment to "the agreement", meaning the terms contained in the letters and schedule of 25 September 2012, which do evidence an agreement between the parties which had been concluded and substantially implemented well before the commencement of these proceedings, and which both parties appear to have relied upon.

The husband was, and is, established in an apparently permanent relationship with Marian.  Since September 2016 the wife has been in a settled relationship with a man called Joe.  He frequently stays with her, although he still also retains his own home.  The wife is well settled in her home in </p>

In July 2018 the wife visited the Vatican, where she was assured by a priest that even if she divorced her husband, she could continue to receive Holy Communion.  Thus reassured, she decided to commence proceedings for divorce in March 2019.  The actual trigger may have been a dispute which arose at that time (the details do not matter at this stage) with regard to financing the eldest child, who was by then about to start at university. </p>

Without any prior warning to the husband whatsoever, and without any prior communication between the wife's solicitors and the husband, the wife presented a petition for divorce on 6 March 2019, which made allegations of unreasonable behaviour.  This was completely unnecessary since the parties had already been completely separated for over nine years, and there could have been a non-judgmental divorce based upon two years&#8217; separation and consent or, if the husband declined to consent, five years&#8217; separation.  Further, both parties were regularly committing adultery, as the other party well knew. </p>

The alignment of the written signatures and date with the typed words and dotted lines is exact.  Miss Hussey described the original as looking rather "war worn".  It certainly had the appearance of a piece of paper which is no longer new, or fresh or recent.  There are some creases.  Part of the right-hand side is torn or worn away.  Another tear is stuck with Sellotape on the back.  Examination of the original satisfied me, on a balance of probability, that the original document is not of recent creation, and could well date from its purported date of May 2007.  I am thus satisfied, on a balance of probability, that bundle page H167 is a photocopy of a genuine document signed by the husband and Mr O'Sullivan in 2007, and containing the terms, even if somewhat vague, of a contract between the company and Mr O'Sullivan. </p>

But if it is clear that a party is fully aware of the implications of an ante-nuptial agreement and indifferent to detailed particulars of the other party's assets, there is no need to accord the agreement reduced weight because he or she is unaware of those particulars.  What is important is that each party should have all the information that is material to his or her decision, and that each party should intend that the agreement should govern the financial consequences of the marriage coming to an end." </p>

Prior to the post 2008 recession, and again since about 2013 (and still now), the business and activity of the Construction company has been, as I have described, providing carpentry and other work as subcontractors to other builders and developers.  During, but only during, the recession, the company diversified into buying, renovating and then reselling properties in order to maintain work for the workforce, and to keep the company afloat. </p>

From the historic perspective of 2012 it might not have done, and might have continued property trading.  Who knew then? </p>

I would in any event recalculate Miss Hussey's net figure as &#163;2,486,091 minus &#163;547,477 (the inter-company loan), viz &#163;1,938,614, upon which CGT at 10 per cent (with entrepreneurs&#8217; relief) would be &#163;193,861, producing a recalculated net figure of &#163;1,744,753. </p>

In my view, I can, and should, isolate and remedy that unfairness now.  The rest of the agreement stands.  But there should be a further cash payment (or by agreement, property adjustment) to the wife now to correct the unfairness. </p>

It remains the case that the wife did not want to keep her shares in the companies.  She wanted security, and the less risk-averse assets.  The value of the shares was volatile and unpredictable, especially in the economic climate still prevailing in 2012.  The husband took risk-laden assets, and it is as a result of his endeavour since then, as well as the improved economic conditions for his business, that they have since greatly increased in value. </p>

Fairness required that she received a further &#163;500,000 in 2012.  That figure clearly requires now to be indexed to take account of the lag of eight years between then and now.  I was quoted a range of indices, including the FTSE 100, which increased by 8.33 per cent between September 2012 and May 2020; the CPI which increased by 13.5 per cent; the FTSE All Share which increased by 16.4 per cent; and the RPI which increased by 21.1 per cent.
