F gave his evidence on the first day and M on the second day. I was due to hear submissions on the third day and give judgment on the fourth. However on the morning of the third day I acceded to an unopposed application made on F&#8217;s behalf to adjourn to allow for the full probate file of M&#8217;s late father to be obtained from the courts of Country A, translated into English, and disclosed into the proceedings. I will set out the relevance of this later.</p>

The hearing on that date was ineffective as it transpired that M had not received a copy of the probate file or the SJE report (also in the language of Country A and translated into English) in relation to M&#8217;s late father&#8217;s will. This was as a consequence of M&#8217;s move from HM Prison X to HM Prison Y. Arrangements were therefore made for these documents to be couriered to her that day. Unfortunately these documents were not handed to her by the prison staff until around 11 am on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2024. M sought a further adjournment in order for her to have a proper opportunity to consider the same and given their centrality to F&#8217;s case this application was (reluctantly) not opposed on his behalf.</p>

About eight weeks later M unilaterally removed Child A from his school in County A where both parties were then living and moved with him to County B, a significant distance away. F received no prior notice of this removal and has confirmed that if approached he would not have so consented. The relocation led F to resign from his employment and he moved to County C in February 2017 to retrain for a different role.

However, I do take the view that the circumstances have to be exceptional. When two parties reach an ancillary relief clean-break order they are putting behind them their financial disputes. Normally the wife, but sometimes the husband, accepts the sum on a once-and-for-all basis. It is, in my view, a very high hurdle that has to be overcome for a mother to then bring a further application for financial provision by way of housing. If it was to occur it would of course be for a settlement of property order; it could not be an outright lump sum given the authorities.</span></p>

If the father had not incited others to kill the mother, and not been sent to prison for most of S's childhood, he would in all probability have been able to pursue a career which would have enabled him to support S in enjoying the sort of comfortable lifestyle which the father and mother enjoyed in earlier times. Furthermore, the mother would have been able to pursue her career as a nutritionist and make some substantial contribution to S's support.

Munby J (as he then was) stated at [103] that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[r]eferring to Rayden and Jackson Divorce and Family Matters (Butterworths, 17th edn), paras 21.60&#8211;21.62, Mr Mostyn asserts, and Mr Deacon does not dispute, that conduct under s 25(2)(g) of the 1973 Act does not have to have a financial consequence for it to be taken into account&#8221; </span>- and he agreed that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the husband&#8217;s conduct in abducting the children and depriving &#8230; them and the wife of that most basic human right, their mutual society, falls squarely within the class of case contemplated by Parliament&#8221; </span>when enacting the ancillary relief provisions. This case therefore also supports the proposition that conduct aimed at a child of the family might amount to conduct such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard. This proposition has obvious relevance to the present case.</p>

It was therefore suggested that the lump sum provisions could be used to circumvent the prohibition against ordering a second settlement of property. This was rejected on the basis that it would be a misuse of the court&#8217;s power. The judge held at [27] that lump sums are not designed to revert to the payer but are paid <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;once and for all and are used to reimburse past expenditure or are spent on current or future needs. To the extent that whatever was purchased with the lump sum is not consumed it will be retained for or by the child&#8221;</span>. Lump sum orders therefore do not revert to the paying party.</p>

This distinction is an important one. At [82] Moylan LJ stated that Williams J supported his decision <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;by interpreting the use of the word 'dependency' in the authorities as connoting 'some form of vulnerability or need continuing from childhood into adulthood which can be remedied by capital provision'. In my view, this does not support his decision because it is far too broadly expressed a proposition &#8230;&#8221;. </span>Whilst they are likely to overlap, they are not one and the same as &#8216;vulnerability&#8217; is a much broader category than &#8216;dependency&#8217;. Whilst &#8216;dependent&#8217; children may well also be &#8216;vulnerable&#8217;, dependency in my view implies some continuing and quantifiable financial need. Vulnerability is a broad spectrum on which many people fall, but not everyone with a vulnerability is &#8216;dependent&#8217; in the sense of requiring financial support.</p>

M&#8217;s explanation as to why she said she did not so expect was that she would have been so informed by either a solicitor and/or executor but no-one made contact with her and she had not received documents other than (i) one letter from Mr. LM dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2023 which said they had previously confirmed to F&#8217;s solicitors that they did not represent her, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;had not been mandated by you&#8221;</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;had not received any mandate from you in relation to the estate of [M&#8217;s father]&#8221;</span>; and (ii) her late father&#8217;s will which she received in late November 2023 via F&#8217;s solicitors.

Likewise M accepted that she had not sought estate accounts (or their equivalent in Country A) and said she would not do so unless I ordered her to do so.

The email said the court of Country A had informed him at the end of July 2022 that Mr. LM <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;who had been chosen by my sister&#8221; </span>had been accepted as executor. F&#8217;s evidence was that he believed from a conversation with M&#8217;s mother that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;[M] may originally have been the executor and disclaimed this and asked for Mr. LM to act as executor instead.&#8221; </span>In her oral evidence in December 2023 M stated that this was not true, and she did not choose or instruct Mr. LM. I have no reason not to accept what DS and M&#8217;s mother say, and it is also contradicted by the letter written by M to which I have referred above. When M was taken to this letter when recalled to give further evidence she accepted that she now had a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;vague recollection&#8221; </span>of writing to Mr. LM to this effect but could not recall when she did so. M also said that it was a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;friend&#8221; </span>(whose name she could no longer recall) who had given her Mr. LM&#8217;s details.

Given it is clear that M wrote to Mr. LM I reject her original evidence which was to the effect that she was given indirect legal advice via friends in Country A that if the solicitor who reads the will saw (as in M&#8217;s case) that she could not be executor and was in prison they would instruct an alternative one. M&#8217;s letter also suggests that she was aware that her father had a will and that she was executor of the same. Her evidence that her letter should have said she did not wish to be executor <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;in case there is a will&#8221; </span>was unconvincing and I reject the same;</p>

However I was provided with (i) a Notice of Acting filed by Mr. and Mrs. K&#8217;s legal representatives dated 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2021; and (ii) a copy of the order made by His Honour Judge ZA on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2021 which recorded that (a) in in attendance on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2021 only (Day 1) were Mr. and Mrs. K; and (b) Mr. and Mrs. K&#8217;s application issued on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2021 (shortly before the IRH) for leave to pursue an application for a child arrangements order or special guardianship order had been dealt with as a preliminary issue and refused on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2021.

I do not take this into account given (i) this information was only provided for the first time in evidence; and (ii) I have no idea as to the level of this financial provision save that my impression was that as it is principally by way of birthday and Christmas presents since Child A&#8217;s birth (as is often the case within families) it is likely to be (in relative terms) a fairly moderate sum; and (iii) M's knowledge that this provision was still being made was either months ago (in the case of Child A&#8217;s great aunt) and several years ago via their great aunt (in the case of their grandmother). Therefore although Child A will be able to access this sum at age 18 it will not in my view provide a resource that could be used to house Child A during their dependency after that age.
