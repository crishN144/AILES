The reasons for this depressing amount of delay in concluding the case are numerous, but can be summarised as emanating from a combination of the scarcity of court time and, rather more significant as a contributory factor, a serious of missteps and failures by the LA.  At this hearing, the LA urges me to adjourn the case so that the delivery of various therapeutic and other interventions and the assessment of their efficacy can take place under the scrutiny of the ongoing proceedings.  To accede to this application would be to see the case concluding probably some time in 2025, so in its fourth calendar year.</span></p>

The LA had completed an updated parenting assessment.  This, again, proposed the case conclude then and there, with no orders and a CIN plan.  This was the third time the LA had proposed that there need be no order and that a CIN plan could adequately protect the children.  While the CG (and, less surprisingly, the parents) supported the LA position, I could not yield to the unanimity with which I was presented.  The risk assessment, such as it was, was of the very lowest quality.  I made clear my misgivings and listed the case for a final hearing, before me, to take place on 29 January and 5 and 6 February 2024.</span></p>

That process was instructive, if profoundly depressing.  As seemed to be the case from the written report, the updating assessments were characterized by the complete absence of either rigour or logic.  Although the parents both continued entirely to deny any wrongdoing, except, possibly, a very minor lapse in supervision on M&#8217;s part (which I had expressly found not to have been the cause of the injuries), and notwithstanding that not a single member of the extended family, on whom any protection plan would need to rely, accepted even the remotest possibility of any abusive act on M&#8217;s part, the LA continued to contend that the children would be more than adequately protected by a CIN plan.  (My judgment of 6 February 2024 contains a far fuller critique of the LA witnesses&#8217; written assessment and oral evidence at paragraphs 30 &#8211; 46 and 60 &#8211; 75.)</span></p>

This tendency to repress undesirable characteristics is likely to have an impact on the scores on the Personality Index and may underrepresent the extent and degree of any significant findings in some areas due to [M]&#8217;s difficulties in acknowledging negative or unpleasant aspects of herself. [M]&#8217;s results show that she tends to have very high levels of inflated self-esteem, expansiveness and grandiosity. Her evaluation of self concept involves a generally positive, and, at times, perhaps uncritical self-evaluation. There may be some variability and uncertainty associated with this self-concept, particularly in the face of scrutiny or criticism from others. Nonetheless, self-esteem is likely to be maintained in such situations through attributing responsibility for setbacks to some external cause rather than to personal failings. </span></p>

She likely has difficulty asserting herself or effectively displaying anger in relationships; past experiences in this regard have probably led to conflicts that she appears motivated to avoid. She describes herself as a very meek and unassertive person who has difficulty standing up for herself, even when assertiveness is warranted. Therefore, she may have some difficulty in the appropriate expression of anger. This submissive style is probably driven by anxiety about potential rejection or abandonment by others. She will tend to feel helpless and overwhelmed under relatively mild pressure and will dependently seek the assistance of others. Her motivation to maintain relationships may potentially provide situations where others are taking advantage of or exploiting her. </span></p>

Scores on this inventory show [M] to have a dependent personality indicating that she tends to withdraw from adult responsibility and will seek nurturing from others, needing excessive advice and reassurance. She probably has an excessively cheerful and optimistic attitude towards interpersonal difficulties as a way of maintaining relationships in the face of difficulties. Alongside this dependency she exhibits avoidant characteristics tending to withdraw as an emotional protection. She is probably hypersensitive to criticism and disapproval and will anxiously look to others for any form of negativity towards her. [M] is likely to overreact to innocuous comments or behaviour towards her, viewing this as a criticism and a possible attack on her fragile self-esteem. She will vacillate between a desire for affection and fear of being rebuffed. [M] showed elevations on the paranoid personality scale, indicating that she has heightened defences and may project her poor self-esteem onto others.

His personality profile suggests an individual experiencing high levels of anxiety.  This, in conjunction with high levels of stimulus-seeking behaviour makes it likely he will be impulsive in his nature and engage in risky behaviours without considering the consequences.  F can also be passive aggressive, meaning that his relational style often involves indirect or ambiguous communication.  When the underlying feelings of resentment, anger or hostility, which typically fuel passive aggressive behaviour, are not addressed openly, they can worsen and cause relational difficulties.  F has a particular difficulty processing his emotions and speaking to others about his feelings.  Hence, he and M have never addressed his extra-marital affairs or spoken about them face-to-face; nor had he and M, at the point of F&#8217;s interviews with Dr Thomson, spoken about what had happened when Q received his injuries.

She said herself that she was finding it difficult to cope on her own prior to [Q] being hurt.

The upshot of that meeting was that the level of supervision has been increased to take account of the experts&#8217; concerns, such that virtually all of M&#8217;s time with her children is now supervised by a member of the family.</span></p>

The social worker, I was told, even after the evidence had been heard &#8216;considers that the chances of [M] injuring [Q] again are remote&#8217;, and, as this is a single-issue case, with no other features of concern, such as substance misuse or neglect, it can and should conclude now without orders.&#8217;</span></p>

The advent of this procedural safeguard and the good practice guidance (which received the subsequent imprimatur of Sir James Munby PFD) had the effect of the practical removal in large part of the import of one of the differences between placement with parents under a care as opposed to a supervision order, i.e., in both cases, absent emergency circumstances, a return to court would be likely as a prelude to the removal of the subject child from the parents with whom it is placed.</span></p>

This provides that any such placement has to be approved by a senior nominated officer, and can only be approved if, in all the circumstances, and taking into account the services to be provided by the responsible authority, the placement will safeguard and promote the child&#8217;s welfare and meet their needs.</span></p>

It can only be justified if it is necessary and proportionate to the risk of harm to the child.  Where such an order is made there will be a real prospect of further litigation in the future, because the responsible local authority should regularly review whether the care of the child is such that the order is no longer necessary, and if so an application to discharge the order should be made.

When this fact was eventually demonstrated and judicially found, an expert psychologist and a very experienced independent social worker were instructed.  Thus it was, thanks to the assessments which flowed from that instruction and due in no small part to the replacement of the previous social work team, that the LA eventually came to appreciate that this is not a case of low risk, but a case in which there is a very significant risk of potentially extremely grave physical harm.  By that stage, the index children had been back home &#8211; with inadequate protective measures in place &#8211; for over a year.  That said, all evidence suggests that the quality of the care they had received had been high, they were loved and thriving in the care of their parents, and no further harm had befallen either of them and nor had any further significant issue arisen.  In many ways, this has been a case of contradictions; and it is no simpler by virtue of this fact.</span></p>

When this starts, allowing as seems likely and humane, a couple of weeks for M to adjust to the recent loss of her grandmother, it may be as long as twelve weeks for her individual therapy (mirrored by a partially concurrent eight-week course of therapy for F), followed by another eight weeks of couples&#8217; work.  There may or may not be a separate parenting programme, and, if so, whether this overlaps or is consecutive to the other work remains to be seen.  There will then follow assessments of progress by Dr Thomson and Ms Roberts.  On any view, then, all of this will take the family towards or to the very point of the end of the year.</span></p>

The risk against which my order is designed to protect these children is of very serious physical harm, possibly worse.  While the LA plan, crafted as it has been in the image of the expert recommendations, is appropriate and sufficiently robust, the care orders which I propose to make are, in my judgment, proportionate to the risks to which the children will be exposed if matters were to take a certain course.  It is a very significant complicating feature of this case that, although it is nearly 20 months old, the therapy, so urgently required by the parents, and the robust family group meeting, so very necessary from a child protection point of view, have yet to begin or take place.</span></p>
