Speed was of the essence. T<span style="color:#000000">he situation facing the court was so urgent and the consequences so desperate that it was wholly impracticable to attempt anything other than the briefest of hearings. There was no time to get everyone to court. </span>The Official Solicitor, Mr Laurence Oates, reacted in the manner which generations of judges have come to expect of the successive holders of that distinguished office. He came over to court himself at very short notice. Such was the urgency that there was no time for me to give judgment before making the order. I now set out the facts and explain why I made the order I did.</p>

The doctor&#8217;s notes record her as being a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness and show that the surgery then planned was to take place using erythropoetin to stimulate blood production without the use of blood products.</p>

Her father tells me that as she left she said to her brother, in the presence of her maternal aunt, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to die.&#8221; She was admitted on 21 April 2003 to the Adult Intensive Care Unit of the first defendant, a well-known London Teaching Hospital, where she is under the care of a consultant, Dr B. He tells me in a written statement dated 2 May 2003 that on admission AE was &#8220;clearly in extremis and had signs of overwhelming septic shock secondary to bacterial endocarditis&#8221;. During this period of severe sepsis she had sustained significant damage to her peripheral circulation with extensive necrosis of her hands and feet which would likely require debridement or partial amputation &#8211; surgery which would be impossible without significant blood loss.</p>

During what Dr B calls &#8220;extensive and frank discussion&#8221; with the mother and other members of the family the consequences of this inaction were made clear: AE would have a very significantly increased risk of death,  trivial haemorrhage could be fatal and the emergency valve surgery which she would require would be impossible. The mother and her relatives remained adamant that the hospital should abide by the Advance Directive &#8220;despite the greatly increased risk of death&#8221; and treatment continued accordingly.</p>

With what Dr B describes as &#8220;aggressive intervention&#8221;, including volume resuscitation, high dose vasopressors, steroid therapy, activated protein C and high volume haemofiltration, AE&#8217;s condition was eventually stabilised. She no longer required vasopressors or renal support. Steps were taken to minimise blood removed for routine testing and haemopoesis was stimulated with erythropoetin and iron. </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Her condition has subsequently deteriorated with evidence of continued sepsis either arising from her heart or from her gangrenous feet. In parallel there has been a further decline in her haemoglobin level &#8230; and a progressive rise in her blood lactate level, suggestive of an impending terminal decline. It would seem inevitable that she will die within the next 24 hours with the current treatment that she is receiving, but that blood transfusion might slow or even reverse this deterioration. It is however by no means clear that blood transfusion would ensure her survival given the advanced state of her illness.&#8221;</p>

Attached to Dr B&#8217;s statement were copies of the Advance Directive and the hospital notes for 29 November 2002. Ms Vahib, the claimant&#8217;s solicitor, had had no time to issue the proceedings but had notified the hospital that she was making an urgent ex parte application. Dr B&#8217;s statement had been faxed to court accompanied by a letter addressed to me from the Trust&#8217;s corporate and legal services apologising that no-one from the Trust would be in attendance at court due to the late notice that, understandably, the Trust had been given. Ms Vahib told me that the Official Solicitor was on his way to court: Mr Oates arrived very shortly after the hearing had begun. He and I read the papers as quickly as possible. </p>

The Official Solicitor addressed me briefly, but did not seek to persuade me to any different conclusion. I then made the order that is set out at the end of this judgment.

Society&#8217;s interest is in upholding the concept that all human life is sacred and that it should be preserved if at all possible.

It is clear that in an emergency a doctor is entitled in law to treat by invasive means if necessary a patient who by reason of the emergency is unable to consent, on the grounds that the consent can in those circumstances be assumed. It is, however, also clearly the law that the doctors are not entitled so to act if it is known that the patient, provided he was of sound mind and full capacity, has let it be known that he does not consent and that such treatment is against his wishes. To this extent an advance indication of the wishes of a patient of full capacity and sound mind are effective. <span style="font-style:italic">Care will of course have to be taken to ensure that such anticipatory declarations of wishes still represent the wishes of the patient. Care must be taken to investigate how long ago the expression of wishes was made. Care must be taken to investigate with what knowledge the expression of wishes was made. All the circumstances in which the expression of wishes was given will of course have to be investigated.</span>&#8221;</p>

If there are no formal requirements for a valid advance directive there can equally be no formal requirements for the revocation of an advance directive. Nor can it make any difference whether the advance directive was itself oral or in writing. An advance directive, whether oral or in writing, may effectively be revoked either orally or in writing. The popular term &#8216;living will&#8217; may be misleading. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Will4and1Vict/7/26" uk:canonical="1837 (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict.) c. 26" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The Wills Act 1837</ref> does </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">not </span><span style="color:#000000">apply to an advance directive. An advance directive does not need to be in writing and signed, nor need it be attested by witnesses. Nor, unlike a will, can an advance directive be revoked only by physical destruction or by another document in writing. To put the point plainly. I have no doubt that, in principle, a written advance directive can be effectively revoked orally. So can an advance directive executed under seal.</span></p>

An irrevocable advance directive is a contradiction in terms and is, in my judgment, a legal impossibility. An advance directive is, after all, nothing more or less than the embodiment of the patient&#8217;s autonomy and right of self-determination. A free man can no more sign away his life by executing an irrevocable advance directive refusing life-saving treatment than he can sign away his liberty by subjecting himself to slavery.

But this is not because the advance directive as such either is or has become irrevocable &#8211; it has not. It is simply because there is now no-one who is able to revoke it.

Suppose that in the present case, before lapsing into unconsciousness and at a time when she was manifestly competent, AE had told her doctors, in the most solemn terms and in the presence of an Imam, that she had renounced her faith as a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness and rejected Jehovah, that she had then made solemn profession as a Muslin speaking the formal words of that faith (&#8220;There is but one God and Mohammed is his prophet&#8221;) and had then told her doctors in terms that, being no longer a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness, she repudiated the Advance Directive and wished to receive blood transfusions if they were medically indicated &#8211; can it seriously be suggested that the Advance Directive would nonetheless remain in force merely because she had lapsed into unconsciousness before executing a document in writing in the terms required by paragraph 2(d)? Of course not. The very suggestion is unthinkable. </span></p>

An apostate is not to die because he may have stipulated that no change of his mind on a matter touching his faith is to be effective unless uttered in the presence of witnesses. It matters not what may have brought about the patient&#8217;s change of mind, assuming that he is acting voluntarily and of his own free will. In the present case AE seems to have been influenced by a wish to return to her original faith in order to marry a Muslim. She is not to be criticised for that. But the point is wider and more general than that. If the patient has changed his mind it cannot matter what his motives may have been. We may applaud the Christian Martyrs who stood steadfast in their faith before the lions in the amphitheatre. But a secular system of law founded on the freedom of the individual cannot hold bound to his previous written statement a patient whose courage fails him as he is wheeled into the operating theatre, whatever he may previously have said in writing.</span></p>

It may be words said to have been written or spoken by the patient. It may be the patient&#8217;s actions &#8211; for sometimes actions speak louder than words. It may be some change in circumstances. Thus, it may be alleged that the patient no longer professes the faith which underlay the advance directive; it may be said that the patient executed the advance directive because he was suffering from an illness which has since been cured; it may be said that medical science has now moved on; it may be said that the patient, having since married or had children, now finds himself with more compelling reasons to choose to live even a severely disadvantaged life. It may be suggested that the advance directive has been revoked, whether by express words or by conduct on the part of the patient inconsistent with its continued validity. It may be suggested that, even though not revoked, the advance directive has not survived some material change of circumstances. But whatever the reasons may be, once the issue is properly raised, once there is some real reason for doubt, then it is for those who assert the continuing validity and applicability of the advance directive to prove that it is still operative. The burden of proof is on them. And, as I have said, what is required is clear and convincing proof. If there is doubt that doubt falls to be resolved in favour of the preservation of life. So, if there is doubt the advance directive cannot be relied on and the doctor must treat the patient in such way as his best interests require.</span></p>

Too ready a submission to speculative or merely fanciful doubts will rob advance directives of their utility and may condemn those who in truth do not want to be treated to what they would see as indignity or worse. (I am acutely conscious of, and trust I am properly sensitive to, the profound sense of violation that Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses feel if forced to submit to blood transfusions against their will.) Too sceptical a reaction to well-founded suggestions that circumstances have changed may turn an advance directive into a death warrant for a patient who in truth wants to be treated.  </span></p>

There will be cases in which, as I have said, there will need to be especially close, rigorous and anxious scrutiny. </span></p>

Since it is quite clear that the Advance Directive was founded entirely on AE&#8217;s faith as a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness &#8211; that is made clear beyond argument by the very terms of the Advance Directive itself &#8211; it seems to me that it cannot have survived her deliberate, implemented, decision to abandon that faith and to revert to being a Muslim. When the entire substratum has gone, when the very assumption on which the advance directive was based has been destroyed by subsequent events then, as Lord Donaldson put it in <span style="font-style:italic">In re T</span>, &#8220;the refusal ceases to be effective&#8221;. The advance directive ceases to have effect, whether or not expressly revoked by the patient. AE&#8217;s rejection and abandonment of her faith as a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness deprives the Advance Directive of any continuing validity and effect.

I do not doubt that the hospital found itself in a very difficult situation and one calling for great sensitivity. And I do not know how much of what the father has now told the court had previously been brought to the hospital&#8217;s attention. But may I remind the medical profession and those who administer hospitals or are responsible for giving advice to the medical profession of what Lord Donaldson said in <span style="font-style:italic">In re T </span>at p 115D:</p>

This step should not be left to the patient&#8217;s family, who will probably not know of the facility and may be inhibited by questions of expense. Such cases will be rare, but when they do arise &#8230; the courts can and will provide immediate assistance.&#8221;</p>
