This agreement records that I is a French citizen;  that the father has acknowledged paternity and that, since July 2001, his permanent home has been established in London, whereas the mother&#8217;s home has been established in France. The agreement also records that the parties &#8220;are now petitioning the Family Affairs Judge of the Paris Regional Court to give official approval to their agreement covering both the financial aspect of (I&#8217;s) maintenance and education as well as the matter of the transfer of her place of residence to England.&#8221;</p>

An agreement was recorded about how I would spend her holidays and the other parent&#8217;s written agreement was to be required if it was necessary for I to travel anywhere outside England and France.  The father was to pay &#8220;the rental, upkeep and charges&#8221; of the apartment occupied by the family, and he was in due course to pay I&#8217;s school fees and medical expenses. His contribution to I&#8217;s &#8220;maintenance and education&#8221; was set at &#163;3,000 per month, payable in London and index-linked (dependent upon the family&#8217;s place of residence). He was also to pay all I&#8217;s and the mother&#8217;s travel expenses between Paris and London. The parents agreed that &#8220;the aforementioned financial provisions&#8221; constituted &#8220;a full and all-encompassing financial agreement&#8221; covering I&#8217;s needs in England.

Although this is puzzling, I do not think that anything turns on the discrepancy. There was a joint application by the parents, which was dated 4 June 2007 and which &#8220;requested official recognition of an agreement settling new living arrangements for their daughter because her father is resident in London&#8221;. </p>

As the judge records, the agreement &#8220;appears to meet the child&#8217;s needs&#8221;.  The judge (Annie Bergougnous) goes on to make what are described as a series of &#8220;orders&#8221; reflecting the terms of the agreement. These include the payments of &#163;3,000 per month. The court also &#8220;takes formal note&#8221; of the fact that the mother &#8220;agrees not to take legal action in England for the purpose of seeking a contribution towards I&#8217;s maintenance and education&#8221;; and that the parties had agreed &#8220;to seek mediation in the family court in the event of difficulty&#8221;.</p>

In a statement dated 22 December 2009, she says she has been &#8220;very unhappy&#8221; in London. Her case under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is that the father has ceased to make the additional payments summarised in paragraph 12 above, and that her application to the English court was designed, essentially, to clarify the full extent of the father&#8217;s obligations to I prior to her relocation to Paris. </p>

She also seeks the payment of her costs which amount, I was told, to some &#163;138,000.

Wide scope was given to the term &#8220;judgment&#8221; in Article 32, and there was no doubt, he argued,  that the French judgment of 24 September 2007 was a judgment for the purposes of  this case and the application of Brussels 1.</p>

If this court were to make an order that would perforce entail consequences which were mutually exclusive vis-a-vis the French order, and thus irreconcilable with it.

It could not therefore be suggested that an agreement that the French courts would have jurisdiction when the parties were living in England would lapse when the party who had agreed not to apply to the English courts was intending to return to live in France. Moreover, Mr. Scott argued, it had to be remembered that Article 23 referred to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;</span>disputes in connection with a particular legal relationship.&#8221; In the commercial context a jurisdiction clause in standard terms of trading might be applicable in relation to more than one transaction.

Brussels 1 deals with three topics. They are: (1) jurisdiction; and (2) and (3) the recognition and the enforcement of judgments.  Despite the exclusive jurisdiction clause, the French judgment (for that is what it plainly is) was, under Brussels 1, capable, as Mr. Scott recognises, of being both recognised and enforced in England. In my judgment, as I think Mr. Scott was minded to concede in argument, it was also capable of variation in England. In my judgment, a variation would not be irreconcilable with the French decision: it would, by definition, start with the French order and be a variation of it. Equally, such a variation would not, in my judgment, be in breach of Article 36 of Brussels 1 since it would be a variation based on a change of circumstances. That change, moreover, is inherent in the agreement itself, which envisaged the parties sharing an apartment in London. This did not happen, and as a result the father made financial provision for I which was different (and more generous) from that which had been agreed and ordered.</p>

She submitted that the mother did not receive legal advice on the point at the time she entered into the April 2007 agreement or when she consented to the ratification of the altered agreement in September 2007. She could not therefore, Miss Lister submitted, be said to have knowingly agreed not to make an application for provision in England. Miss Lister also submitted that there was no power to contract out of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Specifically on Article 23, Miss Lister submitted that if the mother were to choose not to relocate with I to France it would be absurd if the English court were not to have jurisdiction to make orders for I&#8217;s support. She pointed to the father&#8217;s acceptance that the court in England had jurisdiction in non-financial matters relating to I pursuant to Article 8 of Brussels 2. She asked rhetorically whether the father was asserting that if the Court in this jurisdiction declined the mother&#8217;s application to take I to live in France, or if the mother chose not to go as a result of the lack of agreement as to the arrangements for I, the court still had no jurisdiction to hear financial issues?  That, she argued, would leave I in limbo and potentially without support.</p>

It was correct &#8211; see Article 5(2) - that once the mother&#8217;s habitual residence was France, she could no longer sue the father in England for maintenance debts.  If it was correct that he was domiciled in France &#8211; he had never disclosed anything connected to his immigration status &#8211; he could only be sued in France after the mother&#8217;s country of habitual residence became France.  She submitted that father&#8217;s ability to hide behind his reluctance to disclose details of his own position had no bearing on the mother&#8217;s need and entitlement to have financial issues relating to I dealt with in this jurisdiction.  However, the effect would be that the mother&#8217;s claim for capital provision for the benefit of I could not be pursued. In these circumstances, the mother could not be said to be &#8220;forum shopping&#8221; but the father could.</p>

In so far as Miss Lister&#8217;s submissions go to jurisdiction, however, they seem to me wholly without force. For example, it is simply not open to Miss Lister to argue, as she did, that the mother did not receive proper advice before entering into the agreement or being a party to the application to the French court. In my judgment, the mother is bound by the agreement and the subsequent court order. There is not a jot of evidence to support the mother&#8217;s argument that she was not properly advised.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is true that the terms of neither the agreement nor the judgment are &#8220;exclusive&#8221; but it seems to me plain that the parties envisaged any disagreement between them would be resolved either by mediation or by court order in the French proceedings. The critical phrase in Article 23 is: &#8220;Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless the parties have agreed otherwise&#8221;. Have these parties &#8220;agreed otherwise&#8221;? I do not think they have. The evidence is all the other way.  The mother firstly said it was not her intention to litigate in England and then, in the court order, she agreed not to apply here.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Had the mother sought to register and then to vary the French order here, she would, no doubt, have been met with the same arguments as to jurisdiction, but at least she would have had Brussels 1 material to counter them. As I have already stated, there was a powerful case for variation, as the Paris agreement had not been implemented, and the parties were living in separate accommodation. The mother did not follow this course because of the father&#8217;s initial generosity.  But in my judgment, if the mother was to proceed in England, registration and variation remained (and remains) the right course.</p>

Such an argument might have force if there were no other remedy, but that is patently not the case.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It follows that on the second limb of Mr. Scott&#8217;s argument, I greatly prefer his submissions. I do not think that, on the facts of this case, the mother is entitled to bring proceedings under Schedule 1 in relation to I. This is not because she had said she would not, but because of the terms of the terms of Article 23, the terms of which I have set out in paragraph 32 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am reinforced in this conclusion by several factors, of which I will identify two.  The first is that Article 23 appears in section 7 of  Brussels 1 which is entitled <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">&#8220;Prorogation of jurisdiction&#8221;</span>;  furthermore, it plainly makes sense for there to be one set of proceedings rather than two. The second is that the mother &#8211; as I have already stated - is in no sense left without a remedy.  Had she chosen the enforcement in England / variation route her argument might well have been stronger. However, she did not do so and as it is, this is plainly a French case, between two parents one of whom intends to live in Paris with the child involved, both of whom speak French as their native language, and who between them have a French child who will be living in France. It is plainly open to the mother to apply in Paris for a variation of the order in the event that it proves impossible for such a variation to be negotiated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I am therefore sympathetic to the argument that the mother would prefer to know where she stands before she moves, such an argument does not, as it seems to me, go to jurisdiction. In my judgment the English court does not have the jurisdiction to entertain the mother&#8217;s summons, which will be dismissed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For completeness, I add that if I am wrong about jurisdiction, then, for the reasons I have already advanced, I would not exercise the English jurisdiction to make a substantive order in the mother&#8217;s favour. The mother already has the benefit of an order. She and the child will be living in Paris. A French court, if called upon to do so, is far better able to adjudicate upon  the support to be made for a French child  living with her mother in France, even if her French father is living in London. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What follows is not strictly necessary for my determination, but needs, nonetheless to be said. It is in my judgment most unfortunate that this family should have to spend so much time and money on this ultimately sterile issue. Both parents should re-think. The mother must not use I as a weapon against the father. She should not artificially delay her return to Paris in order to put herself in what she would perceive to be a stronger negotiating position. Any attempt now to change tack and apply to register the French order in England would be plainly perceived as &#8211; indeed it would be - a tactic. Equally, the father must not use his wealth as a weapon against the mother. It is in I&#8217;s interests that she should move comfortably to Paris: it is not in I&#8217;s interests that her mother should feel impoverished or resentful. Both parents need to pause, draw breath, and negotiate a future which is calm, peaceful for I and in her best interests.  If that cannot be achieved by negotiation (and in this respect it behoves the father to be magnanimous) the parents should seek the expert mediation of the French court, as they agreed in 2007. Only if all else fails should they resort to further litigation.</p>
