	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned in this case with H, who was born on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2001 and is therefore 15 &#189; years of age.  H is presently subject to an Interim Care Order, having initially been made a Ward of Court.  His parents are M (the Mother), aged 53 and F (the Father), aged 67.  In August 2016 I approved the Local Authority&#8217;s Interim Care Plan permitting H to move from the St Mary&#8217;s Hospital, London to a residential unit in Hammersmith, where he continues to reside.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter is listed before me for a 15 day fact finding hearing.  The case has generated 40 volumes of evidence.  A chronology has been prepared by the Local Authority but virtually every aspect of H&#8217;s childhood, education and medical treatment is the subject of different interpretations or impressions between the parties.  Thus, even a bare chronological outline presents a challenge.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H is referred to throughout the documents, both those generated in hospital and in the legal proceedings, as having &#8216;complex needs&#8217;.  Certainly H&#8217;s present situation is complicated and requires patient, skilful intervention, but I, for my part, would draw back from burdening him with this label.   What can be said for certain is that H has been diagnosed with a connective tissue disorder which is associated with joint laxity, bowel problems, pain and hypermobility.  H also has orthostatic tachycardia.  This, as I understand it, is a relatively unknown but, nonetheless, common condition affecting the autonomic nervous system (the blood pressure control system), causing an increase in heart rate on standing.  It can produce a range of heart symptoms which include dizziness and blackouts, palpitations, breathlessness and chest pain.  The condition can also be associated with hypermobility (high range of joint movement) which can cause joint discomfort or pain. Fatigue is often a prominent feature.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Neither one of these conditions is &#8216;life limiting&#8217; and I have been told by Dr Nelly Ninis, Consultant Paediatrician, that there is no reason that H cannot live a full and active life.  Whether it is genuine or not, both H&#8217;s parents have paid tribute at this hearing to Dr Ninis&#8217; skill and expertise.   In the circumstances, I can see no reason why they would take issue with her encouraging diagnosis of H&#8217;s potential.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H has been subject to multiple medical interventions.  He has been heavily medicated on opiates and spent lengthy periods in hospital throughout his life including: The Great Ormond St Hospital (GOSH), The Royal London and St Mary&#8217;s.  H has been within the purview of the Local Authority&#8217;s Disabled Children&#8217;s Team since he was 8 years of age. <span style="font-family:Garamond"/>He was most recently in St Mary&#8217;s Hospital, Paddington, between November 2015 and September 2016, where the lead consultant in charge of his care was Dr Ninis.  In March 2016, the Local Authority received a referral from the hospital raising numerous concerns about the parents&#8217; behaviour towards hospital staff and their general care of H.  A strategy meeting was convened on 17.03.16 and an Initial Child Protection Case Conference on 18.04.16.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 15.04.16 H&#8217;s mother was arrested for allegedly tampering with H&#8217;s medical equipment, which I will address in detail below.  On the 26.04.16 H&#8217;s father was arrested on a separate allegation of tampering with H&#8217;s medical equipment. Both parents were bailed pending further investigation.  Bail conditions required there to be no contact with H other than supervised by the Local Authority.  During the police investigation various statements were taken from health professionals in respect of this alleged tampering.  In addition, the police requested a report from Dr Ninis.  In early November 2016 the police confirmed that no further action would be taken on the tampering allegations made against both parents and bail conditions were discharged. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At a hearing on the 22.07.16 the court ordered the removal of H&#8217;s Hickman Line (a feeding line that H had been using for some time).  The removal was supported by the treating medical team, the Local Authority and H&#8217;s Guardian.  The Hickman line was successfully removed in early August.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During these proceedings the court ordered the instruction of a Consultant Paediatrician, Dr Yadav, to undertake a paediatric overview of the case.  This was to include an analysis of: treatment and medication received by H; the parents&#8217; co-operation with professionals; any suggestion of exaggeration or fabrication of symptoms or conditions by the parents.  The instruction was supported by the parents and, as I understand it, it was they who identified Dr Yadav as suitable to undertake this forensic exercise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I turn to the allegations specifically, I should like to record two further important factors.  Firstly, H wishes, more than anything else, to be able to leave institutional care.  He would very much like to go home to live with his parents.  This strikes me as so instinctive as to require no further comment.  Secondly, Dr Ninis told me, in powerful language, what in her view, the future medical/emotional/educational objectives should be for H:</p>

Firstly, in respect of the tampering with the pump, the evidence is now clear that the tampering caused an alarm which stopped the pump; thus making it impossible for any air bubbles to enter [H]&#8217;s system. The LA therefore accept that the tampering did not and could cause direct physical harm. However, the LA contend that the mere fact of tampering by his parents, which [H] has since learnt of, has exposed him to emotional harm particularly given that he was so anxious about his pump. Secondly, in respect of misusing medication the LA accept that the evidence is not that the parents overused medication by administering more than was prescribed but rather that they did not cooperate with the weaning programme, a subtle but important difference. </span></p>

Ms Bazley QC, on behalf of M, has consistently signalled the importance of forensic rigour.  She identifies the &#8216;potential unfairness&#8217; of placing reliance on disputed records and the inherent dangers of relying on hearsay evidence.  Notwithstanding the 40 bundles of evidence filed in the case Ms Bazley identifies deficiency (correctly) in the absence of the Chelsea &amp; Westminster Hospital records or any notes of the &#8216;psychological intervention&#8217; by Ms Becky Armstrong during the period January 2016 until September 2016. </p>

Hearsay evidence is, of course, admissible in family proceedings but &#8230;.a local authority which is unwilling or unable to produce the witnesses who can speak of such matters first-hand, may find itself in great, or indeed insuperable, difficulties if a parent not merely puts the matter in issue but goes into the witness-box to deny it.

But direct evidence from those who can speak to what they have themselves seen and heard is more compelling and less open to cross-examination. Too often far too much time is taken up by cross-examination directed to little more than demonstrating that no-one giving evidence in court is able to speak of their own knowledge, and that all are dependent on the assumed accuracy of what is recorded, sometimes at third or fourth hand, in the local authority's files.</span></p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.58in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">It is a common feature of care cases that a local authority asserts that a parent does not admit, recognise or acknowledge something or does not recognise or acknowledge the local authority's concern about something. If the 'thing' is put in issue, the local authority must both prove the 'thing' and establish that it has the significance attributed to it by the local authority. The second practical and procedural point goes to the formulation of threshold and proposed findings of fact. The schedule of findings in the present case contains, as we shall see, allegations in relation to the father that "he appears to have" lied or colluded, that various people have "stated" or "reported" things, and that "there is an allegation". With all respect to counsel, this form of allegation, which one sees far too often in such documents, is wrong and should never be used. It confuses the crucial distinction, once upon a time, though no longer, spelt out in the rules of pleading and well understood, between an assertion of fact and the evidence needed to prove the assertion. What do the words "he appears to have lied" or "X reports that he did Y" mean? More important, where does it take one? The relevant allegation is not that "he appears to have lied" or "X reports"; the relevant allegation, if there is evidence to support it, is surely that "he lied" or or "he did Y". 11. Failure to understand these principles and to analyse the case accordingly can lead, as here, to the unwelcome realisation that a seemingly impressive case is, in truth, a tottering edifice built on inadequate foundations.</span></p>

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority's case was that the father "lacks honesty with professionals", "minimises matters of importance" and "is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance". May be. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise. The local authority's evidence and submissions must set out the argument and explain explicitly why it is said that, in the particular case, the conclusion indeed follows from the facts.&#8221;</span></p>

The weight to be given to records, which may be disputed by the parents, will depend, along with other factors, on the Court&#8217;s assessment of their credibility generally.   Here, the reliability of the hearsay material may be tested in many ways e.g. do similar issues arise in the records of a variety of unconnected individuals? If so, that will plainly enhance their reliability.  Is it likely that a particular professional e.g. nurse or doctor would not merely have inaccurately recorded what a parent said but noted the exact opposite of what it is contended was said?  The reaction of witnesses (not just the parents), during the course of oral evidence, to recorded material which conflicts with their own account will also form a crucial aspect of this multifaceted evaluative exercise.  At the conclusion of this forensic process, evidence can emerge and frequently does, which readily complies with the qualitative criterion emphasised in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re A</span> (supra).  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Early records of M&#8217;s complaints begin with her admonishments of the teaching staff at the private preparatory school where H had been enrolled.  At the centre of the dispute was a conflict between the perception of the school as to H&#8217;s physical abilities and M&#8217;s insistence that he was less physically capable than he appeared.  The conflict between M and school led to vituperative criticism of the teaching staff and, eventually, withdrawal of H from the school.  Subsequently, there are multiple complaints against the Royal London Hospital, Dr Rawat (treating clinician), a battery of nurses and virtually all involved in H&#8217;s treatment at the Great Ormond St Hospital.  What these complaints have in common is their extreme and uncompromising use of language and the fact they invariably strike at the heart of the professional competence of the individual complained of.  It is important to consider the impact of these complaints because they are key to understanding the distorted dynamics between the family, H and the medical staff in the hospitals.  These relentless complaints generated, in my judgement, an atmosphere of wariness, distrust and general confusion.  It is also clear that they resulted in a general unwillingness to confront M or to challenge her views and assertions.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not believe that M failed to understand the impact of what I find to have been, her loud and bombastic behaviour towards others.  On the contrary, I consider that she was fully aware of it, deliberately deploying it, to get her own way and to silence any resistance.  A few weeks in December 2015 provide a convenient forensic example.  On the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015 there were no fewer than 9 separate complaints recorded &#8216;by parents&#8217; in relation to H&#8217;s care.  Whilst I am satisfied that these were driven by M, I have equally no doubt that F was a willing cipher.  On the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015 M is described as &#8216;loud and verbally aggressive&#8217; to the Matron of the ward.  M is recorded as calling the Matron a &#8216;liar&#8217; and though there was much demand on nursing time M required H to have a one to one nursing ratio, despite the absence of any objectively evaluated or clinically driven need.  On the 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December M was again aggressive to staff asserting that she was doing everybody&#8217;s job for them (a recurring theme of her complaints, observed by many nurses).  As Christmas approached M threatened that whoever was on consultant duty on Christmas day would &#8216;not be able to leave the cubicle&#8217; as she will be &#8216;ranting and raving&#8217; at them all day.  To my mind this signals very clearly her level of awareness of the impact of her behaviour.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is difficult to understand how this behaviour was permitted to continue.  Dr Ninis told me that the nurses had become intimidated and afraid of M.  I also sensed that from the demeanour of some of the nurses who gave evidence before me.  Dr Ninis reports that a number of the nurses who had dealings with M are still receiving counselling support, some 5 months after their last contact with her.   This I find to be telling.  Two of the nurses who gave evidence at this hearing (Nurse Sigg and Sister Davis) both told me that they had barely heard H speak during their time caring for him.  The phrase &#8216;passive&#8217; was used by a number of witnesses to describe H&#8217;s presentation.   I have heard that he is otherwise an articulate and intelligent young man.  I consider that his voice was not heard in the hospital situation because it was ultimately drowned out by M.  In this tense, unhappy and fraught situation the channels of communication between patient and medic had been sabotaged by M&#8217;s bullying behaviour.  It is clear, on a review of the records, that it was M who communicated with the staff, for most of the time.  It was she who assessed and reported H&#8217;s pain levels.  It is almost impossible to find an example of nurses undertaking their own independent evaluation.  What is clear however, is that the nurses frequently considered H&#8217;s behaviour (he was often to be found tapping away on his computer) to be inconsistent with the levels of pain M was describing.  It is significant that M does not really directly challenge this feature of the evidence.  She believes it was she who was best placed to assess her son&#8217;s pain.  Such was her dominance, that she appears only to have needed to request additional pain relief for it frequently to be provided without resistance.  </p>

The confused clinical scenario, which M was able to create, undoubtedly led, as events have shown, to a regime of treatment and an approach to H&#8217;s care that was entirely inimical to his welfare.  I do not doubt that it is for this reason that some of the nurses have been &#8216;traumatised&#8217;, to use Dr Ninis&#8217; word, by their experience in this case.  Even Dr Ninis who is an experienced, impressive and, if I may say so, independent minded person told me that she found herself regularly having to devote &#8216;half her week to H and his parents&#8217;.  This was notwithstanding that there were other patients who genuinely and, on occasions desperately, required her attention.  Much of this chaos was due to M&#8217;s manipulative harnessing of the complaints process, her bombastic manner towards medical staff and the barrage of emails sent virtually everyday.  All this, I consider, ought properly to be indentified as bullying.  In her evidence, Dr Ninis said that in 28 years, this was the most difficult case she has ever had to manage.  By this she did not mean that H&#8217;s condition was exceptionally challenging (it is not!) but that organising any structured routine of treatment and care defied any strategy that she was able to put together.  </p>

Dr Ninis is particularly interested in children with hypermobility syndrome and dysautonomia.  For this reason H appeared especially fortunate in having Dr Ninis responsible for his care.  When Dr Ninis first became involved with this case in 2012 the parents were at loggerheads with the GOSH.

Ms Brown, acting for H&#8217;s Guardian, identifies this as a key development in M&#8217;s escalating control of her son&#8217;s presentation.  I was very surprised to hear the mother tell me in her evidence that it was Dr Ninis who had suggested that H obtained a wheelchair.  It is certainly correct to say that Dr Ninis was persuaded by M&#8217;s argument.  Chiefly, in my assessment, she was influenced in her judgement by the difficulties with accessibility at the parents&#8217; accommodation.  It is however a total distortion of the history to say, as M contends, that the wheelchair was, in effect, Dr Ninis&#8217; idea.  It is paradigmatic of the way M distorts information.</p>

I have been told that H now orders sour sweets on Amazon Prime and that they are delivered to him.  This came out unexpectedly, at least to me, during the course of F&#8217;s evidence.  I am not sure whether Dr Ninis or H&#8217;s present consultant is aware of this but it should be passed on to them both.  Dr Ninis has traced the evolution of her care for H in a detailed but succinct report, dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2016.  Perhaps the most striking feature of the report lies in its analysis that, since 2012 and ongoing, M has been convinced or at least representing that H&#8217;s condition is immeasurably more serious than it truly is.  On 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016 Dr Ninis relates that she was presented with a Facebook post made by H&#8217;s mother.  It reads as follows: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The &#8216;devastating news&#8217; was in fact that the parents had been informed that a discharge planning meeting was to take place for H the following week.  Dr Ninis told me this was arranged because H had progressed in physiotherapy to the extent that he was assessed to be able to manage at home with the community physiotherapy service.  M says that her &#8216;devastation&#8217;, the word she accepts using in her Facebook post, resulted from her despair that nothing had been accomplished for H in hospital.  Further explaining this in her oral evidence M said &#8216;I didn&#8217;t believe he was dying&#8230; it was worse&#8217;.  Mr Verdan describes this response as &#8216;unconvincing and bizarre&#8217;.  I agree.  With respect to Ms Bazley, who advances M&#8217;s case in a measured and careful way, this aspect of M&#8217;s evidence tortured belief.  I reject it entirely.  The simple fact is and it requires to be stated unambiguously, M was presenting H to the outside world as a child who was dying.  He was not.</p>

M did not dispute this but asserts that she did not mean to imply that this was somehow &#8216;end of life care&#8217; but regarded it as a reference to pain care specialism.  Again, I reject that.  M is an educated and articulate woman, she knows well that palliative means terminal.  This was the impression she intended to convey and is consistent with the broader canvass of evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I was struck by the observations of the nurses who gave evidence that they had very few conversations with H.  On my assessment, M was and to a large extent remains, the conduit by which H&#8217;s views are communicated to the outside world.  My overwhelming impression, not least from the parents themselves, is that the mother/son relationship is stiflingly, almost claustrophobically enmeshed.  I have no hesitation in concluding that H was talking about dying because his mother had generated this morbid narrative between them.  I note from one of a number of examples that during the course of occupational therapy and physiotherapy on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015, H enquired why he had to do physiotherapy&#8230; &#8216;as it won&#8217;t stop the inevitable&#8217;.   When he was asked what he meant by &#8216;the inevitable&#8217;? he said &#8220;well what do you think it is?&#8221;.  A week earlier H had been speaking to a Dr Lucas with whom he also expressed concerns &#8216;about death and dying&#8217;.  Of course, all this when viewed through a wide forensic lens, further undermines M&#8217;s explanation of the Facebook entries.  </p>

F is by no means as voluble or as intimidating as M but, having heard his evidence, it is plain that he takes the same dystopian view of H&#8217;s health as his wife does.  F has recorded and/or filmed professionals on a number of occasions.  F has also filmed H in pain.  It is more than mere coincidence that H insisted on filming his first meeting, a few months ago, with his new consultant Dr Begent.  In this H merely mirrors his father&#8217;s oppositional behaviour towards the medical profession.</p>

This has been discussed by myself, Dr Platt and Dr Rawat. His liver is at risk of cirrhosis and failure due to the long-term administration of TPN. The best protection against this is to have a low volume of feed with drugs that help the liver. It has proved to be impossible to start this feeding regime before [M]&#8217;s arrest (at the time of writing this report, he is on 25mls /hr without any problems or pain related side effects). [M] has always claimed he wouldn&#8217;t be able to tolerate the feed. Morphine based drugs reduce gut motility as a side effect; and we stated repeatedly that the morphine needed to be reduced to protect his gut and liver. </span></p>

There was a weaning plan made to decrease the doses of this medication. At the end of this weaning plan, he was to be converted onto a morphine equivalent. When I was sent the weaning plan from RLH, I noticed that he would have ended up on 160mgs morphine a day instead of 80mgs ( plus the other medications he was on, therefore the daily dose of morphine would have been in excess of 300 mgs/day)  This would have represented  a vast increase in daily morphine dosage. The pain team at Royal London Hospital stated [M]&#8217;s claimed he was on 10-20mgs  oromorph up to 8 times a day. He was in fact on a total of 80 mgs oromorph a day as a ceiling, to be given as 20mgs doses or 10 mg doses as required but no more. It is my belief she misled the team. The pain nurse at the RLH, Ulricke Sigg agrees that she was misled and is writing her own report. When I insisted that a further wean took place, [M]&#8217;s obstructed this.

It was my impression of Ms Sigg that she continued to struggle to understand what had been happening in the hospital with H.  As a caring, professional nurse she appeared unable to comprehend, on an emotional level, the facts which confronted her.  A somewhat obtuse consequence of this was to render her evidence particularly clear and convincing.  She had no hostile animus towards M and was extremely courteous to her throughout.  In response to Ms Brown she was clear that the escalating use of morphine in H&#8217;s case was entirely contrary to her own professional experience and her understanding of good practice.  She also told Ms Brown that M&#8217;s discovery of a leaking pump, delivering H&#8217;s analgesia, was an unprecedented event in her own experience.  Later it is recorded that M suggested that the leaking pump presented a risk that H had not received all his medication.  </p>

We know that H had difficulties with gut motility, Dr Ninis informs us that this is also a side effect of morphine based drugs.  It is the case that H has not (aged 15 &#189; years) attained puberty.  I have been told that opiates impede sexual maturation.   I have heard the extent to which H slept and his limited communications with the nursing staff, which it seems reasonable to attribute, in part, to the inevitable lethargy of &#8216;a very high level of morphine to be on long term&#8217;,  as Dr Ninis put it.  There were clear medical signs that H&#8217;s liver was compromised and at risk of cirrhosis and failure.  This was due to long term administration of TPN but inevitably exacerbated by high level of opiate use.   Additionally, it seems to me only logical to infer that H will have developed both a psychological and physical dependency on these drugs and that withdrawal will have involved discomfort and distress.  Perhaps most important of all as I have emphasised, M&#8217;s duplicity created a confused clinical situation which increased the prospect of medical error which might easily have led to serious repercussions for H.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> / 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2016 the Local Authority contends that M deliberately tampered with H&#8217;s TPN line.  It is the case that a TPN has to be set up by two people, the second checking the process.  These are the guidelines at St Mary&#8217;s Hospital.  On the night of the 13/14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, Sister Davis was responsible for setting up the pump and Nurse Henry was, in effect, the &#8216;checker&#8217;.  The pump has been here in court and I have had it explained to me how it works.  The nurses proffered their own account of its functioning but the definitive explanation came from Ms Moira Kallis (a qualified nurse now specialising in training for the use of the mini rhythmic PM and Ambulatory Pump for the infusion of parenteral nutrition and fluid).  Ms Kallis has been employed in this capacity for 5 years.  She qualified as a state enrolled nurse in 1982, a registered general nurse in 1984 before becoming a community nurse and regional nurse manager.  Her present role fits well with her experience because, as she reminded me, this particular pump is ambulatory i.e. it is designed for home use.  Although that should have been obvious to me from what I had read, in fact, it came as rather a surprise.  This is because H has been bed ridden and inactive for so long.  To illustrate her point Ms Kallis told me that one of her patients using such a pump is a very successful competitive kayaker.  Ms Kallis had no experience of a line ever having become trapped in any pump of this type at any stage of her career.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The line that the food flows down is separately loaded into the pump under a clear plastic hinged cover.  The line fits exactly into a moulded area with a hinge screen door which, when closed, secures it to the pumping section.  The line will only fit in the device this way, otherwise the small hinge flap will not shut.  Ms Kallis told me that this is designed to avoid &#8216;user error&#8217;.  The clear larger lid clips closed and fits the corresponding part of the device leaving no gap.  I found it difficult to open the clips.  Those familiar with it however had little difficulty.  Key to its understanding is that it operates in &#8216;a clutch bag&#8217; fashion.  The whole structure fits very tightly.  For my part, I could not easily see how anybody setting this up could accidently trap the line.  Moreover, both Sister Davis and Nurse Henry were clear that they had primed the line and that the pump was running before being set up in H&#8217;s room.  Ms Kallis made it clear that the pump can not run if there is an occlusion.  Because it was thought that H struggled to tolerate feeding, initially the pump would run at a much slower rate before &#8216;ramping up&#8217;.  Even so the pump would alarm within a short time of a blockage or occlusion.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am entirely satisfied, from the witnesses&#8217; accounts and from the pump recordings, that the pump was operative when set up in H&#8217;s room.  Both nurses gave a clear description of the line being trapped within the case when they responded to the alarm.  If I am convinced, as indeed I am, that the line was set up properly by the nurses, then I find it very difficult to contemplate a situation in which the line could have become trapped accidently in this very compressed structure.  I remind myself that this is an ambulatory device designed to be used by those with active lives.  It seems to me quite impossible for the line to have become trapped haphazardly, in the way that Ms Bazley hypothesises on behalf of her client.  Ms Kallis rejected that as a realistic explanation, as do I.  For the avoidance of doubt I find that M deliberately tampered with the TPN line.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Contrary to what the Local Authority appeared to understand at the commencement of the hearing, the trapping of the line did not compromise H&#8217;s health or safety in any way.  The device cuts out as soon as the alarm sounds.  Mr Verdan postulates that M, having been banned from using the pump a few days earlier, pursuant to Dr Ninis&#8217; directive, was motivated to prove the nurses to be incompetent in their use of the pump.  I confess the same explanation had occurred to me but it can only be speculation.  This said however, it is inherently dangerous for a parent to manufacture alarm in a clinical situation.  It is a further way by which confusion and anxiety is generated in the hospital ward, which is in itself inimical to H&#8217;s care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case lightning struck twice! The mother was arrested and interviewed and for a period was prohibited from having contact with her son.  On the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2016, whilst the father was having contact with H, precisely the same incident recurred.  Again the line was trapped in the plastic cover in circumstances which were strikingly similar to the first episode.  In the light of my reasoning above, the real issue on this occasion is not whether it was deliberate or accidental but who did it.  I was unsure until I heard the evidence of F.  Though I will set out my impression of him more generally (below) I found the father&#8217;s account to be hollow and unconvincing.  He told me and I broadly accept, that he habitually had left H&#8217;s feeding and medical care to M.  He also stated that he was uncomfortable with the TPN device.  It is unusual therefore, that presented with an apparent alarm, his first reaction was to telephone somebody (either M or his solicitor) rather than run immediately to get the nurse.  Whether F was uncomfortable with the TPN or not, it was very clear from his evidence that he was entirely familiar with the principles of how it operated.  He was also, to my surprise, as familiar with the 40 files of evidence in this case as M was and equally fluent in medical terminology. I have no difficulty at all in concluding that F deliberately trapped the line.  Why he should have done so is again speculation but I think it likely to have been a desperate and bungled attempt to assist M.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Crucial to H&#8217;s health and development is his need for physiotherapy.  During the course of this hearing the family presented me with a bundle of photographs taken between 2012 and 2017.   They make disturbing viewing not least because some of the activities, sailing and camping etc., indicate a physicality which is difficult to reconcile with parental concerns about H&#8217;s health at the time.  Striking are two photographs in the summer of 2012, one showing H sailing a Laser dinghy on the Thames in physically challenging circumstances, the other showing him in a wheelchair with an NG tube in place and a blanket over his knees.  The tube can not easily be reconciled clinically.  Dr Ninis is very clear that H is capable of normal physical activities for a child of his age.  She has repeatedly impressed this on the parents as they both accept.  M&#8217;s position is that she supports H participating in physiotherapy and claims she has always done her best to facilitate it.  Ms Brown points to multiple references to M actively preventing physiotherapy from taking place.  Some, but by no means all, are incorporated by Ms Brown into a schedule which I propose to incorporate into this judgment and requires no amplification:</p>

I do not propose to do so other than to record that she has been polite, courteous and respectful of the process.  There has been none of the voluble behaviour that characterised her time in the various hospitals.  However, as is clear from my reasoning above, I found her an entirely unreliable and dishonest witness.  Moreover, I found her approach to this litigation to be artificial and unconvincing.  She has in the past condemned Dr Ninis in withering and offensive terms.  At this hearing, in her evidence, she was keen to deliver a paean of praise.  As Ms Bazley had cross examined Dr Ninis on the basis that she held <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;strongly negative views of the parents&#8217;,</span> this was not immediately easy to reconcile.  M&#8217;s position in the witness box simply, in my judgement, illustrated once again her capacity to articulate what she believes to be expedient at that particular moment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I found it much more difficult to evaluate F.  Part of the challenge as Ms Morgan QC and Mr Momtaz QC, have emphasised, on F&#8217;s behalf, is that many of the records refer to &#8216;the parents&#8217; without necessarily clarifying whether this relates to one or both.  Inevitably this was not easy to tease out in the course of oral evidence, given the passage of time.  This raises a wider point.  It is axiomatic that when keeping medical records, particularly for children, they are recorded as accurately as possible.  Children frequently have to rely on adults to communicate their symptoms.  Whilst I appreciate that it is easy to be fastidious in the relative calm of a courtroom and that circumstances on a busy ward are much more challenging, it is not unduly challenging to indicate, in the notes, who is describing the symptoms.  The problem is frequently more pervasive e.g. a history given by a parent that a child is in obvious pain is not recorded helpfully if the note states: <span style="font-style:italic">child in obvious pain</span>. Later review of note may create the impression that this has been independently observed by a doctor or nurse.  This strikes me (and Dr Ninis endorses my observation) as unsatisfactory both clinically and forensically.   I record this view not to be in anyway critical of the extremely conscientious medical personnel in this case but to exchange experience in order both better to protect and diagnose children in future cases.  </p>

This is the consequence of their actions for which they and not H are responsible.  H&#8217;s challenging behaviour is the result of the harm inflicted upon him for which he must not be blamed but in respect of which he must now take responsibility.  Counsel have made extensive submissions as to the manifestation of this learnt behaviour.  However, I do not think it necessary further to burden this judgment with the details of it.  I think it would be counter-productive to do so and, after careful reflection, I do not think it is forensically necessary.  One point which does require to be recorded is that H shares his parents&#8217; profound and in the circumstances of this case, entirely irrational opposition to psychological support.

The local authority indicated at the advocates&#8217; meeting that it would be proposing a return of [H] to the care of his parents but with a supervision order in place.  That necessarily requires the threshold conditions to be met.
