	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue before me is whether to lift in whole or in part a Transparency Order made by Francis J on 14 March 2023 which, in summary, prohibits the publication (by any means, direct or indirect) of the names of, or any information that would identify, ST, the family of ST, the applicant Hospital Trust, the hospital(s) attended by ST, experts, treating clinicians and any health/care professional engaged with ST. That wide-ranging order was expressed to last &#8220;until further order of the court&#8221;. However, as the parents, who were acting in person, opposed the order, the judge provided that it should be considered at the next hearing. The judge also ordered that all future hearings should take place in public, but subject to the Transparency Order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">ST at the time of the hearing before Roberts J was 19 years old. She had spent about a year as a patient in intensive care. She had a rare, progressive mitochondrial disease with a number of health problems including impaired sight, hearing loss, gait disorder, muscle weakness, bone disorder, kidney disease and lung damage. On 14 and 17 July 2023, ST had two episodes of hypoventilation, becoming unconscious and seriously ill. She stopped breathing.  Her blood oxygen fell to dangerously low levels. She required life-saving interventions.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Court of Protection proceedings had started in February 2023 with a challenge to a Lasting Power of Attorney granted by ST on 20 November 2022. On 20 July 2023, the Trust applied for authorisation to move to a treatment plan of palliative care, involving a much less invasive treatment regime.  Life-saving treatment would be withdrawn by removal of the dialysis, and there would be no further attempt to resuscitate in the event of a major respiratory arrest.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application came before me on 26 July 2023. It became apparent that there was a substantial issue about ST&#8217;s capacity to litigate and to make decisions about her medical treatment. ST herself was expressing opposition to the Trust&#8217;s proposed care plan and withdrawal of treatment. She supported exploring experimental treatment potentially available in Canada, an option strongly advocated by her family, but which was considered by the Trust and the Official Solicitor on ST&#8217;s behalf not to be realistic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, I gave directions for the capacity issue to be determined before any consideration of best interests. That issue came before Roberts J on 7 August 2023.  Her decision was reached after careful consideration of the voluminous papers, hearing oral evidence from four medical witnesses, and hearing extensive submissions from expert legal teams. The judgment itself is comprehensive. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Roberts J<span style="font-weight:bold"/>concluded that ST did not have the relevant capacity. She accepted that ST was aware of the nature of the disease, that it was progressive, and that she was likely to die of it.  But she determined that ST did not understand the precariousness of her position. ST did not believe the doctors who told her that she might have only have days or weeks to live. She was, on the judge&#8217;s findings, unable to weigh the information because (as set out at para 86 of her judgment): &#8220;(a) she does not believe what her doctors are telling her about the trajectory of her disease and her likely life expectancy and (b) she does not fully comprehend or understand what may be involved in pursuing the alternative option of experimental nucleoside treatment&#8221;. The judge considered, as part of an assessment of capacity, that ST was not able understand properly the option of treatment in Canada: it was unlikely to provide ST with any material benefit, the trial itself had been paused, the journey would be extremely risky and there was considerable doubt about whether she would be eligible for it even if it was available. </p>

The parents recorded a number of videos on mobile phones of staff working with ST, and staff are concerned that such videos may be released and might lead to adverse public reaction directed towards them. During the proceedings, media reporting, although anonymised, was perceived by staff to be negative, and two examples are attached to the statement.  It is extremely difficult for staff to defend themselves against adverse reporting of this sort, and they would not want to comment publicly in any event.

They certainly provide clear evidence of the real possibility of conduct impinging on the article 8 rights of staff before, during and immediately after end-of-life proceedings. It was part of the firm foundations for the making of RROs at the time. They do less to inform an assessment of article 8 risks associated with lifting the RROs at a later date.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">In my judgment, the fact that improper conduct directed towards clinicians has taken place in other cases can in principle be taken into account in the intense balancing exercise, particularly where, as here, the court is considering transparency issues before, during or immediately after the proceedings. Such previous cases are informative of the potential risks run by hospital staff. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of the identification of clinicians, the family allege failings on the part of certain individuals, stating in terms that this amounted to negligence which led to the death of ST. Although the family, I accept, have no intention to take any steps which might lead to harassment of named staff, the harsh reality of modern methods of communications, particularly by social media, is that they will have no control over the narrative. The publicity generated by this case has been heated in some quarters. There is likely to be heightened interest in the coming days as a result of my intention that the restrictions on identifying ST and her family should be immediately lifted. If anonymisation of clinicians is lifted, the consequences are unpredictable, but there is in my judgment a risk that abuse and harassment may follow, particularly as they may be reported by the family as having given ST inadequate care. Were that to come to pass, I would regard it as a very considerable interference with their Article 8 rights. That risk is likely to be at its most acute in the next few weeks and I consider that there should be a &#8220;cooling off period&#8221; measured in weeks. That would be a proportionate interference with the family&#8217;s and the media&#8217;s Article 10 rights, given the potential interference with the clinical/nursing staff Article 8 rights. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This hearing is taking place only a matter of days after the tragic death of ST. That is factually different from the circumstances in both the Abbasi and Haastrup cases where, as para 1 of the Court of Appeal judgment says, &#8220;These appeals concern the principles to be applied when a court considers an application to vary or discharge a Reporting Restrictions Order (&#8220;RRO&#8221;) <span style="font-weight:bold">made long before in end-of-life proceedings in the High Court&#8221; </span>[emphasis added].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Where an application is heard long after the conclusion of proceedings, it is easy to see why there may be little justification for continuation of a Transparency Order. Media and public interest may have diminished. There may have been no improper conduct (of any nature, to any person) in the interim which would indicate a continuing concern about improper conduct towards as yet unnamed clinicians or other staff. The raw emotions upon or shortly after the death of a much-loved person may have dissipated. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But in this case, at this point in time, so close to the tragic death of ST, the likelihood is that interest in the circumstances leading to her death will be at its highest, and the risk of improper conduct is similarly at its highest. It seems to me that what is needed here is a relatively short elapse of time to allow matters to settle and reduce the risk of inappropriate secondary activity of the sort described by the Court of Appeal.  I do not read the Court of Appeal as determining that the strength of the case for lifting such orders long after the end of proceedings would be the same as immediately after the end of the proceedings, and it seems to me that there is a very considerable difference between the circumstances before the Court of Appeal and the circumstances here. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is further submitted on behalf of the family that the potential clinical negligence claims which they are exploring demand an immediate lifting of the Transparency Order in respect of identifying individual doctors. Counsel relies on para 114 of <span style="font-weight:bold">Abbasi</span> in which it was said that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in this case clinical negligence proceedings are simply being considered. Unsurprisingly, given that only a few days have passed since death, no claim has been instituted. I understand that the family, sensibly, intend to take time to consider their position.  It is accepted that were such proceedings to be instituted before discharge of the order anonymising clinicians (or were formal complaints to regulators or the like to be brought)), it would be appropriate to vary the order permitting the lifting of restrictions for the purpose of such proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have therefore concluded that I should leave in place the Transparency Order insofar as it relates to the non-identification of clinicians/nursing staff for a limited period of time before automatic discharge. In my judgment, 8 weeks from 22 September 2023 is a proportionate and appropriate timescale. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not prevent the family from discussing or reporting openly their perception of failings by the Trust and its staff, but they are not permitted to identify any treating clinicians/nursing staff as part of any such discussions or reporting.</p>

The numbers would run into dozens, and there is a risk of not capturing all the relevant names. At the risk of repetition, my approach might have been different if this application was being considered long after the event; by then, it might be easier to identify if any particular individuals or individuals were at greater risk.</p>
