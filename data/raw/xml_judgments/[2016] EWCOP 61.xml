The Official Solicitor rightly, and in accordance with the Act, has sought to test the evidence at every stage, particularly in light of the strength of TP&#8217;s feelings.  As Miss&#160;Gardner has submitted, they have left no stone unturned in interrogating the evidence before the court.</p>

However, it makes clear that the person&#8217;s past and present wishes and feelings are as important to someone who lacks capacity as they are to anybody else.  I was referred to the decision of Peter Jackson, J, in <span style="font-style:italic">Wye Valley NHS Trust v B [2015]</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">EWCOP 60</span>, where he pointed out that a finding of lack of capacity does not operate as an off switch for her rights and freedoms.

The proposed interference in TP&#8217;s family life is huge.  The question the court must determine is whether it is proportionate or justified in all the circumstances.  The ISW, Chris Wall, in an email dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October expressed himself as follows: </p>

At the time of my initial report I had concerns that the protection may be worse than the harm.  This is certainly how TP views the situation.  I have put some of my concerns around this issue down to what I believe to be the inappropriate nature of the placement.  With TP&#8217;s mood lifting and actually liking the placement where she is and her consistency remaining, this leads me to think that the balance is shifting further towards the theory that the protection itself may be worse than the harm.&#8221;</p>

Miss Gardner reminds me that an assessment of best interests under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is a process by which the decision maker must consider matters from TP&#8217;s point of view.

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient&#8217;s point of view.  That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail.  We cannot always have what we want.  Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient&#8217;s wishes are.  Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament.  In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that &#8216;It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless.&#8217;  But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient&#8217;s wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being.&#8221;</p>

And the court must be careful to ensure that in rescuing a vulnerable adult from one type of abuse it does not expose her to the risk of treatment at the hands of the State which, however well intentioned, can itself end up being abusive of her dignity, her happiness and indeed of her human rights.  That said, the law must always be astute to protect the weak and helpless, not least in circumstances where, as often happens in such cases, the very people they need to be protected from are their own relatives, partners or friends.&#8221;</p>

The court, as I have said, is entitled to intervene to protect a vulnerable adult from the risk of future harm &#8211; the risk of future abuse or future exploitation &#8211; so long as there is a real possibility, rather than a merely fanciful risk, of such harm.  But the court must adopt a pragmatic, common sense and robust approach to the identification, evaluation and management of perceived risk.&#8221;</p>

The fact is that all life involves risk, and the young, the elderly and the vulnerable, are exposed to additional risks and to risks they are less well equipped than others to cope with.  But just as wise parents resist the temptation to keep their children metaphorically wrapped up in cotton wool, so too we must avoid the temptation always to put the physical health and safety of the elderly and the vulnerable before everything else.  Often it will be appropriate to do so, but not always.  Physical health and safety can sometimes be bought at too high a price in happiness and emotional welfare.  The emphasis must be on sensible risk appraisal, not striving to avoid all risk, whatever the price, but instead seeking a proper balance and being willing to tolerate manageable or acceptable risks as the price appropriately to be paid in order to achieve some other good &#8211; in particular to achieve the vital good of the elderly or vulnerable person&#8217;s happiness.  What good is it making someone safer if it merely makes them miserable?&#8221;</p>

There has been a constant effort on behalf of the local authority and Official Solicitor to engage TP and involve her in the proceedings.  As Mr McCormack has submitted, it has been successful to the extent that TP has been able to give her clear views to the court.  She is aware proceedings are ongoing and knows the decisions which are open to the court in that the court can say she can or cannot return to FW.

The ISW, Chris Wall, addressed the issue that TP has had no chance to grieve properly and cannot accept that FW has gone out of her life because, as the independent social worker said, he has not gone.  TP has been denied any opportunity of grieving and therefore of moving on.  Chris Wall sees that situation as emotionally harmful.  I agree and it must be remedied as soon as possible.  The finality of an order may affect TP&#8217;s views over time and her views may not be as entrenched as they are forever.  TP has not had the opportunity to consider her future if living with FW ceased to be an option available to her and an option whereby she could return to live with FW.</p>

I heard evidence earlier in the proceedings from both TP&#8217;s sisters, who described a normal sisterly relationship, albeit limited by reason of the fact that they live in the USA.  However, they described regular visits to the United Kingdom and TP visiting them and their families in the United States.

Dr Hughes&#8217; evidence was that people with learning difficulties generally do not live as long as the general population because they are less able to identify and respond to health conditions.  While FW may take TP for medical assistance in relation to acute conditions there are as well subtle difficulties and medical needs which require continuous oversight by health professionals.  People with learning difficulties are not good at spotting something going wrong.  Prior to living with FW TP kept regular appointments with her GP and her health needs were monitored.  That oversight ceased because it did not fit in with FW&#8217;s own views and agenda and his intransigence in dealing with anyone with influence over TP.  </p>

TP would lose the ability to broaden her horizons by attendance at college and interaction with others such as her sisters and friends.  Relationships which could be positive for TP would be lost.

It should ensure that proper recognition is given to the right to private life of adults who lack capacity.  Concepts of autonomy and self-determination have not, for obvious reasons, featured strongly in cases involving children and there can be a tendency to rely on the approach taken in family proceedings even though the MCA concerns adults.  Promoting autonomy and self-determination are clearly of much greater significance in relation to incapacitated adults.  While there are no doubt similarities between the functions of a judge in family proceedings and in MCA welfare proceedings, adults are not children and caution is required in drawing analogies between two groups or assuming that approaches relevant to one group can be translated to the other.&#8221;</p>

However, what Dr Hughes and others have seen is FW&#8217;s coercive and intimidating behaviour and FW referring to TP in a persistently derogatory way.  He refers to her as a broken flywheel.  He said she needed babysitting, she was not right, he is saving her.  Dr Hughes gave evidence early in the case that to repeatedly draw attention to a person&#8217;s limitations at best is not helpful and at worst psychologically damaging.  Dr&#160;Hughes referred to TP having no space to have a thinking mind of her own when dominated by FW.  Margaret R, TP&#8217;s sister, talked about TP being &#8220;Lost to us.&#8221;  Rebecca Horsfall said that TP needs a period of rehabilitation because she has lost skills, such as cooking and being part of a household.

Dr Hughes said that the message given by FW to TP, that she needs him and he keeps her safe, is a very compelling message for her.  The consistent communication that &#8220;your wellbeing depends on me&#8221; creates the implicit fear that that person has to be kept, whatever the cost.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Dr Hughes&#8217; view was that TP was likely struggling on her own.  It is likely she needs to live with other people.  She needs company all the time.  It has been shown that she can engage with staff and Dr Hughes said in evidence that she can see that continuing in the future and in that right setting where TP&#8217;s independence and needs are recognised and met she could see TP making very good progress and having a valued and meaningful life with the ability to enjoy and cherish a degree of independence.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I have made findings as to the harm that TP has sustained which has resulted in the present situation.  While not criticising the local authority the Official Solicitor has raised questions as to why the matter was not referred to court earlier.  It is always very easy with hindsight.  The local authority was trying to manage the case without coming to court.  At the time financial abuse was seen as the main problem.  The extent of FW&#8217;s dominance over TP only became apparent by degrees, the crunch point, it seems, being FW interfering with the assessment process and Dr Hughes being able to spend much more time with TP and FW than had been possible for the social workers and for Dr&#160;Hughes to use her expertise to weigh up the situation and relationship between FW and TP.  The local authority said that it had difficulty gathering evidence of harm until that point and the missing of the medical appointments when the referral for rectal bleeding was missed was a pivotal factor.  At that point the local authority felt that it was justified in applying to take TP out of FW&#8217;s care.  Unfortunately the available placement was not one which was best to meet TP&#8217;s needs and as time passed and a decision as to the future was due to be taken it was not felt to be in TP&#8217;s interests to move her to a different placement.  TP has now started putting down roots in her present placement which, it is agreed, should not be a long-term placement. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I am satisfied that if TP returned, as she wishes, to FW her needs would not be met and her best interests would not be served.  Although I give weight to TP&#8217;s wishes, as I must, her wishes at this stage and in light of the evidence cannot outweigh the harm to which she would be exposed in FW&#8217;s care.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">It has not been an entirely easy decision, but in fact once all the evidence has been available and analysed there is in fact only one decision which meets TP&#8217;s best interests.  It is a massive interference with TP&#8217;s life and against what she has consistently stated to be her wishes.  However, I have made findings as to the harm which she has sustained in the past which will continue and is likely to be exacerbated in the future if she resides with FW.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I have considered not just TP&#8217;s expressed wishes but, as far as I can, with the help of the professionals the reasons behind those wishes.  I have taken account of the evidence of the social workers, Dr Hughes and the independent social worker, Chris&#160;Wall, as to the harm to TP if she returned and the fact that her needs would not be met but subsumed in those of FW.  She would lose her identity.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">When she is separated from FW the professional view is that she can have a valued and meaningful life and connection with people, like her sisters, who care for her and want the best for her.  If she returned to the circumstances and control in FW&#8217;s mind his control would be justified and endorsed by the court.  It would give more power to his argument.  Chris Wall&#8217;s view was expressed that it would be putting TP back into a worse situation.  It would make TP more worried about losing FW.  FW views himself as 100 percent right in any event and therefore he would be of the view he would be able to do what he likes without regard to anyone else.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">TP has said if she goes back that is it.  She told Rebecca Horsfall:  &#8220;If I go back to FW I can shut the door and not be bothered by anyone.&#8221;  Thus the reality would be that FW would be in total control and it would be his needs which would be met.  TP would be isolated from anyone FW thought could influence TP and the harm envisaged by the professionals would continue unabated.  The evidence before me was that it is likely that his narcissistic personality would increase and intensify his behaviours.  Therefore it is not an option to try and test out a return.  It would be harmful and not in the best interests of TP.  It follows therefore that contact will need to continue to be restricted.  To enable TP to fulfil her potential she needs to be free from the influence of FW which would be exerted even in a supervised setting.  Neither TP nor FW have taken up the opportunity for indirect contact, but that option should remain open.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">If the harm is too great to contemplate either a temporary or enduring return of TP to FW&#8217;s care then the future difficult question arises as to where TP should reside.  A return to her flat in Gosforth would inevitably mean a return to FW and therefore is not in TP&#8217;s best interests and the continuation of the tenancy ceases to be a sensible financial option.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The local authority&#8217;s view, supported by the independent social worker and the Official Solicitor, is that TP&#8217;s needs would best be met in an independent supported living placement.  However, Chris Wall&#8217;s recommendation is that until this decision is made as to whether she can return to live with FW and TP has had the time to grieve she will not buy into an alternative placement.  She needs that time and the next move should be one, as Chris Wall said, that, &#8220;She is up for.&#8221;  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">TP needs therapeutic work which should take place where she is and before the transition process is likely to be successfully completed.  There must be focus upon how TP can be supported for the future in light of the decision made by the court not to countenance her return to live with FW.  It must be taken at TP&#8217;s pace.  It will be a process and no one can say at present that the process will be successful.  It seems some progress has been made in getting TP to interact more with the staff and activities provided in the placement where she is, but whether progress is maintained after TP is informed of the court&#8217;s decision remains to be seen.  It is, of course, hoped that with the decision made TP will be able to move on.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The Official Solicitor agrees with the proposals of the local authority, but only on a short-term basis.  However, it must be of a sufficient period to enable TP to grieve and hopefully move on.  It is impossible to determine how long will be required, but it is suggested that there should be a review in three months and a consideration in six months.  Although the independent social worker seemed to take the view that September would be the correct timing it would seem a sensible framework to look at this matter in three months to see if progress is being made and to review the position in six months with the court receiving written evidence as to the progress or otherwise that TP has made.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Rebecca Horsfall said in evidence that, &#8220;What I feel certain of is we are in this position because we feel strongly we are trying to do our best.&#8221;  I endorse that view.  As I have said, this has not been an easy case for anyone involved within it and the social workers in particular have not had an easy task but have at each juncture within their resources, I am satisfied, tried to do their best as they saw it for TP in circumstances which were very demanding of them.  The outcome which all involved in the case have hoped to achieve is that TP&#8217;s rights and freedoms will be protected so that she is enabled to live her life to her full potential.  Time will tell whether such outcome has been achieved.</p>
