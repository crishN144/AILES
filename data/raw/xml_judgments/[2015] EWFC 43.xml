The first is an application by the mother to discharge the existing wardship proceedings in respect of the children and for a child arrangements order to be made to provide for the children to live with her.  She invites the court to make an order for no contact between the children and the father.  She urges the court to continue a raft of protective orders that have been made, in particular since the children returned to this jurisdiction, and she invites me to make a section 91(14) order prohibiting the father from making any further applications without the permission of the court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this matter may be stated shortly.  The parties met in 2000.  They married in 2001.  On 25 February 2013 the father told the mother to leave the former matrimonial home which was then in London.  The following day he drove the mother to her parents' home in East Yorkshire and left her there.  On 8 March 2013 the mother applied for a without notice residence order, prohibited steps order, specific issue order and non-molestation order at the Kingston-upon-Hull County Court.  On that day District Judge Besford made an order preventing the father from removing the children from the jurisdiction of England and Wales and transferring the case to be heard at Willesden County Court.  The following day, on 9 March, the father was personally served with those orders.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 March the matter was listed for a first hearing at Willesden County Court for 3 April.  On 3 April both parties attended court.  They were represented by counsel, and on that day the district judge in Willesden made an interim residence order in favour of the father in respect of RU and Sa, and an interim residence order in favour of the mother in respect of Ar.  The father was required to make the children available for contact and the matter was to be listed for a further directions hearing on 21 May.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 4 April the father purported to appeal the order made by Willesden County Court.  On 9 April, unbeknownst to the mother, the father removed all three children to Afghanistan, the paternal family home, assisted by his sister, SH; and also assisted by his brother, AH, who was present at the airport when the children departed the country.  On 10 April the father sent a text message to the mother saying that he would not bring the children to see the mother and that the judge's decision was unfair and unlawful.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thereafter the mother's solicitors made various applications to the court. On 16 April the mother contacted RU's school to be informed that he had not been at school for the last two days.  On 17 April the mother called the police because of her concerns in respect of the whereabouts of the children and the father.  On the same day District Judge Kumrai in Willesden County Court made an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/34" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 34</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> for the whereabouts of the children to be found.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 April the father attended Kilburn Police Station saying that he had taken the children to Afghanistan.  The father was arrested, having returned to the country the previous day, and was charged with child abduction.  On 21 April, on an out-of-hours application, Cobb J made the children wards of this court and made orders for the father to disclose the whereabouts of the children and made orders for the return of the children to the jurisdiction forthwith.  On the following day, 22 April, Cobb J confirmed the wardship and repeated the return orders.  </p>

He did not disclose the names of those people caring for the children.  On 8 May the matter came before Singer J.  The father refused to receive service of a location order made by the court.  On 17 May, before Cobb J, the father and his brother, AH, gave oral evidence to the judge.  The judge made further orders for the return of the children to this jurisdiction.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 July the matter came before me on a committal application of the father for breach of the orders previously made by the High Court.  I found that he was in breach of those orders and I sentenced him to 12 months' imprisonment for each breach to be served concurrently.  Thereafter, in August 2013 the father, who denied abducting the children, stood trial at the Crown Court at Harrow.  On 22 August he was found guilty on all three counts of child abduction.  The trial judge adjourned sentence to 25 September in order to give the father time to return the children to the jurisdiction, stating that this would be his best mitigation.  </p>

In sentencing, he said the father was "a manipulative and devious man whose actions had deprived his children of their mother".  The father is still currently serving that term of imprisonment and is not due for release until March 2016.  </p>

The children were handed into her care and she returned the children to the jurisdiction on 14 August 2014.  </p>

Where all are agreed, as in the present case, that it is in the best interests of a child to have a meaningful relationship with both parents, the courts are entitled to look to each parent to use their best endeavours to deliver what their child needs, hard or burdensome or downright tough that may be. The statute places the primary responsibility for delivering a good outcome for a child upon each of his or her parents, rather than upon the courts or some other agency.</p>

He then added, "possibly the cause".  This was a gratuitous remark made for no other reason than to cause heartache to the mother and to upset her.

He stands by the ludicrous fiction that he merely took the children on holiday.  He asserted he had been convicted on a false basis.  He maintained that, because he was in prison, he was powerless to take any steps to secure the return of the children from Afghanistan.  I do not accept that proposition.  His brother, AH, visited him at least once every two weeks and could easily have passed on to the maternal family in Afghanistan the father's instruction or request that the children be returned.  He did not do so.  Moreover, he, on at least one occasion, had access to a mobile phone in prison and spoke to one of his uncles and RU in Afghanistan.  </p>

The father is a devious, manipulative and controlling man.  He is totally convinced that his version of events is correct.

He was explaining why the exclusion zone of the whole of the East Riding of Yorkshire was unnecessary and unfair.  He said he had been educated in Hull and had many friends there with whom he had kept in contact over the years and would wish to visit them, as before, on his release from prison in March 2016.  He then announced that he knew where the mother and the children lived, notwithstanding that it is supposed to be a secret and confidential location.  He refused to give me the address, claiming he could not remember it.  He had written it down, he said, in code on a piece of paper which was in his cell at Highpoint.  He claimed a member of the maternal family had given it to him, but refused to say who.

It turned out to be the maternal grandmother's address.  The father claimed he had not been able to remember it the day before because of the strain of giving evidence, because I had shouted at him and because he felt intimidated by me.  That is palpable nonsense.  The maternal grandmother's address is well known to the father.  In earlier times he had visited there regularly and has since used the address to send correspondence.  I reject the notion that the father could not remember that address.  In any event, even if he could not remember the postal address, he could have said it was the maternal grandmother's home.  He chose not to do so.  Why?  I am entirely satisfied the sole reason for saying he knew where the mother and the children lived and then refusing to disclose the same was to unsettle and disturb the mother.  It is yet another example of the father seeking to use these proceedings to upset, to manipulate and to control the mother.</p>

The letters and/or cards must be sent via the local authority, who will monitor the content and only if the content is appropriate should it be sent to the mother to be given to the children.  The children would of course be at liberty, should they wish to do so, to send a reply.  In light of my findings about AH, the same provision will apply in respect of him.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father's alleged desire to visit Hull and to seek a variation in the current protective orders preventing him from entering the East Riding of Yorkshire is a ploy.  It is part of his longer term plan to track down the mother and the children.  I am in no doubt that for the present the current order must, in the welfare best interests of the children, remain in force.  </p>

I am in no doubt that once more in the future they would do his bidding as they both did in April 2013.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no evidence that HH was involved in the abduction of the children. Prior to the children&#8217;s abduction the three brothers lived together in London. They are close and loyal to each other. I am in no doubt that HH would do his brother&#8217;s bidding to (a) seek to find the mother and the children and (b) seek to remove the children from her care or otherwise to denigrate her. As I have made clear such actions are wholly contrary to the best interests of the children. Accordingly, I am satisfied that in order to promote the children&#8217;s welfare protective orders should continue in force against HH as they do to the father and his other siblings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the first application made by the father for contact.  A section 91(14) order would ordinarily only be made where there have been repeated unmeritorious applications.  I accept, however, it may be, in an appropriate case, justifiable to make a section 91(14) order where there is a very strong need for there to be a lull in litigation to promote the welfare best interests of the children.  </p>

Accordingly, I have seriously considered whether I ought to make a section 91(14) order at this stage.  Ultimately, I have decided that would not be an appropriate order, but I will direct that any further or future applications in respect of these children will be reserved to me.  I give fair warning that, if further or repeated applications are made, I will readily reconsider my decision about whether it would be appropriate to make a section 91(14) order.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At this stage, and in light of the progress made by the children, it is, in my judgment, appropriate to discharge the wardship in respect of each of them.  I am content to make a child arrangements order in favour of the mother that the children shall live with her.  I shall make the orders for indirect contact in respect of the father and in respect of AH, as I have indicated, and I shall continue all of the protective injunctive orders in the terms as previously made.  It is not, in my judgment, in the welfare best interests of any of the children that those orders should be varied, and in particular the exclusion from the East Riding of Yorkshire must be maintained to ensure the maximum security for the children living at home.</p>

It may be that, in time, it would be appropriate for  AH to have some direct contact with the children.  That can only happen at a time when the children are fully stable, secure and settled with their mother and when she is more reassured that the children are safe and secure with her.  It would also, in my judgment, require AH to take a more realistic and honest view of the role that he played in the abduction of the children.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It may be in time, as the children become older, that it would be appropriate to increase the amount of indirect contact that the father has with the children.  It may in the future be safe and appropriate for him to have direct contact with them, but, as I have emphasised and referred to on a number of occasions so far, the depth of his feelings against the mother are so strong and the rightness of his course is so strongly held by him, that unless those views undergo a real and significant change, the prospects of the father being able to have direct contact with the children are poor.  The father believes that the children should live with him.  He does not accept that the children should live with the mother.  As matters stand, any direct contact with him would present a very high risk of very significant emotional and psychological harm being done to these children.  </p>
