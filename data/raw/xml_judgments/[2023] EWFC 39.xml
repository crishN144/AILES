	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The short point that arises in this matter is whether the court is prevented from making a parental order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.54</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> in circumstances where the insemination leading to the birth of a child via surrogacy has taken place pursuant to a private arrangement and otherwise than in a licenced clinic.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the applicants and the respondent reaching an agreement that the respondent would act as a surrogate, they elected to attempt home insemination.  The respondent became pregnant by this method and subsequently gave birth to DY and CY.  Within this context that the Magistrates, to whom this matter was previously allocated, raised a concern that this case may fall outside the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> in circumstances where the insemination took place pursuant to a private arrangement and otherwise than at a licenced clinic.  Having been alerted by the Legal Adviser to this concern on the part of the Magistrates, I requested that the case be re-allocated to me and listed it for hearing.</p>

The respondent appears in person. The court has before it a statement from the applicants and a statement from the respondent.  Whilst those statements are unsigned in the bundle before the court, the applicants and the respondent confirmed their contents at this hearing. At this hearing the court also heard briefly from the Parental Order Reporter, Ms Michelle Hughes, and has had the benefit of reading her completed Parental Order reports in respect of both children dated 21 June 2022. In determining this matter, I have also derived considerable assistance from the detailed Skeleton Argument prepared for this hearing by Ms Gordon and Mr Baylis.  Ms Gordon also made short oral submissions.</p>

The applicants married in August 2015. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicants met the respondent approximately 7 years ago. The respondent lived nearby to AY&#8217;s business and volunteered there on occasion. The applicants and the respondent became friends.  The respondent gave birth to her own children in September 2020 and the applicants are actively involved in their lives. They take holidays together and the applicants are the Godparents to the respondent&#8217;s children.  The respondent is married but has been separated from her husband for more than 5 years. She has little current contact with him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At around the time that the respondent gave birth to her children in 2020, the applicants were undertaking enquiries with a view to finding a surrogate in order to have children of their own. Subsequently, the respondent approached the applicants and confirmed that she would be willing to be a surrogate for the couple.  With respect to the process of insemination, it was decided that AY would be the sperm donor.  As I have noted, thereafter the applicants and the respondent elected to attempt home insemination.  After several attempts, the respondent became pregnant.</p>

The twins, CY and DY were born prematurely at 34 weeks on 18 October 2021. Unfortunately, CY was diagnosed with Group B Streptococcal Meningitis the day after she was discharged from hospital. CY still has a number of other medical issues that require regular attendance at medical appointments. The applicants are the sole carers of CY and DY. </p>

Following her birth, CY required very significant medical intervention in the circumstances I have described.
