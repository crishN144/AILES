The FFH arises from a child arrangements application issued by &#8216;DAL&#8217; in relation to his child &#8216;L&#8217; whose date of birth is XX November 2022. The respondent is L&#8217;s mother, &#8216;DAD&#8217;. </span></p>

He was concerned the respondent would seek to relocate with L out of the jurisdiction. Further to the proceedings beginning, the respondent has recently made a formal application via form C2 for her application to relocate with L to Poland to be considered as part of the joined proceedings. </span></p>

That may affect how she views the incidents. I found her evidence overall to be measured, calm and at times reflective and concessionary when called for. Despite lengthy cross examination, she stayed steadfast as to the key issues in dispute. She appeared to me to be largely frank and attempted to be helpful. She made concessions when she could not remember specifics like a date, but overall, her evidence came across as open and detailed. In cross examination when she was pushed on the core elements of the key allegations, she maintained a coherent account. When Mr Miller chose to play the audio recording of the July incident, she became visibly upset. Despite this, her evidence remained clear in my view. </span></p>

What I cannot be satisfied is as to the mechanism of any assault, i.e. did M attack F first or did F take the baby from her resulting in her trying to get him back and then F assaulting her. I note that the burden is upon M making this allegation, but on balance I cannot be satisfied she has discharged that burden. There is no burden upon F.

That seemed to indicate that if he knew he was being recorded he would have acted in a different manner, but his approach to being cross examined bore similarities to his behaviour and tone in the recordings in my view. I found F was argumentative even when clearly defending a losing argument and when being cross examined by someone with a superior grasp of didactic reasoning, logic and rhetoric than him. He seemed at times irked by the line of questioning, which he cannot have found unexpected or been unprepared for. As I have indicated, Ms Geser approached the task with earnest and methodical vigour but was entirely polite, whereas F at times seemed deeply offended and looked to argue instead of simply answering or conceding a point. </span></p>
