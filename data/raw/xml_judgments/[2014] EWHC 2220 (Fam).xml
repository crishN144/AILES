The Husband has not been represented before me, nor has he deigned to appear at what was originally fixed as a 5 day, subsequently extended to 7 day, hearing.

In so far as the Husband appeared to be asking for an adjournment of the hearing so as to obtain legal aid, such application could only meet with summary rejection. Not only is there no entitlement to legal aid, but the Husband, who as I shall explain is in serious contempt of court, has no grounds at all for seeking to delay the outcome of this case.</span></p>

They met in the spring of 2006 and by the summer of that year had forged an intimate relationship leading to their marriage in January 2008. They have one daughter, aged 6. The Wife had not been previously married and, having graduated from Oxford University in Politics, Philosophy and Economics, has always had a professional career. She qualified as a Chartered Accountant when working for an international accountancy firm, from whom she moved to work for an American bank in London as a banker. Later, having attained a Masters Degree in Environmental Technology at a London university, she has worked variously in venture capital finance and as a consultant specialising in the assistance of start-up companies. At the time of the marriage she lived in an excellent area of Chelsea in London, owning a 3 bedroomed maisonette. She had various unquoted investments worth between &#163;150,000 and &#163;200,000. </span></p>

He has 3 adult children by that marriage. When one turns to his career background, it becomes immediately clear that both parties may be described, as to their financial acumen, as being extremely aware and knowledgeable. Whilst British, the Husband, who was born in the Far East, has spent many of his years outside the United Kingdom and most particularly in Africa, where he has for many years had substantial business interests. The Wife describes the Husband (in the context of his execution of the Separation Agreement into which they entered) as a highly sophisticated and intelligent businessman. It is the sort of label which, I am satisfied, it is apt to attach to both parties. Moreover, it is clear on the evidence that during their relationship there was much dialogue between them touching upon their personal finances. In her initial Statement in the show cause proceedings the Wife stated: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"We were ... well aware of each other's respective financial circumstances as we had a transparent approach to finances during our relationship and marriage and we regularly sought each other's advice on business matters",</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> a description to which the Husband did not take exception. </span></p>

The equity was c.&#163;620,000, which was divided into almost equal portions, one half being invested in the Husband's name in a fund named Fund B (as to which see paragraph 51ff. below) and the other half in an investment, also in the Husband's name, in an unquoted company in which the Wife had an active professional interest, named Company C, in the United Kingdom. The Wife has also invested in this company. The Husband, whilst having business interests partly administered in London, does not spend much time in England in any given year, for legitimate fiscal (and no doubt other) reasons. The centre of his interests geographically is very much in Africa and in particular in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo ("DRC"). In the short marriage the parties' principal matrimonial home was in Harare, with holiday-type residence at times in a property known as K House in Kenya. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">As to lifestyle, the evidence is of limited scope, but demonstrates a conflict between the parties which has not been addressed at this hearing. The Wife describes what she terms a very high standard of living throughout the course of the parties' relationship, the occupation of two salubrious homes (three until 2009, when her Chelsea maisonette was sold) and the employment of a full-time nanny, a driver, a cook, a maid and a gardener. Typically, she says, travel was business class, with several holidays each year e.g. at luxurious hotels. In Form E the Husband says that, on the contrary, they always lived modestly and, as he puts it, within his means. He accuses the Wife of profligate expenditure. Reference is made to the upkeep and training of 25 race horses, whereas the Wife, to the contrary, puts forward a 50% interest in a racecourse stud as one benchmark of high lifestyle. A fortiori in the absence of the Husband, there was no investigation in this area of the case; nor was enquiry necessary. The Husband cannot, however, escape the observation that his, albeit general, depiction of a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"modest lifestyle out of necessity"</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> does not sit well not only with the Wife's evidence but with his agreement, at which I arrive shortly, to pay maintenance for the benefit of the Wife and [the child] in the sum of &#163;160,000 per annum, albeit for a finite term.</span></p>

From the Wife's viewpoint, the catalyst for its demise was the Husband's admission at the end of March 2010 of an extra-marital affair. In the first week of May, in the course of (generally amicable) dialogue between the parties the Wife came to believe that the Husband was contemplating the initiation of proceedings in Zimbabwe. She does not seek to disguise that that was not to her liking; and on 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> May 2010 she filed a divorce petition in London upon the basis of the Husband's adultery, which was served upon him on 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> May at Heathrow Airport.

In her show cause Statement the Wife says that the Husband sought legal advice both in Zimbabwe and in England after he was served with her petition. She says that he consulted Mishcons in London who, according to the Husband, gave him some advice concerning the likely parameters of any financial settlement. That presentation was marginally corrected in the course of the hearing. The Wife's position is, first, that the Husband told her in terms during the course of their many meetings that he had indeed had advice as to the parameters of financial settlement in England and, secondly, that it is an established fact that the Husband did go to Mishcons on one occasion (at least). She therefore logically assumed (and understandably continues to contend) that the advice had been received from that firm of solicitors. </span></p>

They include the alleged lack of legal advice and inclusion of terms in the Agreement which exceeded the Court's jurisdiction. The Husband said that the Agreement was flawed commercially and legally, there being, as he put it, no money to pay the capital sum at that time (viz. 2010) nor today. He insisted that the Wife recognised a lack of cash when the Agreement was concluded, that fact being reflected in the deferral of payments within the document. He did also refer to allegedly illegal abduction of [the child] by the Wife from Zimbabwe upon which issue, he said, he hoped that he might obtain Legal Aid. This was an echo of what had been said by his Zimbabwean lawyers in a communication of 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> June.

It is uncertain, on the evidence before me, just when this occurred; but it is of importance to realise that on the Wife's case she had no inkling that the Husband regarded himself as other than bound by the Agreement until solicitors' correspondence was initiated in 2013. It is true that the Husband, having paid the &#163;100,000 first instalment, sought further time in respect of the subsequent 3 instalments; but that did not unduly worry her, because of the favourable interest provision in the Agreement and also because of her conviction that, whatever the Husband's liquidity / cash flow problems, real or contrived, he had the underlying capital base which would ultimately facilitate implementation of the Agreement. She also explains, predictably, that she felt vulnerable given the virtual absence of resources on-shore in the United Kingdom and the consequent spectre of enforcement proceedings overseas. </span></p>

He refers to such collateral factors as the unfavourable exchange control regime in certain African countries. Nowhere, however, does he vouchsafe what, according to him, he was worth in terms of his total (directly or indirectly held) wealth when the Agreement was negotiated and concluded in 2010.

US$ 25-30 million, an allegation not expressly denied by the Husband in his Statement in response, even if he might be taken to have been saying by implication that his wealth fell short of that figure. What is more, she says, the Husband was well placed to look after himself in the 2010 negotiation, being a man of palpable financial acumen who in any event had told her that he had wanted to find out what the financial consequences of divorce would be; had initiated that step in Zimbabwe; had met with a specialist family law firm in London; and, as will emerge, has declined to throw more light on his connections with that firm. To take the pre-eminent element of the settlement, the passage of &#163;2,000,000 by way of lump sum, it defies credibility, says the Wife, that he would agree to pay that amount, and to pay it within 1&#188; years, unless he perceived his own capital worth, whatever his liquidity, to be worth many million pounds more than (and a substantial multiple of) the lump sum agreed. </span></p>

Inevitably, in such situations, some documents will be more powerful in their impact than others. The Wife's position is that, when it comes to some of the Husband's resources, the documents per se establish her case that his presentation is untruthful; and in the case of other resources they have the effect of raising serious doubts, to the extent that the Husband has much explanation to give and the duty to answer a series of penetrating questions (and to disclose relevant documents) before his Form E presentation can possibly be accepted. </span></p>

The Foundation, through a holding company Company C (Mauritius) holds various assets, many of them per the Wife of great value, and the Husband is on his own account one of the class of beneficiaries of the Foundation.

My conclusions will be based upon the parties' evidence (or lack of it), on the submissions I have heard on behalf of the Wife, on the Husband's case as I have been able to collect it, viewed at its optimum, and on the applicable law.

In the event, she kept pressing, effectively saying to the Husband that she wanted still to invite him to flesh out his case, because she was confident that, whatever documents or other information he might produce, he would not be able to make good his Form E presentation.

The Wife believes that this is one of several instances of the Husband seeking to distance assets from her and points out that the Husband's Form E failed to disclose that at the time of the Agreement J House had indeed been held in his sole ownership, disclosure which he was obliged to make by virtue of the Order of HHJ O'Dwyer. She also argues with some force that it is seems strange that the Husband would go to the cost and trouble of setting up such a trust and having it administered, and thus alienate the home he had owned for so long, simply to achieve such a relatively modest tax saving.</span></p>

To judge from this document, there is some doubt as to whether the total issued share capital is in the region of 21,000,000 or 23,000,000 shares; but either way the Husband would appear, failing contrary explanation, to hold around 45% plus of the shares in the company.

One may care more about getting or preserving as much money as possible, while the other may care more about the living arrangements for the children.

The Agreement recites that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">"The parties have taken or have had the opportunity to take independent legal advice before signing this Agreement".</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> My conclusion is, on the balance of probabilities analysed in light of the evidence before me, that the Husband did have at least some legal advice as to the financial consequences of divorce not only in Zambia, but also in London, a fact of which the Wife is adamant he informed her. Certainly, he had ample opportunity to take such advice, and not merely over the distance of several thousand miles, for he was in London a good deal in the summer months of 2010.</span></p>

The Wife says, and I have no reason to doubt, that it was the Husband who made the early proposals for settlement, which included at the outset the core provisions of &#163;2,000,000 capital provision and substantial maintenance subject to limitation as to time. My conclusion on the evidence is that he was wholly content with the Agreement's provisions in 2010, and that they sat comfortably with the worth and substance of his financial resources. If it were true that he had no legal advice as to the financial consequences of divorce in England, that would have been very much his decision, uncontaminated by any lack of knowledge, inequality of bargaining power or other vitiating factor. </span></p>

The Wife's case is that the Court would be driven to the conclusion that the Husband's disclosure is wholly unreliable, even absent the documentation which she has produced, because the adverse inference to be drawn from his contemptuous refusal to answer a single question or produce a single document as ordered by HHJ O'Dwyer, and from his failure to present himself for cross-examination, is inescapable: plainly, he feels unable to sustain that disclosure and has secrets to hide. But the Wife is able to go much further and to contend, in my view with justification, that the February Statement of the Husband is highly unconvincing and that the documents which she has produced constitute in the instance of each of the assets identified strong prima facie evidence that the Husband's evidence has been false and that the figures which she puts upon those assets are valid, at least in substantial measure; and further that the Statement puts in its proper context the Husband's plea that there has been radical change of circumstances since the Agreement and that he should be relieved of its consequences. </span></p>

That is my conclusion. However, the matter has also to be put another way. This is the Wife's Application to show cause, which confers upon the Husband the burden of demonstrating that he should not be held to the Agreement and the Wife should be awarded financial relief which departs substantially from its terms. For the reasons set out in this judgment, he has fallen far short of persuading me to find the change of circumstances for which he contends.</span></p>

As to income, there is no power in the Court to award interest upon unpaid periodical payments, and I am not prepared to countenance any attempt to achieve such an objective. As to the &#163;2,000,000 lump sum provision, it is true that the parties agreed interest at 1% per calendar month, and that the Wife has conveyed that it was the Husband himself, not she, who suggested this term of the Agreement. Be that as it may, 12% per annum can properly be described as punitive, particularly given that interest rates have remained stagnant (Bank Rate 0.5%) over the last 5 years. The Wife says that she has been told that the costs of a property equivalent to her Chelsea 3-bedroomed maisonette now would be approaching &#163;3 million; but there is no primary evidence to that effect. In any event 12%, in respect of the past or the future, appears to me simply unfair, even taking into account the fact that the parties did agree it. </span></p>
