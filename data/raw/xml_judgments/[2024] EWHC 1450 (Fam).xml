The application is supported by the Guardian and opposed by the parents. The proceedings commenced on 11 November 2022, and will be in week 79 at the date of the final hearing on 14 and 15 May 2024.</p>

However, the LA sought a written judgment on the issue and, in those circumstances, it seemed to be more efficient to hold a separate hearing on the issue and then issue this judgment having heard full arguments. </p>

The LA&#8217;s position is supported by the Guardian.  The Father seeks to return to the family home to resume the care of his children alongside the Mother.  The Mother, ideally, would like the Father to return to the family home, if possible, however, if this was not considered to be appropriate, the Mother confirmed to the court that she would abide by any safety plan considered to be reasonable.  </p>

In any event, Mrs Justice Lieven wanted to share her thoughts on the case to assist with out of court discussions.  She said:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;I don&#8217;t know whether there is any scope for movement.  I have read the position statement filed on behalf of the Father and I am not convinced that there is a burden on anyone at the welfare stage.   The burden goes to findings of fact. I don&#8217;t think there is a burden in strict legal terms. </span></p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">If the court sanctions the plan for the Father to keep away from the family home it will be a significant interference of the Article 8 rights of the parents and the children and I would need very clear justification for doing so. I share the Father&#8217;s concerns about the risk assessment. I have made findings against the Father.  There is a significant difference about him posing a risk to [DZ] and to [CX].</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">There&#8217;s an impasse and there&#8217;s no way of breaking it. The Father denies the findings made against him.  He can&#8217;t accept them because he&#8217;d be deported if he did.  The LA and the Guardian are asking the court to sanction a plan which results in keeping the family apart for the next 15 years.  I can&#8217;t force the Mother to accept the findings and separate from the Father, although I had hoped the Mother would after the fact finding hearing.  I am not making any pre-determinations. What am I going to hear at a final hearing that I don&#8217;t already know? There may be some genius cross examination by Mr Williams of the social worker and the Guardian or by Ms Davis of the Father but where is that going to take me?  I know the parameters of this case.  I think that probably this Father needs to be allowed home.  There is a massive difference in risk between a 10 year old girl and a 3 year old boy.  I don&#8217;t see how any court can justify keeping the Father out of the family home indefinitely and until [CX] is 16 or 18 years old.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">If it can&#8217;t be agreed it will have to wait to list for a final hearing.  I can&#8217;t force the LA and the Guardian to agree, but I invite the LA and the Guardian to search their consciences and consider what a final hearing will achieve.  I don&#8217;t say this with much pleasure but I need an answer as to what is going to change?  Where does this case go if the Father is separated from the children for the next 15 years?&#8217;  What I am saying can&#8217;t come as a surprise.  It&#8217;s difficult to see what use a safety plan would be if the Father returns to the family home but some thought could be given to some safeguards.  </span></p>

I made a finding that the Mother failed to protect [DZ] but she did try to protect her.  Probably.  The LA need to get its head round the difference between when something is going on under the surface and, like in this case, where clear findings of fact have been made.

It was submitted that the judge had done so during a process which itself was conducted in an unfair manner.  The mother&#8217;s case was that this premature adverse conclusion infected the judge&#8217;s approach to these proceedings. Lord Justice MacFarlane said: </p>
