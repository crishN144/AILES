	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">some of the key aspects of those reports later. On 1 March 2019 the case came before me for an issues resolution hearing. By that stage the local authority had confirmed that it was their intention to apply for permission to withdraw the proceedings, and so the final hearing time estimate was very substantially reduced so as to enable that application and a number of ancillary matters to be adjudicated upon. Although no party at the IRH was opposing the local authority&#8217;s application for permission to withdraw, there was a dispute on the issue of whether I should approach it on the basis that it was obvious that the local authority could not now establish threshold (Type I) or whether there was a possibility that threshold might still be established (Type II). Apart from the fact that in a Type II case the court might refuse to grant permission to withdraw and might insist on the case proceeding to fact-finding and thus potentially beyond, TP and CP and to an extent the Guardian identified another issue of concern. Put at its simplest, they were concerned that were the court to identify the case as Type II that TP and CP would be left with a cloud of suspicion over their heads arising from the &#8216;fact&#8217; that the court had concluded that threshold might be crossed but in the exercise of its discretion the court had determined not to adjudicate upon the threshold possibilities. Whilst they acknowledged that as a consequence of the binary approach of the law that the absence of any finding equated to no adverse facts having been found against them and thus a clean bill of health forensically speaking, they were concerned about the possibility of the contents of the threshold being either recycled or subconsciously or consciously held against them in some areas on the basis that the court had not explicitly cleared them. On the other hand, were the court to have concluded that it was obvious that the threshold could not be established this would dispel any lingering doubt or cloud of suspicion that might attached to them. It was thus not a distinction without a difference. </p>

Counsel for the parents of C, H, and K filed shorter documents dealing briefly with the permission issue and with the residual issues in respect of each of their clients. I was also provided with a Case Summary, a Schedule of Issues which was prepared following the advocates meeting and detailed chronologies prepared on behalf of the local authority and CP.  I have also read large sections of the court bundle in particular the contents of the Core bundle. Even the more limited court bundle that I was provided with ran to 6 lever arch files and I understand the unabbreviated edition runs to many more. I would like to express my thanks to all of the lawyers for the way in which the case has been presented. Given the huge volume of evidence and the extensive arguments which have been deployed this judgment cannot aspire to being anything like a full evaluation of the evidence and the arguments but is confined to what I consider to be necessary and proportionate to deal with the issue that remains in dispute. Given the nature of the case and the arguments deployed I have inevitably had to delve in some detail into the documentary evidence but I do not intend to burden this judgment or the parties with anything like a full summary of all that I have read or considered. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">However, because of the well-established approach to applications for permission to withdraw an application for a care order, the local authority are obliged to identify whether it is a case where it is obvious that threshold cannot be established or whether it is a case where there is a possibility that threshold might be met. In this case the local authority, through Ms Taylor QC and Ms Begum, have identified at paragraph 29 a) to d) of their Skeleton Argument four particular aspects of the threshold which they submit continue to carry a possibility of satisfying the threshold. I observe that the local authority have not sought positively to argue that the threshold would be met in those respects but rather Ms Taylor QC confirms that as a matter of intellectual honesty and evaluation of the evidence from the local authority&#8217;s perspective they submit that those 4 items carry with them a possibility that the facts might be established and that if established they might demonstrate significant harm or likelihood of significant harm attributable to care being given not being what it would reasonable to expect a parent to give. Thus the court must undertake the nine-point analysis identified by McFarlane J (as he then was) to determine whether permission should be granted to withdraw. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In their skeleton argument Ms Cook QC and Mr Ameen provide a detailed rebuttal of the 4 possibilities in order to show that when properly analysed there is no possibility that the threshold could be met and that rather they fall into the category where it is obvious that threshold would not be crossed. In relation to paragraph 29(a) and (b), they rely largely on the report of Dr Pasterski and point out that the limited observations by Dr Ward in relation to these issues which might be said to support threshold are couched in very qualified terms. In relation to 29(c) they point out that there is much in Dr Ward&#8217;s evidence which confirms that TP and CP have not inappropriately pursued mental health diagnoses and they note that in so far as Dr Ward is critical there is no evidence that any of the children have suffered or are likely to suffer any harm. Moreover, they point to the wider canvas which supports the conclusion that over many years, TP has acted appropriately as a parent or Special Guardian and the evidence is that the children have thrived in her care. In relation to paragraph 29(d) they note that notwithstanding Dr Ward&#8217;s opinion, the level of accidents C suffered simply do not justify any conclusion that they demonstrated a lack of reasonable parenting. All are demonstrably accidents of the sort encountered by many children and even in respect of the swimming pool incident the evidence compellingly demonstrates it was of the &#8216;there but for the grace of God go I&#8217; sort. Given that the last happened in 2017 and the local authority continued to place children with TP and CP thereafter it is difficult for the local authority contended that these accidents demonstrate either significant harm or a lack of reasonable parenting.  </p>

He also provided a detailed rebuttal of the July 2018 threshold in his statement of 27 September 2018.

It is noted that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">a finding that the local authority could have met threshold in this cas</span>e&#8217; would have significant consequences for the future of TP and CP&#8217;s family.

That report appears to have been commissioned specifically to look at the issue of factitious or induced illness. It focuses on the 12 markers of FII. I am not entirely clear what information she had available to her; she refers to the entire chronologies and the template but what these documents contained I am not sure. She confirmed she had not met the children. Her analysis of the 12 categories identifies various entries from the chronology which are used to demonstrate how that category is demonstrated from the evidence. In her opinion she expressed the view that those documents categorised extensively how the family fulfil the criteria for most of the 12 categories consistent with FII. She said in her opinion the children especially H and R are at risk of significant emotional harm and neglect from the possibility of fabricated illness. She said that she would like to support the children&#8217;s social care&#8217;s decision to safeguard the children. Although a further strategy meeting was timetabled for 25 July, the local authority reached the conclusion by 16 July that care proceedings should be initiated and they were formally issued on 30 July 2018. </p>

The reports are lengthy and detailed and I shall only seek to outline their principal conclusions insofar as they bear upon the issue that I&#8217;m called to determine. Although the Guardian rightly notes in her skeleton argument that care must be taken not to view the remaining 4 threshold issues through the lens of the original July 2018 allegations equally one has to look at the totality of those original allegations in order to put the remaining issues in context and to understand the overall impact of the expert and other evidence. Only then will the court be able to survey the full panorama, to take account of the totality of the evidence rather than isolated chunks of it and to avoid a compartmentalised or to narrowly focused evaluation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>In respect of TP, Dr Hellin concluded that she did not have any personality disorder or any psychiatric condition. She observed that her identity and sense of self and of competence is very much based on her role as a mother carer and the proceedings have attacked this making her feel very insecure vulnerable, self-doubting and frightened. TP&#8217;s history and presentation is not consistent with some of the markers of those who perpetrate FII. Her own health problems from 2003 onwards may have been caused by fibromyalgia and arthritis which were not identified until later. She did not reach any clear conclusion on the extent to which TP&#8217;s health complaints might have a psychological component; whether somatoform or fabricated. She noted that TP herself considered that since they were diagnosed they have been well managed. In respect of CP, he concluded that he did not have a history of mood or personality disorder or a psychiatric condition. His physical health has been unremarkable. He is a relatively psychologically resilient man without specific psychological difficulties. There is nothing to suggest that physical or mental health conditions have any particular significance in his family or his upbringing and there are no psychological factors identified would explain why he might inappropriately seek referral or diagnoses for children or act precipitately with regard to gender dysphoria. Research in relation to non-perpetrating fathers of children who have been subject to FII shows they tend to be uninvolved in the family; CP is certainly not uninvolved; he takes a central role in the children&#8217;s care. Both were reflective about the issue of gender dysphoria albeit were overly pragmatic about R or perhaps complacent about H.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Pasterski is a chartered psychologist and gender specialist with 23 years of experience in conducting gender identity assessments in children and adolescents. In her report she identifies that there have been recent changes to the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria and that research on mental health and transgender children have shed light onto critical historical misunderstandings related to clinical presentation in gender dysphoria. Firstly, that children who present with gender dysphoria are likely to desist in their cross-gender identification and secondly that gender dysphoria is inherently associated with high rates of comorbid psychopathology. She notes both have been shown to be false. She identifies that these misunderstandings arise from two particular factors. Firstly earlier studies which showed that up to 80% of children desist in gender dysphoria included children who presented with gender incongruent behaviour but did not necessarily state the wish to be or that they were the other gender. Thus children displaying gender variance may have been wrongly diagnosed with gender dysphoria. As a result of this treatment protocols previously incorporated a watch and wait approach which had prevented truly dysphoric children from transitioning which had likely resulted in increased rates of depression and anxiety. As Dr Pasterski puts it &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">Put simply, many who have shown to desist were likely not dysphoric and psychopathology in those who persisted was likely due to forbidden expression of their true gender identity</span>.&#8217; Current guidance suggests that supporting a child who clearly and consistently states that they wish to be the other gender in their preferred gender role is associated with improved mental health and well-being. </p>

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority's case was that the father "lacks honesty with professionals", "minimises matters of importance" and "is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance". May be. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise.

If it is not proved it did not happen. Mere possibilities are not sufficient to cross the threshold.  </p>

On the other hand what do we mean when we identify a case where the threshold &#8216;could&#8217; be crossed or where it is &#8216;possible&#8217; that it could be established? Mr Justice MacDonald considered such a case was made out where there was no nexus between the activities of the parent and any harm or risk of harm, hence his reminder of the President&#8217;s dicta in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A</span>. The same situation existed before Mrs Justice Knowles in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re ABCDE [2018] 1841 (Fam)</span> where allegedly extremist behaviour was not demonstrated to have caused any significant harm or to give rise to a likelihood of the children suffering significant harm attributable to those beliefs or behaviour. The situation Mr Justice McFarlane (as he then was) was faced with in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">ACC-v-P</span> (above) was very different indeed. There the court had to consider whether to conduct a factfinding hearing in relation to injuries sustained by a child  which may have been caused by his father. Although no care or supervision order was sought because the child was to remain in the care of the mother with only supervised contact to the father, McFarlane J rejected a submission that if all parties to a case applied to have the proceedings withdrawn then the court had no option but to grant their request. In determining whether a fact-finding was required he identified 9 points which the court would need to consider when deciding whether to exercise its discretion in favour of conducting a fact-finding exercise or not. In identifying those factors, he drew on a series of cases identified at paragraph 22; I note that most of them if not all of them involved such a decision being taken in the context of the threshold having been conceded and the court needing to determine whether to go further. On the facts of that case it was clear that the possibility of the father having inflicted serious injuries on his son would be relevant to his future relationship with his son and so a factfinding was required. That it seems to me was an example of it being obvious not that proceedings should be withdrawn but that proceedings would need to continue to factfinding. </p>

That of course leaves something of a blurred dividing line. I do not think that &#8216;obvious&#8217; is limited to &#8216;easily identified&#8217;.

In many Type II cases the application of the 9 <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">ACC-v-P</span> factors and the cross-check with paramount welfare will lead to permission to withdraw. In both cases no findings will be made against the parents and thus applying the binary rule they emerge with a clean bill of health. In some Type II cases though the court may refuse to grant permission to withdraw and the case will progress to fact-finding. Thus there is a material difference. Even in those Type II cases where leave to withdraw is granted it seems to me that although there is no difference in terms of the absence of findings it may still be important for the parties, in particular the parents and the child, to know whether that outcome is as a result of the court concluding that whatever the reasons for the institution of the proceedings it was obvious by the time the court came to determine them that there was no basis for the state to intervene. Whilst I&#8217;m not at all convinced that the submission made by Ms Cheetham QC at paragraph 47 of her skeleton is accurate forensically it may have some traction on a human level. </p>

One aspect of submissions of no case to answer involves the consideration of whether evidence taken at its highest, but not picking out all the plums and leaving all the duff behind, might require the case to be left to the jury. It seems to me that in some cases it may be &#8217;obvious&#8217; that the threshold cannot be established because viewed in its totality and without compartmentalisation or narrow focus the duff clearly outweighs the plum. In the criminal context that exercise will be undertaken bearing in mind the standard of proof would be &#8216;sure&#8217; whereas in the current context the standard would be &#8216;more likely than not&#8217; which would suggest cases with fewer plums (supporting possible threshold) and more duff (undermining threshold) might not properly be categorised as obvious. But even having regard to that wider gateway evaluation of whether it was obvious that threshold could not be established, it would permit consideration of issues as to witness credibility, competing or inconsistent accounts, differences in medical opinions etc, none of which may be put to the test but are considered in written form only. And this exercise of a summary appraisal will only of course be undertaken when the Local Authority has applied for permission to withdraw proceedings. In most cases, albeit not all, this course of action will probably be supported by all the parties and the court will be carrying out its role as independent and dispassionate arbiter.   </p>

The combined effect of the evidence of Dr Hellin, Dr Ward, Dr Pasterski and Ms Sayer taken together with the other witness and documentary evidence made those abandoned aspects unsustainable. The reasons underpinning that decision do though have a bearing on the evaluation of the vestigial elements of the threshold which the LA submit could still lead to the establishment of threshold.  </p>

The evidence from almost all sources of how the children are prospering in the care of CP and TP (notwithstanding any underlying medical or developmental problems) provides very powerful support to the contention that CP and TP are good parents. They are thus unlikely to provide care at a standard which it was not reasonable to expect a parent to provide.  To the extent that there may be individual examples which either do amount to, or could be construed as, examples of inaccurate reporting, or over medicalisation or lack of supervision they are isolated outliers in comparison to an otherwise overwhelming evidential panorama of appropriate parenting. </p>

Her evidence in respect of the &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">2 critical historical misunderstandings</span>&#8217; not only explains the approach of CP and TP but provides clinical justification for that approach. Notwithstanding even the Guardian&#8217;s caution in respect of the openness of CP and TP to the possibility of an alteration in the children&#8217;s attitude to their gender identity I conclude that Dr Pasterski&#8217;s evidence demonstrates that it is obvious that neither of these grounds would meet threshold. Taken together with the panoramic evidence of the child focused approach of CP and TP it is overwhelmingly obvious that neither H nor R have suffered or are at risk of suffering significant emotional harm arising from their complete social transition into females occurring at a very young age. The evidence demonstrates to the contrary, this was likely to minimise any harm or risk of harm. The evidence does not support the contention that it was actively encouraged rather than appropriately supported.  </p>

Even within Dr Ward&#8217;s report they do not support a risk of emotional harm to all of the children by pursuit of mental health diagnoses &#8211; in the sense that these were inappropriately sought. The general thrust of Dr Ward&#8217;s evidence is that CP and TP have sought appropriate referrals. There may be isolated examples which could be interpreted as overmedicalisation but taken within the overall effect of Dr Ward&#8217;s evidence they are almost certainly no more than hypervigilance or perhaps even exaggeration to achieve an end. Within the overall panorama of evidence (including that which might be deployed in support of the threshold) they are obviously not supportive of a risk of emotional harm to all of the children by pursuit of inappropriate mental health diagnoses. The overwhelming weight of the evidence points to CP and TP as being child focused and attuned carers. </p>

Dr Ward&#8217;s opinion that they demonstrated an inadequate level of supervision is only sustainable at a quite simplistic level. Of course, very many accidents of childhood can be attributed to a lack of supervision at a simplistic level. The reality of child rearing though demonstrates that children suffer accidents even with the most highly attuned and careful parents. Parents and carers cannot protect them from all risks however vigilant they are. As in the case of the swimming pool incident events may occur in a matter of seconds. At the time no one considered that these accidents were anything other than that. Most were observed and most were properly explained and those explanations accepted by doctors and social work professionals. Even the swimming pool incident can properly be explained as a &#8216;there but for the grace of God go I&#8217; example of an accident occurring in seconds notwithstanding the presence of two attuned and careful parents. And the overwhelming effect of the panoramic evidence is that CP and TP are attuned and careful parents. Thus I do not consider that on any interpretation the accidents which C has sustained illustrate anything other than the ordinary rough-and-tumble that children of reasonable parents might experience.  </p>

For my part I see that principally as an exercise of the plums/duff sort where the balance of the evidence viewed in its totality and on its broad panorama makes it obvious threshold could not be established.  It might also be the case that in some respects the parental behaviour alleged does not show a causal link with the causation of significant harm or the risk thereof. I have not felt it necessary to conduct that analysis having reached my conclusions on the obvious balance of the evidence. Having reached that conclusion it is self-evident that it is not in the children&#8217;s welfare interests for these proceedings to continue any further.
