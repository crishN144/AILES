The applicant (&#8220;H&#8221;) is RL, who was the respondent husband in the original proceedings. The respondent is NL (&#8220;W&#8221;) who was the applicant wife. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It has taken far too long to deal with these proceedings, which were issued on 5.4.22 . That is the fault of the court. At the first hearing on 29.11.22 I gave permission to W to file evidence in response to the witness statement filed by H in support of his application. In compliance with that direction, on 13.1.23 W brought in to court, and dropped off at the court office, a set of original documents. Unfortunately she did not retain copies and could not remember what was included in the documentation (the only document she remembered including was the decree nisi). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The court lost the documents. That meant that the next hearing, on 28.2.23, had to be adjourned to enable a search to take place. That has now happened but the documents have not been located. My clerk even tried to see whether the court&#8217;s cctv could identify the member of staff to whom the documents were handed, but by the time she checked the relevant footage was no longer available. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The court&#8217;s loss of potentially relevant documentation has added a layer of complication to these proceedings. I have had to take particular care to ensure that fairness to both parties is achieved despite the default of the court. H&#8217;s solicitor requested a further adjournment today but I refused that application as I did not think it would serve any useful purpose. I have been told clearly by the court staff that the documents cannot be located. If they have not been located by now, I am afraid there is no real prospect of their being found. </p>

There is some documentation available to the court (including the order itself) but the historic documentation is limited and incomplete. The original court file was destroyed in compliance with HMCTS&#8217; file retention policy, which provides that where there is no ongoing maintenance payable (as here), financial remedy files are destroyed after 18 years. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">There is no dispute that a final financial remedy order (then called an &#8220;ancillary relief&#8221; order) was made on 3.11.95. The effect of the order was to order H to transfer his interest in the family home, a house in Ilford which was held in his sole name, into W&#8217;s name. Upon execution of the transfer, there would be a clean break between the parties. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">For reasons that are not clear to me, but appear to be connected to a loan secured on the property, the property transfer was never executed. W says the mortgage lender no longer exists and despite her efforts she has not been able to trace the current holder of the debt. The balance of the loan in 1995 was just over &#163;43,000, a relatively modest sum when set against the likely current value of the property. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Bow County Court has now closed, but HMCTS was able to locate some documentation that indicates that an application was made in or around 2007 by solicitors acting W, for implementation directions and in particular for a District Judge to sign the TR1 form which would bring about the transfer of the property into her sole name. The documents available include a witness statement of W (undated, but from its content prepared after August 2012) in which she set out the problems she was having executing the transfer due to a lack of engagement from the mortgage lender. In that statement she referred to correspondence between her solictors and H&#8217;s. She also set out her account of the process which led to the signing of the consent order on 3.11.95. She said that this was agreed and signed by her and H in front of the District Judge, after negotiations between lawyers. </p>

Certainly those proceedings did not result in the TR1 being signed, and according to a Land Registry search conducted in May 2022, the property remains in H&#8217;s sole name. </p>

In accordance with the clean break provision, no maintenance was paid by either party to the other and essentially both have gone their separate ways. </p>

She asks me therefore to direct H to sign the TR1 form in order to effect the transfer.

It transpired that this purported agreement had come about during a discussion outside court between W, acting in person, and H&#8217;s solicitor. When I explored this with W in court it was clear that she had not realised that she did not have to agree to H&#8217;s proposal, and in particular that she had not understood that the order of 3.11.95 remained in force and would continue to do so unless it was set aside by the court. </p>

Despite my direction, H&#8217;s skeleton argument prepared for this hearing did not refer at all to the law in respect of applications to strike out under FPR 4.4, and made only minimal reference to the law on applications to set aside financial remedy orders. H&#8217;s solicitor declined my invitation to address the court further on these issues during the hearing. So the following summary of the law is entirely my own. </p>

Even from the skeleton argument, it is not clear what fraud is being alleged. Even if it is correct that in the original proceedings W made allegations that H had undisclosed assets, the fact of making such an allegation does not amount to fraud. Many spouses in financial remedy proceedings believe that the other spouse has assets that have not been disclosed, and ask questions accordingly. Nowhere in H&#8217;s evidence does he say that W made any statement she knew to be false, fabricated any document, or otherwise misled the court. The argument run on H&#8217;s behalf is therefore inconsistent with his own evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I accept that the lengthy delay (27 years) between H becoming aware of the order and issuing this application is, primarily, a &#8220;merits&#8221; point that is not the focus of this strike-out hearing. However, H&#8217;s silence on this important point, and his solicitor&#8217;s failure to give any sensible explanation when asked why there had been such a long delay, are features of H&#8217;s case that contribute to its overall incoherence. In my view, H&#8217;s case could be described as weak on the merits if he had included in his evidence an unconvincing explanation for the delay. The failure to engage with the issue of delay <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">at all</span>, anywhere in his documentation, means that the court is completely in the dark as to the merits of H&#8217;s case on this point. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I have considered the impact of the unfortunate loss, by the court, of the documents lodged by W. It is possible that those documents, or some of them, contained information that might have shed some light on the background to this case. There is therefore the potential for unfairness to either or both parties in dealing with the case in the absence of the documents, although there is no way of knowing which party might suffer the greater prejudice. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">However it seems to me that it is not unreasonable for the court to expect that H ought be able to explain his own case, even in the absence of the missing documents. After all, when he issued his application he did not know that W had retained any documents and after such a long period of time the likelihood must have been that she had not. Certainly it is not the absence of the documentation that has prevented H from articulating his case. </p>
