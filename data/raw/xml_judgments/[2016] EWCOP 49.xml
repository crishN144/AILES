One important question not considered in that judgment, however, was how RPRs and s.39D IMCAs should decide whether to bring an application to the Court of Protection under s.21A of the MCA to challenge a standard authorisation under Schedule A1.  There is, I understand, considerable uncertainty amongst professionals as to the right approach to this question.  As a result, five test cases were identified, all involving elderly people, hereafter referred to as RD, JB, JP, EP and JW, each of whom was suffering from a form of dementia, to enable the court to consider the general question and specific issues from a range of different factual circumstances.   In each case an application was made under s.21A and the case transferred to me. </span></p>

I invited the Secretaries of State for Health and Justice to consider being joined as parties to make submissions on the issue and gave case management directions for the hearing.  Subsequently, both Secretaries of State indicated that they did not wish to intervene. At the hearing on 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> November, the local authority in two of the cases, EP and JW, had indicated that they had accepted that the two applications had been properly made and, in order to avoid any further delay, the substantive issues were released at that stage to be determined by the local court.  Sadly, JW died a few days before the hearing, although neither the lawyers representing the parties, nor the court, was informed of his death until some weeks later. In those two cases, the local authority, having accepted that the proceedings were properly issued, and the substantive issues having been decided, there was, by the time of the hearing in February/March 2016, no issue in respect of which the court could properly make any order, although the local authority representatives and the applicants in each case contended that those two cases provided helpful illustrations for the court to consider when addressing the issues.</span></p>

The Official Solicitor, acting as litigation friend for RD, was represented by Mr. Parishil Patel.  JB, JP, EP and JW, usually referred to below as &#8216;the four other applicants', each appeared by litigation friend, either their RPR or, in the case of JB, her s.39D IMCA, and were all represented by Ms. Victoria Butler-Cole.   The local authorities, as supervisory bodies under Schedule A1, were represented by Miss Sian Davies.  In the case of JP, the relevant clinical commissioning group ("CCG") was joined as a party and represented by Miss Claire Leonard of counsel. All counsel prepared detailed skeleton arguments or position statements for the hearing.  In the event, there was insufficient time to hear counsel for the respondents &#8211; the local authorities and the CCG &#8211; and it was agreed that they would file written submissions within 14 days.  It was further agreed that Mr. Patel and Ms Butler-Cole would each file a reply 14 days thereafter.  In the event, an application for an extension was made on behalf of the Official Solicitor.  When eventually filed, the Official Solicitor's reply put forward a new argument and that, in turn, prompted, albeit without direction, a further response from Ms Butler-Cole on behalf of the other four applicants, Miss Davies on behalf of the local authority, and Miss Leonard on behalf of the CCG.  Thus the process of written submissions was not completed until towards the end of May, by which point further pressure of judicial time put back delivery of the judgment until today.</span></p>

Recent assessments, however, have suggested that her symptoms are more closely akin to learning disabilities and autism.  Her problems are characterised by abnormalities of speech, understanding of social conventions and interactions, repetitive motor mannerisms, and apparent low intelligence.  Cognitive impairment has become more apparent during her time at B House, and is characterised by poor orientation in time and place and poor short term memory.  She has demonstrated challenging and unpredictable behaviour and has, at times, been at risk of causing harm to staff and other residents.  She has been assessed as being totally dependent on others for all aspects of her care and medication.  Her presentation and care needs have not changed significantly although it has been reported that her aggressive behaviour has significantly decreased, probably, it is thought, as a result of the change in her medication to Risperidone and Lorazepam in 2014.</span></p>

She is unable to leave the house unaccompanied and will be prevented from doing so if she tries.  She has 1:1 support for personal care, and is checked on by staff every two hours during the night.  The door to her bedroom has an alarm which is activated if she walks out.  She is given psychotropic medication covertly.  As a last resort, staff are permitted to use physical restraint to manage her challenging and aggressive behaviour.  </span></p>

Recently, however, she has been inconsistent in what she has said about her wishes in this respect.  On the one hand she has said things like: "They want me to go from here. I'm frightened" and "They won't take me from here, will they?"  At other times she has said: "I don't like it here" and asked if she could return to be with her parents who are, of course, deceased.  A best interests meeting convened on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> July 2015 concluded that it was in her best interests to remain at B House and recommended certain steps be taken to enhance the quality of her life.  An analysis was carried out about her various comments as to her wishes, and concluded that there had been some change of attitude on her part about living there with more recent reports indicating that she felt safe at B House, and was afraid to move. </span></p>

She has a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and since November 2011 has resided at BL Care Home.  She is unable to meet her personal care needs and requires regular prompts and assistance during the day.  She is unable to go out on her own and her movements are continually monitored by staff members who decide when and where she goes.  She has tried to leave the property on many occasions.  For a long period after she moved to BL Care Home she had near daily episodes of agitation, when she became fixated on her children (all of whom are grown up) and was convinced she had to leave to pick them up from school.  She has four adult daughters, who are all very involved in her care.  All her family agree that the placement is in her best interests. </span></p>

One of JB's daughters was appointed as her relevant person's representative and, in addition in her case, a s.39D IMCA, Mr. Underhill, was appointed.  A second authorisation was granted in July 2015.  JB had continued to exhibit distress and agitation and attempted to leave the building and become verbally aggressive when prevented from doing so.  At other times, she had repeatedly requested to leave.  When asked by Mr. Underhill she expressed surprise that she was in a care home, and stated she did not intend to stay very long but did not object to the placement.  Notwithstanding these comments, however, Mr. Underhill concluded that her actions indicated an objection to the placement and/or the restrictions on her liberty and therefore that an application should be made under s.21A.</span></p>

The episodes of agitation had decreased and she was no longer physically attempting to leave the property.  She was engaging more in activities and had enjoyed walking around the grounds.  Although she sometimes got upset in the afternoons when she thought she would be late for the children at school, she was much more easily distracted than before, and the episodes did not last as long.  A psychiatric report supported the view that JB was happier at the home than she had previously been, and that staying at the care home was likely to be better for her than the disruption of moving to a different residence. </span></p>

Since January 2014 she has lived at a nursing home ("H House").  She has a poor memory and is disorientated in time and space.  She regularly becomes distressed and agitated, calling out loudly with repetitive sounds.  She is able to communicate verbally and make her needs known, although due to her cognitive impairment she can become confused.

The decision that he could not return home was supported by his wife.

The key features of the DOLS are a process whereby a supervisory body, namely the local authority where the person is ordinarily resident or where the hospital is situated, may authorise a deprivation of liberty ("standard authorisation") and a process where under the managing authority of a care home or a hospital may authorise a deprivation of liberty for a short period pending the grant of a statutory authorisation ("urgent authorisation"). By these processes a person lacking capacity may be deprived of his/her liberty by administrative action.  In order to ensure compliance with Article 5(4) of ECHR, s.21A was inserted into the Act to give the Court of Protection jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of the detention of anyone subject to a standard or urgent authorisation.</span></p>

Part 8 of Schedule A1 (paras. 101 to 125) contains provisions for reviews of standard authorisations by supervisory bodies.    Under para. 102, a supervisory body must carry out such a review if requested to do so by "an eligible person" which includes the relevant person, his/her representative and the managing authority of the relevant hospital or care home.  Under para. 103(1), an eligible person may, at any time, request the supervisory body to carry out a review of the standard authorisation, and under para. 103(2) the managing authority of the relevant hospital or care home must make such a request if one or more of the qualifying requirements appear to them to be &#8220;reviewable" on grounds defined in paras. 104 to 107, including, under para. 105(1), that the relevant person does not meet the requirement in question.  It follows that, if the RPR is of the view that one or more of the conditions for the best interests requirement at para. 16 is not met, he may, as an "eligible person" request the supervisory body to carry out a review. Chapter 8 of the DOLS Code of Practice gives further guidance as to when and how authorisations should be reviewed by the supervisory body. </span></p>

He submitted that the use of the words "in particular" makes it clear that the duty to assist P to initiate proceedings is not limited to cases where P has expressed a wish to exercise the right.

He further submitted that the court must determine what Article 5 requires without reference to resource constraints.   He acknowledged that the court will wish to be mindful of the limited resources available to deal with such applications, but contended that the answer lies not in limiting P's access to the court, but rather in ensuring that, once access has been achieved, the process and content of the court's review are adapted to ensure that the requirements of Article 5 are met in a practical, effective and speedy way. </span></p>

First, whereas, as Baroness Hale herself observed in the House of Lords at para. 4 of her judgment, most patients admitted under the Mental Health Act do have some capacity to make an application to a tribunal or have someone else who will help them make it, it is far from clear that the same can be said about incapacitated adults deprived of their liberty under Schedule A1 of the MCA.  Secondly, the Mental Health Act provides a wider range of mechanisms for referring a case to a tribunal which do not exist under the MCA.  Mr. Patel, therefore, submitted that the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">dicta</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> of Baroness Hale quoted above are not applicable to the determination of how the rights of a mentally incapacitated adult who is deprived of his liberty under authorisations granted under Schedule A1 of the MCA should be protected.  </span></p>

However, in his reply, filed subsequent to the written submissions filed on behalf of the supervisory bodies and the CCG, Mr. Patel put forward a different argument.  He submitted that the roles of the RPR and the s.39D IMCA were different in that there was a distinction in the statutory scheme.  The circumstances in which the RPR has a duty to assist P to access a court were wider than those which expressly applied to a s.39D IMCA.  As for the RPR, where P lacks the capacity to decide whether or not to apply to the court, the RPR must make that decision on his behalf, and in making a decision he must act in P's best interests.  Mr. Patel based his submission on s.1(5) of the MCA, and para. 7.3 of the DOLS Code of Practice, both cited above.  He proceeded to recast his submissions within the best interests framework, submitting that it is a matter for the RPR to decide what weight to place on P's wishes and feelings in the best interests analysis.  Other relevant circumstances to be taken into consideration in this analysis would be likely to include the benefit to P of independent judicial scrutiny of his arrangements, and any impact, positive or negative, which the decision to bring, or not bring, proceedings would have upon P. </span></p>

This requires evidence capable of founding a reasonable belief that P would wish to appeal, having regard to P's express wishes, his or her behaviour, and the wider circumstances of his or her deprivation of liberty. Ms Butler-Cole informed the court that the litigation friends for whom she acted did not favour the so-called "double negative" formulation suggested by the Official Solicitor, namely that proceedings should be issued where it is not possible for the RPR to be satisfied that P does not wish to exercise a right of appeal.  </span></p>

The litigation friends for whom she acts consider that it would be incompatible with Article 5(4) for the question of whether to appeal to the court to be determined solely by P's express wishes, given that P is unlikely to have an understanding of the process.  It was further submitted that, in a framework such as this, where there is no automatic referral to a court or tribunal, as under the MHA for example, a more generous approach must be taken in exercising judgment as to whether there is reason to think that P would wish to exercise his or her right to appeal.

Ms Butler-Cole submitted that drawing such a distinction is neither possible nor appropriate.  If a patient with dementia is trying to climb out of a window to leave a care home, that is an expression of a wish by that patient.  The fact that, were it not for P's mental impairment, she would not be seeking to leave is irrelevant. Were it not for the impairment, she would not be in the care home at all.  Having said that, the four other applicants accept that a level of inquiry is required in dementia cases where P is not expressing an obvious wish to leave since, for example, agitation or distress may be linked to other identifiable or specific causes. </span></p>

She submitted that the decision to issue s.21A proceedings could never be a best interests decision. Access to a court is an absolute and unqualified right under Article 5(4) and the decision to exercise such a right cannot be delegated to a third party who could choose to go against the wishes of the right-holder.  To permit such a conclusion would mean that rights had a different character for mentally disabled people, compared to others and that an RPR would be entitled to refrain from issuing proceedings even though one or more of the qualifying requirements under Schedule A1, which are fundamental to the legality of a deprivation in this context, are not met.

Ms Butler-Cole drew attention to a number of other problems and anomalies that would arise were the court to accept the Official Solicitor's submission on this point.   She concluded the Official Solicitor's new position offends against the fundamental principle of the universality of human rights, is internally inconsistent, creates unnecessary ramifications within the DOLS scheme that will lead to delay and is not mandated by the statutory provisions. </span></p>

Developing this point in her closing submissions, the local authorities rely on the margin of appreciation principle, which defers to the State&#8217;s decision-making even in cases involving positive obligations in circumstances where there is a balance to be struck between protecting the rights of the individual and the interests of the wider community.  In the present context, Ms Davies submitted that the balance has been struck by the statutory scheme which provides for extensive and regular administrative authorisation, the provision of representation and advice, (including, following </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re AJ</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, the duties imposed on local authorities to ensure that the representation is effective), and the availability of a statutory mechanism which enables judicial consideration without any permission threshold for an application to be made.  The applicant's propositions &#8211; and, in particular, the proposal advanced by the Official Solicitor &#8211; would have the effect of undermining the careful balance of allocated resources in pursuit of 21A applications which, in the case of local authorities, inhibit their ability to meet the social care needs of adults in their area. </span></p>

The threshold for taking practical steps to help P exercise the right to apply to the court is whether it "appears" that there is a "wish" expressed to exercise that right.  Ms Davies submitted that, under the scheme in the section, it is clear that this is to be an informed wish, the relevant information having been conveyed in accordance with s.39D(7).  She further submitted that "wish" should be given its ordinary meaning &#8211; &#8220;want, desire, have an inclination&#8221; &#8211; and thus a positive determination by P is required.  The appearance of an equivocal or ambivalent expression would not meet the threshold for the wish.  Appearance has a relatively low threshold, but nonetheless it is a threshold and what appears to in whatever form must amount to a positive wish and, furthermore, a wish which, however expressed, must relate to the exercise of the relevant rights.</span></p>

Whether it should be so implied is a matter for the judgment of the trained representative who must, Ms Davies submitted, be alert to the possibility that behaviour may be the result of a mental health condition otherwise unrelated to the issue of deprivation of liberty or the circumstances in which accommodation and care are provided.  Equally, an express statement may not be determinative (either way) if there are circumstances which cause the representatives to consider that it may not truly represent a wish.  The IMCA's duties include advising and informing about the right to review under Part 8 of Schedule A1 and providing assistance to exercise that right if it appears that P wishes to do so.  In a case where further inquiry would assist to determine whether P wishes appeal, Ms Davies submitted that the review mechanism may be capable of generating further professional opinion and in relation to assist in assessing these wishes as regards exercise of the s.21A right.  </span></p>

In written final submissions, Ms Davies submitted that an entitlement to take proceedings implies a positive obligation upon the State to enable such proceedings to be taken but not to require such proceedings in every case.  That interpretation is, she submitted, consistent with Baroness Hale's observations in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">H </span><span style="font-size:14pt">case at para. 23 of the judgment, and also the language of the European Court in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Winterwerp</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> at para. 60 of their judgment.   The approach advanced by the Official Solicitor would have the effect of requiring that P's detention is brought before a court in every case, whether P wishes it or not.  That is not consistent with the opportunity to take proceedings but much closer to a management system of judicial review. The need for "special safeguards" in the case of persons with mental illness in terms of the procedural balance is acknowledged but the local authorities&#8217; position is that the statutory scheme when viewed as a whole contains sufficient safeguards.  It is the scheme as a whole which falls to be considered when assessing human rights compliance. The question for the Court is therefore, in the local authorities' submission, whether the statute is deemed as a whole to provide sufficient access to the court, including "special safeguards" in order to comply with Article 5(4). That scheme includes provision for administrative authorisation, the appointment of a representative and possibly also an IMCA, and obligations including to advise, inform and assist in addition to the mechanism by which P's case can be taken to court on his behalf. </span></p>

Furthermore, Ms Leonard submitted that, as well as placing an intolerable burden on already stretched public resources, the Official Solicitor's proposed test carries a real risk of reducing the protection offered by Article 5(4) since the large number of applications that would ensue would impede access to the court by applicants who have a real prospect of success. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There is, in my judgment, an important distinction between the roles of the RPR and the s.39D IMCA.  The RPR has a wide role to represent and support P in matters relating to or connected with the Schedule.  The s.39D IMCA's role is much more narrow.  As I explained in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Re AJ</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, that role is confined to the specific duties identified in s.39(7), (8) and (9).   This distinction is important in interpreting the language used in the statute.  In particular, one cannot apply the language used in the statutory provisions or DOLS Code of Practice concerning the RPR to the role and duties of the s.39D IMCA or vice-versa.  One particular example of this is the use of the word "appears" in s.39D(7) and (8).  The fact that the s.39D IMCA's obligation to take practical steps to help P or the RPR apply to the court is described as arising if it &#8220;appears&#8221; they wish to do so has no bearing on the extent of the RPR's obligations, which are described in wholly different terms.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Once appointed, an RPR is under an obligation to represent and support P in matters relating to or connected with the schedule.  This obligation includes taking all steps to identify whether P wishes to exercise the right to apply to the Court of Protection, or the right to review under Part 8 of the Schedule. If the RPR concludes that P wishes to apply to the court, it is the RPR's duty to ensure that the application is brought.  In doing so the RPR should, however, bear in mind the provisions of paragraphs 10.5 and 10.6 of the DOLS Code of Practice.  Where possible, concerns about the deprivation of liberty should be resolved informally, including under the review process of Part 8.  The aim is to limit applications to the court to cases that genuinely need to be referred to it.  On the other hand, as deprivation of liberty is at stake, people should not be discouraged from making an application to the court if it proves impossible to resolve concerns satisfactorily through other routes in a timely manner.</span></p>

The right to apply to the Court of Protection is available to all persons subject to authorisation under Schedule A1, irrespective of whether or not they can communicate their wishes.  The obligation on the RPR to represent and support P in matters relating to the Schedule includes supporting and representing P in making an application where the RPR concludes that P would wish to make the application in circumstances where he or she is unable to communicate that wish. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In addition, however, the RPR's obligations in supporting P in matters relating to and connected with the Schedule include, in my judgment, assessing for himself whether an application should be made to the court, independent of any wishes expressed by P.   The RPR is entitled under s.50(1)(a) of the MCA to apply to the court without obtaining the court's permission.  The terms in which s.50 is drafted to my mind make it clear that this right to apply is independent of the right enjoyed by P himself: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">AB v LCC and Another </span><span style="font-size:14pt">[2011] EWCOP 3151 per Mostyn J.  The DOLS Code of Practice confirms that, once a standard authorisation has been given, P and the RPR each has a right to apply to the court to determine any question relating to the matters set out in s.21A(2) and repeated in para. 10.2 of the DOLS Code of Practice.   It follows, in my judgment, that, as part of his obligation to represent and support P in matters relating to or connected with Schedule A1, the RPR, in addition to identifying what P wishes or would wish, must assess for himself the matters identified in s.21A(2), namely: (a) whether P meets one or more of the qualifying requirements for deprivation of liberty as defined in Part 3 of the Schedule, (b) the period for which the standard authorisation is to be in force,  (c) the purpose for which that authorisation is given; and (d) the conditions subject to which that authorisation is given.  </span></p>

In deciding whether to make such an application, the RPR must again bear in mind the provisions of paras. 10.5 and 10.6 of the Code of Practice so that, where possible, concerns about those matters should be resolved informally.  But the qualification in the second sentence of para. 10.6 applies as much to the RPR as it does to P.  The RPR should not be discouraged from making an application to the court if it proves impossible to resolve concerns about P's deprivation of liberty satisfactorily through other routes in a timely manner. </span></p>

The matters listed in s.21A(2) and in para. 10.2 of the DOLS Code involve, inter alia, an assessment relating to best interests. The question whether the best interests requirement is satisfied obviously involves an assessment of best interests &#8211; the requirement will only be met if, inter alia, &#8220;it is in the best interests of the relevant person for him to be a detained resident&#8221;. In addition, however, any assessment of the period of, purpose of or conditions attached to an authorisation will equally involve consideration of P&#8217;s best interests.  This, to my view, is consistent with para.7.3 of the DOLS Code of Practice. Best interests is, therefore, integral to the decision by the RPR whether or not to apply to the court himself under s.21A.   </span></p>

Although that is not spelt out in terms in the DOLS Code of Practice, the cardinal principles in s.1 of the MCA apply to anyone who does an act or makes a decision for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity.  </span></p>

It is defined in s.39D (7), (8) and (9).   Under s.39D(7), the role is to take practical steps to help P and the RPR understand the effect, purpose and duration of the authorisation and any conditions to which the authorisation is subject; the reason why the relevant assessors concluded that P met the qualifying requirements; the right to apply to court and the right to review under Part 8; and how to exercise those rights.  Under subsection (8) the IMCA is required to take such steps as are practical to help P and/or the RPR exercise the right to apply to the court or the right of review if it appears to the IMCA that P or the RPR wishes to exercise the right.  If he helps P or RPR to exercise the right of review under Part 8, he may, under subsection (9), contribute to that review.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The language used in these statutory provisions is, to my mind, important.  The obligation on the IMCA to take steps to help P or the RPR apply to the court only arises where it appears that P or the RPR wishes to apply.  When P is unable to express a wish, either verbally or through behaviour, it is not the function of the IMCA to analyse whether P would wish to apply. That is a matter for the RPR.  Equally, in my judgment, it is not the role of the IMCA to consider whether there is any other reason to apply to the court to consider the questions in s.21A(2).  That is also a matter for the RPR.</span></p>

I do not accept the Official Solicitor's submission that it is appropriate or necessary for the RPR to apply to the court unless satisfied that P does not wish to exercise that right.  I agree with the submissions put forward in response by the other parties.  As Ms Leonard submitted, this "double negative" formulation would effectively introduce a presumption that P wishes to exercise the Article 5(4) rights unless the RPR is satisfied that he/she does not.  As Ms Leonard further submitted, that presumption is supported neither by the European Convention of Human Rights, nor by national legislation, and would, in my judgment, be tantamount to incorporating a right to automatic judicial review for incapable persons deprived of their liberty under the MCA.  As Baroness Hale observed in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">H </span><span style="font-size:14pt">case, there is no support for such a presumption in the Strasbourg jurisprudence or elsewhere, and in my judgment it would be both unnecessary and unworkable.  The statutory scheme, as a whole, set out in the MCA, as analysed above, guarantees that P's rights under Article 5(4) are adequately protected.  </span></p>

Mr. Patel invited the court to find that it was appropriate for the RPR to assist to bring the application because the fluctuating nature of her wishes meant that it was not possible for the RPR to be satisfied that RD did not wish to exercise her right pursuant to Article 5(4).  I have already indicated when considering the general issues above that I do not consider this "double negative" formulation to be the right approach.</span></p>

Her wishes have fluctuated and, on occasions, she has expressed a wish to return to live at a property she used to occupy with her parents many years ago which is no longer available to her.  It is possible, submitted the local authority, that the change of behaviour she presented is a symptom of her mental health condition and unrelated to any wish to leave B House. </span></p>

Without going into specific detail, I have not found clear evidence that RD ever wished to appeal to the court against the standard authorisation.  Her presentation has followed the familiar pattern in which she appeared very unsettled at times in the early stages of her stay at B House, but has now, to a certain extent, settled down subsequently. I recognise, however, that it has been extremely difficult for the RPR in this case, as for all the RPRs and the s.39D IMCA in this case, to evaluate these decisions in the absence of any guidance up to this point.  I therefore propose to request that RD&#8217;s RPR reconsider the question of whether this application should proceed in the light of the guidance I have given above, and provide me with a decision on that question at the hearing provided for below. </span></p>

The local authority submitted that the IMCA was obliged to consider cognitive impairment as a potential cause for her behaviour and was wrong to conclude that it was to be interpreted as an expression of a wish to leave.  To this Ms Butler-Cole responded that drawing a distinction between behaviour caused by dementia and behaviour which indicates a wish or preference on the individual's plight is often neither possible nor appropriate. </span></p>

That is a matter for the RPR or IMCA as the case may be, and it is difficult, without a wholly inappropriate lengthy inquiry, to assess whether that decision was right or wrong.   Since the IMCA took the decision to start proceedings, there have been two developments which impinge on this issue.  First, there is now this judgment which considers the whole question of the issue, and has given certain guidance to be followed when RPRs and IMCAs are making the decisions arising in these circumstances.  Secondly, in JB's case it is, as Ms Butler-Cole reiterated in her written submissions in reply, clear that JB is no longer objecting to her placement with the same force and regularity she was displaying earlier.  In those circumstances, I again request in JB's case that the IMCA review her decision whether proceedings should continue, and provide me with her decision in the light of this judgment at the hearing provided for below. </span></p>

Ms Davies submitted that, as in RD's case, determining that JP wishes to leave the placement was an overly simplistic approach.  She wishes not just to be in a different place, but also in a different time.   Making links between her express verbal behaviour and her wish to exercise her relevant right is, in the local authority's submission, tenuous at best.  </span></p>

The CCG submitted that her agitated behaviour appears to relate to her dementia rather than a wish to object to her placement.

It was only subsequent to making an application that JP was asked for the first time whether she would like a judge to consider her situation and she indicated that she wanted this.  The CCG's understanding is that this conversation took place while JP was in an agitated state and, therefore, should be viewed with some caution. </span></p>

JW's RPR sought to improve his access to activities in the care home with some success, but JW continued to express unhappiness at his placement.

Ultimately, the RPR decided to apply to the court, although Ms Butler-Cole informed the court in her submissions that the RPR accepted that, with hindsight, it would have been better if proceedings had started sooner and in parallel with taking other steps, since there was reason to think that JW would want to exercise his right of appeal at an earlier stage, even though there was no realistic option of a return home. </span></p>

In this case, therefore, there had been informal steps to assist JW to settle, as recommended in the DOLS Code of Practice, and it was only when it was realised that these steps had not succeeded that the decision was taken to apply to the court.
