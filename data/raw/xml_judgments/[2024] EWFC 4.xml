	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">There is antipathy and mistrust between the parents, which was sad to behold. Each accuses the other of misconduct, and has taken the opportunity to commit their condemnations to paper in statements and, on occasion, in oral evidence, although F was on the whole more restrained in his personal criticism of M than she was of him. The limited solicitors&#8217; correspondence which I have seen has been tetchy. It is not for me to attribute blame in respect of the parties&#8217; relationship, or its breakdown. The attritional litigation has, I am quite sure, contributed to the parties&#8217; personal discord. That is reflected in their respective costs: M&#8217;s are &#163;906,000 (which includes VAT) and F&#8217;s are &#163;659,000 (VAT not being payable). My task, however, is to approach the case dispassionately, and alight as best I can upon fair financial provision for the children in accordance with the law. </span></p>

The breakdown of the relationship has, I think, affected her deeply. She presented as anxious and tearful. As a result, she was on occasion hyperbolic and prone to exaggeration. F was in general calm and composed and, I suspect, he has found it easier to move on. It may be of note that F has a more developed relationship with a new partner for a year, whereas M is in the early stages of a new relationship. I thought both did their best to tell the truth as they saw it; differences between them were more of perception than fact. </span></p>

She was born and brought up in the USA. Her father (now retired) worked in the public sector and her mother was a homemaker. M was a professional equestrian from the age of 18 onwards, until shortly before the birth of the parties&#8217; first child. She is recovering from PTSD, the origins of which lie in a traumatic previous relationship unconnected to F. Her underlying depression and anxiety have been, I am quite sure, exacerbated by the litigation. An order in Children Act proceedings indicated her agreement to undergo a psychiatric treatment plan for some 12 to 18 months. She is currently receiving therapy. An important feature of this case, in my view, is that the children need their mother to be, and remain, stable and happy. Her mental and emotional wellbeing are aligned with, and important to, their own wellbeing.</span></p>

He has a particular interest in horses, and co-owns with his brothers a holding company with business interests in this area. F as a result travels extensively around the world for business purposes. He suffers from anxiety disorder. He is recovering from personal issues, which cost him up to &#163;2m pa, and describes himself as having been in a &#8220;bad place&#8221;.

I am satisfied that this was the family home, and therefore the children&#8217;s home, during the parties&#8217; relationship (including for the Covid lockdown period), and has remained the home of M and the children since separation. M and F planned to develop, and increase the size of, the property at a cost of about &#163;1m, and also considered buying the next-door property for &#163;850,000; these plans did not in fact come to pass.  They also contemplated buying a property in the USA, and researched houses at prices ranging mainly (ignoring the odd outlier) between about $10m and $15m; again, nothing in fact came of this. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I have heard a great deal of evidence about standard of living. In some ways it was hybrid. Their home was a conventional property of relatively modest value given F&#8217;s wealth. M attempted to portray a magnificent property in Central London valued in the hundreds of millions, as another home of theirs. This was a considerable stretch, which I am not prepared to accept. F holds, via a family trust, an interest in the house; his siblings hold the balance. It is the home of F&#8217;s mother, the family matriarch. Of course, she welcomes F, and during the relationship welcomed M and the children, but I accept F&#8217;s evidence that he, and they, could not go there without her permission. M stayed there for two months while each of the children were born, and on other occasions she and the children visited, but this was not in any true sense a home of M, F and the children.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On the other hand, standard of living is not referable just to a home. It is perfectly obvious that the lifestyle enjoyed by M and F during their 4-year relationship was hugely privileged. There is some dispute between the parties as to precisely how opulent it was, but I do not consider it necessary to resolve the specific details. On any view, it involved private jets, first class commercial flights, staffing, luxurious holidays, high end cars and the like. They travelled abroad at least once a month until the onset of Covid, to glamorous destinations, many of which were related to F&#8217;s horse-related activities. As examples, a week&#8217;s skiing cost &#163;100,000, as did a week in St Bart&#8217;s. The children each had 2 nannies. In England, the family had a chef, a butler, a housekeeper, a gardener and driver. Large sums were spent on their shared interest in horses. M competed at equestrian events and had the best trainers. F bought three horses for her at a total cost of $475,000. M had expensive clothing. The expenditure was consistent with F&#8217;s status, and the lifestyle available through his family and business connections. They mixed with ultra-rich individuals around the world. All of this was paid for by F, or, where an equestrian element was involved, by the business. In addition, he gave M $10,000 pm to accrue some savings, a sum which is not insignificant, but certainly not vast.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I do not consider that it is necessary to determine precisely the level of expenditure during the relationship, nor would it be easy to work out. The best I can do is conclude, tentatively, that it was at least &#163;2m pa, and probably rather more. The evidence suggests that the cost of running F&#8217;s property in England (including all staffing) was about &#163;800,000 pa, and my sense is that at least &#163;1.2m pa was spent on personal expenses, including holidays. On top of that, some travel was paid by the company where it was business related. Nor is that the whole picture, for F spent huge sums additionally on the personal issues referred to above. Money was never really an object, and the outline of the standard of living which I have sketched speaks for itself. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">However, I am clear that in reality this was a lifestyle enjoyed principally by M and F. It was not enjoyed by the children to anything like the same degree. When the parties separated in 2021, the children were respectively just under 2 years old, and just over 4 months old. They cannot have had any real appreciation of the lavish lifestyle around them, or, for that matter, any recollection of it. Moreover, much of it would not have included them anyway. For example, they did not travel with their parents on the holidays abroad save that the elder child did accompany them to the USA on one occasion and to Portugal on another. Of course, from March 2020 onwards, Covid prevented a great deal of overseas travel, but the plain fact is that the holiday expenditure, on which M places much reliance, only involved the children to a limited extent. I accept that the parents dressed the children in expensive clothes, they visited F&#8217;s mother&#8217;s home in London, and staff were on hand. But they have not grown up in, and become accustomed to, the sort of lifestyle which I have described. </span></p>

Earlier this year, he bought a property in the Caribbean for $1.75m which he describes as his permanent home. He may see it as such, but in reality he will also spend time at his home in England, and he usually rents a property in the USA every winter.  </span></p>

In September 2022, F indicated that he did not intend to have contact with the children. He says that was driven in large part by M placing obstacles in the way of his relationship with the children. M disputes this. I do not need to explore how and why this sad state of affairs came about, but I record that I hope these parents will attempt, once the proceedings are over and the dust has settled a little, to cooperate in finding a way for the children to rekindle a relationship with their father. It is in their welfare interests to do so; partly for the pleasure and enjoyment that they should derive from a warm and loving relationship with him; partly because of the benefits of a paternal role model; partly because of the need for them to understand, and be familiar with, the paternal side of the family which is a core part of their culture and identity. Unless and until this happens, M will be the sole carer of the children, which is a relevant consideration in these financial proceedings. F will not be having them to stay with him, and paying for them during those periods. </span></p>

He did not demur when I suggested (on a very ad hoc calculation) that as much as $15m might be required to secure the sums for the duration of the children&#8217;s minority.

He applied a 62.5% discount to his minority shareholdings in various family businesses, in particular the family holding company. Without such a discount (for example, if his interests were to be valued on a quasi-partnership basis), his total asset base would be more like &#163;250m net. As for income, he estimated his total net income (including gifts from family) for the next 12 months as &#163;5,155,200, but he has also historically received family loans amounting to &#163;32m since 2016.

The figures, which are in any event overstated, in large measure stray into impermissible territory of meeting M&#8217;s personal needs independent of (or only distantly related to) the needs of the children, even taking into account her responsibility as the parent with care. Her claim seems to me to be based in part on her own wish for a high-end lifestyle to reflect what she experienced for 4 years with F.  The children, as I have commented, can scarcely have any appreciation, or memory, of the standard of living before their parents separated. Nor, it seems to me, were they fully exposed to it; an obvious example being that they barely travelled with M and F. Their main home was in South East England, which, although fully staffed, does not fall into the category of fabulous properties which one sees in many of these cases. I remind myself that, although due allowance must be made for M as the primary (indeed, in this case, sole) carer of the children, Schedule 1 claims are for the benefit of the children. I accept that F&#8217;s wealth and his own lifestyle going forward are matters to take into account, but in my judgment the claims made in respect of the children are disproportionate. Of course, they are children of a member of a Middle Eastern royal family and need to be brought up comfortably and securely, but that does not of itself translate into a need for luxury. It is M&#8217;s understandable choice to return to America, where she is from, and her family remain. The children&#8217;s experiences of life, and growing up, will be shaped by what I sincerely hope will be happy times in America, living in a secure home, attending school there, and enjoying all that M&#8217;s home state in America has to offer. The proposed home environment in America is, per </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re A (supra)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, an obvious base line to consider maintenance. It is a normal, albeit very comfortable, environment, and not, in monetary terms, a fabulous one.

By an open offer made in March 2023 she sought $924,000 pa. In June 2023 her open offer reduced to $780,000 pa, for which she contended at trial, although, with additional horse maintenance costs requested by M in her oral evidence, that figure rises to $913,860 pa. Her housing claims have also reduced, from $7m in March 2023 to $5.5m at trial. The claimed costs of house refurbishment have reduced from $695,000 in March 2023 to $400,000 at trial. </span></p>

It is reasonable for her to want to live in a 5-bedroom house in a comfortable area which has privacy and security. In my judgment, a guard-gated location is desirable, both because of M&#8217;s own anxieties, rooted in the trauma of a previous abusive relationship, and because of the children&#8217;s affiliation to the high profile Middle Eastern royal family.  M needs to feel safe, for the children&#8217;s sake as much as her own. She accepted in evidence that it is possible to buy properties in guard-gated communities for less than her proposed figures. I also bear in mind that a number of the properties advanced in property particulars in fact sold for as much as 10% less than the asking price. As a cash purchaser, M may be well placed to negotiate a good deal. </span></p>

She says that equestrianism is part of the parties&#8217; lives, and it was always intended that the children would ride. It seems likely to me that M&#8217;s passion for equestrian pursuits will pass down to the children. However, I consider it is premature to determine what sums should be payable in the long term; it is too soon to be sure that the children will in fact ride, and, if so, how much and to what standard. To require F now to pay such large sums referable to points long in the future, with no certainty as to what will in fact be needed, seems to me to be speculative. The child maintenance order can be varied in due course if necessary, to include purchase of a horse. It is possible, as M&#8217;s counsel suggest in their written opening, that once the children have moved to the USA and are resident there, there will be no power to make a fresh Schedule 1 capital claim for horses, but in my judgment this can be dealt with under a broad review of the maintenance provision; if necessary, and sanctioned by the court, M could take out a loan to buy horses and the repayments would in my view legitimately be classed as part of the maintenance provisions. However, I am concerned that simply to leave all of this to a later date risks further litigation, potentially very soon; in one year, the elder child will be 5 when M considers she might be ready to ride. I therefore propose to make some provision for the purchase of a first horse for each child, so that the parties have at least some breathing space from possible litigation. I will order that F pays $25,000 per horse, i.e $50,000 in total (&#163;40,000). If they do not in fact ride, I suspect they will have other hobbies to which the sum can be applied. Any question of horses thereafter will have to be dealt with at a later date.  </span></p>

I have already commented on how her original budget exceeded $1.9m pa. I find it difficult to attribute a great deal of weight to what seems to me to be a wish list in circumstances when M has so dramatically changed the figures. It is hard to resist the conclusion that M has projected some of her aspirations within the children&#8217;s stated needs.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This seems to me to be one of those cases where a broad assessment of the children&#8217;s budget is the proper approach to take. Cross examination of M demonstrated to my satisfaction that numerous items are simply too high. Certain elements leap out. $180,000 pa for one nanny seems excessive, particularly on a long-term basis; I cannot accept, as M suggested in evidence, that she will need that full level of support until the children are 12 years old. $34,000 pa for children&#8217;s clothing at this age is excessive. $37,896 pa for birthday/Christmas presents and parties is also high. Household outgoings at $131,000 pa struck me as overstated. Holidays and entertainment at $326,000 pa is excessive to a significant degree, including, for example, three return long-haul first-class flights each year for M, the children and the nanny. M&#8217;s own clothing at $64,000 pa is an example of crossing the line between a reasonable figure for M qua carer and an unreasonable figure for herself. I am not convinced that a full-time housekeeper at $62,400 pa is warranted. Many other figures can also be reduced, such as $12,000 pa for the children and M to attend equestrian events, including in boxes, $9,492 pa for taxis, and $13,000 pa for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The budget includes about $24,000 pa for M&#8217;s therapy, although I sincerely hope this will be relatively short term and will not endure for the children&#8217;s minority. Included in the budget is $133,860 pa for keeping horses, although none have yet been bought; this figure seems to me to be excessive even if the children are about to ride (which they are not). </span></p>

Of course, F will pay the basic school fees and, I am told, books, which appear on the school bills.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In the end, I have come to the conclusion that the correct figure should be $500,000 pa in total ($250,000 pa per child). That includes school meals, school trips and uniforms which M will meet directly. It is sufficient for M to meet standard horse related costs for the children. If they do not, the monies can be applied in other ways for their benefit. In other words, there should be no variation upwards just because the children do indeed pursue equestrian interests, unless there is a clear case to establish that higher costs should be met by F (perhaps because they compete at a serious level). In general, I do not take account of M&#8217;s earning capacity, save that in my view it can and should at the very least be applied towards her own horse maintenance costs. The child maintenance shall be payable until each child reaches 18 or finishes full time tertiary education, and shall be apportioned as to 50% to M, and 50% to the child when they respectively reach the age of 18. This shall be paid by standing order. It will increase in accordance with an appropriate US index, which I suspect is CPI. </span></p>
