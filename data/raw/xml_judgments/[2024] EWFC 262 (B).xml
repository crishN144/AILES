William Jones (WJ), M&#8217;s now husband and Elisabeth&#8217;s step-father was named as a respondent, as he was registered on Elisabeth&#8217;s birth certificate as her father.

RO told me that he was aware that Cafcass had come into the case late, and that he didn&#8217;t consider that it was for him to go through each piece of local authority evidence and challenge it &#8211; instead, he told me that he tried to provide the best analysis that he could to address the issues as they stood. He explained that this was the most sensible way to approach the task directed by the court without re-visiting decisions made by previous workers in the case. RO noted a theme in the Section 7 and 37 reports prepared in this case that they were &#8220;not always as robust as I might like.&#8221;</span></p>

I make no criticism of the way he formulated his report or analysis &#8211; he went about the task drawing on his considerable experience and sound judgement. His evidence has been of huge assistance when I consider the state of the evidence before November 2023. In evidence, RO was quick to recognise the benefits which both parents offer, and was shrewd in his analysis of conflict. He plainly had Elisabeth at the centre of his formulation, and often brought his evidence back to Elisabeth and away from the adult issues when appropriate. Although RO did not support shared care, other things being equal in his report, he tempered his report with context about the importance of the sibling relationship and narrowed the key factors and considerations for me in a digestible way. I found RO&#8217;s evidence and analysis to be utterly compelling. </span></p>

In many areas, as I shall explain, her evidence is internally inconsistent. Rarely did M give an explanation that matched either WJ, or the corroborative evidence in this case. I found her appeal to ignorance when under pressure to be a recurring theme &#8211; she would often say that she didn&#8217;t understand, or she had given important papers to solicitors who had then lost it or failed to send them on.

His vocabulary was impressive; as he floundered under cross-examination, he apologised to me for losing his &#8220;perspicuity.&#8221;  He obviously found giving evidence very difficult and was plainly uncomfortable in being confronted with a myriad of facts which M had not shared. Despite being told some objectively upsetting things that his wife had done, he kept a cool demeanour. I did, however, find him to be preoccupied with how WJ was painted. When asked about his own behaviour &#8211; such as with the birth certificate registration &#8211; he attempted to employ rhetoric and pedantry as a weapon against the truth. He evaded important questions about Elisabeth&#8217;s life story. He also made claims that were made by nobody else in evidence, such as F allegedly threatening M into an abortion. It was difficult to know what was contrived, such as in my view his account of the testing process selection, and what he was repeating because he had been lied to. I agree with Ms Venters that his evidence was not credible; I felt that WJ was preoccupied with protecting his and M&#8217;s position, and attacking F, and did this to a point where I question the reliability of his account. </span></p>

The reviews prior to June 2019 make for viscerally painful reading. Although Mr Bott refers to the benefit of hindsight, WJ&#8217;s statement plainly refers to the foresight he had, and the significant due diligence he had done. These are public reviews, on some of the leading public review platforms. The reviews were obviously on WJ&#8217;s radar, as he referred to them in his statement (see &#8220;a few negative reviews&#8221;.) The reviews from the Trustpilot page include (from before June 2019) excoriating claims of inaccuracy. By way of example:</span></p>

It is clear from what purports to be a record that the samples were received on 13 June 2019 and testing was &#8216;in progress&#8217; from 14 June 2019. These dates seem largely uncontroversial, and concord with the bank statement submitted by M showing payment to &#8216;Testing Services&#8217; in the sum of 430 USD on 14 June 2019. However, on 31 May 2019, M was in email correspondence with the company email address: </span><a href="mailto:info@prenatalpaternitiesinc.co.uk" class="Hyperlink" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">info@prenatalpaternitiesinc.co.uk</a><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. She told me in evidence that she was also in contact with someone at the company using a &#8216;Gmail&#8217; address, which itself could have been seen as a &#8216;red flag&#8217;. I believe her that there was indeed a mix-up. Not because it makes evidential sense that a company would lose an email address it was previously using to correspond with a customer, but because the company&#8217;s operation seems to be genuinely shambolic.</span></p>

They described the extent of the test as a prick to the finger and smearing the sampled blood onto a card. The smeared card was then sent to a supposed forensic laboratory. Applying the gentlest of common sense to this, I fail to see how this is a robust or reliable form of paternity testing. At best, it could analyse a link between M&#8217;s DNA and F&#8217;s DNA.

The reviews of the DNA service refer again and again to the method of testing being flawed. M&#8217;s own written and oral evidence does not describe the &#8216;swabbing&#8217; element referred to on the Prenatal Paternities Inc website as being a necessary comparator for the plasma analysis, and it seems to be highly unusual to smear blood onto a card, as opposed to filling a vial of blood. </span></p>

In my judgement, given the knowledge that WJ had of the company at the time, and the pressure felt by both to resolve Elisabeth&#8217;s paternity in favour of WJ, M and WJ selected Prenatal Paternities Inc because of their reputation for mishap, and the questionable reliability of their testing. In short, and in my judgement, it is inherently likely that they viewed Prenatal Paternities Inc as a &#8216;gun for hire&#8217; capable of giving them the answer they craved, and adding a veneer of credibility to their plan to reconcile at the expense of F. I am driven to the conclusion that the entire testing process was a sham. In this regard, I reject both M and WJ&#8217;s evidence.

This imbalance in my view arises from the breakdown of M and WJ&#8217;s relationship in 2018, and the obvious breakdown of trust. M has admitted wholesale dishonesty towards WJ, which is catastrophic for the prospects of a relationship built on mutual trust. They have plainly kept the relationship going with M submitting to tracking and monitoring. M&#8217;s own evidence to me suggests that this is more potent than when they separated in 2018. In my view there can be some confidence that M&#8217;s views about F are softer. WJ has strongly held and intoxicating views about F. WJ has an intense dislike and mistrust of F. It would be artificial to discount the likelihood that these strongly held views may vitiate M&#8217;s softer views. </span></p>

She concedes that her own mother acted as a go between. Indeed, F&#8217;s evidence refers to the maternal grandmother having to intervene to ensure that F could meet and hold his daughter at the first contact on 13 December 2020. The incontrovertible text messages make clear MGM&#8217;s view that, for example &#8220;[M] understands how you feel left out of Elisabeth&#8217;s life &#8211; but it appears [WJ] seems to think your (sic) going to take [M] and Elisabeth away from him&#8230; such a mess.&#8221; MGM later suggested to F that the contact offered by M was &#8220;not satisfactory for anyone&#8230; It&#8217;s Elisabeth who will miss out.&#8221; In evidence, M told me that she insisted on supervised contact, and contact was arranged to take place in Victoria Park in Stafford. Her own description of this contact was out of step with WJ&#8217;s description. M told me that it was a lovely experience and that she tried to promote the relationship. WJ told me that this was a time where &#8220;Elisabeth was being taken from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">us</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> by a person we&#8217;ve never met.&#8221; He described it as &#8220;horrifying&#8221; and that the park was agreed because he was &#8220;scared of what [F] would do.&#8221; He described how this was destabilising their plan to reconcile: &#8220;I thought it would be a lot less troublesome&#8230; [F] was messaging my wife a lot&#8230; We just wanted to build our life.&#8221; This account adds significant weight to F&#8217;s own evidence that MGM was being pestered by WJ with calls and texts to cut contact short. F told me that MGM told him that WJ has tracked his phone &#8211; this interestingly concords with a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">modus</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> that WJ uses for M with tracking devices. F told me that WJ was reading the messages sent and at one point blocked her. It is easy to see how MGM&#8217;s enthusiasm for F&#8217;s role in Elisabeth&#8217;s life would have angered M and WJ, who were trying to build their life exclusive of F, and in doing so relegating the past. </span></p>

I am further troubled by WJ&#8217;s evidence because contact stuttered and was affected in spite of M&#8217;s evidence that she was open to promoting contact and wanted it to work.

I do not accept M&#8217;s criticism that the instruction of Dr Ranu was in any way incendiary, and I do not agree that this fact can undermine my faith in F&#8217;s ability to promote a relationship with M. F in his evidence was sincere about his wish, for example, to promote a relationship between Elisabeth and Anna &#8211; notwithstanding the animosity.

RO was plainly satisfied that the sibling bond would be protected during a shared care arrangement with both parties in/near to Staffordshire.

RO&#8217;s evidence was that such a move would have an overwhelmingly destabilising impact on Elisabeth. It would displace the threads of stability she has woven over her short life, which would in turn require pragmatic and co-operative parenting to ameliorate the harm. Such an option would require cordial relationships between F and M/WJ to ensure that the bond with Anna &#8211; who is an undeniably important person in Elisabeth&#8217;s life &#8211; is not fractured. Against that backdrop, it seems almost impossible to contemplate the parents working together to ensure that a transfer of residence to F&#8217;s care is protective of Elisabeth. An equal shared care Order would not have such challenges, because the threads of stability woven by Elisabeth would be maintained, albeit Elisabeth would need to adapt to a good amount of her life being with F. </span></p>

However, on a very fine balance, there is enough in the recent past to show that M and WJ are at least compliant with Orders, and the option of equal shared care is open to me, allowing me to preserve the ties that Elisabeth has built, and her relationship with Anna. If I ordered only limited contact with F and Elisabeth, as M invites me to, I do not consider that this would be sufficient to counterweight the potential for hostility with positive experiences of F&#8217;s parenting. In my view, Elisabeth needs generous, regular, and consistent time with F. Only this arrangement is sufficient to militate against the significant risk that M and WJ &#8211; given their behaviour and entrenched attitudes &#8211; may seek to undermine Elisabeth&#8217;s time with her father. When the periods of contact are shorter, that is a much easier task for M and WJ. Alternate weekends and shared holidays are simply insufficient to meet these aims. This sort of undermining behaviour is a source of significant emotional harm for Elisabeth.</span></p>

This again is to militate against the risk that I am satisfied exists from M and F to Elisabeth&#8217;s emotional wellbeing. To assist Elisabeth in embedding in her paternal family, and in meeting her strong welfare need for a sense of enduring belonging with her paternal family, in my view it is important that Elisabeth is baptised in the Roman Catholic faith. This creates a lifelong bond between Elisabeth, her paternal family, and the community of which Elisabeth will become a part. I reject M&#8217;s evidence &#8211; I consider that M has lost objectivity with her own negative experiences. In fact, baptism is just the first step on a faith journey and Elisabeth is free to make her own decisions &#8211; in time &#8211; about whether she remains a member of the Roman Catholic church and takes the sacraments. </span></p>

I accept that the ties should be preserved as much as possible. However, I also must give the half-sibling relationship an appropriate weight when looked at against F. Anna forms an important part of Elisabeth&#8217;s conception of her family, and her maternal identity. F constitutes Elisabeth&#8217;s sole gateway to her paternal family, and a side of her family and identity that she will benefit from, and must share in. Although I am satisfied that a separation from Anna would be harmful, RO did not consider that a shared care arrangement within the same proximity would be a separation. The girls would attend the same school and spend regular time with each other. They would be near each other as they grow up. I do not consider that a shared care arrangement within the local area is in any meaningful sense a &#8216;separation&#8217;. Nor do I consider that an Order which alternates Christmas morning with the siblings would in some way run contrary to Elisabeth&#8217;s needs or interests. RO was clear that this was in many respects the reality of blended families, and the closeness is fostered by the siblings being able to spend Christmas with each other at some point. There are many things that blended families do to meet this challenge &#8211; shared activities etc in the build up to Christmas, etc. </span></p>
