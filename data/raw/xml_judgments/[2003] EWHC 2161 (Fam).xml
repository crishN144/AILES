In her case, however, because three of the embryos created from the gametes provided by herself and Mr. Hadley had, on a previous occasion, been unsuccessfully transferred into her (and thus used), it was argued that the remaining two embryos in storage had also been used. Accordingly, since paragraph 4(2)(a) of Schedule 3 to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> prevents any withdrawal of consent to treatment once an embryo has been used in providing treatment services, it was argued that Mr. Hadley was prevented by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> from withdrawing his consent. The argument was initially limited to Mrs. Hadley&#8217;s case, but in their closing submissions Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn sought to include Ms Evans within it. I will deal with the argument under the heading <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The Second Point of Law</span> in paragraphs 150 to 165 below. </p>

Both have withdrawn their consent to the continued storage of the embryos, and both wish the embryos to be allowed to perish. Both say, quite simply, that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> gives them (and the claimants) an unequivocal and unconditional right to withdraw their consent to treatment and to continued storage of the embryos up until the moment the embryo is used. The stored embryos, they say, have not been &#8220;used&#8221;, since in the context of this case, &#8220;use&#8221; means the transfer of the embryo into a woman.  In so far as Convention Rights under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref> are concerned, both men say they are either not engaged, or, if engaged, are not breached. Article 8 in particular, they say, gives each of the four adults the right to respect for their private lives, and the State&#8217;s &#8220;interference&#8221; under Article 8(2) with those rights, by allowing them to withdraw their consent and thus prevent the transfer of the embryos into the claimants is, they say, necessary to prevent a breach of their Article 8 rights, and thus both justified and proportionate.  </p>

I was, however, materially assisted by the evidence called on behalf of the clinics and by argument from Dr. Kristina Stern, who appeared on their behalf. I was particularly impressed by the evidence of Dr. Nicholas Sharp, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist specialising in reproductive medicine at the Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust, who was responsible for Ms Evans&#8217; treatment; and by the evidence of Dr. Gillian Lockwood, obstetrician / gynaecologist at the clinic attended by Mrs. Hadley. I also heard from Mrs. Pamela Spearman, a fertility sister at Ms Evans&#8217; clinic, and from Ms Susan Lowbridge, a fertility nursing sister at the clinic attended by Mrs. Hadley. I was generally impressed by the overall quality of the care which each of the claimants had received; and it was in my judgment quite appropriate in each case for Mr. Tolson to preface his cross-examination of the clinics&#8217; witnesses by stressing how grateful each of the claimants was for the treatment they had received. </p>

There were those who considered the creation of embryos, and thus of life, in vitro to be either sacrilegious or ethically repugnant and wished to ban such activities altogether. There were others who considered that these new techniques, by offering means of enabling the infertile to have children and increasing knowledge of congenital disease, had the potential to improve the human condition, and this view also did not lack religious and moral arguments to support it. Nor can one doubt the difficulty of legislating against a background of fast-moving medical and scientific development.

The merits of this solution are not a matter for the House in its judicial capacity.

But that is not to say that attention should be confined and a literal interpretation given to the particular provisions which give rise to difficulty. Such an approach not only encourages immense prolixity in drafting, since the draftsman will feel obliged to provide expressly for every contingency which may possibly arise. It may also (under the banner of loyalty to the will of Parliament) lead to the frustration of that will, because undue concentration on the minutiae of the enactment may lead the court to neglect the purpose which Parliament intended to achieve when it enacted the statute. Every statute other than a pure consolidating statute is, after all, enacted to make some change, or address some problem, or remove some blemish, or effect some improvement in the national life. The court&#8217;s task, within the permissible bounds of interpretation, is to give effect to Parliament&#8217;s purpose.

The new scientific techniques which have developed since the birth of the first IVF baby in 1978 open up the possibility of creating human life in ways and circumstances quite different from anything experienced before then. These possibilities bring with them huge practical and ethical difficulties. These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between the various interests and concerns. Centres, the HFEA and the courts have to respect that scheme, however great their sympathy for the plight of particular individuals caught up in it.&#8221;</span></p>

She was, however, recommended for a laparoscopy, which took place on 13 September 2001.  That examination gave rise to concern over the condition of her ovaries, and on 27 September 2001, she underwent a laparatomy, or surgical incision into the peritoneal cavity.

The contents of the consent forms were explained to us. Indeed, we were taken through the consent forms on a paragraph by paragraph basis. It was obviously made clear to us that the consent of both myself and (Ms Evans) would be required before anything could be done. It was also explained to us that the continued storage of the embryos would be considered on an annual basis so as to ensure that both myself and (Ms Evans) wanted the storage to continue. In addition, it was clear that upon the termination of our relationship the storage and use of the embryos would need to be reviewed. It was therefore clear that we would still maintain freedom to choose either whether we wanted to start a family together or when we would start a family together. I suppose I was reassured by the fact that I would still maintain the same control regarding this decision as I would had these unfortunate events not occurred. Having said that, I would estimate that the entire consultation lasted approximately 90 minutes. This was from the diagnosis being given to (Ms Evans) and us embarking on a course of IVF treatment. As outlined above, the circumstances were far from ideal. (Ms Evans) and I certainly had no opportunity to discuss matters in details privately. In fact, the only time we had time to discuss matters alone was when we talked in whispers for about 60 seconds whilst staff went to obtain an IVF kit.</p>

I would have only provided (Ms Evans) with assurances, the nature of which are frequently given on a daily basis in any relationship.

The question of oocyte freezing is frequently raised by couples who, at initial consultation, may not be aware of or understand the difference between oocytes and embryos. Had such a query arisen regarding treatment, I would have referred the couple back to Mr. Sharp and the wider team for further discussion and consultation. This is because if oocyte freezing had been raised, it would have suggested to me that there was some doubt about them seeking treatment as a couple. This would have changed both my and the team&#8217;s perception of the suitability and appropriateness of IVF treatment for the couple since the welfare of any potential child or children from such treatment is always our paramount concern. </p>

She told me that Mrs. Spearman said words to the effect of  &#8220;we don&#8217;t do egg freezing at this clinic &#8211; you will have to go to an alternative clinic&#8221;, and that it was at this point that Mr. Johnston told her not to be a negative person: they did not need to have egg freezing. She said he told her he was not going to leave her. She put all her trust in him. He was trying to reassure her and he was going to be the father of her children.

Equally, when Mrs. Spearman gave evidence, the slightly defensive dogmatism of her statements softened. She was clear that there had not been a discussion with her about freezing eggs, but she accepted that it had quite possibly arisen as a question which was not followed up. She would have told Ms Evans that it was something the clinic did not do, and that Ms Evans would have to discuss it with Mr. Sharp.</p>

In a skilful cross-examination by Mr. Robin Tolson QC for Ms Evans he said that he was very much in love with Ms Evans. It had not crossed his mind that they might want to go their separate ways, although he knew the relationship would have ended if he had told her that he was not going to give her the child she so desperately wanted. He could not remember what he had said but he accepted that she had said words to the effect of  &#8220;what if we split up&#8221; and that he had replied &#8220;we are not going to split up&#8221;.

On 26 November 2001, Ms Evans underwent a successful bilateral oophorectomy for high-grade multiple tumours of borderline malignant potential. The positive news is that, although Ms Evans cannot now conceive a child spontaneously, the latest ultrasound scans were normal, and she has been given the &#8220;all clear&#8221;. Since the cancer did not spread to her uterus, it is the opinion of Professor Ledger, the independent expert brought in to advise pursuant to the order of the President of 19 September 2002 that Ms Evans should be able to carry a pregnancy normally, although if she is unable to use the six frozen embryos fertilised on 12 November 2001, there is no prospect of her bearing a child which is genetically hers.</p>

He accepts that he agreed to attend such a meeting to discuss the possibilities, but Ms Evans did not arrange it.

His version that there was no sex after 1989, possibly not even a meeting in 1990, and then an agreement merely as a casual favour to give sperm in the summer of 1991, makes no sense at all and I reject it. I do not find he donated as though he was an anonymous donor doing a favour which could have no repercussions for him.

The couple wanted to use the man&#8217;s sperm, but when it came to the point of insertion, the doctor told them that he had fertilised 12 of the woman&#8217;s eggs but that only one of them had been fertilised with the man&#8217;s sperm. The couple were told that the chances of the single embryo developing successfully if implanted on its own were negligible. The couple asked for time to reflect overnight, and on the following morning agreed that the treatment should proceed using six of the embryos, one of which, of course, was from the man.  The man signed a form acknowledging paternity of the unborn child. Insertion then occurred. </p>

Where, as in the case of Ms Evans and Mr. Johnston, we are concerned with embryos which have been created and are now stored, the question is whether, if Ms Evans sought to have the embryos transferred to her, that would still constitute treatment together with Mr. Johnston.</p>

Ms Evans and Mr. Johnston were undoubtedly being treated together on 12 November 2001 when Ms Evans&#8217; eggs were harvested and fertilised by Mr. Johnston&#8217;s sperm. In my judgment, they remained in treatment together, notwithstanding that nothing happened, until their relationship broke down.   From that point onwards it seems to me impossible to say that the couple are being treated together, or that if Ms Evans went to the clinic and asked to have the embryos inserted into her, this would be treatment of the couple together. </p>

As an ongoing series of events over time, treatment together must be something which can change and, in particular, come to an end in different ways.  Thus, I have no doubt that on 22 September 1999, when three fertilised embryos were placed in Mrs. Hadley, that constituted treatment together within the terms of Mr. Hadley&#8217;s consent. They were together as a couple and were so treated. Even if they had separated after the transfer of the embryos into Mrs. Hadley and before the birth of the child.

It equally gives too little weight to the fact that treatment designed to enable a woman to give birth to a child can only be provided in accordance with the strict terms of a clinic&#8217;s licence, and requires the clinic to take account of the welfare of the unborn child.  The need for the clinic to have an effective, continuing consent of both gamete providers pursuant to paragraph 6(3) of Schedule 3 at all times up to the transfer of the embryo into the woman is thus critical. It is not a matter of the clinic being protected by a bright line, non-fact sensitive approach. Without effective consents, the clinic cannot lawfully use the embryos. </p>

She would have very real concerns about asking a couple what would happen if they separated: if they wanted to discuss that option she would want to counsel them and they would have to come back for further discussion if separation occurred.

To treat in those circumstances, however, the clinic, in my judgment, would not only have to be positively satisfied of the man&#8217;s continuing consent to the treatment, but would have to give particular attention to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/49/section/13/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13(5)</ref>.

That is what has happened in the instant case. They are thus entitled to argue  (because the point is being considered irrespective of whether or not the consents have in reality been withdrawn) that we are positing a consent which has not been withdrawn, and which therefore remains in existence. The point, however, remains whether or not the consent is still effective. This is, essentially, an issue of fact. The facts here are that both couples have separated, and no longer have any form of relationship with each other. In these circumstances, in my judgment, it cannot be said, as a matter of fact, that either couple in this case is still being treated together.  </p>

As I have already stated, for there to be continuing &#8220;treatment together&#8221; in circumstances in which a couple have separated, the clinic, in my judgment, would need to be satisfied that the man&#8217;s consent remained effective.   I accept that this places a burden on clinics, but it is one, in my judgment, which it is appropriate for them to bear. I did not get the impression that either Dr. Sharp or Dr. Lockwood thought such a burden inappropriate.

The argument on Article 8 ranged very widely, principally, I think, because Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn sought to set up a positive obligation on the State to allow Ms Evans to have the embryos created by her and Mr. Johnston released from storage and transferred into her. This led Mr. Coppel, for the Secretary of State to set out in considerable detail the law on positive and negative obligations, as well as providing, with the assistance of Mr. Webb (an official in the Department of Health whose evidence I record at paragraphs 186 to 188 below) a comprehensive rationale of the policy considerations underlying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.

There is no direct authority on the point in relation to embryos, but there is abundant domestic authority, binding on me, that a fetus, at whatever stage of its development, has no existence independent of its mother.

To the contrary, it is one of the most important questions posed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  It is simply that Article 2 is the wrong medium to address it. Embryos created through IVF self-evidently contain life in an embryonic form. The questions are how those embryos should be treated; when and in what circumstances they can be stored; when for what purposes they can be used; and when they should be allowed to perish. The fact that they have no independent right to life does not either diminish the importance of these questions or mean that they are not fully addressed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:-0.02in">Once it was decided in principle that it would be appropriate to legislate in this field, and to enshrine within legislation the principle of consent to treatment services, it was, in the Secretary of State&#8217;s view, entirely legitimate, and consistent with the underlying objective, to favour clear or &#8220;bright line&#8221; rules which serve to produce certainty in all cases, and do not depend upon the circumstances of individual cases. Therefore, it was considered appropriate to permit male partners to withdraw their consent to treatment services prior to the use of an embryo in all cases, rather than to make that permission dependent upon the facts of the individual case: the circumstances, financial and otherwise, of the male, and of his partner or ex-partner, whether she was already a mother, whether she would be able to have recourse to IVF in the future, etc. A fact-sensitive rule would, in this situation, give rise only to uncertainty and to litigation. The fact that the present cases are perhaps the first major example of litigation between parties to IVF treatment (in contrast to the US, where there are several examples) demonstrates the success of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> in regulating this very sensitive area. The position of the claimants is undoubtedly deserving of sympathy, but the consequences of Schedule 3 in an individual case cannot, in the Secretary of State&#8217;s view, negate the legitimacy and the legality of the policy of adopting clear rules which can govern all cases.</p>

In the alternative, they argued that until the point at which the partners withdraw consent, the State has permitted both claimants to develop their private and family lives as they, and their partners, saw fit.   The State had licensed (and not banned) an assisted conception regime which met the claimants&#8217; needs.  Accordingly, there had been no interference.

Furthermore, the phrase &#8220;necessary in a democratic society&#8221; meant that there had to be a &#8220;pressing social need&#8221; for the restriction in question; the restriction had to correspond to that need; as a response the restriction had to be proportionate (i.e. do no more than is necessary); and the reasons advanced by the State had to be relevant and sufficient.

They acknowledged that no one licensing scheme would be required by the European jurisprudence.  What amounts to a &#8220;pressing social need&#8221; domestically was, within the margin of appreciation, for the State to judge &#8211; as was the choice of means to address that need. </p>

The first was that a State permitted assisted conception.  Having taken that step, a State might legitimately conclude that a number of matters required restrictions: - for example, ensuring standards of treatment and record-keeping; limiting research; prohibiting cloning; and limiting the numbers of children born to any one gamete provider.  The State might also choose to limit the &#8216;age&#8217; of the embryo &#8211; both &#8216;fresh&#8217; (in the United Kingdom by the 14 day primitive streak period) and &#8216;frozen&#8217; (in the United Kingdom by the 10 year storage period).

For example, the State should no more require a male to provide sperm to father a child than it should require a female to provide the egg, or to become pregnant.

It did not concern the lawfulness of a licensing scheme in general; or even the lawfulness of requiring consent.  It concerned the circumstances in which consent already given could be withdrawn to the use of embryos lawfully created for the purposes of having a child. It was in this context, and not in any wider area, that the necessity for a particular set of rules must be examined. Thus, it was submitted, respect for both (i) the couple&#8217;s private rights; and, (ii) the embryo, produce very different requirements once an embryo has been created.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.02in">Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn then addressed Mr Webb&#8217;s evidence. The first point was &#8220;the female right of self-determination in pregnancy&#8221;.  They agreed that the biological and social reality which lies behind the science, or which the science attempts to mimic, was important as a guide to the nature of the public interest and any balance.  However, it pointed, they argued, to a different conclusion.  During sexual intercourse, the male will have a role in fertilising the egg (and a free choice as to whether to attempt to do so or not), and a role in raising any child born.  But in between, the fate of the embryo lies with the female.  Before IVF, no male had ever been able by lawful means to prevent a female from developing and in due course giving birth to her embryo if she wished to do so.

But it was important not to refuse him the power to do anything else.  If a man wished to reassure a woman whom he loved that her embryos would always be available for her then why should he not be free to do so because of the &#8220;primacy of consent&#8221;?   Mr. Webb argued that it would be undesirable and unfair to insist on holding a male to his consent.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.02in">As to the special significance of parenthood, Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn argued that it was a commonplace for a child to be born against its father&#8217;s wishes. As to the welfare of the child, the interests of any child to be born &#8211; or the interests of the embryo if any &#8211; pointed in only one direction - birth.  Whilst it could be argued that a child may have a right not to be born (for example a severely congenitally disabled embryo) no such argument applied here.  The State was permitted to interfere in situations which were &#8220;potentially damaging&#8221; for the living child only in strictly defined circumstances  - see Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Was it to be suggested that the State has a policy to prevent a child being born because its father did not wish it where there is no suggestion that that child is likely to suffer (at least) significant harm?  </p>

The more important argument, they submitted, was the following.  A man should be free to withdraw his consent if he wished for the reasons advanced by Mr Webb.  But if he, at least, can give an irrevocable consent he should be free to do so.  It will always be apparent to the man that in doing so, there could be no quid pro quo from the woman because it will be impossible to require her to submit to the medical treatment necessary for implantation.  There is a natural imbalance here which it would be artificial for the law to try to correct.  </p>

It was an area in which individual circumstances will vary greatly and where any policy in the law should, at the very least, be capable of admitting of exceptions.  In any event a number of points in particular should be made.  First, a freedom to agree an irrevocable consent is clear and &#8220;bright line&#8221; enough.  Secondly (to anticipate the argument on &#8220;storage&#8221;) a rule which provided that there should be continued storage of embryos already created with consent unless both gamete providers determined otherwise was every bit as &#8220;bright line&#8221; as the present law.  Thirdly, however &#8220;bright line&#8221; a law may be, if it contravenes any individual&#8217;s human rights then it cannot be maintained.  Fourthly, certainty did not make a bad law better.  </p>

Assuming that all young victims of ovarian or similar cancers would at least be offered the opportunity to store fertilised eggs, the present position on the consent of the male gamete provider left them very vulnerable indeed.  Counsel submitted that it was a bad law which would permit a donor to deprive a young cancer victim from bearing a child from an embryo fertilised with his sperm when he might do so for no good reason, or no reason at all and perhaps years after he had made the donation (for which he might have been paid).   </p>

The emotions of the party against storage on contemplating the continued existence of the embryos, though valid, must be weighed against the emotions of the party who did not want to see the demise of the embryos.

Hence, in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Quintavalle CNR</span>, Lord Bingham of Cornhill had noted the strong views on both sides of the debate surrounding IVF and held that the merits of the approach adopted by Parliament in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> were not a matter for the House of Lords in its judicial capacity: see paragraphs 12 and 13 of his speech, which I have set out at paragraph 17 above.

In some circumstances it will be appropriate for the courts to recognise that there is an area of judgment within which the judiciary will defer, on democratic grounds, to the considered opinion of the elected body or person whose act or decision is said to be incompatible with the Convention.

It will be easier for such an area of judgment to be recognised where the Convention itself requires a balance to be struck, much less so where the right is stated in terms which are unqualified. It will be easier for it to be recognised where the issues involve questions of social or economic policy, much less so where the rights are of high constitutional importance or are of a kind where the courts are especially well placed to assess the need for protection.</span></p>

No later point could be chosen.  The claimants, he noted, did not dispute that but argued that the same rule should be applied to a frozen embryo stored outside the womb. However, that argument did not address the fundamental point that a woman who becomes pregnant following IVF treatment is in the same position as a woman who becomes pregnant following sexual intercourse only once she is pregnant.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.02in">As to the primacy of consent, the approach of Schedule 3 was that participants in IVF treatment should be able to give and withhold consent to the greatest extent possible, having regard to the potentially very lengthy period of time over which treatment might run and the special significance of parenthood which was the intended result of the process.  Schedule 3 recognised the reality that people&#8217;s situations can change over the course of a period of years, perhaps quite unexpectedly; and, in the Secretary of State&#8217;s view, it would be undesirable and unfair to hold people (both men and women, since the rules apply equally to both) to consents which they may have given several years earlier.</p>

That, however, did not establish that it was impermissible to consider this to be undesirable state of affairs.  Further, the Secretary of State simply did not agree with the claimants that the only public interest in whether or not a father consented to the birth of a child was a financial one; nor, patently, did Parliament.</p>

Nobody, he suggested would argue that a male progenitor should be able to compel the use of an embryo by transfer into an unwilling female, but the claimants were arguing for a position whereby transfer can be enforced against an unwilling male.  The claimants&#8217; argument that this was merely an imbalance which was created by nature which the law should not seek to correct did not meet the point. The law must strive to avoid sex discrimination in the enjoyment of Convention rights (Article 14 of the Convention) regardless of its underlying cause.  The regime contended for by the Claimants, whereby a frozen embryo would be treated as belonging to a woman who would have the sole power to determine its future would, he submitted, amount to a very serious form of sex discrimination, which it would not be open to the Court to countenance as result of its own duties under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HRA 1998</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/6/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6(1)</ref>.</p>

He accepted that this was not an argument for fixing the &#8220;point of no return&#8221; in any particular place, but rather for making it a firm line wherever it is fixed, and which did not depend upon the facts of individual cases.  As already noted, it was fundamental to the intention of Parliament when passing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to instigate a system of firm and clear statutory regulation in preference to a &#8220;free for all&#8221; governed only by the common law and equitable rules.  The instant cases were, he submitted, very good examples of the difficulties which could arise both for the parties to IVF treatment and for licence holders providing treatment, if the fate of frozen embryos had to be decided on grounds of fairness in the particular case. .  The need for certainty in this particular context answered the submission made by the claimants that a policy is <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> disproportionate if it does not admit of exceptions.  Everything depended upon the context:  there may be a very good reason in a particular case for a &#8220;bright line&#8221; rule.</p>

In each case there was an unwilling male former partner who did not want the interference with his right to respect for private life which use of the embryos would entail.  Moreover, the effect of Schedule 3 was not to deny parenthood to the claimants.  In Ms Evans&#8217; case, a prohibition on the use of the embryos deprived her of a less than 30% chance of conception, and a possibly lower chance of a live birth. However, she also had the possibility of becoming a parent in other ways, by conception using donor eggs, and / or by adoption.  In Mrs. Hadley&#8217;s case, the claimant was already a parent, and had a far greater prospect of conceiving another child of her own through the use of other techniques not involving the disputed embryos. </p>

If the parties did not consent to continued storage of embryos created with their gametes, then, in the Secretary of State&#8217;s view, that should not be imposed upon them.  There were considerable benefits for a non-consenting party in resolving the situation once and for all, by removing the embryos from storage.  This would put an end to any lingering doubts as to their fate, and obviate the possibility of pressure to change his / her mind being brought to bear upon the non-consenting party during the remainder of the storage period  (for example, as had occurred in this case, through the media).</p>

As Mr. Johnson and Mr. Hadley pointed out, each of the four parties has a veto. I have no doubt &#8211; indeed Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn accept - that were there a provision in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> which permitted either of the men to insist that either of the women had the embryos transferred into them against their will, both Ms Evans and Mrs Hadley would regard that as a gross interference with their right to respect for their private lives, and that they would be correct to so to regard it.

To put the matter another way, it is not unreasonable for either Mr. Johnston or Mr. Hadley to say, given the break-up of their respective relationships, that they do not wish to be the father of a child by a woman with whom they no longer have anything in common; by whom they would not wish now to have a child; and in circumstances in which, once any such child was born, they would not be in a position to play a full or proper paternal role, whilst at the same time remaining financially liable to maintain the child. </p>

It is an area in which the courts have only a limited role to play.   Parliament has chosen a carefully structured system of regulation, with clear rules based on mutual consent and the interests of the unborn child. The approach to statutory construction set out by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Quintavalle CNR </span> (set out at paragraph 18 above) and Lord Hope of Craighead in Hope in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">R v DPP ex parte Kebilene</span> (set out in paragraph 232 above) applies.

In these circumstances it is, once again, entirely appropriate, in my judgment, that the licensing system created by Parliament should provide clear and non-fact specific rules for any clinic which the Authority licences, which stand to lose its licence if it breaches its terms.</p>

The careful argument advanced by Mr. Tolson and Miss Freeborn, which I have endeavoured to set out in full, accepts that the State has the right to regulate fertility treatment and that a generous margin of appreciation must be given to the means permitted to the State in doing so. They do not challenge the lawfulness of a scheme of treatment which requires consent. Their argument, it seems to me, boils down to the proposition that it should be possible for the male gamete provider, if he wishes, to give an irrevocable consent to the use of the embryos created with his gametes, and that there is no legitimate public interest in permitting embryos created in these circumstances to be allowed to perish.  For the policy reasons set out by Mr. Webb and elaborated by Mr. Coppel I am unable to accept this approach. </p>

The right to found a family through IVF can only, put at its highest, amount to the right to have access to IVF treatment. Self-evidently, it cannot be a right to be treated successfully. Furthermore, it is a right which is qualified by availability, suitability for treatment and cost. Once it is clear, as in my judgment it is, that the consensual scheme for IVF treatment contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> (and to which both claimants have had access) is lawful and does not breach Article 8 of the Convention, it must follow that there is no breach of Article 12. </p>

It was, rather, that the Clinic was only permitted to store and use the embryos if Mr. Johnston consented, which consent was contingent up until the point at which the embryos were used in the material sense. It should be noted, Mr. Coppel argued, that in this context consent must be given to the licence holder, and could only be withdrawn by notice to the licence holder, regardless of what had passed between the participants themselves.  The scheme of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> therefore removed one of the essential pre-requisites for promissory estoppel.</p>

There was, he argued, as might perhaps be expected, a strong identity between this rule, and the rule which applied to the issue of whether a party may waive statutory rights by <span style="font-style:italic">contract</span> (as opposed to conduct).  The question in that context is whether the right conferred is exclusively personal (in which case waiver will be permitted) or is designed to serve other, broader public purposes and so, compendiously, whether to permit a waiver would undermine or frustrate the purposes of the statute:  see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Johnson v Moreton</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1980] AC 37" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1980">[1980] AC 37</ref>, 51F, 58B-D, 68D.</p>

Certainty was an important policy in the general public interest.  The effect of the claimants&#8217; estoppel argument would be to superimpose a fact-sensitive rule, the operation of which would depend upon the contents of unminuted discussions between participants in IVF treatment, occurring perhaps at a time of great stress, and upon the whole range of factors which affect whether the courts will recognise an &#8220;equity&#8221; (fairness, clean hands etc.). </p>

The bright line rule obviously enabled licence holders to be sure about what they could and could not do.  If estoppel could operate so as to overlay the provisions of paragraph 4 of Schedule 3, licence holders would be placed in the invidious position of having to investigate and make findings of fact in relation to what was said between male and female partners, and whether it was equitable to permit consent to be withdrawn.  The livelihood of those working on behalf of licence holders would be at risk if their judgment of the facts was found by the courts to have been incorrect.</p>

Thus if the notice of withdrawal may be avoided as a result of undue influence, duress or estoppel between the gamete providers, that did not affect the clinics in any way. They could carry on regardless unless and until they received notice. At that point they did not have to do anything other than continue to store the embryos. </p>

The clinics depend both for their livelihoods and their reputations on strict compliance with the terms of the licences granted to them.

The cases show a wide range of variation in both of the main elements, that is the quality of the assurances which give rise to the claimant&#8217;s expectations and the extent of the claimant&#8217;s detrimental reliance on the assurances. The doctrine applies only if these elements, in combination, make it unconscionable for the person giving the assurances (whom I will call the benefactor, although that may not always be an appropriate label) to go back on them.</p>

The principle, as I understand it, is that where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the one who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relations as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration, but only by his word. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:-0.02in">Seeing that the principle never stands alone as giving a cause of action in itself, it can never do away with the necessity of consideration when that is an essential part of the cause of action. The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind. Its ill effects have been largely mitigated of late, but it still remains a cardinal necessity of the formation of a contract, although not of its modification or discharge. I fear that it was my failure to make this clear in<span style="font-style:italic"> Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd</span> which misled Byrne J in the present case. He held that the wife could sue on the husband&#8217;s promise as a separate and independent cause of action by itself, although, as he held, there was no consideration for it. That is not correct. The wife can only enforce the promise if there was consideration for it. That is, therefore, the real question in the case: Was there sufficient consideration to support the promise? </p>

Firstly, there must be a legal relationship between the parties. Secondly, the estoppel is not, of itself, the cause of action, although it may be an element in it. Thirdly, there must be a clear and unequivocal promise or representation which is designed to affect the legal relationship between the parties.  Fourthly, there must be reliance on that promise or representation by the other party and, fifthly, it must be unconscionable for the person making the representation to be allowed to resile from it. </p>

That said, however, it does not seem to me that the absence of any one or more of these elements is necessarily fatal to an equitable estoppel. The essence of the doctrine, as Robert Walker LJ comments in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Jennings v Rice</span> [2003] 1 FCR at 518f is to do what it necessary to avoid an unconscionable result.  However, it does seem to me that in the instant case, the three critical elements which must be present are (1) a clear representation by Mr. Johnston; (2) reliance on that representation by Ms Evans to her detriment, and (3) a finding that it would be unconscionable to allow Mr. Johnston to allow Mr. Johnston to go back on the representation.</p>

On 10 October 2001, Mr. Johnson was doing his best to reassure Ms Evans that he loved her and that he wanted to be the father of her children. He was giving what I have no doubt was a truthful expression of his feelings at the time. He was not &#8211; nor could he be- committing himself for all time. In the field of personal relationships endearments and reassurances of this kind are commonplace, but they do not &#8211; nor can they &#8211; have any permanent, legal effect. They certainly cannot bind Mr. Johnston in what were totally changed circumstances, namely his separation from Ms Evans.</p>

What he is now saying simply reflects the reality. He and Ms Evans have separated. He no longer loves her, and she no longer loves him. In these changed circumstances, he no longer wishes to have a child by her. Were it not for the existence of the embryos, Ms Evans would not choose to have a child by him.   </p>

Ms Evans had very little time. She was given the news on 10 October 2001.Harvesting of her eggs and fertilisation of them took place on 12 November 2001. Ms Evans underwent an oophorectomy on 26 November 2001.  The reality was that egg freezing was not a option, nor, I think, was the use of donor sperm. The clinic would not undertake the former. I think it highly unlikely, in the light of the evidence of Dr. Sharp and Dr. Lockwood that Ms Evans would have found a clinic which undertook it, even if she had had more time, and been able to afford it. Furthermore, both egg freezing and AID would have opened up the question of the durability of her relationship with Mr. Johnston. The alternative clinic would have been bound to enquire into why Ms Evans wanted egg freezing or to use donor sperm; and, despite her personal circumstances, might have felt unable to provide either when Ms Evans had a partner who was capable of providing the gametes to fertilise her embryos.</p>

She was naturally in a highly anxious state of mind. She was, I think, by undergoing IVF with Mr. Johnston taking the only realistic course which was open to her. She was, I think, both aware that it was the only course, and it was one she was content to adopt. No doubt Mr. Johnston&#8217;s assurances played a part in what she did, but I do not think they were critical.  Had Mr. Johnston not given her the assurances I have found he did give her, I think she would have gone ahead with the treatment in any event. However, even if I am wrong about that, and even if an estoppel is capable of existing in the face of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, I do not, for the reasons I have given, think it would be unconscionable to allow Mr. Johnston to withdraw his consent. It is a right which the Statute gives him within the clear scheme operated by Parliament. It was the basis upon which he gave his consent on 10 October 2001. It is perfectly reasonable for him, in the changed circumstances which appertain, not to want to father a child by Ms Evans.  </p>
