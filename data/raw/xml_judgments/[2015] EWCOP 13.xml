		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"It is my primary factual finding that in Katherine's case the second part of the acid test is not satisfied.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">I am not suggesting, of course, that it is impossible for a person ever to be deprived of his liberty by confinement in his or her own home. In the field of criminal law this happens all the time. Bail conditions, or the terms of a release from prison on licence, routinely provide for this. However, I am of the view that for the plenitude of cases such as this, where a person, often elderly, who is both physically and mentally disabled to a severe extent, is being looked after in her own home, and where the arrangements happen to be made, and paid for, by a local authority, rather than by the person's own family and paid for from her own funds, or from funds provided by members of her family, Article 5 is simply not engaged."</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"Physically, Katherine is just ambulant with the use of a wheeled Zimmer frame. Mentally, she is trapped in the past. She believes it is 1996 and that she is living at her old home with her three small children (who are now all adult). Her delusions are very powerful and she has a tendency to try to wander off in order to find her small children. Her present home is held under a tenancy from a Housing Association. The arrangement entails the presence of carers 24/7. They attend to her every need in an effort to make her life as normal as possible. If she tries to wander off she will be brought back."</p>

I will explain the significance of this later in this judgment. It was also, I like to think, an important decision and it was for this reason that I expressed the view that the matter should be reconsidered by the Supreme Court (see para 27). However, the applicant council did not give the necessary consent for a leap-frog straight to the Supreme Court and I therefore granted KW permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal (see paras 31 and 32).</p>

In such a case it would be necessary to set aside the original decision without a determination on the merits. Similarly, a procedural order may require to be set aside without a determination on the merits because of a change of circumstances or a mistake.

And so I must here, even if I happen to think that the order of the Court of Appeal is ultra vires. The allowing of the appeal should be construed as setting aside para 6 of my order, even if it does not actually say so. But does the order replace it with a declaration that Katherine is being deprived of her liberty? It does not explicitly say so, which is highly surprising. Further, para 2 of the order is phrased in highly ambiguous language. It says "to the extent that the restrictions in place pursuant to the care plan are a deprivation of KW's liberty, such deprivation of KW's liberty is hereby authorised." The use of this conditional language suggests to me that Court of Appeal has not actually decided that this is a situation of state detention. What they are saying that <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">if</span> it is then it is authorised. In my judgment para 2 of the order does not amount to a declaration that Katherine is being deprived of her liberty. </p>
