	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In this sad case the court is concerned with the welfare of Alta Fixsler.  Alta was born on 23 December 2018 and is now 2 years and 4 months old.  The question which is before the court in respect of Alta is one of the hardest of those that come before the family courts of this jurisdiction for determination.  During her premature birth, Alta sustained a severe hypoxic ischaemic brain injury and was born showing no signs of life.  Although she was successfully resuscitated by the medical team, it is not disputed that Alta continues to exhibit the symptoms of a catastrophic brain injury, which injury will inevitably result in her death.  Alta is currently a patient at the Royal Manchester Children&#8217;s Hospital Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (hereafter &#8216;PICU&#8217;) where she is receipt of intensive life sustaining treatment from an expert and dedicated medical team.  This court is now asked to decide whether it is in Alta&#8217;s best interests for that lifesustaining treatment to be continued.  The inevitable consequence of it being discontinued will be the death of Alta. </p>

Alta is represented through her Children&#8217;s Guardian by Ms Fiona Holloran of counsel.  Alta&#8217;s parents, are represented by Ms Victoria Butler-Cole of Queen&#8217;s Counsel and Dr Rob George of counsel.  The mother gave her evidence to the court in Hebrew with the assistance of an interpreter. </p>

The parents tell the court that prior to these proceedings it had been their intention to return to Israel.  In their first statement, the parents emphasise the fact that being devout members of the Jewish faith means that their faith is not simply a religion but is also a way of life.  Within this context, the parents have sought and taken detailed rabbinical advice as to their religious duties and obligations in the context of Alta&#8217;s medical situation.  The parents oppose the application brought by the NHS Trust and instead seek to take Alta to Israel for continued treatment and the exploration of long-term ventilation at home in Israel in due course or, if the court concludes that it is in Alta&#8217;s best interests for life sustaining treatment to be withdrawn, for that step to be taken in Israel. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In making the very difficult decision that is before me, I have had the benefit of expert medical evidence from Dr Martin Samuels, Consultant Respiratory Paediatrician, Dr Anthony Hart, Consultant Paediatric Neurologist and Dr Rob Ross Russell, Consultant Paediatrician.  In addition, I have heard evidence from certain of the clinicians involved in the treatment of Alta, namely Dr A, Consultant Paediatric Neurologist, and Dr B, Consultant Paediatric Intensivist.  I have also had the benefit of hearing oral evidence from both of Alta&#8217;s parents, from their Rabbi, Rabbi Israel Goldberg, and have had benefit of a detailed and closely argued report from the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  The statement of the father also has exhibited to it a letter from the Chief Rabbi of Israel and a letter from Rabbi Lefkowitz.  Finally, I have been greatly assisted in this challenging matter by the helpful, considered and erudite oral and written submissions of Ms Mulholland, Ms Butler-Cole QC and Dr George and Ms Holloran. </p>

Alta&#8217;s birth, following a pregnancy marked by reduced foetal movement and polyhydramnios, was premature and occurred by way of an emergency Caesarean section.  The facts of the birth are not in dispute between the parties.  Upon delivery, Alta showed no signs of life and attempts at advanced resuscitation were commenced including intubation, ventilation, IV adrenaline and ET surfactant.  Alta was successfully resuscitated.  Her APGAR scores were 0 at 1 minute and 2 at 10 minutes, indicating a severely compromised perinatal period. It was 20 minutes before a heart rate of greater than 100 bpm could be maintained.  Following the transfer of Alta to the neonatal intensive care unit she required both artificial ventilation by way of high frequency oscillation ventilation and support to maintain her blood pressure.  Further tests demonstrated signs of organ damage including acute renal impairment and, from a neurophysiological perspective, severe cortical dysfunction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Given Alta&#8217;s prematurity, her treating medical team waited until 10 February 2019, the date on which Alta would have been at full term, before conducting a formal assessment of the severity of her brain injury. MRI brain scans demonstrated severe multicystic encephalomalacia affecting nearly all parts of Alta&#8217;s brain (meaning that extensive areas of cerebral spinal fluid now replace most of Alta&#8217;s higher brain structures). Alta demonstrated symptoms of a severe hypoxic ischaemic injury in the form of a gross hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and severe four-limb cerebral palsy with elements of dyskinesia and spasticity.  Dr A&#8217;s evidence is that by March 2019 there were indications that the damage to Alta&#8217;s central nervous system exceeded even some of the most severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathies seen in paediatric neurological practice.  The parents do not dispute that Alta has suffered a severe brain injury. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">From April 2019, a series of multidisciplinary team meetings were undertaken, at which treatment options were discussed.  The parents contend that, initially, the possibility of Alta going home was discussed, at which time there was no mention of Alta being in pain.  The parents further contend that only latterly did the issue of pain come to the fore, after the Trust had decided to make an application to the court.  The Trust contend that palliative care was discussed with the family from the outset and that pain has likewise been an issue for Alta from the beginning.  I am satisfied that it is not necessary for the court to determine which perspective is correct for the purposes of determining Alta&#8217;s best interests.  No agreement having been reached with respect to Alta&#8217;s care, on 18 December 2020 the Trust made its application for the orders it now asks the court to make under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court.

As I have further noted, MRI scans of Alta&#8217;s brain show extensive multicystic encephalomalacia, although elements of Alta&#8217;s cerebral cortex remain.  There is a limited amount of Alta&#8217;s thalami remaining and a small area of her cerebellum.  In addition, the imaging of Alta&#8217;s brain shows damage to Alta&#8217;s brain stem, although she does not meet the criteria for brain stem death.   </p>

There was less movement in her lower limbs.  Passive movements of her limbs revealed increased tone with a combination of dystonia and spasticity, with very marked clonus.  It was difficult to get full abduction of her limbs bilaterally.  Her reflexes were brisk in upper and lower limbs.  There was no plantar or palmar grasp.  I thought she was developing early contractures in her finger flexors, although you could just about extend the fingers fully.  She clearly has contractures in her thenar eminence and her thumb is tending into palm.  There were really no purposeful movements or normal movements in Alta at all.

Dr Ross Russell did not, unusually, examine Alta before preparing his first report and, accordingly, had the accounts provided by the parents and Rabbi Goldberg, the Trust&#8217;s application, the statements of the treating clinicians that accompanied that application and Alta&#8217;s medical records from which to form a view as to the extent to which Alta exhibits movements that could cause her pain.  The parents contend that Dr Ross Russell did not visit Alta initially in part due to the impact of COVID-19 and in part due to time constraints.  The Trust do not accept that Dr Ross Russell was prevented from attending by restrictions consequent on COVID-19.  It is not necessary for the court to determine that dispute. In his addendum report, and having examined Alta, Dr Ross Russell concluded that &#8220;the fact that Alta does have episodes of spasm on handling, even if those do not occur every time, seems indisputable&#8221;. In oral evidence, he conceded that there are spasms and that he had made that clear to the family because there are many reports from reliable professionals.  However, Dr Ross Russell also attached significance to the fact that Alta produced no response when her tracheostomy was suctioned by a nurse. </p>

Dr Hart stated that, with respect to Alta, what is seen consistently is that, when a painful stimulus is applied, a consistent response results.  In this regard, Dr Hart urged the court that it is the fact that a <span style="font-style:italic">consistent </span>response to painful stimuli over an extended period of time is identified in Alta that is significant, rather than the question of whether such a response is <span style="font-style:italic">constant</span>.  Dr Hart considered that this is particularly the case in the context of the variability inherent in painful stimuli, the medication being administered to Alta and level of damage sustained by Alta&#8217;s brain, which may lead to inconsistent response by reason of variability in the degree of stimulation, the amount of medication administered to Alta and inconsistent brainstem hosting of responses by reason of the level of damage Alta has sustained. Within this context, I note that when cross-examined by Ms Mulholland Dr Ross Russell conceded that, as pointed out by Dr Hart during oral evidence, during his own examination of Alta Dr Ross-Russell had not documented giving, nor had given painful stimuli to Alta, including not undertaking nail bed testing or supra orbital pressure tests.  In so far as he relied on Alta&#8217;s reaction to suctioning, he based his opinion on watching a nurse undertake that activity.   </p>

Alta is able to generate the reflex to unpleasant sensations, but she does not have any brain left of significance in the supratentorial compartment to have the cognitive ability to process pain further or to experience joy or happiness.

In contrast to other cases in which a proposal for continued care in another jurisdiction has been advanced, the details in respect of the parents&#8217; proposal are unhelpfully sparse.  The Israeli doctors, who it is envisaged by the parents will care for Alta in the event of her transfer to Israel, have not examined Alta nor have they requested facilities to do so.  It is unclear whether they have fully considered her medical records and they have not yet spoken to the Trust&#8217;s clinicians.  There is no written material from the medical institutions in Israel other than the two scant documents which are exhibited to Mr Fixsler&#8217;s statement, which confirm an apparent willingness on the part of director of the Herzog Medical Centre, Dr Yehezkel Caine and the Head of Paediatric Critical Care at the Hadassah Medical Centre, Dr Uri Pollak, to admit Alta as a patient. There is no evidence from the Israeli hospitals as to the treatment regime that would be implemented were Alta transferred to Israel and neither document deals in any way with the medical logistics of transfer or treatment plans, although there is confirmation that the parents have identified an air ambulance service willing to transport Alta.  Whilst the Herzog Medical Centre in Jerusalem has agreed to accept transfer of Alta, this is said to be subject to her being stabilised at the Hadassah Medical Centre.  The reason for this requirement, which introduces an additional move for Alta, is not dealt with in the documents provided by the parents.   </p>

The estimates that were provided by the expert medical witnesses ranged from six to twelve months in the opinion of Dr Ross Russell (he having revised his original estimate that Alta would live to between the age of six and eight after he had examined Alta prior to authoring his addendum report) and 12 to 24 months in the opinion of Dr Hart.  Dr Samuels was of the view that it is difficult to give a reliable prognostication with much depending on level of care doctors are willing to escalate to.  Each of the medical experts repeatedly stressed the difficulty in reaching any reliable conclusion as to life expectancy with respect to a child in Alta&#8217;s condition.

As I have noted, the parents consider that the medical staff involved with Alta&#8217;s care have performed an unjustified volte-face in circumstances where they consider that, when Alta was under the care of a previous treating clinician, she demonstrated a consistent and continuing respiratory drive, treatment at home was being considered and the question of pain was not raised but that, following a change of treating clinicians, it is now considered that treatment should be withdrawn and pain is now being used by the Trust to justify their application.

In our faith we consider that if somebody could live for at least 12 months and that that it cannot be proven that they are suffering constant pain, then it ultimately makes no difference whether they might live for a further 12 months or a further 70 years. They are regarded as being alive and there must not be any steps taken that would shorten a life. In our faith, it is strictly forbidden to actively shorten a life. The only circumstances under which this might be permissible is where somebody is in constant suffering and pain, but we do not believe that these circumstances apply to Alta.&#8221; </p>

Absent the fact of pain or the awareness of suffering, the answer to the objective best interests test must be looked for in subjective or highly value laden ethical, moral or religious factors extrinsic to the child, such as futility (in its non-technical sense), dignity, the meaning of life and the principle of the sanctity of life, which factors mean different things to different people in a diverse, multicultural, multifaith society. Nevertheless, the gold standard against which cases of this nature are measured and determined remains that of the child&#8217;s best interests and as the march of medical innovation continues to bring cases of this nature before the courts the courts will be required to apply this standard to the best of their ability.

Again, I accept that within the context of the frame of reference advanced by the Trust, namely continued invasive medical treatment over many years with little recuperative benefit may, for example in the manner articulated in Bland, reach the point of indignity for Tafida. The concept of human dignity as an element of the best interests analysis is however, not without difficulty. The term 'human dignity' does not lend itself to precise definition and there is no universal agreement as to its meaning. The concept of human dignity must, accordingly, contain a significant element of subjectivity and thus be influenced by, for example, the religious or cultural context in which the question is being considered.

In the context of the concept of human dignity, although difficult to define, I am satisfied that this is a significantly different proposition to, for example, continued care over a period of years confined in a Tier 2 ICU unit.&#8221; </p>

In an adult or older child the concept of dignity might be linked to their exercise of autonomy and be a crucial factor in determining what is in their best interests, but that factor does not apply in the case of a young child like Pippa, whose values, beliefs, and wishes cannot reliably be ascertained or inferred. Perhaps we all think we can recognise human dignity when we see it, but there is obviously a high degree of subjectivity involved in describing someone's life or death as having dignity &#8230;. There is a wide range of opinion as to what constitutes a dignified death &#8230;. I take into account the views of Pippa's mother and of others about her best interests, but given the very different ideas expressed to the court about what would constitute dignity for Pippa in life and in her dying, I shall not presume to adopt some supposedly objective concept of dignity to determine her best interests.&#8221; </p>

In his submissions on behalf of the guardian, however, Mr Davy made extensive submissions about the concept of dignity and its role in decisions concerning the withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment. It was his contention that, in addition to the principle of the sanctity of life and principle of self-determination, the court in these circumstances should take into account the principle of the respect for the dignity of the individual. He submitted that the judge was correct to identify amongst the factors relevant to his decision both the burdens arising from the intensive and intrusive treatment required to keep Pippa alive and her grave loss of function and the potential benefits to be gained from treating her at home surrounded by her loving family rather than in hospital. Mr Davy submitted, however, that the real justification for including these burdens and benefits is that they are both aspects of the principle of respect for the dignity of the individual. He argued that this principle requires respect for an individual's value as a human being and encompasses both their psychological and physical integrity being deemed worthy of respect. </p>

Mr Davy submitted that, in Pippa's case, there is an innate indignity and burden associated with the intensive and intrusive treatment required to keep Pippa alive and her grave loss of function. Alternatively, if she were able to be cared for at home surrounded by her loving family, this would be a less undignified existence than her current care within the PICU. Notwithstanding these submissions, however, the guardian concluded that, when all the factors relevant to the decision are taken into account including the three principles of sanctity of life, self-determination and respect for the dignity of the individual, the potential benefit to Pippa from being cared for at home did not come close to tipping the best interests balance. </p>

Examples include children in Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), Minimally Conscious State, or those with such severe cognitive impairment that they lack demonstrable or recorded awareness of themselves or their surroundings and have no meaningful interaction with them, as determined by rigorous and prolonged observations. Even in the absence of demonstrable pain or suffering, continuation of LST may not be in their best interests because it cannot provide overall benefit to them. Individuals and families may differ in their perception of benefit to the child and some may view even severely limited awareness in a child as sufficient grounds to continue LST. It is important, here as elsewhere, that due account of parental views wishes and preferences is taken and due regard given to the acute clinical situation in the context of the child&#8217;s overall situation. Although it is possible to distinguish these different groups of decisions to limit LSTs that are based on quality-of-life considerations, in practice combinations may be present. For example, a child or infant in intensive care may have sustained such significant brain injury that future life may provide little benefit, while both intensive treatment and future life are likely to cause the child substantial pain and distress.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">With respect to the latter issue of the constancy of Alta&#8217;s responses, which forms a central aspect of the parents&#8217; case, I accept the expert evidence of Dr Hart that it is the question of whether a <span style="font-style:italic">consistent</span> response to stimuli over an extended period of time is identified in Alta that is key, rather than the question of whether such a response is <span style="font-style:italic">constant</span>.  In my judgment this must be the correct analytical approach having regard to the variability inherent in the stimuli applied to Alta by different individuals (as readily demonstrated by the different views expressed as between Dr Ross Russell, who did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>apply painful stimuli such as supra orbital pressure, and the treating clinicians who have undertaken such testing), the medication being administered to Alta to address her spasms and other symptoms and level of damage sustained by Alta&#8217;s brain leading to the possibility inconsistent brainstem hosting of response.  These factors will, I am satisfied, lead to the likelihood of some instances of lack of response even if, overall, Alta&#8217;s demonstrates a consistent response over time.  In this context, the balance of the clinical and expert medical evidence before the court is that, over an extended period of time, Alta consistently exhibits whole body spasms in response to handling, care giving and treatment. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is correct that the observations of the clinicians, whilst internally consistent and consistent with the experts and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, are not consistent with parents&#8217; and Rabbi Goldberg&#8217;s observations.  However, I am satisfied that I must prefer medical evidence, and that of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, over that of the parents and Rabbi Goldberg.  Whilst there is no question as to the <span style="font-style:italic">bona fides</span> of their evidence, four factors have to be borne in mind when the court considers the weight to be attached to their observations.  First, it is not disputed by the parents or Rabbi Goldberg that Alta does sometimes exhibit spasms when handled and when subjected to treatment.  Second, in part for reasons that the court is aware but does not need to detail in this judgment, and in part by reason of choice, the parents have had little contact with Alta in hospital.  This must necessarily reduce significantly the weight the court can attach to the parents&#8217; assertions regarding the nature and pattern of Alta&#8217;s response to handling, care and treatment.  Whilst Rabbi Goldberg visits more often, his interaction with Alta is less comprehensive than that of the treating clinicians and nursing staff.  Third, the parents are, inevitably, in these very difficult circumstances subject to the flattering voice of hope.  This must also necessarily affect the weight that the court can attach to the parents perceptions of Alta&#8217;s presentation.  Fourth, neither the parents nor Rabbi Goldberg are medically qualified and necessarily observe Alta&#8217;s responses from a lay perspective rather than a medical one.  In such circumstances, I am satisfied that the evidence of the treating clinicians and experts should attract greater weight on the first question of the extent is Alta exhibits movements that, if she is able to experience pain, will cause her pain. </p>

Whilst Dr Ross Russell suggests that they do not occur on every handling, Dr Ross Russell did not examine Alta prior to his first report and his time with Alta ahead of submitting his addendum report was necessarily <span style="font-style:italic">far</span> more limited than that spent with her by the treating clinicians and nursing staff.  As I have noted, in any event Dr Ross Russell also considered that, having regard to her medical records, that it is &#8220;indisputable&#8221; that Alta does have episodes of spasm on handling, care giving and treatment.   </p>

Dr A&#8217;s detailed evidence in this regard demonstrates to my satisfaction that although both Alta&#8217;s brain stem and her thalami are damaged they are still partially functional and that therefore critical structures for perception of pain remain present and therefore she can still perceive pain.  Dr Hart likewise confirmed, in his capacity as the expert paediatric neurologist in this case, that the scans of Alta&#8217;s brain indicate that a limited area of her cortex has survived and that the EEG results indicate some degree of activity in Alta&#8217;s cortex, albeit abnormal in nature.  As I have noted, Dr Hart also considered that twitching seen in Alta in association with epilepsy indicated some surviving connections between Alta&#8217;s cortex and her muscles.

In my judgment, the evidence before the court demonstrates that Alta exhibits consistently a consistent response to the application of painful stimuli.  Dr B, who has regular clinical involvement with Alta, was clear that the application of painful stimulus such as nail-bed pressure, supra-orbital pressure or trapezius squeeze, causes Alta to exhibit the whole-body spasms that I have found Alta exhibits and, albeit more inconsistently, causes head movement (slight rotation to the right), mouthopening and tachypnoea. Within this context Dr Hart, the expert paediatric neurologist instructed in this case, stated that what is seen consistently in respect of Alta is that when a painful stimulus is applied a consistent response results  I accept the evidence of both Dr B and Dr Hart.   I am not able to attach significant weight to the opinion of Dr Ross Russell on this issue in circumstances where, by his own admission, his examination of Alta did not include the application of painful stimuli by way of nail bed pressure or supra orbital pressure or otherwise and conceded that his evidence with respect to this issue was &#8220;inexpert&#8221;. </p>

The RCP guidance is not guidance promulgated with respect to infants, who are both physiologically different to adults and differ in terms of conscious awareness of environment, learning, movement and reflexes.  Further, to my reading, the RCP guidelines do not rule out the possibility that reflex responses in a person in PVS can denote the experience of pain.  Within this context, I am satisfied that a consensus statement from those specialisms concerned with patients over the age of 16 with PVS or MCS does not greatly assist the court in determining in an individual case the extent to which an infant in Alta&#8217;s position experiences pain.   </p>

The difficulty is compounded by the fact that the language that has to be deployed in an attempt accurately to describe Alta&#8217;s experience is language that has been, as with all human language, developed to describe conscious experience.  We do not have language to describe properly, or perhaps at all, the experience of pain divorced from conscious thought. Within this context, I accept that this issue brings the court close to the boundary between the legal and the metaphysical.  That said, I am satisfied that the fact that it is not possible to describe exactly the nature of Alta&#8217;s experience of pain does not prevent the court from finding that, being satisfied that she is able to experience pain, that experience of pain is a significant burden to her.   </p>

Whilst I accept that, ordinarily, this proposition assumes conscious thought as a pre-requisite, I am satisfied on the evidence before the court that this need not inevitably be the case.  Even if the pain that I am satisfied Alta responds to is not &#8216;felt&#8217; by Alta emotionally or understood by her cognitively, in the context of her consistent response to painful stimuli and the nature of pain that is known to be generated by the repeated and consistent responses to handling, care giving and treatment by Alta (namely spasms that are said to be akin to severe muscle cramp) there is no reason to consider that such pain would be experienced by Alta any other way than as a negative experience.  Indeed, the experience of pain without the ability to understand it is arguably an even worse predicament than pain accompanied by understanding.  On the evidence before the court, the pain experienced by Alta can be associated with any of the handling, care giving and treatment she is subjected to and with the physical conditions from which she may suffer, for example, constipation and from positions that may create pressure points on parts of her body.  Within this context, I am reminded of the evidence of Dr A that the statement &#8220;It is impossible to know how much she feels&#8221; with respect to Alta may be correct but:  </p>

As Dr Samuels observed, having regard to the complexity of Alta&#8217;s condition and to her vulnerability, the only real certainty with respect to her life expectancy is uncertainty.  However, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the court to take account of the fact that whilst it is possible that Alta could succumb quickly if she develops an infection, on the upper estimates before the court it is possible that Alta may, subject to the continuation of intensive care and in all likelihood an escalation in that level of care, remain alive for two or more years.  Within this context, I am satisfied on the evidence before the court that Alta has no prospect of recovery or improvement given the severe nature of her brain injury.  The evidence before the court demonstrates that Alta will remain ventilator dependent and without meaningful awareness of her surroundings. </p>

Whilst Ms Butler-Cole succeeded in demonstrating in cross-examination that predicted deteriorations in a number of areas have not yet come to pass, I accept the expert evidence of Dr Hart that Alta&#8217;s symptoms are going to worsen, and she will accumulate further comorbidities that will increase the burden of pain that I am satisfied that she is bearing, including worsening dystonia and spasticity with associated pain, hip dislocation and pain, scoliosis, which may be painful, pressure sores corneal abrasions and ulcers and urinary tract infections. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The starting point in the analysis of Alta&#8217;s best interests is to consider the matter from the assumed point of view of Alta. As I have noted elsewhere, there are inherent and obvious difficulties in a judge seeking to place him or herself in the shoes of a two year old child.  In undertaking this difficult exercise I am not able, in circumstances where Alta suffered a brain injury that left her with no ability to learn about the world around her before she was able to understand anything of religion and culture into which she was born, to accept the submission that the assessment of Alta&#8217;s perspective on this matter should start by assuming, without more, that Alta would share the values of her parents, of her brother, and of her wider family and community.  I accept that a child&#8217;s attitude may be, and indeed often is influenced by the views, beliefs and guidance of his or her parents.  But the child remains an individual in his or her own right.  In some cases, of which <span style="font-style:italic">Raqeeb </span>was an example, there may be evidence that will allow the court to make an informed judgment as to the extent to which a child shares in their parents&#8217; values and the values of their community and factor that into the overall evaluation of best interests.  That is not the case here.  Alta is not of an age, nor in a condition to have knowledge of and to adopt her parents&#8217; values, from which she could extrapolate a position on the complex issues that arise in this case.   </p>

Within this context, I have held in mind at all times the strict religious credo that the parents adopt and the tenets of that credo as they relate to the withdrawal of life sustaining treatment.  I have also borne in mind that a person may wish to continue to receive treatment notwithstanding the presence of profound disability and that the court cannot simply assume that a profoundly disabled child will not wish to lead a life affected by disability.  However, against these matters, I am satisfied that I must also have regard to the fact that Alta&#8217;s likely attitude to treatment would be influenced by the fact that the prospect facing her if treatment is maintained is one of continued medical intervention that will do not more than maintain her in a moribund state with no awareness, with no prospect of improvement or recovery, the certainty of further physical deterioration and, as I have found above, in a situation of consistent pain.  Within this context, in discharging the difficult task of asking myself what Alta&#8217;s attitude to continued life sustaining treatment would be likely to be, I am satisfied that, in circumstances where she has not developed any understanding of the faith into which she was born, and giving due weight to the fact that a child&#8217;s attitude may be, and often is influenced by the views, beliefs and guidance of his or her parents, it is more likely than not that Alta&#8217;s point of view would be that continued life sustaining treatment would not be acceptable to her. </p>

The sanctity of life is a fundamental, indeed sacred, principle from which there flows a strong presumption in favour of a course of action that will prolong life.  Whilst, understandably, the parents seek to locate the principle of the sanctity of life within the strict religious paradigm to which they each hold, the sanctity of life is recognised in both the religious and the secular spheres.   Further, the sanctity of life is of equal application to everyone.  Alta is profoundly disabled but a life of disability is of equal value to all other lives.  Notwithstanding Alta&#8217;s parlous position, her life is valuable in itself and for the manner in which it adds, during her brief time in the world, to the collective human experience from which we can all learn. Alta&#8217;s life has value for her, to her sibling and, without question, has value to her parents. Alta&#8217;s life also has inherent value.   Within this context, in reaching a decision as to Alta&#8217;s best interests I acknowledge the strong presumption in favour of continuing the treatment that will prolong Alta&#8217;s life. </p>

I have of course cautioned myself that, as was made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A Minor)(Wardship: Medical Treatment)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] Fam 33" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] Fam 33</ref>, pain is but one factor to be placed in the best interests balance and, in particular, that intolerability is not a quasi-statutory yardstick when determining best interests.  However, having regard to the findings I have made in this case with respect to Alta&#8217;s experience of pain, associated with any of the handling, care giving and treatment and with physical conditions from which she suffers, I am satisfied that that experience is a very weighty factor in the best interests analysis of the court.  The weight to be attached to this factor is further enhanced in circumstances where it is possible that with intensive care Alta will survive for a number of years but will, as I have found, accumulate in that time further comorbidities that will increase the burden of pain that I am satisfied that she is bearing, including worsening dystonia and spasticity with associated pain, hip dislocation and pain, scoliosis, which may be painful, pressure sores, corneal abrasions and ulcers, and urinary tract infections.   </p>

Within this context, in evaluating Alta&#8217;s best interests the court must factor into that analysis the fact that the burdens of life sustaining treatment for Alta, as particularised in the statements of Dr B, outweigh by a significant margin any benefits beyond that of maintaining fidelity to the principle of the sanctity of life.

Namely, the transfer of Alta to Israel for continued life sustaining treatment at an Israeli medical institution.  The evaluation of this option has been significantly hampered by a paucity of detailed information regarding the option that is advanced by the parents as their primary case.   Whilst the court has email confirmation that two institutions in Israel would be prepared to accept Alta as a patient, there are no details of the treatment regime that would be adopted, no explanation of why Alta would be required to be admitted first to one hospital and then moved again to a second hospital.  The Israeli clinicians have not been available for discussions with Alta&#8217;s treating team in this jurisdiction and, accordingly, there has been no liaison with the clinicians who have a detailed knowledge of Alta&#8217;s current medical needs.   In this context, the court has no information regarding the basis on which the Israeli doctors who indicate they will accept Alta for treatment say that that course is in Alta&#8217;s best interests.

To take that course of action would, on the evidence of the treating clinicians and each of the experts instructed in this case, be to expose Alta to further pain and discomfort during the course of transfer for no medical benefit in circumstances where all parties accept that the treatment options now available for Alta provide no prospect of recovery.   </p>

On the particular facts of this case however, and within the context of the findings I have made as set out above, I consider that I am bound to give significant weight to the fact that both the treating clinicians and each of the experts instructed in this case, including Dr Ross Russell, the paediatrician instructed on behalf </p>

Further, whilst the views of the parents may have particular value in circumstances where they know well their own child, that proposition comes under some strain in this case in circumstances where the parents have, as I have described, had little contact with Alta.  The court must also be mindful that the views of the parents may, understandably, be coloured by emotion. All that said, I am satisfied that in this case it is important to examine the views of the parents, particularly in circumstances where those views crystalise around their strongly held religious convictions and the weight the parents contend the court should place on that factor in reaching its best interests decision.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In this case the parents&#8217; views are informed by their strong religious belief as UltraOrthodox Jews.  Within this context, I have considered very carefully their evidence on this subject and the extremely helpful evidence of Rabbi Goldberg in seeking to understand the religious tenets that the parents contend impact upon this case.  In some respects, it might be said that the approach articulated by certain rabbinical scholars is not so different to the secular task assigned to the court, namely, and to paraphrase Rabbi Goldberg&#8217;s formulation, the question is how one is to balance the presumption in favour of preserving life with the need to alleviate suffering.  However, and as would be the position were the court concerned with the religious principles observed by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism or any of the world&#8217;s established religions, it is not religious law that governs the decision in this case but the secular law of this jurisdiction.  Within this context, and self-evidently, the analysis the court must undertake is much wider in its ambit than the rabbinical analysis that informs the position that is taken by the parents in this case.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Whilst the rabbinical analysis may rest on the question of the extent of Alta&#8217;s suffering (and acknowledging that that analysis is more or less strict depending on the strand of rabbinical teaching that is being considered), the question for the court is what outcome is in Alta&#8217;s best interests taking into account <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> relevant factors, including the pain the court has found that Alta consistently experiences.  Accordingly, the spiritual considerations that the parents urge upon the court fall to be considered alongside the very worldly issue of the consistent pain that the court is satisfied that Alta experiences (which, according to certain rabbinical schools, is an approach that Jewish law also recognises) and the additional burdens on her of treatment and her condition.  Within this context, it is further important to note that, insofar as the parents Art 9 right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion is engaged in this case and must be accorded weight (in respect of which I did not hear detailed argument), the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion may be circumscribed where this conflicts with the subject child&#8217;s best interests.  Within this context, as I have noted in other cases, in <span style="font-style:italic">Prince v Massachusetts</span> (1944) 321 US 158 the US Supreme Court held that parents&#8217; rights to manifest their religion are necessarily circumscribed by the interests of the child in that: &#8220;&#8230; neither rights of religion nor rights of parenthood are beyond limitation. Acting to guard the general interest in youth&#8217;s well-being, the state as <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> may restrict the parent&#8217;s control by requiring school attendance, </p>

Its authority is not nullified merely because the parent grounds his claim to control the child&#8217;s course of conduct on religion or conscience. Thus, he cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the child more than for himself on religious grounds. The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death &#8230; [T]he state has a wide range of power for limiting parental freedom and authority in things affecting the child&#8217;s welfare; and that this includes, to some extent, matters of conscience and religious conviction &#8230;&#8221; </p>

In the circumstances, and having examined Alta&#8217;s best interests from a broad perspective, encompassing medical, emotional, sensory and instinctive considerations, and having paid due regard to the fundamental, but not immutable principle of the sanctity of life, as well as the parents&#8217; deeply held religious convictions, it is with deep regret that I am satisfied that it is not in Alta&#8217;s best interests for life sustaining medical treatment to be continued and in her best interests for that treatment now to be withdrawn and to be moved to a palliative care regime.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">First, and again having regard to the court&#8217;s findings with respect to Alta&#8217;s experience of pain and to the courts findings as to her prognosis, it cannot be said to be in Alta&#8217;s best interests to be transferred to Israel in circumstances where to take that course of action would, on the evidence of the treating clinicians and each of the experts instructed in this case, be to expose Alta to further pain and discomfort during the course of transfer for no <span style="font-style:italic">medical</span> benefit.  Whilst I accept that transferring Alta to Israel for the withdrawal of life sustaining would mean that her last days or weeks would be spent with her family who would have support for themselves and Alta&#8217;s brother, that her death and burial would be able to occur in accordance with the religious beliefs of the family, including being buried with wider family including her paternal greatgrandmother and that her grave would be in Holy Land, and her parents would be able to visit it to remember her and to pray, I am not satisfied that these necessarily adult concerns can outweigh the additional burden of pain that would be placed on Alta by a transfer, particular in circumstances where it is conceded that it is possible to transfer Alta for burial in Israel after her death.  Likewise, whilst I accept that, from the perspective of Jewish law, there would be spiritual benefits to Alta in ending her life in Israel, as helpfully articulated to the court by Rabbi Goldberg, I am not satisfied that those spiritual benefits are sufficient to outweigh the additional burden of pain that would be placed on Alta by a transfer, again particularly in circumstances where, whilst </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Second, and more fundamentally, this court having concluded that withdrawal of life sustaining treatment is in Alta&#8217;s best interests, there is no evidence that that course of action would be endorsed following the transfer of Alta to the jurisdiction of Israel.  At the very least, Ms Butler-Cole and Dr George concede the decision of this court would not be directly enforceable in Israel and that an order of the Israeli court authorising withdrawal of treatment would be required.  This court has not had the benefit of expert evidence on Israeli law to assist it in evaluating the likelihood of such an order being granted.  However, the letter from the Chief Rabbi of Israel suggests that parents have rights under Israeli legislation that may mean that were they to seek a different decision in Israel to the one reached by the court in the jurisdiction in which Alta is habitually resident, such a decision may be granted.  This is particularly the case where, as I have observed, there are plainly different schools of rabbinical thought regarding the permissibility of withdrawing life sustaining treatment.  For example, and accepting I did not hear from him, Rabbi Mansour gave a more categorical view to a meeting on 9 December 2020 to the effect that the Jewish faith does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> believe in shortening life because of pain.  Whilst Ms Butler-Cole and Dr George urge upon the court a delay in the implementation of its decision whilst these matters are clarified and an application made to the Israeli court, I am satisfied that such a delay would be inimical to Alta&#8217;s best interests in circumstances where she is, as I have found, the subject of consistent pain. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Third, I am satisfied that it would, from a human perspective, be unfair to put temptation in the way of the parents and their family. Both parents gave clear, spontaneous evidence to the court that they would respect the court&#8217;s decision even if it is not what they themselves think is best for their daughter and would accept the withdrawal of life sustaining treatment in Israel. I have absolutely no doubt that each parent&#8217;s statement to me that they would abide by the decision of the court was made in good faith and that, at the time those statements were made, each parent intended fully to honour them.  However, the formal context of the courtroom is very different to that provided by the embrace of close family and friends.  It would not be surprising at all if, having arrived in Israel for the purposes of the withdrawal of life sustaining treatment, the decision of an English judge now over 2000 miles distant were to be overborne by the siren call of friends and family deeply connected to the religious traditions that are a way of life for the parents and their family. </p>

The parents cannot be criticised for having reached a different decision informed by the religious laws that govern their way of life.  But applying the secular legal principles that I must, and according due respect to the deeply held religious convictions of the parents, I cannot agree with their assessment and am required to act accordingly.

The first nurse I met was young and engaging. She had expert knowledge of Alta&#8217;s needs and was to spend her entire twelve-hour shift at her bedside. She spoke to Alta before she did any interventions, used terms of endearment such as &#8216;gorgeous girl&#8217; and moved her with extreme care. She gave her a bed bath and changed her outfit. She then sponge-washed her hair, patted it dry and then put it in two plaits with clips with tiny bows on. Despite knowing that Alta has no awareness of such, the care and consideration she and the other staff I met gave Alta was obvious&#8230; I asked the nurses what it felt like to care for her and all responded with the utmost respect, impressive medical knowledge but with a deep sense of sadness that the care they give, from a nursing perspective but also on a human level, only ever causes her pain.  One nurse (several years experienced on paediatric intensive care) said to me &#8216;I go home and cry about Alta&#8230;I came into nursing to make people better, more comfortable and we cannot do that for her&#8217;.&#8221; </p>

Whilst it is important now to implement the judgment of the court expeditiously in light of the findings I have made with respect to pain and suffering, a little time will need to be given to allow the parents to come to terms with the decision of the court in order that Alta, I hope, has the benefit of their input and presence at the end of her life. Further, if it is to be the case that Alta is to be taken to Israel for burial following her death then, accepting the uncertainties as to the period of survival following the withdrawal of treatment, careful co-ordination of those arrangements with the point at which life sustaining treatment is withdrawn will need to be made.  I am satisfied that that planning should form part of the overall plan that governs the withdrawal of treatment. </p>
