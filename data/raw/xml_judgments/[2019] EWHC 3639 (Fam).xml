The first application is not opposed by the respondent mother, and the dispute revolves around the second application.

The mother and E moved to the Westcountry with a maternal half-sibling, L, who is now six years of age, a child from the mother&#8217;s earlier relationship.  There is some dispute between the parents regarding their period of cohabitation in a family unit with E.  The resolution of that issue is not determinative of this application.  In any event the mother accepted that they were together for approximately eight months, and in the context of a life cut short at 22 months, this period of family life was of significance.  The father&#8217;s last direct contact with E was in 2017. </p>

In October 2017 E met her death as the victim of a homicide; she was only 22 months old.  In March 2019, Mr C was convicted of E&#8217;s murder; he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 20 year minimum sentence.  The mother was convicted of causing or allowing E&#8217;s death and she was sentenced to three-and-a-half years imprisonment.  At page D65 to 68 of the trial bundle I have the sentencing remarks of May J in relation to the mother and her culpability and the basis of the sentence imposed.  I do not propose to refer to those matters in this judgment.  If at all possible in this dispute I shall try and de-escalate heightened emotions.  May J referred to the dignity and the restraint exhibited by the family during the criminal proceedings, which must at times have been hard to maintain. </p>

The father&#8217;s opinion of the mother and her conduct and responsibility for E&#8217;s death emerged clearly during his oral evidence as well.  It should not be forgotten that the person who was responsible for E&#8217;s death was her murderer. </p>

The father told me that the mother moved away with E without advance notice nor consultation, and in the interval of seven months or so between his last direct contact with his daughter and her death he did his best to locate her, and without Legal Aid to pursue Private Law Children Act proceedings he was attempting to keep contact with his daughter.  The father admitted that following E&#8217;s death a Facebook page had been set up which was still active.  He maintained there were up to 30,000 social media followers, and that this support had assisted him. </p>

He averred that he has been subjected to a volume of threatening messages and calls which were exhibited to his documentary evidence.  Having regard to this atmosphere of mistrust and acrimony, it is commendable that the parents have reached significant agreement about the funeral ceremony during discussions at court in September when this application was listed before Holman J, and in further discussions during the course of this hearing itself.  For example, the father agreed that E should be buried rather than cremated, acceding to the wish of the maternal family.  It is fitting that E should be laid to rest in the Midlands, which was the county of her birth, rather than the Westcountry, which was the county of her death, and in this regard the maternal family have compromised also.  The mother and father confirmed that the funeral and the internment would be limited by written invitation to approximately 80 or so family members; 40 or 50 on the paternal side (which may include some of E&#8217;s half-siblings on the paternal side; there are five of them, the oldest being 11 years of age), and 30 or so on the maternal side, and the involvement of the media would be discouraged.  The father had contacted a firm of local funeral directors, which were identified, and appeared to be perfectly reputable.  The mother had also made enquiries in that regard as well.  Both sides of the family could meet the expense of E&#8217;s funeral ceremony.  I am not informed of any other financial assets which are included in E&#8217;s estate.  I do not propose to outline further the arrangements which have been agreed between the parties because they are intimate to the family.  If necessary they can be set out in a schedule to any order made by the court, which was the format of the order approved by the court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Burrows</span>, to which I have referred already.

The mother would prefer a motor hearse, but has no preference with regard to its colour.  Each hearse would be glass sided, as is usual, and E&#8217;s baby pink coloured coffin would be visible (this being the colour selected by the parents jointly).  The horses drawing the hearse would have pink plumes.  I have seen photographs of the hearse in a document produced by the father from his selected funeral directors.  The mother&#8217;s apprehension centres around the level of public interest and attendant media attention which might follow a funeral in (Cemetery X) where she is known and where she would not feel comfortable, this being accentuated by the selection of a hearse which would draw attention to the funeral itself.  </heading>

She feared the father would organise a &#8220;media circus&#8221; and she wanted a dignified and peaceful burial for E.  (I refer there to page C108 of her evidence).  I do not believe that the father&#8217;s preference for the horse drawn hearse was motivated by a desire to cause any difficulty.  He appeared (when giving his evidence) to be genuinely motivated in his preference and his desire to do his best for his daughter in death.  White is often associated with purity, and the father&#8217;s opposition to a black hearse was quite apparent in the witness box.  Of itself what was proposed by the father in this regard could not reasonably be described as undignified. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Burrows</span> the mother was disqualified by reason of her substance misuse, and the assistance available to her by a third party did not overcome the mother&#8217;s disqualification.

Where a child is taken from this world in her infancy, in the tragic circumstances of this case, where one surviving parent is incarcerated and hampered in the practical exercise of her duty as an administrator, what could be more obvious than the substitution of the deceased&#8217;s second surviving parent able and willing to discharge this responsibility? The mother does not ask for a grant to a non-parent, and on what conceivable basis should I consider any alternative grantee, for example, E&#8217;s maternal step-grandfather or grandmother?  This,  I believe, would aggravate a situation which is already fraught, and, as indicated by Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re K</span>, whilst these third parties do in fact fall within Rule 22, they fall within a lower hierarchy of priority than does a birth parent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">What then about the inherent jurisdiction?  I believe a wise parent in the circumstances of this case would wish to attend to E&#8217;s burial without further inordinate delay and with all proper respect and decency.  In general, I do not believe that I should micro-manage the funeral arrangements which are so intimately connected with family life and in this instance by parental ties.  Public taste and convention in the organisation of funerals or cremations is constantly evolving, and a court should be slow to direct where or how a deceased would be buried.  (I refer there to <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Anstey v Mundle</span>).  One can always envisage an extreme case where respect and decency was being totally disregarded and intervention might be required, but I have no reason to conclude that what is proposed by the father crosses that line.  The burial at (Cemetery X), or the use of a horse drawn hearse, is not of itself exceptional.  The mother&#8217;s attendance would be constrained and limited and her safety provided for by the circumstances of her imprisonment and the arrangements made by the Prison Authorities.  I have no real evidence to conclude that decency, respect or public order would be compromised by what is proposed by the father.  Why should the safety of the maternal family members, or indeed L (if he attends the funeral), who are entirely blameless be compromised.  Right-thinking attendees at the funeral should be sympathetic rather than hostile to all those who have suffered loss in their bereavement; that is an integral part of our common humanity.  After all, no one in this case proposes a wholly secret funeral ceremony for E, and there are risks whatever the location or the hearse selected.  Assurances have been provided by the father that he will not whip up media interest and attention, and </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.01in">I have no real basis for concluding that he intends to breach these assurances given solemnly to the court.  Public memory fades with the passage of time, allowing grieving family members paying their respects to E&#8217;s grave in future years to be unhindered.  (Cemetery X) appears to be a reasonable base for E&#8217;s family generally, who are mainly based in the Midlands, to attend and pay their respects in the future.  This future apprehension is not of such significance that it materially affects the immediate decision which the court must take, namely, to facilitate a swift, decent and respectful burial for E. </p>
