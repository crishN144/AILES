At all events, once these two people were in a relationship, they moved forwards towards the conception of a child.  A male donor was privately identified and in due course the respondent was successfully inseminated with sperm from that donor.  The applicant says, and I accept, that she was present throughout that actual process of conception.</span></p>

The applicant has said in her statement at paragraph 17 that it was agreed that the child would grow up calling her "Papa".  Further, the mother took the applicant's surname as the surname both of herself and of the child, so the child is now known by the surname of the applicant.  </span></p>

There was no formal issued or written application.  Apparently, the Irish judge, in a brief or summary way, declined to make any order on that informal oral application.  </span></p>

It may be that she was not prepared to take action on an application merely made orally at court.  It may be that she was taking the view that the question whether or not the child should be returned to, or remain in, Ireland fell to be decided exclusively by this court, here in England and Wales.  It may be that, on the merits of the matter, she did not feel it was appropriate, at that stage, that the child, who by then was becoming settled in the environment of the mother's own mother's home in England, should have to remain immediately in Ireland.</span></p>
