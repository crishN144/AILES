B, C and D were all present in the home when this happened.  A was understandably very upset when her mother shaved her head, not least because she was very proud of her hair.  The Mother was arrested following the head shaving incident.  The Stepfather was arrested in relation to the sexual abuse allegations.  Bail conditions prevented the Mother and Stepfather from returning to the family home.  Fortunately, the Maternal Aunt was able to move into the family home to look after the children.  They remained living in the family home and the children were able to continue to attend their schools.  Some sense of normality was retained for them.  However, the children were living apart from the Mother and the Stepfather.</p>

A now says (and has said for some months now) that she lied and that the sexual abuse did not take place.  A has given reasons for lying, including jealousy about the relationship between the Stepfather and the other children and wanting more of her mother&#8217;s attention.  Whilst A saw the Father regularly in the past, the Father has not wanted to spend much time with A after A told the Father&#8217;s step-daughter in October 2022 that the Father was not that child&#8217;s real father.  A has probably felt rejected by the Father.  The Father&#8217;s actions in reducing the time he spends with his daughter is surprising because I have been told that he is/is training to be a social worker.  The Father rejected that description and told the local authority that he is an Uber driver [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 1495</span>].  Whatever his occupation, the Father ought to know the likely impact his decision would have on A.  However, I have not heard from him.  He has chosen to take no part in these proceedings.</p>

The last version is dated 19 January 2024.   The allegations are relevant to welfare decisions concerning the children because the Stepfather and the Mother both want the Stepfather to return to live with the family.  They are allegations that could re-surface again, as they have over the years.  On 17 January 2024, I refused an application by the Stepfather to reduce the scope of the factual issues to be determined.  In my ex tempore judgment I set out why the allegations of sexual abuse need to be determined now.</p>

She says that in the evening of 14 November 2022, and following A&#8217;s November 2022 allegations of sexual abuse, she shaved A&#8217;s head for lying.  She regrets having done so.  The Mother is neutral on the allegations made against the Stepfather.  She says that if findings are made against the Stepfather, she will cooperate fully with the Local Authority in whatever course of action is considered appropriate in respect of the Stepfather.  She denies prioritising her relationship with the Stepfather over A.  She says that her main priority is the safety and wellbeing of the children.  Her priority has been to be reunited with her children and to remain with them.  She denies shaving A&#8217;s head for refusing to apologise.  She denies telling A that A was ruining the Mother&#8217;s life or that she regretted A having been born.  She says that prior to January 2022, the only allegations ever made to her were that (1) there had been a kiss between the Stepfather and A; (2) there had been a video shown of people kissing and (3) there had been a single &#8220;pat&#8221; on A&#8217;s bottom.  The Mother says that her response and reactions were not less than what would be expected of a reasonable parent.   She says that she sought advice from her own mother and spoke to A&#8217;s father.  She says that it was not unreasonable not to report this to professionals at the time (namely in 2017/2018).  She says that before January 2022, she was not aware of further allegations including that the Stepfather sucked A&#8217;s neck, showed A his penis, asked A to lick his penis or showed A pornography on his mobile phone.  She says that had A told her any of this, she would have reported it.  She regrets shaving A's head as punishment for lying.</p>

Judges give due allowance for the fact that the court room is often an unfamiliar and frightening place for those who appear as parties or to give evidence, and that some witnesses will find the process more stressful and difficult than others particularly if they have a mental health issue such as depression. </p>

In fact, there is no dispute that prior to January 2022, A had complained to the Mother about the Stepfather&#8217;s inappropriate behaviour towards A and that the Mother had spoken to the Stepfather about it at the time.

Later (and in response to questions from the Guardian&#8217;s counsel), DL told the Court that as a child protection officer, she had to have child protection training.  That involved two days&#8217; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">proper child protection officer training</span>&#8221; by a specific company including training on how to ask questions.  She described having had training on the types of questions &#8211; open, not leading, allowing the child to use their own words, not putting words into the child&#8217;s mouth, asking who, what, when.  She said that the training was extremely important in her role and that it was important to ask the right questions.  She explained how she had to keep the child protection training up to date, with child protection training every three years.  She was first trained in 2006 and received training every three years after that.  I had the clear impression that she understood the training, the reasons behind it and applied it.  She understood its importance.  DL told the Court that she had dealt with sexual abuse allegations before January 2022 and she felt competent to handle the allegations that A made in January 2022, having had specific training by a child protection officer.  DL described her practice of using a pen and notebook to write down sentences, key words and sometimes exact words as she spoke to the child.  She said that she did not have to type up notes because she could scan them in and attach them.  The school&#8217;s safeguarding record does refer [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 1617</span>] to a pdf document in A&#8217;s name (recorded at 12:36 on 18 January 2022).  A&#8217;s school was not able to provide that pdf document.  Whilst DL said that she could not recall following that training when she spoke to A, having heard her evidence I find, more likely than not, that she did follow her training.  DL was a careful and impressive witness.  She made it clear when she did not recall something.  My assessment is that she was a diligent and effective designated safeguarding lead at A&#8217;s school who knew and applied the guidelines on questioning children.</p>

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I found DL to be a very impressive witness.  She was clear in what she did and did not recall.  She had a clear understanding of her safeguarding role and whilst she did not conduct an ABE interview of A on 18 January 2022 when A made the allegations at school, I am confident and find that, more likely than not, DL followed the guidelines and training she had received (and had been updated) on questioning a child.  She understood the importance of them.  She understood the rationale behind them.  She was an experienced, quietly confident, efficient and effective DSL.  More likely than not, her questioning of A was appropriate and followed the guidelines.    She said that A&#8217;s account was given before the rest of the form was aware of the allegations.  That does not sit well with the Mother&#8217;s and the Stepfather&#8217;s suggestion that A was attention seeking.  DL&#8217;s impression, both as the head of year and as an experienced and trained safeguarding lead, was that A was not attention seeking.  DL was as an honest and reliable witness.   I am confident in the accuracy of her oral evidence and in her contemporaneous documents including the online MASH referral she completed on 18 January 2022 [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 1634-1636] </span>and the Reason for Strategy Discussion [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 467</span>], both of which DL confirmed were in her own words.  </p>

Sometimes she would speak to the child and make notes afterwards.  It would depend on the child.  Some children might feel nervous if she was taking notes at the time.  CL told the Court about the September 2022 incident when A&#8217;s thigh was touched by another pupil.  During these proceedings, that incident has been put forward as an example of A making false allegations against a peer at school.  However, by the end of CL&#8217;s evidence, it was clear that that characterisation of A making a false allegation against a peer was both unfair and inaccurate.  CL was clear that both A and the other child involved told the truth and that their accounts matched.   CL said that it was A&#8217;s friends who caused the situation to blow up into a different allegation with A at the centre of it.  However, the story that emerged was not the account that A or the other child involved gave.  CL was clear that A and the other child told the truth and that there was nothing untoward in what had happened.  No boundaries had been crossed.  When A told the other child that she did not want to do something, the other child had respected that.  CL was quite clear in her evidence that A had not exaggerated what had happened but that she enjoyed the attention it brought to her.  The other child was popular in school and had shown an interest in A.  CL&#8217;s evidence, having worked in a girls&#8217; school, was that girls of A&#8217;s age seeking and enjoying the attention of their peers was not unusual.    She said that A was even able to turn the upsetting head shaving incident into a situation where she revelled in attention with her use of hijab to cover her head.  A told her peers that it was her new look and they told her that she looked good in it.  In my judgment, it is to A&#8217;s credit that she turned such a terrible experience into a positive.</p>

There is a record of it in the police disclosure documents.   During that meeting, A gave various reasons for lying about the sexual abuse allegations including wanting to get the Stepfather out of the house, not seeing her own father very often (but then saying she sees him quite a lot) and wanting her mum and dad to get back together.  In her evidence, CL said that she did not remember A saying that she wanted her mother and father to get back together.  She also did not recall A telling the police officer that she had googled things [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 375, 1085</span>].  A told the police officer that she did not want anyone to get arrested or to lose their jobs and she wanted her mum and stepdad back and to live with her family.  A told the police officer that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;no one has put any pressure on her and no one told her to say she made it all up.  [A] did not realise the consequences would be so dire and she regrets her actions.&#8221;</span> [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 375</span>]  CL agreed with the Stepfather&#8217;s counsel that during the 5 December 2022 meeting with the police officer, A was clear that the allegations were not true and that A provided a consistent rationale for why she made the allegations in the first place.</p>

I have reflected on this inconsistency in A&#8217;s account.  The fact that A gave inconsistent accounts about who she told does not mean that A has lied about other matters.  A was a child in a very difficult situation, feeling the impact and pressure of her separation from the Mother whom she clearly loves, wanting family life to return to normal, feeling guilty about her siblings separation from their parents and telling adults that she had lied.  The fact that she gave inconsistent accounts of who she told is one part of the evidential picture that I have considered.  Like all the evidence, it has to be considered in context.</p>

She said that she took notes on the day that she visited a child and would takes notes on her work computer while she was speaking to the child.  At the time, she had been attached to the CAIT unit for about six months.  She had been trained to interview witnesses but she had not been trained on how to interview children.  She received that training at a later date.  At the time, she wanted to know that A was safe.  She also wanted to know whether A had been pressurised into changing her account.  She said that the questions she asked were along those lines and she confirmed that the CRIS report was a summary of what A told her rather than A&#8217;s words.  She agreed that she had no record of the questions she asked A.  She agreed that that was problematic and agreed that she would have done that differently now that she had training in asking children questions.  PC M did not hesitate in accepting those suggestions by the Stepfather&#8217;s counsel.  PC M also accepted that A gave a potentially plausible reason for having lied.  She also accepted that her CRIS report was the outcome of lots of questions she asked A to try and ascertain whether A was telling the truth or whether there had been a forced retraction.

Priority had been given to safeguarding the children.  She explained that once the children had been safeguarded, she had to attend a Crown Court trial in A Crown Court involving international child abduction and custody time limits.  She said that she spoke to A at the earliest opportunity after that trial concluded.   That was on 5 December 2022.  By that time, A had withdrawn her allegations.  PC M was not aware of any arrangements having been made for any other police officer to interview A before 5 December 2022.  It is regrettable that an ABE interview of A was not conducted sooner.  13 days is a long time to wait, particularly in relation to allegations of sexual abuse that had been made and withdrawn in the past.  The CRIS log dated 17 November 2022 sets out a list of actions to be done, including  <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;VRI to be completed with victim to focus on the nature of the allegations and why she had previously retracted the allegations and said she had lied.</span> [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 272, also at MB 357</span>].   PC M confirmed that had not been done.  She said that the other children had been visited at home (on 18 November 2022) and that they all presented well and happy with nothing to indicate sexual harm.  PC M accepted that further evidence that might have corroborated, refuted or shown inconsistencies in A&#8217;s allegations at the time (including accounts from A&#8217;s school friends) was not obtained.  The absence of an ABE interview at a time when A had made and maintained the allegations is one of the matters I have considered in this case.  The police did not visit A again until 5 December 2022, despite the VRI being assigned as a task on 17 November 2022.  By the time the police did visit A, A had withdrawn her allegations (on 30 November 2022).</p>

She said that it was normally the OICs responsibility to arrange for VRI statements.  She agreed that when a child makes an allegation or gives an account, the police could go straight to a VRI.  She readily agreed that it was best practice to get VRIs done quickly and that it was particularly important if there was a history of retractions and possible pressure to retract allegations.  PC M spoke about the need to prioritise according to resources available with the main priority being to safeguard children.  She agreed that the delay in the police seeing A until 5 December 2022 was regrettable and that it meant that the police did not get an account from A.</p>

At the same time, PC M was required to attend a Crown Court trial.  The police appeared to be under pressure, needing to prioritise their work taking account of their resources.  However, in all of this, the opportunity and time to conduct an ABE interview of A following the allegations of sexual abuse resurfacing in November 2022,  which were made directly by A on 17 November 2022, even after her head was shaved on 14 November 2022 as punishment, was lost.  There should have been an ABE interview of A soon after she made the allegations on 17 November 2022.  13 days later, and clearly upset by the Mother&#8217;s separation from the children and feeling the impact of the allegations on family life, A again withdrew the allegations.  A was not spoken to by the police until 5 December 2022.  It was all too little, too late.</p>

TC told the Court that she took handwritten notes on her notepad, writing down the information as it was given to her, pausing if she needed to.  She said that she kept her handwritten notes contained in her notebook for some time and used them to prepare her statement.  She told the Court that by the time she gave her oral evidence at this fact finding hearing, she had shredded her handwritten notes.  The lack of handwritten contemporaneous notes is a feature in many cases.  TC told the Court that she had taken her handwritten notes with her when she left the LA.  I found that surprising.  She told the Court that she did not have much recollection beyond her notes.  Whilst she told the Court that she recorded certain works verbatim, it was clear that she did not.  On reflection TC accepted that certain words such as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">pornography</span>&#8221;, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">penetrate</span>&#8221;, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">rekindle</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">intermittent</span>&#8221; were probably not words used by A [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 412-413</span>].  It would be very surprising if a child of A&#8217;s age had used words like rekindle and intermittent. The LA had been unable to find TC&#8217;s case notes from the 17 or the 30 November 2022 meetings with A.  TC produced her case notes and could not explain why they were not on the LA&#8217;s system but were used in the LA&#8217;s evidence.  She was unable to tell the Court whether the information contained in the LA&#8217;s documents was a summary or information cut and pasted from her case notes.  However, she was clear that she used her original handwritten notes (which were not provided to the Court or to the parties) when she prepared her statement.</p>

TC said that she had done ABE training some years ago, a few years before covid, but she could not recall when.  She said that she was relatively experienced in asking children these sorts of questions, having been a front line social worker for 14 years.  However, TC did not appreciate that the ABE principles apply to all questioning of a child who had made allegations of sexual abuse and throughout a forensic investigation.  She was asked whether her training included recording what a child said and the questions that a child was asked.  Her response was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I can&#8217;t recall but it makes sense.</span>&#8221;  I did not get the sense that TC had fully taken on board the ABE guidelines /principles or the fact that they do not just apply to the police&#8217;s ABE interview.

She was clearly not given the full picture by the Mother.  The Maternal Aunt focused on caring for the children.  When A told her that she had not told the truth, the Maternal Aunt was keen not to discuss matters with A.

The IRO should not have questioned A in the way that she did or for the reasons she did including to satisfy her curiosity.

I did not find the Mother&#8217;s evidence on this credible.  The Mother said that she told A to call the Father (A&#8217;s biological father) to tell him to come and take A away. She said that A called the Father but he said that he was not coming.  A had already been told that she was being sent away.  The Mother said : &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I was mad at [A]</span>.  <span style="font-style:italic">I told her for that I was going to cut off [her] hair as punishment for lying</span>.&#8221;   The Mother&#8217;s evidence was that she knew that cutting A&#8217;s hair would emotionally hurt her and make her feel bad but that she did not know that it was unacceptable because the Mother did not grow up in this country.   She later accepted that it was emotionally abusive, although she seemed to be saying that she did not think it was emotionally abusive at the time.  The Mother described being angry when she cut A&#8217;s hair.  She said that she felt guilty when she had finished it and that she felt bad when she saw A&#8217;s head with all the hair shaved off.  She said that A started crying.  The Mother&#8217;s actions in shaving A&#8217;s head on 14 November 2022 undoubtedly caused A significant emotional harm.  A went to school from home the next day.  She went home to her grandparents, not her mother, after school on 15 November 2022.  A would have been in no doubt about the Mother&#8217;s feelings of anger towards her.  A had effectively been sent away.  Whilst the Mother sought to portray that as A&#8217;s decision, I find, more likely than not, that it was the Mother who decided that A should go and stay with the maternal grandparents.   The Mother told the Court that she did not speak to A between A going to school on 15 November and the Mother being arrested on 17 November 2022.  Whilst she said that she did not speak to A again until supervised contact, I did not believe the Mother.  A told the school on 28 November 2022 that she spoke to the Mother.  I accept that record as accurate and find that the Mother did speak to A over the weekend of 26/27 November 2022.  A had no reason to lie about that.  The Mother knows that that was in breach of her bail conditions.  Two days later, on 30 November 2022, A once again retracted her allegations.   A did not see the Mother until supervised contact started on 7 December 2022.  I am in no doubt that A felt the pressure of having made allegations which then led to the Mother being arrested and the siblings being separated from their parents.  A saw her mother again on 7 December 2022.  She has maintained her retraction since 30 November 2022.</p>

      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">I asked mum about [A&#8217;s] hair, Mum admitted to shaving [A&#8217;s] hair off. Mum said [A] denied telling her friends about the abuse and said it wasn't true. Mum said [A] refuse (sic) to apologise, and this made her angrier, so she told [A] she's going to be punished and shaved her hair off.&#8221;</span></p>
      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Having reflected on all the evidence, I accept the above Case Note as accurate.  In her oral evidence, the Mother accepted that the above extract records what she told the social worker at the time.  I find, more likely than not, that the Mother shaved A&#8217;s head as punishment for lying and for not apologising for the reports of sexual abuse against the Stepfather.  In  her police interview, the Mother also referred to A not saying sorry [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 650, lines 28-30 and MB 651, line 8</span>].  Having considered all the evidence, I find that the Mother was not being honest with the Court about her reasons for shaving A&#8217;s head. </p>

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">When the Mother was asked about the incident when the Stepfather was said to have touched A&#8217;s bottom when A was in bed, the Mother appeared to change her evidence.  At first she said that the Stepfather would often look for C in the girls room and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">would cover the girls</span>.&#8221;  This was the bedroom that A and C shared at the time.  When the Mother was asked whether the Stepfather would cover A up, the Mother changed her evidence to say that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">A covers herself up to the top of her head</span>&#8221; and said that the Stepfather would not go to cover the girls but only to cover C.  The Mother clearly changed her evidence.  The Mother&#8217;s evidence was that when she confronted the Stepfather at his workplace in Hatfield in 2018 about what A told had her that the Stepfather had done to A, the Stepfather said that he had never shown A a video of people kissing, had never kissed A and had never touched A&#8217;s bare bottom.  Later, the Mother changed her evidence to refer to A&#8217;s bottom rather than her bare bottom.  She told the Court that during that conversation in Hatfield, the Stepfather said that the only time he remembered touching A&#8217;s bottom was when he was trying to find C in A&#8217;s bed.</p>

The Mother said that she had never seen the Stepfather sit close to A and that it sounded odd to her that A would have seen that.  I also found it difficult to see how A could have seen a pop-up on the Stepfather&#8217;s phone if they spent most of their time avoiding each other and did not sit next to each other.  Later in his evidence, the Stepfather said that A did sit next to him.  That contradicted what he had told others.  It also contradicted the Mother&#8217;s evidence about the physical and emotional distance between the Stepfather and A.</p>

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The Mother told the Court that A had her own bedroom in preparation for going to secondary school in the summer of 2021.  When she was taken to the social worker&#8217;s statement dated 22 November 2022 that states that a few days earlier, on 17 November 2022, the Mother &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">shared that [A] has a lock on her door to ensure she feels safe</span>&#8221; [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 51</span>], the Mother said that that was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not what I said to my recollection</span>.&#8221;   She said that she was sure that she did not say that the lock was to ensure that A felt safe.  There were times in her evidence that I believed the Mother.  This was not one of them.  The Mother then tried to tie the word &#8220;safe&#8221; to &#8220;privacy&#8221;, saying that the lock was put on A&#8217;s door to give her privacy.  I did not believe the Mother&#8217;s evidence on this.  She went on to say : &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Feeling safe means several things &#8211; dressing up, brothers in the house, [A] being in her bedroom and feeling safe &#8211; she can dress up and feel safe</span>&#8230; <span style="font-style:italic">Sometimes her brother comes into the room when she is dressing up and arguing so I put a lock on there.&#8221;</span>   However, the word &#8220;safe&#8221; is recorded as having been said by the Mother in the context of a discussion about A&#8217;s allegations of sexual abuse, not privacy.  Having had the benefit of seeing the Mother give her evidence on the question of whether or not she told professionals that the lock was on A&#8217;s bedroom&#8217;s door to keep A &#8220;safe&#8221;, I am certain that the Mother lied when she denied using the word &#8220;safe&#8221; or using it in the context of the sexual abuse allegations.  I am in no doubt that the Mother used the word &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">safe</span>&#8221; as is recorded in the social workers&#8217; statement dated 22 November 2022.  The previous social worker&#8217;s statement was prepared shortly after the mother is recorded as having &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">shared that [A] has a lock on her door to ensure she feels safe&#8230;&#8221;</span> DL (whose evidence I accept as truthful, accurate and reliable) had a clear recollection of A telling her that she did not feel safe in her bedroom and would put a chair in front of her bedroom door (see paragraph 43 above).  Having considered all the evidence, and taking account of the fact that the previous social worker who prepared the statement did not give evidence and could not be challenged, I find that, more likely than not, A felt unsafe in her bedroom and that her feeling of unsafety related to the Stepfather.  I also find that the Mother knew that A felt unsafe and knew that A felt unsafe from the Stepfather and that is why a lock was put on the inside of A's bedroom door.  It was put there to keep A safe from the Stepfather.   My clear impression and assessment of the Mother was that she was not telling the truth about the reason for the lock being put on A&#8217;s bedroom door.</p>

It is unreasonable to expect a child of A&#8217;s age to be as fastidious in locking her bedroom door at night as, for example,  an adult responsible for ensuring that the front door to a home is locked up.   Whilst the Mother explained that she put a bolt on the inside of A&#8217;s bedroom door to stop A&#8217;s brothers going into her room to get A&#8217;s &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">stuff</span>&#8221; (she gave an example of headphones), it did not explain what there was to stop the brothers going in when A was not inside the room.  In other words, the brothers had free access to A&#8217;s belongings when A was not there but when A was in her bedroom, she was able to lock her brother&#8217;s out.  The mother&#8217;s evidence was not credible and I did not believe her explanation for putting the lock on A&#8217;s bedroom door.</p>

She said that the children&#8217;s bedtime routine was that they would go to bed at 8pm but that if they were at secondary school, they would go to bed at 9pm.

It was prepared a month before the start of the Fact Finding hearing and was an assessment of her husband whom she wants to return to live in the family home.

I believed the Mother&#8217;s evidence on this.   Towards the end of the Stepfather&#8217;s evidence, I asked him whether he had been through his December 2023 PCA.

The Mother spoke about A speaking rudely to the Stepfather over throwing food away and over a meal being ready.   Stepping back, I do not accept the Mother&#8217;s suggestions that the issues are linked.  The Mother said that it was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">definitely right</span>&#8221; that the Stepfather and A avoided each other.  The Stepfather&#8217;s evidence on this was inconsistent.   Having considered all the evidence, I find that A did avoid the Stepfather and that she did so because she felt unsafe around him due to the sexual abuse she experienced from him.

The Mother&#8217;s response was to drop the children off at the grandparents&#8217; home, drive to speak to the Stepfather in Hatfield, accept his explanations, let him return home, collect all the children apart from A from the grandparents&#8217; home and continue life with the Stepfather and the children, leaving A at the grandparents&#8217; home for a few days.  A was seven or eight at the time.  She was not a teenager plotting to get rid of her stepfather.  She was a young child who, at the very least, was alleging that the Stepfather had kissed her, shown her inappropriate videos and touched her bottom when she was in bed.  The Mother should have informed professionals.    Instead, she  limited who knew what even within the family and she prioritised the Stepfather, and her relationship with him, over A.</p>

A would have been in no doubt that her mother was displeased and angry with her.  A was given the silent treatment by the Mother, who did not speak to A between 15 November 2022 and her arrest on 17 November 2022.  After that, bail conditions were put in place.

A has clearly felt responsible for, and guilty about, the Mother&#8217;s absence from the family home.  A has clearly missed her mother and wanted her home.  A has clearly felt responsible for the family being separated and for her siblings separation from the Stepfather.  A was humiliated and harmed by the Mother shaving her head as punishment for lying.  Although A tried to make the most of it, it was clearly upsetting and caused A significant emotional harm.  The other children were well aware of the punishment.  In my judgment, there is a significant risk that the children will not report any wrongdoing out of fear of being punished, isolated or sent away as A was.  The Mother was either unable or unwilling to see the context surrounding A&#8217;s retractions.  The Mother did however accept that A knew that the Mother loved the Stepfather and that the Mother wanted him to be part of the family.  When it was suggested to the Mother that if A wanted the Stepfather out of the home, the best way would be to make and maintain the allegations, not to retract them because that would have the opposite effect, the Mother agreed.  When it was suggested that it did not make sense for A to make the allegations and then retract them, the Mother&#8217;s response was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">probably, I don&#8217;t know</span>.&#8221;  The Mother accepted that she was very angry with A after the police retraction interview on 19 January 2022.  That anger was documented in the police disclosure [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 360</span>].  I did not believe the Mother when she said that she had not been angry with A the evening before or that she did not tell A that she was attention seeking or a brat.  Those were unusual words  for a child of A&#8217;s age to use to describe herself.  It is part of the Mother&#8217;s and the Stepfather&#8217;s case that A has been attention seeking.</p>

That was a video that the Stepfather told Ms L that he had been sent on his mobile phone [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 1920</span>].  The Mother was not particularly surprised or concerned about that video (she thought it was probably from a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">WhatsApp group of people from my country</span>&#8221;) and said that she could not see the relevance of it to her or to her children.   Later, the Stepfather denied getting material of that sort on his mobile phone.</p>

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Having had the opportunity to stand back and consider all the evidence, I do not accept that the Mother has given an entirely truthful account.  I find that she knew more about the Stepfather&#8217;s actions than she admitted to.  I find that she knew that A had alleged that the Stepfather had shown A his penis and asked her to lick it.  The Mother clearly tried to keep the allegations within the family and even then not even telling her sister (the Maternal Aunt) the truth.  I do not accept the Mother&#8217;s evidence that A is an attention seeking, lying child.  In my judgment, the Mother&#8217;s and the Stepfather&#8217;s portrayal of A has been an attempt to deflect from the Stepfather&#8217;s wrongdoing.  A&#8217;s retractions have to be seen in context, including the pressure that A was under after the Mother was arrested and separated from the children.   My assessment of the Mother is that she clearly loves her children, very much wants the allegations to be untrue but was too quick to accept the Stepfather&#8217;s explanations.  She should have reported the allegations to professionals, not kept them within a limited number of people in the family.  Having considered all the evidence, and for reasons set out in this judgment, I find, more likely than not, that the Stepfather has sexually abused A.  The Mother has been present in Court throughout the Fact Finding hearing.  She has heard the Stepfather&#8217;s evidence.  She must now know that he has not been truthful.  Their evidence is internally inconsistent.  It is also inconsistent with each other.</p>

At first the Stepfather told the Court that he learned English when he was at school.  It was only when he was pressed that he reluctantly admitted that his education abroad was delivered in English.  When pressed, he admitted that he studied in English until he was 20 years old.  The Stepfather was assisted by an interpreter throughout the fact finding hearing.  He confirmed that he was happy with the second interpreter used during the hearing.  When I refer to the interpreter in this judgment, I am referring to the second interpreter.</p>

On another occasion, the Stepfather began to answer a question before it had been interpreted into his own language.  The Stepfather has been offered interpreters for assessments but has turned them down, saying that they are not helpful or needed.  Yet he told the Court that he had difficulty communicating with Dr P because he did not have any interpretation assistance.  He also said that he had difficulty understanding Dr P&#8217;s accent.  I heard Dr P&#8217;s evidence.  He  does not have any particular accent.  He was as easy to understand as Ms L and others in this case.  It was odd that the Stepfather singled out Dr P&#8217;s accent for no discernible reason. </p>

      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I can confirm that I do not require an interpreter in these proceedings or to have any of the documents translated.

I have been brought up to speak English alongside my language, I was taught in English at school right up to when I left secondary education.&#8221; </span>[<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 423</span>]</p>
      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the start of his evidence the Stepfather confirmed that that statement was true.  In his evidence he said that his education in English ended in about 2003 when he was around 20 years old.  He has also lived and worked in England since 2017.  When he was cross examined about the above statement, the Stepfather said that his English was not good enough to read the papers in these proceedings.  He said that whoever he was speaking to when he made his statement did not understand what he was saying.  I did not believe that.  It was a statement directed at his understanding.  He was represented by competent solicitors when he signed that statement.  He confirmed its contents at the start of his evidence.  Later he sought to distance himself from it when he wanted to put discrepancies down to lack of understanding/language issues.  He told the Court that most of the time he would send documents to his wife who would explain them to him in his own language.  He then changed that to say that his wife &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">always explained and interpreted things to me</span>.&#8221; I did not believe him when he said that English was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">so difficult for me to understand  &#8230;. I struggle to understand</span>.&#8221;  He said that in his country he was taught a bit in English but mostly in his own language.  He then agreed that his education in his own country was formally delivered in English.  I am in no doubt that the Stepfather has overplayed/exaggerated his language difficulties.</p>

His interview was put off because there was no interpreter available. By the time an interpreter was arranged to attend the police interview, A had withdrawn her allegations.  The Stepfather was never interviewed and the police decided to take no further action after A withdrew her allegations on 30 November 2022.   It was notable that overnight the Stepfather changed his evidence.  He blamed a lack of understanding or an interpretation/language issue.  However, the inconsistency was in his words, spoken in his language, on a topic he was carefully taken through and which was interpreted by the interpreter he confirmed he was happy with.  It was clear to me that rather than being a misunderstanding/language issue, the Stepfather had changed his evidence because he realised that he had been caught out.</p>

He has blamed inconsistencies in his evidence in Court and in his assessments on language/communication issues.  He started the second day of his evidence by trying, unprompted, to go back over his evidence from the previous day and to explain it away as a misunderstanding on timeframes. However, his evidence the day before, using his own words, in his own language, which were interpreted by the interpreter, and which he did not correct (as he had on other occasions) referred to the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">days</span> (not months or years) after the 2017/2018 Hatfield discussion with the Mother.  His evidence could not have been clearer.  Having seen and heard the Stepfather&#8217;s evidence and having considered it alongside all the other evidence in this case, it is clear to me that the Stepfather was not being truthful about his ability to speak and understand English.  His difficulty was not in the language or in communicating.  His difficulty was in telling the truth.  He had an experienced, competent interpreter who interpreted what he said about the days following the Hatfield discussion.  He changed that evidence after the overnight adjournment.</p>

She reported that the Stepfather told her about a young girl aged about 10 being taken from the street, naked, pulled into the back of a car and raped [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 1920</span>].  In his oral evidence, the Stepfather insisted that he gave a completely different account.  He said he told Ms L about the recording of a girl already seated in the back of an Uber and that the driver got out of the driver&#8217;s seat and got into the back of the car but moved back into the driver&#8217;s seat when a bystander challenged him.  He told the Court that he did not tell Ms L that the child was pulled into the back of the car or that she was taken from the street or that she was naked or that she was raped.  He said that in the video the UBER driver drove off.  I am in no doubt that Ms L accurately recorded what she was told by the Stepfather during the assessment.    Ms L is and was a far more reliable witness than the Stepfather.  I reject the Stepfather&#8217;s assertion that it was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a misunderstanding</span>.&#8221;   Of course, the fact that he lied about the video does not mean that he sexually abused A. </p>

The words &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">after a few days</span>&#8221; were the Stepfather&#8217;s own words, spoken in his own language and translated by the interpreter whom he did not correct.  He repeated the words &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">after a few days</span>&#8221; several times.  He was clearly talking about a few days after the Hatfield discussion.  According to the Mother, the Hatfield conversation took place in 2017 before the family moved to the LA&#8217;s area.  They moved in November 2017.  The Stepfather said it was in 2018.  The Stepfather was carefully taken through what it was that he and the Mother spoke about at that time.  The Stepfather clearly told the Court that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">a few days</span> after the Hatfield discussion (in 2017 or 2018), the Mother told him that A had alleged that he had shown her pornography and kissed her.

He also said that A had told her own father and that the Father had told the Mother and that was how he was informed about it.  Again, it was the Stepfather who said that it was a few days after the Hatfield discussion.

He was unsure how long he was away from home following the January 2022 allegations.   He was away for months. The Stepfather said that when they discussed it after he returned home, he asked the Mother if she had asked A what his penis looked like.  He also said that he asked the Mother whether the police had asked A that question.  That was not the same evidence that he had given the day before.  Whilst the Stepfather tried to put the change in his evidence down to confusion, it was clear to me that he was changing his evidence.  His evidence the day before had been clear.  On Day 6 he said that the conversations took place within a few days of the Hatfield discussion, not (as he said on Day 7) years later in January 2022.</p>

His evidence was not consistent with the Mother&#8217;s evidence that A never sat next to him, would often leave the room when he came into it, would often go upstairs if he was downstairs and that the Stepfather was worried about being too close to A because he worried that A might make further allegations.  The Stepfather also denied that he and the Mother argued about money or about A&#8217;s father.  He said they did not have cross words or fall out.  That was not what the Mother told professionals.  I found it surprising that neither the Mother nor the Stepfather were able to remember why they did not speak for eight months, particularly when, on the Stepfather&#8217;s evidence, they did not argue.  An eight month fall out is unusual in most relationships.  In one as argument free as the Stepfather described, I would expect him to remember the reason for it.  His evidence was not credible.</p>

When I read and saw the ABE interview, I thought it unusual that a child of 11 would describe themselves as a brat.  A was also worried that her allegations had led to the police being involved.  She was worried about getting into trouble.  The retraction interview, made after A had been at home overnight, raised more questions than it answered.  Whilst it is understandable that the police did not take further action after it, when the allegations were made again in November 2022, including after A&#8217;s head was shaved following allegations which were then repeated despite that harmful incident, the police should have arranged an early ABE interview.  By the time they got round to looking at arranging an ABE interview, A had again retracted her allegations.  The system has not worked for A in the way that it should have.</p>

CRIS reports and LA documents have been created using notes (typed and handwritten) at the time.  A repeated the allegations even after her head was shaved by the Mother as punishment.   When she repeated the allegations on 17 November 2022, A was living with the maternal grandfather and the maternal aunt.   The Mother had not told either of them about the sexual abuse allegations A had made against the Stepfather.

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">On at least two occasions, the Mother suggested that she did not believe that the Stepfather had abused A because she had brought him into the household.  She also said that she had not seen the sexual abuse with her own eyes.  Whilst I understand how difficult it must be for the Mother to hear those allegations, the Mother did not take steps to protect A.  Instead, she left A at the grandparents&#8217; home, failed to inform professionals about the allegations A had made, let the Stepfather continue to live in the household and continued to leave him at home with A and the other children whilst she went to work at night.  She put a lock on A&#8217;s door to keep her safe.  When A made the allegations again in January 2022, the Mother was again angry and had to deal with professionals&#8217; involvement.  When the allegations were made again in November 2022, the Mother shaved A&#8217;s head as a punishment, sent A to stay with the grandparents, did not speak to A on the telephone and effectively gave her the silent treatment before the Mother was arrested and bail conditions were put in place.</p>

The Mother was angry that the allegations were made again.  I am in no doubt that she let her feelings be known to A.  The Mother had been angry before.  I find she was angry again.  When A told her school friends about the Stepfather, A did not think that the allegations would be passed on by her friends.  I do not believe that A was looking to get the Stepfather out of the house.  She knew that when she told the Mother in the past, there had been no change.  The Stepfather told Dr P that A may have made the allegations because she was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">showing off</span>.&#8221;  That was clearly untrue and baseless.</p>

However, they have put forward reasons for A making the allegations and those reasons have to be considered as part of the evidence.  During the course of these proceedings, the Mother and Stepfather have suggested that A is a child who lies.  They pointed to an incident in which A was said to have made allegations of sexual assault against another pupil at school.  Having heard the evidence of CL, it is clear to me that A made no inappropriate allegations.  CL was clear that what A and the other pupil told her about the incident was consistent with each other and did not show A to have made exaggerated claims.  From the evidence I heard, any exaggeration came from A&#8217;s classmates.  A received some attention as a result but it is clear to me that A did not seek it.</p>

As I have already said, on at least two occasions he corrected the interpreter&#8217;s interpretation.  He also answered a question before it had been interpreted.  Whilst I accept that he should (and did) have an interpreter during the hearing, including when he gave his evidence, it was clear that he sought to blame language issues when he gave inconsistent answers, was asked about difficult parts of his evidence or wanted to be less than honest.  When he first gave his evidence about the discussions he had with the Mother at home in the days (not months or years) after the Hatfield discussion, he could not have been clearer about the timeline.  He described it using his own words in his own language, interpreted by the interpreter whom he did not correct and using his own timeframe.  The words came from him.  He had clearly thought about his evidence overnight and in my judgment that was why, unprompted, as soon as he resumed his evidence the next day, he sought to say that he was speaking about the years (not days) between 2018 and 2022.  His evidence lacked credibility.  He was clearly changing his story.  I am certain that there was no language difficulty.  The Stepfather was not being honest.</p>

It was clearly not true because the Mother had not read that report.  All of the Stepfather&#8217;s statements are in English with no certificate of interpretation.  His statement directed to deal with his understanding and need for an interpreter specifically states that he did not need an interpreter or for documents to be interpreted.

I share the Guardian&#8217;s concerns about the evidence gathering, and at times analysis, in this case.  I have taken into account the fact that there is no record of the questions that A was asked by professionals (police, teachers and social workers) at school in 2022.  There was no ABE interview in November 2022 despite it being on the police&#8217;s action list.  Had the police conducted an ABE interview with A in the 12 days after she made the 17 November 2022 allegations, no doubt the police would have explored with A sensory/experiential information around the fingering allegation.  Regrettably, the police did not visit A again until 5 December 2022, after A had withdrawn the allegations.  There was no ABE interview as planned. </p>

DC LU readily accepted that he breached the ABE guidelines when he conducted the retraction interview.  He reminded A of what she had said, he asked closed questions, he tested repeatedly whether her retraction was accurate, he asked A whether anyone had put pressure on her to change her story. However, he was clear in his evidence that when he spoke to A at school on 18 January 2022 (the previous day) he used open questions.  I accept his evidence on this.  I am satisfied that the questions asked by DL and DC LU at A&#8217;s school on 18 January 2022 were, more likely than not, appropriate and followed the ABE guidance.  Standing back and having considered all the evidence that I have seen and heard, I am satisfied that the LA has discharged the burden of proof.  I am satisfied and find that, more likely than not, the Stepfather has sexually abused A.    I am also satisfied that the Mother knew more about the sexual abuse allegations in 2018 than she has said.

A also said that she had told her mother about what the Stepfather had done.  When she gave her evidence, CL had a clear recollection of A telling her that the Stepfather had fingered her.  A did not make that allegation in January 2022 when she was living at home.

More likely than not, that featured heavily in A&#8217;s decision to retract the allegations.  A felt guilty about the impact on her Mother, siblings and family life.  She wanted things to go back to normal.  A has been careful to tell professionals that she has not been pressurised into retracting her allegations.  More likely than not, A was trying to protect her family from any suggestion of pressure when she told the teachers on 30 November 2022 that she had not told anyone else about lying about the allegations.  Had A thought about it, she would have realised that the Maternal Aunt had asked her the night before whether she was happy with the Maternal Aunt making contact with the social worker (see paragraph 98 above).  A was not a calculated child who had plotted the Stepfather&#8217;s removal from the family home.  She did not make up the allegations in November 2022 because her own father decided to spend less time with her in October 2022.  The rift with her own father cannot account for the January 2022 allegations nine months earlier.  A is, and was, a kind, thoughtful child who felt very sad and guilty about what had happened after her November 2022 allegations and wanted things to go back to normal.  She wanted her mother home.   A has consistently said that she wants her mother home and for family life to return to normal.

He has lied about the video of the young naked girl being dragged into a car and raped, although I make it clear that that is not determinative.  He has lied to the Court and to professionals.  He had attempted to muddy the waters.  He has made the task of getting to the truth of A&#8217;s allegations more difficult.

TC&#8217;s record [<span style="font-weight:bold">MB 413</span>] that on 17 November 2022 A said that the Stepfather &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">never took his penis out</span>&#8221; is at odds with the Stepfather&#8217;s evidence that in the days after the 2018 Hatfield discussion, the Mother asked him about showing A his penis and asking A to lick it.  It is also at odds with the Stepfather&#8217;s evidence that he asked the Mother to ask A what colour it was and the Stepfather telling Dr P that A said that it was brown.  TC&#8217;s record may not be entirely accurate.  She initially said that she recorded certain words verbatim but then accepted that A would not have used works like &#8220;penetrate.&#8221; A may have said in November 2022 (after her head had been shaved and she had been sent away from the family home) that the Stepfather never took his penis out.   However, I believed the Stepfather&#8217;s own evidence that in the days after the 2018 Hatfield conversation, the Mother was asking him about showing A his penis and asking A to lick it.

The Mother and Stepfather were arrested.  The Maternal Aunt moved in to look after the children.  Bail conditions prevented the Mother and Stepfather from contacting the children.  The children all missed their Mother.  The younger children missed the Stepfather.  A felt sad and guilty about the consequences of her allegations.
