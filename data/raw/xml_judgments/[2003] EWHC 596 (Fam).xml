The boys are now aged just 11 and 8 and three quarters. The father of the two boys opposes the application. He has a cross application for a residence order. This application started as an application for defined contact but was amended to include an application for a residence order.  The order in which the applications were made was that the father&#8217;s application for defined contact was first, it was followed by the mother&#8217;s application and the amendment to seek a residence order was then made.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Secondly, the children are dismayed with their father for having left the family home. Although they love him very much, this does not dilute their sense of having been betrayed by him. To some extent, they behave as though they are talking about very concrete facts rather than having a sense of going through a psychological process. For example they do not seem to have the notion that they have hurt feelings, and that these feelings might well change over time.&#8221;</p>

The causes for such difficulties include the breakdown of the marriage, the unhappy relationship between the parents during and after the marriage, the respective characters and emotions of the parents and, of course, the attachment that the boys have to their parents, the impact on them of the breakdown of the marriage (together with the problems and difficulties that have ensued) and the possible impact on them of a move to Singapore or the refusal of the mother&#8217;s application.</p>

		<p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.49in">[31]<marker name="tab"/>Logically and as a matter of experience the child cannot draw emotional and psychological security and stability from the dependency unless the primary carer herself is emotionally and psychologically stable and secure.  The parent cannot give what she herself lacks.  Although fathers as well as mothers provide primary care I have never myself encountered a relocation application brought by a father and for the purposes of this judgment I assume that relocation applications are only brought by maternal primary carers.  The disintegration of a family unit is invariably emotionally and psychologically turbulent.  The mother who emerges with the responsibility of making the home for the children may recover her sense of well-being simply by coping over a passage of time.  But often the mother may be in need of external support, whether financial, emotional or social.  Such support may be provided by a new partner who becomes stepfather to the child.  The creation of a new family obviously draws the child into its quest for material and other fulfilment.  Such cases have given rise to the strongest statements of the guidelines.  Alternatively the disintegration of the family unit may leave the mother in a society to which she was carried by the impetus of family life before its failure.  Commonly in that event she may feel isolated and driven to seek the support she lacks by returning to her homeland, her family and her friends.  In the remarriage cases the motivation for relocation may well be to meet the stepfather&#8217;s career needs or opportunities.  In those cases refusal is likely to destabilise the new family emotionally as well as to penalise it financially.  In the case of the isolated mother, to deny her the support of her family and a return to her roots may have an even greater psychological detriment and she may have no one who might share her distress or alleviate her depression.  This factor is well illustrated by the mother&#8217;s evidence in this case.  As recorded in Miss Hall&#8217;s note she said:</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.99in"> &#8220;Things happen and I think I can&#8217;t stand it.  I&#8217;ve got to go home.  But then I see S and I calm down and I think I can&#8217;t leave her .... I would give it a really good try to be a mother to S here but in my heart of hearts I think I would not be able to do it.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">[32]<marker name="tab"/>Thus in most relocation cases the most crucial assessment and finding for the judge is likely to be the effect of the refusal of the application on the mother&#8217;s future psychological and emotional stability.</p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">[42]<marker name="tab"/>In very many cases the mother&#8217;s application to relocate provokes a cross application by the father for a variation of the residence order in his favour.  Such cross applications may be largely tactical to enable the strategist to cross examine along the lines of: what will you do if your application is refused?  If the mother responds by saying that she will remain with the child then the cross examiner feels that he has demonstrated that the impact of refusal upon the mother would not be that significant.  If on the other hand she says that she herself will go nevertheless then the cross examiner feels that he has demonstrated that the mother is shallow, or uncaring or self-centred.   But experienced family judges are well used to tactics and will readily distinguish between the cross application that has some pre-existing foundation and one that is purely tactical.  There are probably dangers in compartmentalising the two applications.  As far as possible they should be tried and decided together.  The judge in the end must evaluate comparatively each option for the child, one against another.  Often that will mean evaluating a home with mother in this jurisdiction, against a home with mother wherever she seeks to go, against a home in this jurisdiction with father.  Then in explaining his first choice the judge will inevitably be delivering judgment on both applications.</p>

If, however, there is a real dispute as to which parent should be granted a residence order, and the decision as to which parent is the more suitable is finely balanced, the future plans of each parent for the child are clearly relevant. If one parent intends to set up home in another country and remove the child from school, surroundings and the other parent and his family, it may in some cases be an important factor to weigh in the balance. But in a case where the decision as to residence is clear as the judge in this case clearly thought it was, the plans for removal from the jurisdiction would not be likely to be significant in the decision over residence. The mother in this case already had a residence order and the judge`s decision on residence was not an issue before this Court.</p>

In particular the court will have to consider the manner in which the competing welfare factors apply in the case before it and thus, for example, the manner in which the reasons for promoting (a) stability in the home, and (b) contact apply in that case.  Further factors are likely to include the circumstances in which the child or children came to be living with one parent rather than the other, the ages of the children, their connection with the countries involved, and the ability of the family to maintain contact after a move.</p>

Also in my opinion it is inevitable that both the  mother and the father will influence the views of the boys. Indeed as good parents they should be doing this. Further I accept that it is very difficult for a parent to hide his or her mood and feelings from a child. But in my view, in particular (a) what the boys said to Dr Berelowitz about the father&#8217;s girlfriend, and (b) the point made by Dr Berelowitz, which I accept, that the boys have not yet been able to accept that the separation of their parents is permanent, are based substantially on things the mother has said and done which have reflected her hostility towards the father and his girlfriend and her wish for a reconciliation. In my view that hostility and that wish of the mother have fluctuated, and the boys have been influenced both directly by what the mother has said to them and in their hearing about such matters and by her general attitude and mood. </p>

To my mind this is reflected in things said by the boys to Dr Berelowitz about the father and his girlfriend.

Naturally I accept that the father may have been making it clear to the mother that he did not want to reconcile prior to the time that he asserts she recognised this.  This was not gone into in the oral evidence and the written evidence indicates that there is a dispute as to whether for a period after he left the matrimonial home the father gave the mother grounds to reasonably believe that a reconciliation was a possibility.  I cannot resolve that dispute on the evidence I heard.</p>

He does this by reference to paragraph 4 of the mother&#8217;s first statement and this accords with a letter written by the mother&#8217;s solicitors at the beginning of March 2001 in which the  mother asserts that the marriage had irretrievably broken down. </p>

Thus I accept that it was probably not easy for the father to identify that such an arrangement alone and together with his stance on attending things like matches and very regular telephone calls was likely (i) to be putting pressure on the mother and (ii) to be causing confusion in the minds of the boys as to whether or not their parents would return to living together.  Further I appreciate that the father and the boys enjoyed the morning school run and the father thought that the boys benefited from it, and that a reduced level of taking and collecting the boys to and from school was agreed in the correspondence between the solicitors and incorporated in an agreed order made in September 2002.  </p>

Further in my judgment the mother&#8217;s view that this stance was oppressive and unreasonable was well within the range of natural human reactions of a mother in her position.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.01in">In the circumstances of this case in my view a change in attitude by the mother after a realisation by her that reconciliation was no longer realistic or a decision by her to abandon it would be reasonable because it would reflect the need for both parents to set about setting up their homes on that basis.  As I have mentioned for the purpose of this submission the change is put at the Spring of 2001 by the father but it is not clear to me when or how the father made it clear that a reconciliation was not going to take place and in any event it is clear that thereafter the mother continued at least from time to time to hope for a reconciliation. In my judgment it is thus not possible to draw a clear line by reference to the mother&#8217;s realisation that a reconciliation was not possible albeit that I accept that from about the spring of 2001 the chronology and correspondence show that problems concerning contact increased.  Further I accept that in her statement the mother asserts that it was at that time it became clear that the father did not wish to reconcile and she started to think seriously about returning to Singapore.  However it seems to me that that is a natural and logical progression of thought which could reasonably be based on the reasons advanced by the mother.</p>

Rather in my judgment they are in all the circumstances of this case an understandable and genuine expression of the emotional insecurity and turmoil she has experienced since the breakdown of the marriage and in particular as she has come to realise that reconciliation is not a realistic option.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this context in my judgment the mother was correct to accept that her volatility and outbursts have not promoted the welfare of the boys. In my view she thereby correctly accepted that parts of her behaviour which in my judgment are based on her character and emotional reactions has had this result.  Her acceptance of this was however limited both as to the parts of her behaviour that had had this effect and the harm or potential harm that such conduct had caused and would cause if it continued.  For example, to my mind she made unrealistic and incorrect assertions that she did not regard the relationship of the father with his girlfriend as an issue or a continuing issue.  This was unrealistic and incorrect because in my judgment she has clearly been hurt, upset and confused by this and at least at times continues to be so.  Further as I have already said in my judgment by what she has said and by her conduct she has made the boys well aware that this is the case and more generally of her anger with the father.  Thus important issues are whether in the future she can avoid repeating such behaviour and promote the attachment and relationship between the father and the boys.</p>

At present, the  mother does not agree to do this and it follows that if one applies the progression of reasoning set out above (and as I have mentioned earlier) that the essential competing considerations are between the likely effects of  (a) a move by the mother with the boys to Singapore, and (b) the mother staying here against a background of her application having been refused and in that sense because she has been compelled to do so if she is to continue to live with the boys.</p>

Also her parents do not speak English which will naturally make it difficult for them to build a relationship with the boys quickly.</p>

	      <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.49in;text-indent:0.01in">In short I agree that there are real risks that the mother has (i) underestimated the difficulties the boys will have in coping with the changes the move will involve and its widespread implications for their day to day life and development, and (ii) overestimated the benefits of a move to Singapore in respect of her own happiness and the stability of her home.</p>

In the short term I have little doubt that the mother would feel released from considerable burdens, would thus be much happier and would seek to promote contact and the relationship between the boys and their father as she says she would.   In the longer term I am of the view that the mother was not paying lip service to the point that she recognises that if she undermined the relationship between the boys and their father this would be harmful to them and could result in her relationship with the boys being damaged.   </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The greater risk that the mother will undermine the relationship between the boys and their father is that she will do so as a product of her emotional and volatile personality if after a move to Singapore she does not become happier and perhaps even if she does.  However if the mother becomes happier I am of the view that my conclusions on her motivation for making this application and her evidence in general found the result that it is unlikely that this will happen.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The problems are more acute if the mother does not become significantly happier in  Singapore.  In my view they are not that then the mother may actively and consciously denigrate the father or seek to criticise him but that she will not be able to conceal her continuing unhappiness and her view that the father has been the main cause of it and further or alternatively her continuing hostility to him and his girlfriend.  A further risk factor is the attitude of the mother&#8217;s family in Singapore and as to this she said that they did not speak of the father in Singapore.  To my mind if this continued it would constitute a negative influence.  Also there is as Dr Berelowitz put it the worry that having regard to her attachment to the boys and her difficulties in parting from them the mother may find parting from them when they are due to come to England extremely difficult and her distress will be communicated to, or appreciated by, the boys (and in particular the younger one) and may lead to them being distressed as well and asserting that they do not want to go to England or have contact with his father.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This scenario is similar to one in which the negative influences I have found that the mother has had on the boys and the product of her emotional turmoil since the father left the matrimonial home and more particularly since about the Spring of 2001 would continue to exist.  It is also one in which problems that the father asserts he can only effectively combat if the mother and the boys remain in this country would exist.</p>

In my judgment the prospects of that situation being significantly improved if I refuse the mother&#8217;s application, and in that sense she is compelled to stay here, are poor and significantly worse than the prospects of the mother becoming much happier in Singapore.</p>

In reaching this view I have taken into account the proposals for changes made by the father in correspondence and in argument.  This is because the nature of, and the reasons for, the underlying problems and emotions that have caused the mother to genuinely believe that the best interests of the boys will be promoted by her moving with them to Singapore are such that unless the mother agrees that changes in the arrangements if she was to remain in this country have a reasonable prospect of enabling her to move on and to reduce her existing emotional turmoil and unhappiness the chances that they will have this effect are poor.</p>

In my view this would be the best solution but there is only a reasonable prospect of achieving it if the mother agrees to embark on this course and is not forced to do so by her application being refused or otherwise.</p>
