By common consent the delivery of this judgment has been deferred until after the decisions of the House of Lords in the conjoined appeals of and Miller v Miller; McFarlane v McFarlane <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2006/24" uk:canonical="[2006] UKHL 24" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] UKHL 24</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 FLR 1186" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 FLR 1186</ref>, have become available, since when I have received further written and oral submissions from counsel, Mr Cusworth and Mr Carter for W and Mr Moylan QC and Miss Phipps for H.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">H and W are respectively almost 54, and 51<span style="font-style:italic">. </span>H comes from a Mediterranean family which removed from North Africa to England in 1959. H was educated here and is fully integrated into English life. He met W in 1973 or 1974 when she would have been 18 or 19 and shortly thereafter (H puts it in 1975) they commenced cohabitation in rented accommodation in South west London. They were married in September 1977. Notwithstanding a number of medical interventions it transpired that they were unable to have children, a fact which continues to be a cause of considerable regret to both of them. Passing for the moment over the intervening years, they separated in March 1996 when H moved out of the final matrimonial home (LM House) where W continues to live. He rented accommodation until August 2001 when, with the assistance of significant mortgage facilities, he purchased his current home.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">In broad terms, therefore, these parties cohabited before their marriage for a year or two, and as a married couple for a further 18 <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span>/<span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:smaller">2</span> years. I am asked to have regard to what W, in particular, asserts was or might have been the absence of finality about that separation in March 1996, an uncertainty which continued she suggests until some time late in 2000. But on any view of the matter their physical separation took place ten years ago, and during the intervening period it is the fact (and in no sense a recrimination) that H has developed his business without any form of support or contribution from W. She however argues that as he has not until now had to deal with her capital claims he has in effect had the use of money or assets which should be regarded as hers, and thus that her contribution has continued.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">This is a submission with which I will deal in due course, but for the moment I simply observe that although (as correspondence produced by H evidences) some desultory requests for financial information with a view to settlement negotiation were requested from him in 1998 and 1999, the reality is that neither party felt emotionally able to face up to the unpleasantness of divorce and ancillary relief resolution until, in March 2003, H presented a petition relying on five years&#8217; separation. Decree absolute was pronounced in September 2003, and W initiated these financial proceedings in November 2003. They were to have been heard by Baron J on 13 June 2005 but were adjourned until this April because of late developments in the valuation dispute concerning H&#8217;s shares in his company T Ltd.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">For reasons which will become apparent that was, to say the least, unfortunate, and must be a significant feature of the development of the costs bills on each side. These were in round figures estimated at &#163;361,000 for H and &#163;207,000 (revised in July to &#163;235,500)<span style="font-style:italic"/>for W, a total therefore of just short of &#163;600,000. By 20 September the aggregate costs bill was about &#163;650,000. These amounts are wholly disproportionate in the context of the parties&#8217; present liquidity, the value of their assets (excluding pensions and H&#8217;s T Ltd shares) amounting to something under &#163;2M.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">H accepts that throughout the course of their marriage W contributed to the fullest extent, and makes no criticism whatsoever of any aspect of her conduct. They did not initially seek to have a family. W found her work as a teacher (at which she had commenced just prior to the marriage) fulfilling, moving as necessary from one school to another when the parties came to live north of London at a time when H started to work with his brother in a civil engineering contracting company which I shall refer to as YD. That was in 1979, and W continued teaching until 1988 or 1989 when she branched out into writing educational books. Although she still derives some very modest income from that source, since the early 1990s she has developed an interest in antiques which, again, over the years has brought her in some relatively small income. She still has some stock but no or no secure trading premises. H recognises that nothing she earns or which it would be realistic to anticipate she might earn from these or any other sources is of significance in the context of the issues before me.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">By 1991 H had a shareholding in YD and was chief executive of that company while his brother was chairman. Between them they had come to hold all the shares. H&#8217;s financial situation had improved significantly over the previous decade when in November 1991 LM House was purchased in joint names for &#163;540,000 with a considerable mortgage. It is a very extensive property indeed, and is now to be valued, in my view, at &#163;1,310,000, which disregards notional sale costs but takes into account &#163;60,000 which was the price H recently paid for the acquisition of some adjoining land to resolve a dispute with neighbours. The property is subject to a mortgage standing currently at just over &#163;298,000.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">LM House stands in almost five acres of grounds. It is a substantial three floor Victorian building with eight bedrooms and a variety of reception rooms. It has attractive formal gardens and a tennis court. W lives there alone and wishes to continue to do so. It is H&#8217;s desire that she should be left in a position where she owns the property free of mortgage and may have the means to continue to live there indefinitely.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">Although brief reference is made in documentation filed prior to the hearing to the fact that work needed to be done to the property to bring parts of it up to the extremely high standard of the rest, it was only at a late stage in the hearing before me that W produced her own detailed list of the repair and renovation works which she regards as essential. There is no professional estimate of what these works may cost, but something of the order of &#163;150,000 to &#163;175,000 would not seem untoward. What has been happening to date, over the years since separation at least, is that maintenance and refurbishment works to the house and garden have proceeded piecemeal at an average annual cost of about &#163;16,000. This has been met by ad hoc contributions from H supplemented by W&#8217;s income from all sources including the disposal of quite a number of items of household furniture (as opposed to her trading stock). She has also taken bank loans to help defray the refurbishment costs which debt stood at &#163;30,000 by July 2005.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">In June 2005 Baron J decreed that pending the outcome of this hearing H should pay W at the rate of &#163;2,000 per month and should in addition discharge the monthly mortgage payments. He was also to pay outgoings and utilities, to include &#163;300 a week towards the wages of the cleaner and gardener employed at the property. In fact, the cleaner and the gardener cost more than this, and W contributes a further &#163;105 per week from her own resources. Thus staff costs at LM House are running at &#163;21,000 annually. H has also since June 2005 paid W some &#163;30,000 on account of her ongoing legal fees.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">No very great scrutiny was directed during the course of the hearing at the detail of W&#8217;s historic annual expenditure. She produced a schedule in early 2004 which threw up a total of &#163;81,300 per annum, but when the mortgage interest and ongoing fees for a dispute which is now resolved are stripped out this reduces to about &#163;65,000. Almost &#163;10,000 of that is put down to repairs, decoration and maintenance of the property. As against that staff costs were then running at about &#163;6,000 less than they now are. H&#8217;s approach to resolution of the case assumed that W would be able to live at LM House with a net annual income, currently, of about &#163;70,000. In his final submissions for W, in which he put forward a significantly revised proposal for the appropriate outcome, Mr Cusworth contended for ongoing maintenance at the rate of about &#163;107,500 per annum net.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">As for the husband&#8217;s career and current circumstances, during the period of cohabitation he too clearly contributed fully. He would from his own description appear to be something of a workaholic, and indeed W suggested that his inability to take time off work for domestic life may have been a factor in their estrangement. I have no doubt that he has put and continues to put very considerable effort and commitment into his business endeavours. He told me that he lives for his work and that the reason why he has so few outside interests is largely because he takes so little time off work for them.</p>

	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">Another striking feature of the case is what I regard as his genuine continuing sense of regret that the marriage did not continue (a sentiment shared by W). This finds expression in his oft-repeated determination to ensure that LM House should be hers free of mortgage, and that she should have the means to continue living there. I repeat that to live there long-term has been her long-held expectation and remains her aspiration but these are aims which, if (as I would hope to do) I am to find a solution which achieves them, seriously limit the fair options available having regard to the quantum and structure of the parties&#8217; wealth and the balance between solid and realisable assets and those which are currently unrealisable and carry risk.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">In the light of this mutual identical intention as to the ownership and occupation of LM House it seems to me not to matter whether (as H asserts) there was some express agreement that he would not put the property at risk to support any business ventures. The parties do seem throughout the separation to have acted on the basis the house would be W&#8217;s and indeed she seems to have taken that for granted. But in any event I do not accept that I should approach the case on the basis that some sort of partition of assets has had the effect that in return H&#8217;s shares in YD or T Ltd were to be treated as immune from inclusion in the assets falling for consideration in this application.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">H&#8217;s first employment was in 1977, at the time of the marriage, when he went to work for a petrochemicals firm as a management trainee. In 1980 the parties decided that H should leave that employment and go to work with his brother at YD, initially as services manager. His role expanded as did YD. H became a director of the company in the following year. In 1989 he became a shareholder in the company which by then was wholly owned by himself and his brother. It was then that he took on the role of chief executive.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">Civil engineering was YD&#8217;s principal activity, engaging in a series of one-off contracts in the construction industry. But in 1994 it started to diversify, on the initiative as I am satisfied of H, into longer-term contracts taking on aspects of local authority responsibility for such works as road repairs. By 1995 there were two such contracts which had been secured by YD. It was in that year that H and his brother redistributed their shareholding to reflect his importance and contribution to the success of YD and thereafter he held 40% of the shares. Mr Nedas, the forensic accountant instructed on behalf of H, has estimated that at the time of separation in March 1996 that shareholding can fairly be valued at &#163;533,600 gross, &#163;304,000 net. In the ten years from March 1996 to March 2006 the Retail Prices Index has gone up from 151.5 to 195.0, an increase thus of broadly one third. I simply note, therefore, that taking &#163;304,000 as the shares&#8217; realisable worth in March 1996 indicates that in money&#8217;s worth the equivalent value in March 2006 would be &#163;391,000. Another indicator would be to postulate that H had at the time of separation held a portfolio of quoted shares worth &#163;533,600 gross which had risen in line with the FTSE All Share Index. Their gross value would in March 2006 have risen to &#163;882,500. The realisable value of those shares would be &#163;754,500 (after deducting <span style="font-style:italic">5 </span>per cent dealing costs and, at best, 10 per cent capital gains tax if maximum taper relief applied to the whole portfolio).</p>

The company de-merged and the local authority contracts were taken over by T Ltd, the company which (with its associated and subsidiary companies, and its joint venture partners) H has run since. H explained and I accept that his philosophy and that of his brother diverged, the latter preferring the cut and thrust, in and out, and absence of sustained longer-term risk inherent in shorter-term civil engineering contracts, which the construction part of YD retained.</p>

In order to achieve the management buyout, T Ltd had to find &#163;16M of which &#163;12M was borrowed from its bankers and a further &#163;4M was raised by the issue of preference shares to a lending institution. The preference shares were to have been repaid in three equal annual tranches commencing in June 2005. None of this financing involved jeopardising the parties&#8217; other assets, principally LM House, as neither charges nor personal guarantees were provided by H.</p>

W points to that as evidence that the business which is now T Ltd was acquired virtually fully-fledged from YD in 1999, and that its seed and indeed its early roots date back to before the 1996 separation. She also seeks to lend weight, or rather length, to this submission by suggesting that for the period from separation until sometime late in 2000 the marriage should to some extent be regarded as effectively continuing (in the emotional rather than the practical or just the legal sense) because she remained hopeful of a possible reconciliation. As it happens I prefer on balance H&#8217;s evidence to the effect that this hope, if indeed it has more to it than subconsciously distorted hindsight, was wishful thinking without objective foundation. But whichever of them is right, or indeed if the reality is somewhere between the two, I cannot for my part accept that it adds to the merits of W&#8217;s claim that she should receive at some unascertainable future date a capital sum to reflect the value, if and when realisable, of H&#8217;s shares in T Ltd. A principal issue in this case is the fairness of that ingredient of her claim judged in the light of the accumulated guidelines on the principles which underlie the discretionary ancillary relief exercise.</p>

Then it is said to have &#8216;plateaued&#8217; and thus although turnover increased the increases have been very much less significant. The profit before taxation has fluctuated significantly, more than halving between 2002 and 2003 despite a &#163;16M increase in turnover. Profitability before tax dropped a further 58 per cent over the two subsequent years to 2005 notwithstanding &#163;46M of increased turnover over that period, and inroads were made into the profits retained from previous years. This is because the overheads of the business remain relatively constant, whereas the flow of work for which charge can be made is dependent upon the spending budgets of the client local authorities whose priorities may change from year to year and indeed during the year. In 2005 and, it was anticipated, in June 2006 T Ltd&#8217;s bankers will not have been prepared to afford it facilities to redeem the first two-thirds of the &#163;4M preference share debt, which has been rescheduled.</p>

Although there was talk about the possibility of flotation in 2002 that soon evaporated. Neither accountant suggests that the company is ripe either for a trade sale or flotation in current circumstances, or in reasonably imminent circumstances which can be said to be more likely than not to eventuate. Whether such a time will ever come must be speculative. If it does then it will most likely have been achieved in large measure by dint of H&#8217;s energy and acumen, not only past but prospective, as well as more favourable market forces than exist at present when (I am satisfied on the evidence) there is some stagnation in the company&#8217;s development.

In order to purchase the property he took a mortgage of &#163;855,000. That mortgage fluctuates as it reflects his overdraft and other liabilities to his own bank. It goes down when he receives a bonus and increases again when he pays tax, by way of example. At the date of the hearing it stood very near its limit, at &#163;852,000. The property has six bedrooms and is a substantial home created by the subdivision of the wing of an eighteenth century country house. It comes with a half acre garden. It is clearly very desirably situated although it suffers some of the defects to which new conversions can be subject. H lives there alone.</p>

Apart from his interest in his home (itself subject to the mortgage of &#163;852,000 already referred to) H&#8217;s most significant but currently illiquid asset is those accrued but unpaid dividends, the value of which I have already stated. He owes &#163;50,000 to his brother, which he anticipates may soon be &#163;100,000 to enable him to pay the balance of his own costs. He accepts that he will be under no pressure to repay this amount, but regards it as a matter of honour that he should in due course do so. It is therefore apparent that he is burdened with debt and has at this time little if any capacity to produce capital other than by the sale of his property. This no one suggests he should do (although H in evidence did say that to comply with the requirements of a deferred clean break order which he seeks he would if necessary sell this property to honour his obligations), and in any event a sale would produce only some &#163;360,000 net which it would be entirely reasonable for him to reinvest to buy somewhere else.

But when they met to see what common ground there was they discovered that there was less even than had been apparent, Mr Nedas reducing his valuation to &#163;4.35M while Mr Lobbenberg increased his to something over &#163;30M (revised on the eve of the hearing down to &#163;27.2M). By then however Mr Nedas valued H&#8217;s shares in T Ltd at no pounds at all. For the purposes of the hearing, however, (and for reasons which do not matter for present purposes) the application proceeded upon the basis that H&#8217;s advisers took H&#8217;s shares to be worth either &#163;4.35M or &#163;3.73M (to include the value of his own preference shares).</p>

Thus the substratum for any assessment of my order against equality&#8217;s yardstick would have been invalidated wherever within the accountants&#8217; parameters I had alighted.

That of course is true in every unquoted share valuation exercise. But in this case for either of those events to happen T Ltd will first have to have established a record of increasing size and profitability which sadly it now lacks. It will not then be a company of the same scale as it is now, and if this outcome is achievable at all then (as I have already indicated) it is likely to be in large part as a result of H&#8217;s continuing endeavours stretching from now into the future and therefore from a point commencing a full 10 years since the parties&#8217; separation. In the particular circumstances of this case I regard that as a highly significant factor which cannot be sufficiently satisfactorily offset whether by limiting the proportion of the value payable in the future to W, nor by putting an arbitrary cap of &#163;8M upon what she might receive as was Mr Cusworth&#8217;s final proposition.</p>

In addition W&#8217;s pension funds would be equalised with a share from H which can be regarded as very largely the product of his endeavours since 1999.

She proposed now to take LM House subject to its mortgage, on the basis that she would not anticipate redeeming it until she received further capital from the T Ltd share realisation. A lump sum instalment of &#163;200,000 meanwhile would enable her to deal with her costs and the bulk of her accrued liabilities. Together that would leave her at this stage, Mr Cusworth calculates, with fractionally over 50 per cent of all assets save the T Ltd shares. But on this basis H would be left &#163;1.07M worth of currently inaccessible pension fund, some &#163;720,000 due to him for an indefinite period re unpaid dividends, and about &#163;200,000 worth of tangible assets in effect represented by his home subject to (at least) its existing substantial mortgage. Future earnings apart, his ability ever to improve his tangible capital base (apart from receipt of the unpaid dividends and any others to which he might in the future become entitled) would depend on the feasibility of realising the T Ltd shares. W&#8217;s ability ever to discharge the LM House mortgage would similarly depend on a share realisation.</p>

	    <p class="p15" style="margin-left:0.45in">W in addition now seeks ongoing periodical payments, until a share realisation, at the rate of &#163;107,500 p.a. Out of this she would service the LM House mortgage interest (currently &#163;16,700 p.a.), spend about &#163;15,000 each year on ongoing renovation and improvement costs to the property, and meet annual staff costs of &#163;21,000. She would have &#163;55,000 net p.a. left for her other needs and outgoings. In arriving at this figure, however, unless I am mistaken there is an element of double-counting as it seems to include &#163;15,000 for LM House improvements twice, once as an element of past expenditure and then again as an ongoing annual requirement. I do not regard &#163;30,000 as a reasonable amount to expect H to pay under this head on an ongoing annual basis but I do take a budget of &#163;15,000 into account for this purpose.</p>

Unlike the earlier proposal H would receive no guaranteed first tranche of &#163;2M. Instead W would at that point reimburse him for 75 per cent of all maintenance payments meanwhile, with an overall cap of &#163;8M on the payment to W thus calculated. At that point a comprehensive clean break should take effect. On the rival share valuation extremes of &#163;3.73M net and &#163;27.2M net the payment to W would range between &#163;853,000 if disposal took place at the lower figure after one year, to &#163;6M at the higher figure after 10 years.</p>

They disagreed as to the accounting periods to be taken (Mr Nedas relying more on forecasts than did Mr Lobbenberg); the multiple to be applied to arrive at an Enterprise Value for the company (a capitalisation of its earnings); the net debt position of the company; what if any other companies might be illustrative comparables; and the effect of differing assumptions as to the timing of repayments to the outside shareholders. All of these taken together significantly contributed to the divergence in the value each attributed. But the major disagreement and the one which gave rise to the most serious exchange of epithets related to the depreciation charges in T Ltd&#8217;s accounts and forecasts. Mr Nedas contended for an evaluation known as EBITA as the basis to establish maintainable earnings. The acronym signifies &#8216;earnings before interest, tax and amortisation&#8217; and involves writing back these three items. Mr Lobbenberg maintained strenuously that the appropriate methodology was to evaluate on the basis of EBITDA, writing back in addition the depreciation charge in the accounts which he took as &#163;6M. If he is mistaken in that view, on the multiple he adopted of 4.5 his valuation would reduce by &#163;27M, although on this changed basis he would have been entitled to reconsider the appropriate multiple.</p>

This company tends to spend each year on new and replacement plant and equipment an amount broadly equal to (and in 2001 to 2004 more than) the depreciation charged in the accounts in line with accounting and fiscal requirements. I am satisfied that the nature of its business requires this expenditure, and that it is imperative if the company is to continue to generate the &#8216;maintainable earnings&#8217; which are a basic constituent of each accountant&#8217;s methodology. In the context of T Ltd, as it seems to me, incurring the cost of necessary renewal and maintenance of plant and equipment is as much a prerequisite to bringing in the turnover and the profit as paying the work-force. Mr Lobbenberg agreed that anyone interested in acquiring the company would take the depreciation into account, recognising it as a recurring reality. He suggested that this would form part of due diligence enquiries. Due diligence would show the expenditure as real and necessary, and I do not understand why it should not be treated as a legitimate expense of the business, and thus not to be added back in the search for a maintainable earnings figure.</p>

H&#8217;s case is that although the seed for what has become T Ltd&#8217;s core business was germinating by the time of separation in 1996, so that by the date of demerger in mid-1999 about 40 per cent by turnover of YD&#8217;s business related to local authority outsourcing, the development of the company and the expanding diversity of the functions it contracts to perform have been achieved by his endeavours as undoubtedly the leading light of the company, without any relevant contribution whatsoever from W notwithstanding their continued status till 2003 as spouses.</p>

It is true that by March 1996 YD had two local authority contracts, both road- and construction-related, and thus in the same line of endeavour as YD&#8217;s historical civil engineering activity. By the time of the 1999 buy-out by T Ltd, entirely financed by external funds, one major contract secured was with a London local authority, and since the parties&#8217; separation outsourcing work has not only increased but has become more diverse. By 2000 turnover had increased from &#163;28.SM in 1997 (the last year for which YD accounts are available) to &#163;200M but thereafter the rate of increase slackened. Activities had expanded into building and grounds maintenance, and refuse and cleaning services. Thereafter what are now thirteen or fourteen separately organised enterprises around the country, each separately managed, have taken over transportation, recycling, quantity surveying and project management services. The company has moved into white collar operations, for instance undertaking payroll functions. Some contracts have been joint ventures with other service providers.</p>

If their gross value of &#163;533,600 had at that time been invested in shares performing in line with the FISE All Shares Index they would now be worth &#163;882,500 gross, and &#163;754,000 net after deduction of dealing costs and the minimum amount of capital gains tax which could be payable if full taper relief applied to the whole portfolio. If I notionally took &#163;755,000 as a current realisable value representative of the value of the shares H had in YD in the year of separation he would on the formulation I have adopted now still only have net realisable assets worth about &#163;545,000, to balance against her &#163;l.3M once the mortgage has been redeemed and &#163;200,000 paid to her to discharge liabilities.

There is, in addition, the problem that with such impenetrable doubt concerning the value, actual but unrealisable and only potential but unascertainable, of the illiquid shares there is no process whereby they can be weighed or valued against the liquid assets retained by W, so that this is not a case where it is feasible to carry out any arithmetical check against the equality yardstick.</p>

There the first instance judge (Wilson J as he then was) had achieved a division of assets which left H with a very modest tangible capital fund by reference to that allocated to the wife, and with the whole of his shareholding in the company he ran and in which the wife for her part had a very modest shareholding. The Court of Appeal adjusted the division of the assets which were readily saleable at stable prices by increasing the husband&#8217;s share, but replaced the clean break outcome ordained by Wilson J so as to defer absolute finality by introducing a mechanism enabling the wife to apply in the event of the sale of the husband&#8217;s shareholding within the following five years. In arriving at this conclusion Thorpe LJ, giving the judgment of the court, canvassed what it clearly appears would have been that court&#8217;s preferred solution, although in the absence of both parties&#8217; agreement an outcome which the Court of Appeal could not impose for the reasons given at [25] of the judgment. I set out the passage where at [24] the merits of a substantial increase in the wife&#8217;s shareholding were canvassed:</p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="p20" style="margin-left:0.71in">[24] Having read the skeleton arguments and the judgment we were at once struck by the security of the result that the wife had achieved in contrast to the risks confronting the husband&#8217;s economy. The family&#8217;s standard of living has throughout been dependent upon the fortunes of the husband&#8217;s business. Had the marriage survived the family would undoubtedly have shared adversity as it had shared prosperity. The years of marriage comprise the years of the husband&#8217;s commercial vitality between his late 30s and his mid-50s. The harvest of those years is represented by the concrete assets totalling &#163;1,823,000. But the future years look hazardous. It seems unlikely that the husband will restore the pattern of prosperity and savings from income in the years ahead. After all, if it is reasonable for him also to seek to retire at 60, he has only <span style="font-style:italic">5 </span>years in which to recover the profitability without which Soundtracs will not be easily realisable for significant value. In principle it seems to us that the separation of the family does not terminate the sharing of the results of the company&#8217;s performance. That is easily achieved in any case in which the wife&#8217;s dependency is met by continuing periodical payments. It is less easy to achieve in a clean-break case. In that situation, however, sharing is achieved by a fair division of both the copper-bottomed assets and the illiquid and risk-laden assets. After all, the wife was already a shareholder in Soundtracs and a substantial increase in her shareholding would at least have enabled her to participate in future prosperity by dividend receipts or capital receipts on sale or a cessation of trade. An increase in her share of the illiquid and risk-laden asset would have allowed a reduction in the <span style="font-style:italic">Duxbury </span>fund, if not in the housing fund. If profitability were not recovered then both parties would share the experience of a marked reduction in standards of living.</p>

Furthermore the range of outcome in relation to concrete assets was not so constrained as in this case, where both H and W wish to secure her ownership and occupation of LM House, and to achieve that end and a deferred clean break H is prepared to shoulder future capital commitments, albeit less onerous than my order will impose upon him.</p>

Coleridge J decided against that outcome, largely because the husband would need &#8216;plenty of time to re-arrange his financial and business affairs by way of borrowing and/or sale to meet the sums&#8217; which he awarded to the wife in a case where extracting cash from what was essentially the only available asset was fraught with obstacles and problems. Although he envisaged that the husband would need to liquidate his shareholding in the company in order to meet the order he was to be given several years in which to sell that shareholding. He accordingly made an order for a lump sum payable over a period, while leaving the parties with the ability to apply in relation to the terms of security and as to the timing of the payments, observing that he would be slow to make any alterations in the absence of significant change of circumstances.</p>

But this is not an approach of universal application (as indeed Coleridge J had pointed out in the passage cited from N v N). Here (at the risk of repetition) the distinguishing features are that H and W want W to have far more than a half-share of the plums and an enhanced albeit only partially tangible pension share which reflects in part H&#8217;s post-separation endeavours; and W recognises that H should retain something greater than half of what could yet turn out to be disappointing duff.

The increase in the husband&#8217;s means is plainly relevant; but it is also, in my view, relevant to remember that it is something which has happened since the parting. And what is of much more importance here is that it is not merely something which has happened since the parting: it is something which has been brought about by the husband in co-operation and partnership with Miss Capozzi, who has indeed played a direct part in the business in which he has been engaged and which in the past has been the main source of his income which has provided the capital which has enabled substantial assets to accrue to the husband and Miss Capozzi in the shape of premises which they are now able to let at a quite comfortable rent.</p>

On the other hand, if a matrimonial asset has simply increased in value during the period of separation as a result of passive inflationary economic growth (such as the increase in the value of a house) then it would seem obvious that such growth is an accrual to the original matrimonial property.</p>

	      <p class="p32" style="margin-left:0.69in">But what of the position where a party has taken matrimonial property that existed at separation and traded with it and achieved a significant profit? Two points of view arise here. On the one hand it can legitimately be argued that the party in question has traded with the other party&#8217;s undivided share and so should share with that party the profit that has been generated. On the other hand it can equally convincingly be said that the second party has not contributed to the industry or endeavour that gave rise to the profit or growth and so it is unfair that the second party should share to the same extent in that profit as the first who made all the effort. Similar controversy arises in relation to bonuses earned in the period of separation. The earner of such bonuses can validly argue that he did his work outside married life and without the support of his spouse. But the other party can equally validly argue that the ability to earn was generated during the marriage; that she was maintaining the family infrastructure pending dissolution of the marital partnership and division of the assets; and that during the period of separation the parties were financially linked.</p>

Further, Mrs Miller had here no right to, and could not have been given, any part of Mr Miller&#8217;s New Star shareholding in relation to which Mr Miller carried the risk. Mrs Miller has at all times been living in the house, which has now been formally transferred to her. Her only further claim was to a sum of money, assessed by the judge at &#163;2.7 million (which Mr Miller paid in two instalments in May and June 2005). Mr Miller cannot easily be said in this case to have been holding on to any asset which should have been Mrs Miller&#8217;s, or to owe anything other than money. <span style="font-style:italic">Assuming that the focus is on assets acquired during the marriage, rather than on the husband&#8217;s overall means, it seems to me therefore natural in this case to look at the period until separation.

The court will decide whether it should be shared and if so in what proportions. In so deciding it will have regard to the reality that the longer the marriage the more likely non-matrimonial property will become merged or entangled with matrimonial property. By contrast, in a short marriage case non-matrimonial assets are not likely to be shared unless needs require this,</p>

	    <p class="p45" style="margin-left:0.44in">I regard that formulation as a helpful and accurate analysis, and adopt it. I regard the value which the T Ltd shares now represent as more akin to non-matrimonial property. But I have given the shares weight in the balancing exercise to what I regard as an appropriately constrained extent by having regard both to the approximate value of H&#8217;s separation-date holding of YD shares, and to the fact that in my view what he has since built on the back of that asset has involved only incidental use of those shares and the business then conducted by that company which have been unmatched by any contribution on the part of W since the effective end of the marriage. I have also paid regard to what is described as the &#8216;passive economic growth&#8217; which might have been added over the relevant 10 years to those shares and to the underlying business conducted by H by reference to two published measures of economic growth in prices and share valuations.</p>

I do not regard H as having treated W unfairly during the period since separation, looking at the situation broadly. My decision takes into account not only the risks which H must run before he may at some stage be able to achieve positive capital liquidity, but also the comparative absence of risk to W (subject to H proving able to comply with the terms of the order). I do not doubt his determination to comply if possible.</p>

But the economic disadvantage generated by the relationship may go beyond need, however generously interpreted. The best example is a wife, like Mrs McFarlane, who has given up what would very probably have been a lucrative and successful career. If the other party, who has been the beneficiary of the choices made during the marriage, is a high earner with a substantial surplus over what is required to meet both parties&#8217; needs, then a premium above needs can reflect that relationship-generated disadvantage.</p>

The provision for W which this order requires deals fully with her needs in terms of accommodation and her ability to maintain her lifestyle while living at LM House, and indeed for her lifetime. Having arrived at the determination that she should not share proportionately as and when it may materialise in the liquidity which may be released from the T Ltd shares, I consider that the overall provision H is to make for her goes beyond those needs (taking the Duxbury calculation simply as a guide to the size of the income-producing element) to the extent of &#163;250,000 or thereabouts, and that this is a fair result bearing in mind the burden of debt the order will impose on him over a number of years. Ihese arrangements strike a fair balance between the obligations and entitlements flowing from this marriage and its aftermath, and achieve the parties&#8217; shared objective of securing W in LM House. I believe that this is not only a fair outcome for W but one which should obviate and protect her from the risk that T Ltd will never be brought to market, which if her final proposal were adopted would leave her with a continuing mortgage liability of &#163;300,000 to repay but without the resources to do so otherwise than by the sale of LM House. That is an outcome which she wishes so strongly to avoid.</p>

	    <p class="p45" style="margin-left:0.44in">I have now (on 20 September 2006) heard submissions in the light of this judgment about the timing of payments, security arrangements, and the form of the order. As to security, my provisional proposal was to suggest that lump sum payments be secured by way of a charge or equivalent arrangement over H&#8217;s preference shares which (I hope I am correct in envisaging) will most likely be redeemed at latest at the time of any flotation. I can at present see no significant disadvantage to H in his management of T Ltd from this course as the preference shares carry no voting rights. Nor do I see how the financial standing of the company will be diminished in the eyes of the outside investor or of the company&#8217;s bankers, given that H&#8217;s personal financial substance does not underwrite any of the company&#8217;s financial facilities, An arrangement along those lines has now been agreed.</p>

To the extent that W does not recover her costs in full, or has a costs liability to H, I envisaged that adjustment by way of set-off can be made. Having now heard submissions on that topic I have determined that the appropriate order is that W should pay a contribution towards H&#8217;s costs of &#163;275,000 to be set off against the &#163;900,000 second instalment of the lump sum. H has however voluntarily proposed that he will undertake not to enforce that costs order if W makes no application to the court of appeal for permission to appeal (I having refused her application to me for such leave). An order to give effect to this judgment, incorporating an agreed timetable for its implementation, has been negotiated between the parties and approved by me.</p>
