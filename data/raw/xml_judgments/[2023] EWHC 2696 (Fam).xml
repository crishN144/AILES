As Z was habitually resident in the Czech Republic prior to July 2023, and as the father accepts she was wrongfully removed in breach of the mother&#8217;s rights of custody, the 1980 Hague Convention is engaged in respect of Z. </span></p>

In addition, I have read the Cafcass report of Ms Sarah Gwynne dated 18 October 2023, and heard her oral evidence in court.

During that year, both parties met new partners to whom they are now married (mother in 2011, and father in 2022). Various applications ensued in the family court leading to a final Child Arrangements Order made in 2012 for Z to live with the mother and spend time with the father every other weekend and for holiday contact. </p>

At a final hearing on 15 August 2017, the court ultimately granted the mother permission to relocate with Z to the Czech Republic. Although the father initially lodged an appeal against that order, and permission was granted, he withdrew the appeal on 4 October 2017. Since 2017, Z has lived in the Czech Republic with her mother, her two half-siblings (a sister &#8216;A' aged 10 and a brother &#8216;B' aged 8) and her step-father. </p>

It is clear that the parents have continued to be in conflict over the contact arrangements for Z, and in February 2019 there were further proceedings in the Czech Republic around contact with the father, handover arrangements and child maintenance. Notably, in those proceedings, Z's voice was heard and her wishes and feelings were considered. In March 2020, the Covid pandemic significantly impacted travel and contact as between Z and her father. Despite the restrictions, the father accepts that indirect contact was facilitated by the mother thus enabling the relationship between Z and her father to be maintained. Those proceedings concluded with a Czech Order dated 21 July 2021 providing that Z should spend time with the father. It is not in dispute that this order has been complied with by the mother. Subsequently, direct contact between Z and the father resumed, once restrictions were lifted. </p>

The father indicated that he would make arrangements for her to start school locally in September 2023. He subsequently issued proceedings in the family court on 17 July 2023 in Wolverhampton seeking permission for Z to live with him in the UK. On 20 July 2023, the mother contacted the Czech Central Authority regarding her concerns about Z and that she may be wrongfully retained in the UK. The father also contacted the police in respect of Z&#8217;s disclosure that her step-father had hit her and her half-siblings.</p>

I am also told that the father accepted that there could also be direct contact between Z and her step-father's parents in England, (who Z refers to as &#8216;Grandma&#8217; and &#8216;Grandpa'), although this is not recorded on the face of the order; but the father subsequently reneged on this indicating that if A and B were to visit the UK, Z could only spend one night with them. Eventually, an agreement was reached whereby A, B and the mother visited England, with Z staying overnight with them for two nights between 28-30 September 2023. However, there is some suggestion that the father did not agree to this arrangement until only 12 hours before they were due to fly. </p>

She is at a fee-paying private school whereas Z and B attend a local state school. Z has new clothes whereas A receives hand-me-downs and fewer new things. Z has many school trips that A and B do not. Mother also asserts that Z is the oldest child and the expectation is that she should be a positive example to her siblings, with responsibilities commensurate with her age and maturity (for example keeping her bedroom tidy and helping with chores), none of which amounts to abuse. Nor do restrictions on social media use, make-up and insisting on effort into school work amount to abuse.</p>

When the relevant issue is a child's objections, this is because the child's views and interests will, typically, "be properly presented to the court" through evidence from a Cafcass officer and through the legal arguments being advanced</span> on behalf of the parents and addressed by the court.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition, Practice Direction 16A FPR 2010 sets out the circumstances in which it is appropriate to grant party status to a child in family proceedings. Although it is not focussed on Convention proceedings, much of it is directly apposite to them. Thus paragraph 7.1 of the Practice Direction makes clear that a grant to a child of party status will be made only in cases which involve an issue of significant difficulty and thus only in a minority of cases. Consideration, so it suggests, should first be given to whether an alternative course might be preferable.</p>

This factor has a particular relevance to Convention proceedings. The need for expedition is written into Article 11.3 the Convention.</p>

In particular, I note paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 of the Good Practice Guide:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The second underlying concept is that the wrongful removal or retention of a child is prejudicial to the child&#8217;s welfare and that, save for the limited exceptions provided for in the Convention, it will be in the best interests of the child to return to the State of habitual residence.&#8221;</span></p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">The third underlying concept is that, as a rule, the courts of the child&#8217;s State of habitual residence are best placed to determine the merits of a custody dispute (which typically involves a comprehensive &#8220;best interests&#8221; assessment) as, inter alia, they generally will have fuller and easier access to the information and evidence relevant to the making of such determinations. Therefore, the return of the wrongfully removed or retained child to his or her State of habitual residence not only restores the status quo ante, but it allows for the resolution of any issues related to the custody of, or access to, the child, including the possible relocation of the child to another State, by the court that is best placed to assess effectively the child&#8217;s best interests. This third underlying concept is founded on international comity, which requires that the Contracting Parties:</span></p>

In doing so, rights of custody existing in the State of habitual residence are respected in the other Contracting Parties. In dealing with the prompt return of children, the Convention does not deal with the merits of custody and access, which are reserved for the authorities of the State of habitual residence.</p>

Objectively, (and this is not in dispute) Z's grades were &#8216;average'.  No concerns have been raised about mother or stepfather by the Czech equivalent of Cafcass or the Czech school in relation to their parenting capacity. Despite the allegations which he has made, father accepted the principle of unsupervised overnight contact at the first hearing, and no concerns arose out of the unsupervised overnight time that Z spent with her mother and her siblings in England mid-proceedings. Father does not suggest that, in the event of a return, that he would accompany Z or seek for her to live with him in the Czech Republic on an interim basis pending further Czech court determinations, or social services investigations.</p>

But the observations of Ms Gwynne are helpful insofar as she considers them to be nuanced potential influences, which in my view, could significantly interfere with future contact and impact on Z's welfare and well-being.

The practicalities of this should now be drafted and I will hear submissions as regards date of return (mother suggests by 27 October 2023 whereas father referred to the standard timeframe to be 2-3 weeks). However, as I have not heard full submissions on this issue, I invite the parties to address me on that limited iss<span style="color:#000000">ue at the resumed hearing.</span></p>

Ms Gwynne has helpfully agreed to discuss the terms of the return order with Z, observing that this will be a difficult time for all concerned with Z. &#160;I would urge the parties and all those who care for Z to pro-actively work together to ensure Z's safe return to the Czech Republic.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having heard further submissions from the parties, and after checking with the High Court Team at Cafcass, it was agreed that the date for return to the Czech Republic would be Wednesday morning, 1 November 2023, if suitable flights could be found; but in any event, I direct that the return should be effected by no later than 23:59 on Thursday 2 November 2023 to ensure that Ms Gwynne has the opportunity to speak to Z, as she suggested, prior to the return to the Czech Republic. Both the mother and the father agreed with this timetable, which also affords Z an opportunity to attend some planned Halloween events and see her friends in the UK prior to her departure.</p>
