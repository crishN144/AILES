The first account the father gave of this was in his police interview on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012. Asked whether Z had had any medical problems in the past he replied, &#8216;Once she had a bruise on her hip and we had to go to the doctors&#8230;&#8217; Later in the interview he spoke of seeing a bruise &#8216;on her right side at the back on her back&#8217;. In cross-examination of the father Mr Kingerley, for the local authority, suggested to him that these may have been two separate bruises. I am satisfied that they were not. I find that the father was speaking about the same bruise. The difference between &#8216;hip&#8217; and &#8216;back&#8217; is easily explainable given that the father was responding to police questions with the assistance of an interpreter. </p>

In the event, the bruise was seen by two health visitors and a GP. None of them reported their concerns to social services. The mother told the father that the doctor had told her that the bruising may have been caused by her holding Z too tightly around the waist whilst changing her nappy. Given that the mother had sought medical advice, what more should the father have done? Should he have overridden the doctor and made his own referral to social services? Should he have sought another medical opinion? The answer to both of those questions, in my judgment, is &#8216;no&#8217;. He was entitled to take the level of concern of health care professionals as the yardstick by which to determine what more, if anything, he himself needed to do.</p>

However, with respect to the buckle fracture of the right distal humerus, the transverse fracture of the left ulna shaft, the incomplete fracture of the left radial neck and the probable healed fracture of the right proximal tibial shaft, &#8216;someone not witnessing the causal events would have realised that Z was distressed and had reduced limb movement.

Firstly, in its threshold document the local authority seeks no findings arising from the police officer&#8217;s evidence. Although in the light of the father&#8217;s acceptance of the police officer&#8217;s evidence I accept that on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October there were concerns about the state of the property I am not persuaded that they are of any great significance in the context of the decisions I have to make. In arriving at that conclusion I have in mind, secondly, that the report of the Serious Case Review notes that up to 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2012 (the date when Z was seen by two health visitors and a GP with bruising to her back) Z had been seen and weighed 7 times including 3 home visits by a health visitor and a community nursery nurse. The health professionals who visited the home do not appear to have expressed any concerns about the state of the home. The evidence of PC Adams does not justify a conclusion that the father could not be relied upon to maintain a home to a good enough standard in which to care for a vulnerable child with the range of medical needs which Z has.</p>

He is an overstayer. RD notes that whether he is able to remain living in the UK is dependent on the outcome of these proceedings. The father told her that he expected that once these proceedings have been concluded he will have to return to India. During the assessment it was not entirely clear whether the father wanted to return to India (i.e. whether that was his primary position) or whether he was resigned to the risk that the immigration authorities would require him to return.

His finances are extremely modest and not sufficient to enable him to support both himself and Z. In relative terms, his family in India appear to live quite comfortably. It is clear that in reflecting on his position the father realises that, at the moment, he would be financially better off living in India than in the UK. RD notes that the father &#8216;stated that he is unable to stay in the UK as he has no money but if he returns to India, then he will not have any financial problems&#8217;.</p>

Although she acknowledges that the father has not been invited to attend any of Z&#8217;s medical appointments she is nonetheless concerned that the father &#8216;has very limited understanding of Z&#8217;s disabilities, the impact of those disabilities on her day to day life and on her long term needs&#8217;. RD was left with the impression that the father believes that Z &#8216;will recover really well&#8217; and that with the right treatment she will in time &#8216;recover and become a normal child&#8217; whereas the medical evidence suggests the very opposite.</p>

[The father] explained that his religion and faith are very important to him, he has strong religious faith that Z will get better, he stated that Doctors have their place but so does religion and the hope that Z will get better.

I am satisfied on the evidence that the local authority was right to rule out most of these family members whose interest and commitment appears, at best, to have been equivocal. However, I do have concerns about the local authority&#8217;s screening (it cannot in truth be called a viability assessment) of paternal grandmother (&#8216;PGM&#8217;).</p>

Due to the injuries that Z has sustained and the impact of these, Z currently requires a significant amount of care from her foster carer, medical staff and community-based health professionals. Based on the current assessment of Z&#8217;s physical and cognitive disabilities, it is likely that she will require this significant level of care throughout her life and I am concerned about the facilities in the Punjab region where both sets of grandparents live. I have discussed this issue with Shila (sic) Foster in the kinship team who has personal experience of the region in the Punjab where the grandparents live. She has indicated that there would be limited healthcare and educational facilities for a child with Z&#8217;s difficulties. Furthermore, she has raised reservations about how a child with Z&#8217;s difficulties may be viewed culturally.&#8217;</p>

The Local Authority have identified Z&#8217;s current carer wishes to adopt her; clearly this will provide continuity in the specialist care that Z needs and her attachments and bond with her carer will be maintained and indeed, will continue to grow and develop.&#8221;</p>

As Lady Hale said (para 198) it is "necessary to explore and attempt alternative solutions". What are these options? That will depend upon the circumstances of the particular cases. They range, in principle, from the making of no order at one end of the spectrum to the making of an adoption order at the other. In between, there may be orders providing for the return of the child to the parent's care with the support of a family assistance order or subject to a supervision order or a care order; or the child may be placed with relatives under a residence order or a special guardianship order or in a foster placement under a care order; or the child may be placed with someone else, again under a residence order or a special guardianship order or in a foster placement under a care order. This is not an exhaustive list of the possibilities; wardship for example is another, as are placements in specialist residential or healthcare settings. Yet it can be seen that the possible list of options is long. We return to the implications of this below. </p>

Against that history, it was not unreasonable for the local authority to ask the father to demonstrate various aspects of his parenting ability. This was done in order to find out whether the father has the proactive energy and drive needed to look after Z. The signs are that he does not. Despite being in England for some three years he is still unable to speak English and this fact alone will make the very difficult task of looking after Z an altogether impossible one.</p>

He was cooperative and teachable. Despite this the local authority declined either to increase the level of contact or provide him with any form of training to enable him to meet Z&#8217;s care needs (unlike the foster carer for whom training has been provided).</p>

To this must be added the local authority&#8217;s failure to give the father opportunity to meet with any of the health care professionals responsible for Z&#8217;s care.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.23in">The local authority&#8217;s social work assessment proceeded on the assumption that the father wished to return to India and care for Z there. Whilst I acknowledge that some of the things the father said may reasonably have led the local authority to that belief, I am equally satisfied that that is not his position. This is not the only issue in this case in which something has been lost in translation.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.23in">The local authority appears to have assumed that a care plan for adoption automatically means that post-adoption contact should be limited to letter-box contact only. It has not given any consideration either to the benefits for Z of contact continuing or, as part of its assessment of the father, what the father has to offer to Z  through ongoing direct contact. Whereas the guardian has begun to reconsider her position on contact there is no evidence that the local authority has begun to do so.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in;text-indent:0.06in">I am satisfied that the local authority&#8217;s assessment of this father falls short of the standard required. Even if, ultimately, a conclusion is reached that this father is unable to be his daughter&#8217;s primary carer (and on the basis of the present assessment I am not yet persuaded that that is necessarily the case) and that a long-term placement outside her birth family would be in Z&#8217;s best interests, the local authority&#8217;s assessment does not enable any conclusions to be arrived at as to the nature and extent of the role the father may be able to play in Z&#8217;s life. Such a role may be limited to infrequent supervised contact. It is also possible that it may be more extensive perhaps including unsupervised, and maybe even overnight, contact. If more extensive contact were appropriate is it possible that the father could be a respite carer? Is this completely fanciful? On the basis of the present assessment it is impossible to know. All that can be said is that the local authority&#8217;s planning in this case has been unimaginative and its assessment wholly inadequate. Given this child&#8217;s cultural needs &#8211; needs which will only be partially met in her current placement &#8211; a fair, robust and thorough assessment of the father may better enable decisions to be made that genuinely take account of Z&#8217;s global, holistic needs.</p>

We do not envisage that proper compliance with what we are demanding, which may well impose a more onerous burden on practitioners and judges, will conflict with the requirement, soon to be imposed by statute, that care cases are to be concluded within a maximum of 26 weeks. Critical to the success of the reforms is robust judicial case management from the outset of every care case. Case management judges must be astute to ensure that the directions they give are apt to the task and also to ensure that their directions are complied with. Never is this more important than in cases where the local authority's plan envisages adoption. If, despite all, the court does not have the kind of evidence we have identified, and is therefore not properly equipped to decide these issues, then an adjournment must be directed, even if this takes the case over 26 weeks. Where the proposal before the court is for non-consensual adoption, the issues are too grave, the stakes for all are too high, for the outcome to be determined by rigorous adherence to an inflexible timetable and justice thereby potentially denied.</p>

However, it is appropriate that I should make the point that it should not be assumed that if the assessment of the father is negative then that, without more, will lead to endorsement of the present final care plan. Even leaving to one side the local authority&#8217;s flawed assessment of the father, it is plain that the current final care plan is deficient. For example, it does not consider and analyse realistic alternatives to adoption (long term foster care, special guardianship); it does not consider whether it is appropriate for Z to remain in a placement in which there is a changing population of children in short term foster care; it assumes that post-adoption letter-box contact is appropriate without making any attempt to consider whether ongoing direct contact would better meet Z&#8217;s needs; it proposes by way of contingency plan that if the placement with FC breaks down it will search for an alternative adoptive placement even though it acknowledges that it is highly unlikely that an alternative adoptive placement could be found. These are all issues which must be addressed. The local authority has more work to do before this case can fairly be concluded.</p>

For the reasons set out earlier in this judgment I regard that assessment as inadequate. The notion that a Punjabi speaking grandmother living in India, expressing a clear interest in being assessed as a long-term carer for her granddaughter, not having been provided with any of the background papers translated into Punjabi, can be ruled out on the basis of two telephone conversations one of which was conducted by a Hindi speaking English social worker, is in my judgment wholly unsupportable. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.32in;text-indent:0.06in">Z&#8217;s care needs require support from a multi-disciplinary team of health care professionals. Is there any possibility that a similar package of support could be available in India? If the answer to that question is &#8216;no&#8217; then it seems to me that notwithstanding PGM&#8217;s offer to care for Z and the duty on the local authority pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.17</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> to promote the upbringing of Z by her family, it would be difficult to argue that a move to India would be in Z&#8217;s best welfare interests. However, making that point simply serves to highlight the fact that the court does not, at present, have sufficient evidence to enable it to make that judgment. There needs to be a proper assessment of PGM. Any such assessment also needs to identify and consider the services that would be available to meet Z&#8217;s care needs in India. These are now issues for further case management.</p>
