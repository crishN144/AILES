	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On Sunday 20 November 2016, probably in the early hours of that day, S then aged 10, died in her bedroom at the family home.  This case is concerned with the question as to whether the circumstances of her death pose a risk to her younger siblings so as to require the intervention of the state.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The family home was that of her parents.   Also living there were two older brothers, E and W.  S also had three younger siblings, a sister X and two brothers, Z and A.  Apart from them, nobody else lived in the house.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On the night in question the whole family were present in the house, but, at least so far as they were aware, there was no one else.  In due course, I will have to consider whether in fact an intruder entered during the night.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">S went to bed happy and well at about 10.30pm or a little after on the Saturday night.  It is said that she was found by family members in the morning.  When she was formally pronounced dead at about 10.30 that Sunday morning, it is clear that she had in fact been dead for some time.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">S shared a room with X and sometimes Z slept with them and sometimes he slept with his brothers.  That night it is said that he slept with his sisters. </p>

	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">During that night, S suffered a fatal injury.  The formally recorded cause of death was a compression injury of the neck.  On the day in question, the provisional view of the police was that S had died as a result of a tragic accident.  That view was radically revised after the post-mortem examination to a sexually motivated homicide.  That was because not only did the pathologist conclude that strangulation was the most likely cause of death, but they had found genital bruising suggestive of a sexual assault.   </p>

	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The parents have never been able to explain how S met her death.  Their conclusion is that this was a tragic if inexplicable accident.  Certainly, they assert that neither they nor any member of their family bear any culpability for what happened.   </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The Local Authority&#8217;s case is that S had died at the hands of one or more of the parents and two older brothers, having suffered a sexual assault.  It is further alleged that the family then engaged in obfuscation and the erection of a wall of silence to impede and distract the investigation of their daughter's death.  At the end of the day the question which the court must decide is reasonably clear: can the Local Authority prove on the balance of probabilities that S suffered a sexual injury and was strangled and, if so, whether that was a result of a culpable act by one or more of the four named family members and if so, was there a concerted determination to impede the investigation which would thus expose the younger children to the risk of significant harm?  The question might be clear, but its answers are far from easy.  That much appears clearly from the next part. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The younger children had been accommodated under police protection orders on 25 November 2016, and X and Z had been placed in foster care, though A remained with his mother.  The London Borough of Southwark issued Part IV proceedings in respect of all five children on 29 November 2016.  There were then a series of procedural orders that amongst other things, included the return of X and Z to the mother and the older boys to the parental grandfather.   </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 13 November 2017, the first fact-finding began before Francis J, who on 22 December 2017 gave a judgment dismissing the claim, something confirmed by the order of the court made on 8 January 2018.  Subsequent to that judgment, the family were reunited.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in;text-indent:0in">On 25 July 2018, the Court of Appeal allowed the Local Authority&#8217;s appeal and set aside the order and directed a retrial. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On 21 January 2019, the retrial began before Hayden J.  On 7 June 2019, Hayden J gave judgment in which he found that S had died at the hands of the mother as a result of a failed attempt at FGM and this was confirmed by the order of the court on 14 June 2019.  On 14 November 2019, the Court of Appeal allowed the family&#8217;s appeal and set aside the order and directed a third fact-finding trial.  Shortly thereafter, the case was assigned to me by the President and there have been a number of procedural orders, but the matter culminated on 26 March 2020 by the opening of this third fact-finding trial.   </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">That is a history unique in the experience of all involved in this case.  The reasons for this retrial are set out in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, but were no doubt influenced by the fact that two wholly conflicting decisions had both been overturned.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There are a number of consequences of all this so far as this trial is concerned.  Everyone has given evidence in court three times.  The experts have both lodged reports, had two experts&#8217; meetings and some have answered written questions.  The family members have in addition made statements in these proceedings and statements to the police, both in the capacity of witnesses and in two cases in the capacity of suspects.  All this means that the evidence before me must now be weighed with particular care, making proper allowances for all these matters.  This trial has presented a most formidable forensic challenge.   <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Part 3</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">When I first came to this case on 17 December 2019, I made a number of matters clear.  First, that I wanted to treat this as a new trial.  Secondly, that I did not intend to read the transcripts of the first or second fact-finding hearings.  Thirdly, that I did not actually intend to read the judgments in those hearings, though of course parts have been drawn to my attention as will appear.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have, however, read both judgments of the Court of Appeal.  I also made a direction that there should be no reference to previous evidence unless it was to put an alleged inconsistent statement.  I did not detect any real resistance to this approach. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">During the trial there were occasional references to the earlier proceedings, but save where there was a plainly inconsistent statement, it was immediately apparent that any such investigation involved the real risk of having to explore the context in which the statement came to be made.  Accordingly, I remained firm, save for that one exception of inconsistent statements, in discouraging or even preventing reference to earlier proceedings. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Although there was clearly some forensic risk inherent in this approach, it was my view that that risk was very significantly outweighed by the benefit of the clear management of the evidence actually advanced before me.  Given the skill and experience of leading counsel in this case, I am satisfied that no injustice was done by my approach.  To the contrary, I believe the evidence emerged with a clarity that I found most helpful.   </p>

It was during this week that the Government announced the civic lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 virus.  It was clear that we were not going to be able to resume on 23 March as a conventional trial at the Royal Courts of Justice.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">For entirely good and indeed obvious reasons, all parties were most anxious that we should not be faced with a long adjournment.  That, given the history of this case, would not only have been undesirable but in my view, unjust.  The proposal was floated that we could continue the trial in a virtual court by the use of Zoom.  All including, it has to be said, the judge agreed to explore this option. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On Friday 20 March, we had a dry run.  It involved the parties, counsel, solicitors, and witnesses in over 20 different locations.  The system was organised by 1GC Family Law Chambers with Miss Gemma Kelly, junior counsel for the mother, acting as host.  As a result of this, all parties agreed to continue this case in a virtual court and a consent order to that effect with my express approval was drawn.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The police evidence had been heard in the conventional form.  However, all the expert evidence and the lay evidence, including the relevant family members, was heard via Zoom.  After the evidence had finished, parties put in written submissions, printed, and arranged for me with cooperation of a clerk in the Liverpool Family Court, with a further Zoom hearing to allow counsel to speak to those submissions.  This judgment is being given via Zoom, but in accordance with the advice of the President of the Family Division, it is being given in a courtroom, in this case Court 27 in the Liverpool Family Justice Centre.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Having reflected on this experience, which was in this form certainly new to me, I have concluded that it has served the interests of justice.  Certainly, I was denied the advantage of being able to see how the family reacted to the evidence as it was given.  However, as this would have been the third time of hearing, I would have had to be very cautious in evaluating any such reaction.   </p>

	  <num>23.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Insofar as this was a disadvantage, it was significantly outweighed by the benefits of being able to continue the trial and not having an indefinite adjournment.  I will have something further to say in the epilogue to this judgment about this matter.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It has to be said that it would have been nigh impossible to conduct this hearing without the fulsome cooperation of all involved: counsel, parties, and witnesses.  I am very grateful to all of them.  Special recognition should be accorded to Miss Kelly, who has acted throughout as host and undertook the responsibility of seeing that daily recordings were provided to the Royal Courts of Justice.  I should record that at no point did anyone suggest that the interests of justice were no longer being served by this method of conducting this trial or indeed the means by which it was done.   </p>

	  <num>25.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Amongst the matters that required cooperation were the willingness of parties to opt out of being seen on the screen, though they could of course see and hear everything, and to selfmute.  The latter was particularly important as the screen picture is sound sensitive and so a cough, noises off (and in this case everyone I think was working from home), or even noisy page turning could suddenly result in a figure appearing on the screen and disrupting the witness actually giving evidence.  The one exception was to allow family members to be able to see their own counsel whilst being cross-examined by others.   </p>

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened&#8217;. </p>

In this country we do not require documentary proof. We rely heavily on oral evidence, especially from those who were present when the alleged events took place. Day after day, up and down the country, on issues large and small, judges are making up their minds whom to believe. They are guided by many things, including the inherent probabilities, any contemporaneous documentation or records, any circumstantial evidence tending to support one account rather than the other, and their overall impression of the characters and motivations of the witnesses.

A young baby dies whilst under the sole care of a parent or childminder. That child can give no clue to clinicians as to what has happened. Experts, prosecuting authorities and juries must reconstruct as best they can what has happened. There remains a temptation to believe that it is always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child. Where the prosecution is able, by advancing an array of experts, to identify a non-accidental injury and the defence can identify no alternative cause, it is tempting to conclude that the prosecution has proved its case. Such a temptation must be resisted. In this, as in so many fields of medicine, the evidence may be insufficient to exclude, beyond reasonable doubt, an unknown cause. As <span style="font-style:italic">Cannings</span> [177] teaches, even where on examination of all the evidence, every possible known cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown&#8217;. </p>

In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a disputed aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown.  That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof.

His view that day, although he had changed his mind once or twice, was that he was dealing with a tragic accident.  He regarded both murder and suicide as unlikely and further noted that there were no signs of disturbance or struggle in the bedroom or the house, a now uncontroversial fact.   </p>

Although the bedroom was for a time that day secured as a crime scene, everything else was governed by the conclusion that this death was not suspicious.   </p>

There are inconsistencies both between and within the evidence of each family member.  The parents sometimes surprisingly had ready recourse to, &#8216;I don't know&#8217; or &#8216;I don't remember&#8217; types of answer.

Has the court made sufficient allowances for the fact that although both parents were competent in English, it was for each of them not their first language? Or does this, on the other hand, create such an impression as to lead to a conclusion that this family has consciously and of course dishonestly erected a wall of silence against the state&#8217;s proper enquiries into S&#8217;s death? </p>

Secondly, this family were a rarity in Part IV proceedings in that not only was there no hint of any risk factors associated with sexual assault or violence within the family, but also there was a plethora of independent evidence which demonstrated that this was a high-functioning, effective, coherent and loving family.  That does not prove that they did not do it, but it is very important evidence in the big picture, especially where what is alleged involves deliberation rather than a transient loss of selfcontrol.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Since this is at least the second time that I have concluded after a long forensic enquiry that I do not know what has happened, I need to ask myself one hard question: is this simply a failure of judicial nerve to make a finding against a family such as this, the finding which is nevertheless required by the evidence as a whole?  I ask that question not just because it occurred to me but also because I recognise that decisions in cases like this are not driven exclusively by the process of reasoning. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There is an element in human judgment that lies beyond cold rationality as every experienced trial judge soon comes to appreciate.  In order to test that, I have reflected carefully upon the position as it would be were I to have found that the Local Authority had indeed established their case and this child had been sexually assaulted and killed by one or more members of a family who had then conspired to conceal the truth from all legitimate enquiry.  I discovered that such a conclusion would be an affront to my judicial conscience.   </p>

The only consequence of that can be, and will here be ordered to be, a dismissal of these proceedings.   </p>

I wish to record my appreciation for the unfailing assistance and cooperation that I have received from counsel, both in the conduct of the case generally and in the conduct of the virtual trial in particular.  As I noted earlier, to do such a case as this in a virtual court is really only possible if everyone involved, including the lay parties, is both ready and willing to be cooperative.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This has been an extraordinary case both because of its subject matter and because of its litigation history.  Of course, the greatest burden has been born by the parents and the family and I wish specifically to acknowledge that.  It has also taken its toll on the witnesses, even those whose profession might be thought to have hardened them against such things.  I think that at every point at which I received a surprising answer or response from a witness, this was the key to it.  It has also taken its toll of the legal teams, which deepens my appreciation of the assistance I have received.  This was in many ways a unique case and one that is unlikely to be repeated.   </p>

S had much to look forward to.  My abiding regret is my inability to say exactly how and why she met her sadly premature end.   </p>
