In 1994 LS and BD, who had formed their own band, persuaded the husband to join them. After his arrival they changed the name of the band. In 1999 the band signed its first record deals with companies in the USA, Europe and Australia. It released its first album, in 1999. Since then it has made a further six albums. The band has been extremely successful. </p>

This generates a modest income and has a correspondingly modest capital value. The valuers were only about &#163;5,000 apart on the value of this stream, and everyone agreed that the difference was not worth worrying about and that it should be split. Therefore, I take the value, net of all notional taxes, to be &#163;55,561. </p>

This has a significant element of gratuity to it as there is no obligation on LS to dispense such largesse. This agreement is in the process of being changed and the new agreement will be signed very shortly. The new agreement has different terms depending on whether the husband leaves or stays in the band. Thus, if he were to leave the band tomorrow this entitlement would run out after 10 years. If he stays in the band the agreement endures until he is aged 70. </p>

Ultimately, it was agreed that the best means of valuing Stream 3 is the discounted cash flow method. </p>

Although this procedure is referenced in CPR PD 35 at para 11, it has not found its way into FPR PD25A-E. This is not to say that the procedure has not been used in family proceedings; to my knowledge, certainly in public law children proceedings, expert evidence has been given in this way. In this case the process was extremely successful. The witnesses occupied the witness box together in close proximity. They were questioned topic by topic which from the court&#8217;s point of view meant that relevant evidence on each topic was given contemporaneously and not separated by a hiatus. It was fascinating to observe little debates break out between the accountants in the witness box. After it was over Mr Greene commented that it was much more friendly than the traditional adversarial process. In my opinion this </p>

I do not think that it is justifiable to reduce the multiplier substantially by reference to the formal legal non-assignability of this stream in circumstances where Mr Marks has convinced me that whilst this may be the formal legal position, it is not reflected in the real world. Therefore, the multiplication is &#163;88,493 x 14 = &#163;1,238,895. From this I deduct notional costs of sale of 2.5% (&#163;30,972) giving a net pre-dividend tax value of &#163;1,207,923. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In relation to Stream 3 (the money received from LS&#8217;s publishing or composition income) it is now not disputed that the optimum valuation method is Mr Burns&#8217; discounted cash flow spreadsheet. This uses a discount rate of 6.59%, corresponding to a multiplier of 15.8, as explained above. Given that income derives from LS&#8217;s publishing or composition income I do not believe that this multiplier is high enough. The source is gilt-edged income which would in my judgment command a higher multiplier. I am satisfied that a multiplier of 17.2 would be fair and reasonable. This, using Mr Burns&#8217; averaging technique explained above, corresponds to a discount rate of 6.06%. The annual income which I should take is agreed (or at least not seriously disputed) at &#163;170,000. Inputting these data into the spreadsheet gives a pre-dividendtax capital figure, on the basis that the husband does not leave the band, of &#163;1,793,146. If he were to leave the band tomorrow, then under the terms of the new agreement the annual income figure would be &#163;102,000 giving rise to a pre-dividendtax capital figure of &#163;376,564. It is agreed that the figure I should take should lie at a fair point between these two bookends. Mr Kingscote QC argues that the second scenario &#8211; the husband leaving the band tomorrow &#8211; is far more improbable than the first scenario and that therefore I should take a weighted average of the two figures, attributing a factor of two to the higher figure and a factor of one to the lower one. I agree with this approach. It is consistent with my estimate of the probabilities. Thus, a figure of &#163;1,320,952 is derived. </p>

It was explained to me that this sort of arrangement happens in about 50% of bands, but that does not make it any less an instance of benign largesse. In my opinion there is a significant nonmatrimonial element to this income stream which justifies discounting the figure of &#163;1,320,952. In my judgment the least discount which would be consistent with fairness to reflect this factor would be 25%. Therefore, the figure falls to &#163;990,714. </p>

I completely disagree with this approach. If the husband goes on tour in 2021 and 2022 and plays songs which were created during the marriage (although written by LS) then the income which he derives from that endeavour are to be characterised as earnings made after the marriage. The fans are coming to see the band performing, not to listen to songs being played by a machine </p>

It is clear that for his own personal reasons LS wishes to take a break from touring for up to two years. The husband also has found touring wearing and would welcome a break, particularly in circumstances where a child from his new marriage will shortly arrive into this world. LS&#8217;s email suggests that there may be some modest touring in 2021 with a more full-throated resumption in 2022. Based on this evidence Mr Greene has endeavoured to calculate the husband&#8217;s future income from 2020 onwards. His calculation is as follows: </p>

There may be in a case a very good reason why there should be departure from the starting point of the formula. In my opinion the formula should apply even where the earnings of the father are in excess of the &#163;3000 per week maximum provided for in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/48" uk:canonical="1988 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and the Regulations. If the earnings of the father were very much in excess of that then there would be a good reason to depart from the formula downwards, but if the income of the father is not un-adjacent to the maximum then to my mind, subject to other factors, that of itself is not a good reason to depart from the formula.&#8221; </p>

In my judgment both the burden of any downside (i.e. if the tax bill is more than &#163;2.2 million) and the benefit of any upside (i.e. if the tax bill is less than &#163;2.2 million) should accrue to the husband alone and there should be no sharing of either benefit or burden with the wife.
