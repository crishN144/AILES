	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am concerned here with a little girl, M, who has just turned 13 months of age. She is presently the subject of an interim care order, along with her siblings. Concerns arose following a difficult situation in January 2019 when her parents were initially unable to agree to a gastrostomy being performed (as advised by her treating clinicians), although subsequently they did give their consent.  </p>

On 18 February 2019 a further dispute arose, again in relation to M&#8217;s treatment and, having heard evidence, I made an order authorising the removal of an infected peritoneal dialysis catheter. I made a declaration that insertion of a new one was in her best interests.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">M was born with end stage renal failure. Prognosis in such circumstances, I have been told, is not propitious but far from forlorn. On 18 February 2019, I heard from two paediatric nephrologists who highlighted the background to the application, telling me that M, who weighed between 7 and 8kg would become eligible for a transplant if she were to achieve the weight of 10kg.  All this is by way of the most sufficient superficial summary to the background of this application before me today.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I have heard today from Dr Dean Wallace, consultant paediatric nephrologist, responsible for M&#8217;s care and I have had the benefit of an addendum to his earlier statement which sets out the change in M&#8217;s medical status. I draw upon that to summarise the medical issues. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Pursuant to my order, M&#8217;s dialysis catheter was removed, she having been accommodated on the emergency list on 19 February 2019. The reinsertion of a new catheter, as I have had explained to me, was delayed until 23 February 2018 the objective there had been to facilitate a more effective and complete treatment of the peritonitis from which she was suffering, by way of targeted antibiotics. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At the operation Dr Wallace noted a significant number of thick adhesions in the middle of the abdomen and pelvis. As he told me in his oral evidence, they were larger and more extensive than he had expected and the effect of this was to compromise the efficacy of the peritoneal dialysis catheter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr Wallace has consulted with his paediatric and nephrology specialist colleagues throughout this case. It is a case which has, for entirely understandable reasons, caused him great concern and he has wanted properly to harness as much expertise as he can to provide the best treatment for his patient. In discussions with his surgical colleagues there was agreement that the adhesions were so widespread and extensive that it was not possible to identify a usable space for a new peritoneal catheter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Peritoneal dialysis was recommenced on Sunday 24 February 2019 and whilst fluid was moving in and out of her abdomen it was clear that M was retaining fluid on each cycle, meaning that overall, fluid was being retained and not removed from her body. This is one of main indications for dialysis. It was recommenced on Monday 25 February 2019 but again, despite efforts with, this time, a higher concentration of dialysate, she continued to retain fluid on each cycle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The process has not been wholly ineffective because it seems clear as I understand it that toxins have been expelled from the body and antibiotic treatment has addressed M&#8217;s peritonitis effectively. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the last 48 hours, M has gained a net weight of 300 grams. This represents an entirely fluid gain. It has been during a period of intense fluid restriction and she has clinical signs as Dr Wallace has explained of accumulating fluid, otherwise known as an oedema. The risk from this is that she could develop respiratory difficulties and high blood pressure. This scenario, known as &#8220;ultrafiltration&#8221;, arises in consequence of the very small surface area which is available for the dialysis, due to the extensive adhesions. It is complicated further by the location of the catheter position which was, in truth, all that was available. To this must be added the sequelae to the recent peritoneal infection.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The repositioning of the catheter has, therefore, been made impossible in light of the intra operative abdominal findings.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The first and primary option is the performing of haemodialysis. That is not an uncomplicated procedure in any circumstances but is particularly fraught for M. It requires to be said that it would necessitate a procedure under general anaesthetic, probably by a surgeon or interventional radiologist, to site the haemodialysis catheter, in effect a central line, into an available large venous vessel in M&#8217;s neck or groin. Through that line the blood can be cleaned and fluid effectively be removed with the assistance of the machine outside the body. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">into the future, from the most optimistic perspective, it remains the case that M&#8217;s long-term care will continue to require vigilance with ongoing medical care. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Burrows extracts from the medical reports the key risk factors attendant upon haemodialysis for M. There is M&#8217;s longstanding history of hypotension. It is, I am told, difficult to maintain her blood pressure in a haemodialysis regime because at any given point a significant proportion of her blood is not inside her body. There is a risk of collapse. There is a risk of stroke. There is a risk of seizures. There is a risk of exposure to infection concomitant upon frequent blood transfusions. There is the everpresent risk of blockage. There is a real potential for catheter removal by accident or migration. There is a risk of catheter infection and thrombosis of the small blood vessels with large plastic catheters within.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">When Dr Wallace wrote his report he, once again, consulted widely with his colleagues, as he has done throughout. Since writing his report he has consulted even more extensively, this time nationwide. He has enquired of other specialist units as to general experience with haemodialysis in infants under 10Kg and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;how they were getting on&#8221;</span>. He told me with, if I may say so, admirable candour, that the approach within the profession was evenly balanced in favour of either the contemplated options in M&#8217;s case. He surmised that an ethical committee would probably be split 50/50 as to which is the right course.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is difficult to imagine a more onerous question for a court to address. However, since writing his report Dr Wallace has continued to think, reflect and to confer. When he came to give his evidence this morning, his conclusion, foreshadowed by counsel for the Trust in his opening submissions, was, he told me, by the narrowest of margins, that the haemodialysis option represented M&#8217;s best interests. Having expressed himself in this way Dr Wallace logically and inevitably added that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;this is only for now&#8221;</span>.

Examples include children in Persistent Vegetative State (PVS), Minimally Conscious State, or those with such severe cognitive impairment that they lack demonstrable or recorded awareness of themselves or their surroundings and have no meaningful interaction with them, as determined by rigorous and prolonged observations. Even in the absence of demonstrable pain or suffering, continuation of LST may not be in their best interests because it cannot provide overall benefit to them. Individuals and families may differ in their perception of benefit to the child and some may view even severely limited awareness in a child as sufficient grounds to continue LST. It is important, here as elsewhere, that due account of parental views wishes and preferences is taken and due regard given to the acute clinical situation in the context of the child's overall situation.&#8221; </span></p>
