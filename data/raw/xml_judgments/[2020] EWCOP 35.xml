KD was scheduled in the operating list of Dr Ahmed Salah, a consultant cardio-thoracic anaesthetist at the Trust&#8217;s Castle Hill Hospital (the &#8220;Hospital&#8221;) in Hull since 1992, as an urgent case on Tuesday, 30th June 2020 but this did not proceed because KD objected to the procedure taking place that day. She had arrived on the ward on Sunday 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June in anticipation of the surgery, having previously been an inpatient on the respiratory unit at the Hull Royal Infirmary for just under two weeks. </p>

It is described as right-sided video-assisted thorascopic bullectomy and pleurodesis, a form of what is commonly known as &#8220;keyhole&#8221; surgery, the details of which I shall set out below. The need for this arises in consequence of what is in fact a second pneumothorax. Mr Vasileios Tentzeris, her consultant thoracic surgeon, has explained to me in simple language, that when the lung collapses because there is a hole in it, the lung, which he described as being like a balloon in a barrel, deflates, the air is compressed and it has to be reinflated. Mr Tentzeris was contacted by the respiratory consultant at the Royal Infirmary on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and then met KD once she had arrived at the Hospital on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June and on another three occasions on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.  </p>

It is not lightly assumed she lacks capacity merely because she has a longstanding diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Even with this condition, it may be possible to understand, retain and weigh the issues that arise. However, KD suffers from active persecutory delusions which impair her ability to understand and take decisions. She has had the benefit of a community psychiatrist, Dr Graham Harkness, for some 10 years with whom she has an easy and comfortable professional relationship. Dr Harkness has concluded that KD does not have the capacity properly to evaluate and weigh the medical issues around the proposed treatment in this case. The primary impediment, he considers, is KD&#8217;s unspecified anxiety which involves a generalised belief that rather than being there to help her, as they self-evidently are, the doctors may be motivated by some more hostile animus.  </p>

She has electrodes attached to her and we are monitoring her heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and pulse.  It is vital that we check how her condition is progressing haemodynamically. With a fully collapsed lung, if a little bit more air enters in the pleural cavity that that can push the heart and strangulate the blood supply.  This is called tension pneumothorax, which causes an immediate collapse of blood pressure (bringing it very close to zero) and this needs to be treated in seconds otherwise the patient will die.  KD is currently in a high observation area of hospital where we can do this within seconds.  The Trust has an on-call and on-site cardiothoracic team who are more than qualified to put a drain in to treat this as a matter of emergency.  </span></p>

There are a number of points here that are of importance. Firstly, due to the fact that KD presently has no drains from her chest, the surgery needs to happen urgently and is contemplated in the next 24 hours. Secondly, a repetition of the earlier option of draining KD&#8217;s lungs and waiting for the lungs to heal themselves is likely to take a great deal longer, thus exposing the patient to a greater risk of infection, as well as being clinically contra-indicated. Thirdly, I am told by Dr Saleh that the hospital procedures are so strict in terms of testing, isolating and screening for the area of the hospital where KD is situated, that the risks of contracting the virus are significantly reduced, albeit they cannot be eliminated altogether. Additionally, KD is unlikely to have brought the virus into hospital as she has recently tested negative and has been in hospital for 2 weeks. However, if KD contracted the infection she is considered to be very high risk. The doctors will wear full protective equipment throughout the operation.  </p>

He considers the risk intrathoracic injury also to be no greater than 1% or the risk of bleeding or infection to be no greater than 10%.  It follows from all that I have said above that the operation is urgently required and I have no difficulty in concluding that the surgical intervention and proposed aftercare is in KD&#8217;s best interest.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Wenban-Smith and Ms Greaney were kind enough to take a contemporaneous note of this ex-tempore judgment. With little amendment I have been able to publish it. I have done so, not because the case raises any complex point of law or medicine but because I consider that any judgment of this kind, involving treatment to an incapacitated individual against their expressed wishes, always requires proper public scrutiny. Additionally, the case contributes to a wider body of knowledge available to treating clinicians as to the type of case that should be brought to court. I agree with the Trust&#8217;s decision that this case required an application to be made. It is entirely consistent with the guidance: <span style="font-weight:bold">Serious Medical Treatment, Guidance <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2020/2" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCOP 2" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCOP 2</ref></span>. I should like to record my gratitude to Counsel and the doctors for their assistance in this case.</p>
