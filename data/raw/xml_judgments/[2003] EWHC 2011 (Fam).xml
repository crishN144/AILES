	      <p class="p27" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in">This is an appeal from a decision of District Judge Million sitting in the Principal Registry of the Family Division on 26 March 2003. In care proceedings relating to two children he held that the threshold criteria were made out under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. The children are Michael born on 27 November 1988 and Lola born on 20 August 1990.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="p28" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in">The local authority&#8217;s case was based on three incidents of violence by the mother towards Lola.</p>

	    <num>3.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="p28" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in">The first occurred in about November 2001 at Lola&#8217;s school when the mother chased Lola, angrily brandishing a shoe. The incident was the subject of evidence from staff at the school. The finding of the district judge that the incident occurred as alleged is not one that is susceptible of appeal.</p>

	    <num>4.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="p28" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in">The second incident occurred after a parent&#8217;s evening at the school on 11 July 2002. On the way home, apparently because of her disappointment with Lola&#8217;s school report, the mother had hit Lola with the rolled up school report and when they reached home had hit her again with an umbrella. Here the evidence consisted only of what Lola had said to a school teacher and to a doctor. There were inconsistencies in what Lola had said but having reviewed the evidence that was available the district judge found that these assaults had taken place in the way that Lola alleged and again it does not seem to me that those findings of fact are susceptible of challenge before me.</p>

	      <p class="p28" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.54in">Had those two incidents stood alone it might have been doubted that the threshold criteria were established. However, thirdly and importantly, it was alleged that on the evening of 17 July 2002 the mother had struck Lola&#8217;s outstretched hand a severe blow with a doubled up electric flex. Here again the evidence was principally of statements made by Lola to the schoolteacher and to the doctor, a specialist paediatric registrar. The doctor said that the injury was serious, as indeed could be seen from a photograph. The social work team manager and the police officer who had become involved decided not to conduct formal interviews of either Lola or Michael. In the case of Lola they considered that she would not have made a credible witness in a videoed interview because of her obvious uncertainty about talking to the police. Moreover both children had been involved in previous criminal proceedings involving allegations of violence against them by their mother and the social worker and the police officer felt that the possibility of another prosecution of their mother would place undue pressure on the children and would not be in their best interests.</p>

On 23 May 1998 both children had been assaulted by the mother with an electric flex. Michael had been found to have over 40 whip marks on various parts of his body and Lola had a number of welts on her back and arm. Both children were found to have other and older scarring and Michael had said that they had been previously hit by their mother and also by their father. Criminal proceedings were taken and the mother pleaded guilty to charges of causing actual bodily harm. The mother was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for 12 months.</p>

He also held that the mother was likely to cause further significant physical and emotional harm to Lola in future. As to Michael, the judge held that he had been caused significant emotional harm by living in a household where his mother was threatening and assaulting his sister, on one occasion causing her a significant injury, and also drawing Michael into what he described as &#8220;a scheme of deception about those assaults&#8221;, in particular in respect of the most serious assault being the one to Lola&#8217;s wrist. In the result Michael had become cowed by the mother into overcompliance and wrongful acceptance of blame for her actions.</p>

There are no video or audio tape recordings of what either child said or says about these incidents, in particular about the wrist incident. Neither Lola nor the guardian on her behalf has sought to call Lola to give evidence or to file a written statement from her. Michael is separately represented and, with the court&#8217;s permission has filed a statement. . . . As I have said, I was not asked to reconsider the question of Michael giving evidence but obvious difficulties would have arisen which no doubt informed the decision of District Judge Roberts in refusing permission. Would it be fair to Lola to hear from Michael but not from her? Would either or both children giving evidence have itself been abusive or harmful for either or both of them? Would the interests of fairness and justice have outweighed the potential harm of either child giving oral evidence and going through the ordeal of being asked questions and appearing in court in relation to their own future and circumstances? All of those are questions. The fact is that I have not heard directly from either child.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="p80" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;I have a sense of grave disquiet in the present case. Perforce, the procedure for the taking of evidence has to be modified in the case of young children, Depending on his or her age, the formal questioning of a child may be neither practical nor sensible as a means of finding out what the child has to say, or as a means of testing the child&#8217;s truthfulness. But in the present case, J is only a few months short of adult status. She is now 17 years and 3 months. In the normal course of events, I would have thought that fairness and the best interests of all these minors marched hand-in-hand in requiring the veracity of J&#8217;s statements, and of her stepfather&#8217;s vehement denials, to be probed by at least some questioning of J. As it is I am concerned there is a real danger that, in deciding where the future of the three younger children lies, great weight may be attached to J&#8217;s statements, without he stepfather or his counsel ever having had any opportunity at any stage so much as to ask her one question on any aspect of what she has said. I am alive to the danger of intimidation, and to the very real likelihood of J suffering distress if she has to go over these matters yet again. I would have hoped that these problems would not be insuperable. It ought to be possible to investigate such serious allegations or statements or disclosures, however they are to be described, in a more satisfactory manner than will now be possible, when the stipendiary magistrate will hear evidence from the stepfather and read J&#8217;s statements, coupled with an expression of view on her credibility by the psychiatrist who has interviewed her.&#8221;</p>

The purpose of the criminal court is to deal with criminal offences committed by people or children, and one of the aims at any rate of the criminal court is to punish the perpetrators. This jurisdiction is entirely different. It is, as the Official Solicitor said, a benign jurisdiction. It is to protect the child, sometimes from others and sometimes from itself and in some cases it is necessary in order to protect the child and to act as a good parent would act to curtail the child&#8217;s liberty for a time . . . In addition to the considerations of the interests of the child, which override any other considerations, there is also the inherent power of the court to control its own proceedings. The court must always bear in mind that attendance in court is likely to be harmful to the child, and the court should only allow the child to attend if it is satisfied that attendance is in the interests of the child.&#8221;</p>

If that should seem to suggest a conclusion or even an approach to the judge let me say at once that I have no knowledge of the case, no knowledge of the issues, and no knowledge of the matters to be discussed or the evidence likely to be given that might prove harmful to A. The balance to be maintained between recognising and upholding the rights of children who are parties to Children Act litigation to participate and be heard, and the need to protect children from exposure to material that might be damaging is a delicate one, and one essentially to be performed by the trial judge with a full perspective of the issues and the statements and reports, and at a relatively early stage in the proceedings.&#8221;</p>

One ground of appeal was that the trial judge had refused an application for the child to be called to give oral evidence. Wilson J said, at p 454:</p>

		      <p class="p93" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.02in">&#8220;It is unusual for a child complainant of sexual abuse to give oral evidence in proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. For example, it has never happened in my court; nor have I ever been asked to order the attendance of a child complainant Clearly, when a court is asked to make such an order it must approach the application on its merits without preconceptions. In principle, the older the child, the more arguable will be the application, &#8230; courts are increasingly aware of the further grave damage which can be done to a child who has been sexually abused, or indeed a child who has not been sexually abused but for some reason has spoken of being sexually abused, if she or he is subjected to the trauma of questioning by a stranger whose task is to attack her or his truthfulness in this supremely sensitive area. I would expect that in most cases where the child, whether or not a family member, is of N&#8217;s age or younger, the court would favour the absence of oral evidence even though the concomitant were to be the weakening, sometimes perhaps the fatal weakening of the evidence against the adult.&#8221;</p>

The daughter had apparently denied the allegations of abuse, ie her evidence was supportive of the parent&#8217;s case as was indeed the position of Michael in the case with which I am concerned. As to this Wilson J said at p 455:</p>

I asked Miss Allardice in argument what more she hoped that S might in evidence add to her denial. Miss Allardice&#8217;s answer was that, had S been asked to focus more specifically on N&#8217;s allegations, she might have produced some little extra piece of evidence which would have made her denial more compelling. In my judgment it would have been gravely abusive for a court to have subjected S to the trauma of further questions and such trauma would have been quite out of proportion to the doubtful probative value of her answers.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="p104" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in">Like Wilson J, I have never heard evidence from a child in court. I agree with him that the practice of not, having evidence from children is followed even where it may weaken a local authority&#8217;s case. Here however the child was 14 and the evidence that he would have given was said to be supportive of the parent&#8217;s case and as I said earlier, might have resulted in the court refusing to make a care order. I bear in mind what is said about the character and personality of the boy. I bear in mind the savage assault to which he had been subjected by his mother several years earlier, the pressure possibly brought upon him and of course his wish to remain at home. All of those things suggest that the weight to be attached to his oral evidence might be very little. As in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span> (above) it might have proved to add nothing to his written statement and at best nothing to justify the disadvantages to him of having to give evidence which as the district judge pointed out, would have been in conflict with the statements made by his sister with whom he is, and one hopes will continue to live.</p>

	      <p class="p105" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.52in"><marker name="tab"/>Nonetheless I harbour the same concerns as were expressed by Nicholls LJ. The court has held that this boy is mature enough to justify his being separately represented and parents who are at risk of losing their children wished to call him and he, his counsel assured me, wished to be called. I do not intend to be giving any indication of general principle but to confine myself to the facts of this particular case, I do not decide this issue on the, technical basis that the order of District Judge Roberts was not the subject of appeal and was not sought to be reopened before District Judge Million. I decide the issue on the limited basis that, whatever other judges might have done, the decisions of these two district judges not to have oral evidence from Michael were decisions well within their discretion and not susceptible to challenge before me.</p>
