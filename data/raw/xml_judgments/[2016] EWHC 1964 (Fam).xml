They lived together in England until their separation after sixteen months of marriage in March 2008; they were divorced in Australia in May 2009.  This was clearly a short marriage; CG is the only child of the marriage.  The mother has lived in Australia with CG since 2008, and continues to live there; she says that she wishes to live now in the UK.  The father has in fact since re-married, and has two further children; he lives in London.</p>

The financial remedy proceedings were resolved by consent when the parties entered into a series of &#8216;Binding Agreements&#8217; during 2009 (April and August), following mediation.  The parties were assisted in the negotiations, and in drawing up the agreements, by specialist family lawyers.  Three separate agreements were reached, in relation to (i) spousal maintenance, (ii) child support and (iii) capital provision.  It is significant to note, for an appreciation of the context of the substantive application and the application to strike out, that the agreements took effect in Australia as if they were/are court orders given that a number of relevant statutorily prescribed requirements were fulfilled - e.g. that the agreements were signed, that the parties had independent legal advice etc.  The agreed quantum of child support exceeded that which would have been calculated by the Australian Child Support Agency.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Some two years after the concluded agreements in Australia, in August 2011, the mother issued an application in the English Court for an order under <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1</span> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>; the father applied to strike it out on the basis that the financial support for CG had been dealt with in 2009 (as above). The mother responded by agreeing to the dismissal of her application without determination of the merits in November 2011.  There is some suggestion in the documents that in early 2012 the mother applied again in this jurisdiction for an order under <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1</span> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>; if she did, it appears to have been withdrawn.  In July 2012, the mother issued an application in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia for a variation and/or set aside of the Binding Agreements relating to spousal maintenance, child support and capital provision; she sought an interim order for capitalised spousal maintenance at Aus$100,000, and a further Aus$50,000 by way of child support.  By the time of the hearing of her interim application in August 2012 she had revised her bids upwards to Aus$300,000 and Aus$200,000 respectively. That application was considered by Judge Scarlett and dismissed by him in October 2012; for that hearing, the mother had filed a &#8220;plethora of lengthy affidavits with a significant number of annexures, not all of which appear to be directly relevant to the application&#8221;.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother then pursued in the Federal Court her applications to set aside all of the Binding Agreements on the basis that the agreements had been procured by duress, and/or fraud, and/or unconscionable conduct, and/or on the basis that the father had failed to give full and frank disclosure, and/or on the basis of a change of circumstance, and/or on the basis of negligent advice from her lawyers; by this time, the mother&#8217;s aspiration &#8220;for lump sum child support&#8221; had risen to Aus$580,000.  The mother&#8217;s multiple applications were heard in 2014, and judgment was delivered on 29 January 2015.  It is recorded in that judgment that 16 affidavits were filed by the mother with multiple exhibits running to some 2,200 pages; 12 of the affidavits were ruled inadmissible in their entirety and of the remaining 4, certain whole sections of these were ruled inadmissible.  The mother&#8217;s applications in all respects were rejected, and her claim that the Binding Agreements should be set aside was dismissed.  In his judgment, the judge (Judge Scarlett) considered carefully the limited routes by which a Binding Agreement for spousal maintenance or child support could be set aside, and disposed of the arguments thoroughly and carefully.  He drew attention to <span style="font-style:italic">section 136(2)(d) </span>of the <span style="font-style:italic">Child Support Assessment Act 1989 </span>(Australia), which provides that in these circumstances a Child Support Agreement could be set aside only if, because of &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; relating to the mother or child (CG) arising since the agreement was made, &#8220;[the mother] or the child will suffer hardship if the agreement is not set aside&#8221;. The Court found that the mother had not demonstrated that she or CG fulfilled this statutory threshold requirement.  Indeed, the Judge specifically recorded:</p>

On 26 May the application was transferred to the High Court by DJ Gibbons; she gave directions for the filing of a Form E by the father.

In deciding whether to order a strike out based on &#8216;abuse of process&#8217; under <span style="font-style:italic">rule 4.4</span>, I must not be distracted by a detailed consideration of the merits of the claim itself, but must confine my consideration to whether the claim is incoherent, lacking in sense, legally unrecognisable, factually baseless or similar.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, the 2014/2015 challenge to the Binding Agreements in the Australian Federal Court did not cause that court (as a court of competent jurisdiction) to consider the financial settlement for CG truly on its merits; unlike the English matrimonial jurisdiction, in which the court has a duty to scrutinise an agreement and a proposed consent order, to satisfy itself as to the appropriateness of its terms, and to consider whether any further enquiries should be made (see <span style="font-style:italic">Xydhias v Xydhias</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 683" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 683</ref> at 692), the Australian court does not in these circumstances have such a role, and did not exercise such a role.  The mother&#8217;s legal challenges to the Binding Agreements in Australia required Judge Scarlett to consider the specific, and relatively discrete, allegations of fraud, duress, lack of disclosure etc., not the overall adequacy of financial provision.  Moreover, on the issue of child support, the judge in the 2014/2015 litigation was confined (per <span style="font-style:italic">section 136(2)(d) </span>of the Australian <span style="font-style:italic">Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989</span>) to considering whether the mother had demonstrated &#8216;exceptional circumstances&#8217; and &#8216;hardship&#8217; before he could displace the Binding Agreement.  This specific and exacting test would plainly not be applied in a <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1</span> claim here; indeed, in a <span style="font-style:italic">Schedule 1</span> case the judge can include issues beyond hardship and basic need, including the &#8216;standard of living&#8217; of the parties which, although not expressly among the statutory factors, has been held to be relevant to the exercise of discretion &#8211; see Hale J (as she then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">J </span><span class="Emphasis">v C (Child: Financial Provision)</span>&#160;<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 152" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 152</ref> and Singer J in <span style="font-style:italic">F v G </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/1848" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 1848 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 1848 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 261" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 261</ref>.

I recognise the importance of judges seeking to save expense, by dealing with cases proportionately (see, for instance, Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Crossley v Crossley</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/1491" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 1491" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA Civ 1491</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1467" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1467</ref> at [15]), and will apply the &#8216;overriding objective&#8217; conscientiously.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother seeks an order for legal costs funding.  She asserts that without this support from the father, she would not enjoy equality of arms with the father in this litigation.  The mother&#8217;s schedule of prospective costs from now to FDR reveals a figure of &#163;78,198; that is on the basis that the solicitor and counsel are on &#8220;reduced rates&#8221;.  The mother&#8217;s claim is for a contribution of &#163;30,000.  The father opposes the mother&#8217;s application.  </p>

The father, it seems to me has reasonably limited free income, and/or ability to make a contribution, given his own financial commitments to his family in London, to his ongoing support for CG, to his mortgages, and in supporting his ability to earn.  On the mother&#8217;s own schedule, the father&#8217;s assets are essentially illiquid - the net equity in his home, equity in another property (from which, on sale, CGT would need to be accounted for) and an ongoing business credit (which operates effectively as income); </p>
