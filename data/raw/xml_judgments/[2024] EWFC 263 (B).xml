	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case involves A.  She is a little girl, she was born on (redacted) so she has just turned (redacted) now.  Her father is N T, who is the core applicant in these proceedings, and he is represented by Mr Shojaei of counsel.  A's mother is P M, and she is represented by Ms Ellison of counsel.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">
	  <num>2.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background to this case is that the father was born on 4 July 1982, and mother was born on 21 January 1993.  The chronology tells me that they married on 13 July 2019 in a religious marriage, but it is important to note, just for the fullness of the chronology, that their relationship started some years before, in about 2010, 2011, when mum was just 17.  It is clear that they did not live together all the time between then and getting married, because of work and study commitments, and they did break up in 2014, but they got back together again.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_3">
	  <num>3.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is of course the fact finder relating to allegations of abuse, and the question was put to mother, "Well, if this was such an abusive relationship, why didn't you leave it?  You broke up, why did you get back together again?"  But we are all aware, are we not, of the nature of an abusive relationship, and the court has to take into account the fact that often in even the most inexplicable circumstances people who are being abused go back to their abuser.  So, the court has to be aware of that.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I say, the parties married in July 2019, A was born in (redacted), but in September 2022 the parties separated.  There were some efforts I have seen from the various text messages and the like to agree child arrangements, but eventually the father felt he had no alternative but to issue an application for a child arrangements order in November 2022.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A few weeks later, Mr Shojaei notes with a degree of cynicism, the mother issued an application for a non-molestation order, notwithstanding the fact that it was quite a few weeks, certainly three months, since they separated, and he wonders why such an urgent application was necessary.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Be that as it may, the application was issued, and it was granted by another judge, and the proceedings have progressed from there, through a First Hearing Dispute Resolution Appointment, directions for a fact finder, to which I will return in a moment, and ultimately to today's hearing.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Perhaps the only other point to highlight from the chronology is that in August of last year there was a DNA test which confirmed that the applicant is indeed A's father.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, to pose that rather philosophical sounding question, "Why are we here?" but not to pose it in a philosophical manner, to ask, "What is this hearing all about?"; both parties make allegations of abuse against the other.  Where allegations of abuse are made, under Practice Direction 12J the court has to consider whether a fact finding hearing is necessary to see whether any of those alleged facts are true, to inform the court, often with the assistance of a report from CAFCASS or the Local Authority, of the factual nexus upon which the welfare situation should be based.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With some difficulty due to ill counsel, non-production of police records and other things, the hearing has finally come on today, and my job today is to consider the allegations which have been made, and decide which, if any, I find are proved.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That comment leads me onto something which I feel is often forgotten in fact finding cases, and that is an allegation is not enough.  If an allegation is to be of any relevance within proceedings it has to be proved.  If it is not proved, the courts proceed on the basis that it did not happen.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I know away from the court environment there are some bodies who perhaps place more reliance on the making of an allegation than the courts can, but unless you can prove your allegations they really are going nowhere, a matter to which I will return.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Allegations have to be proved on the balance of probabilities, that is what is more likely than not.  Often for the benefit of lay people in the room I say that I am aware that they may have heard of the phrase "beyond reasonable doubt", that is the criminal standard of proof, that is not what I am concerned about today, I am concerned about the civil standard of proof, the balance of probabilities, what is more likely than not.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Yesterday I read the transcript of a similar hearing, because I had ordered the transcript to be produced for CAFCASS.  I said, and this is relevant in this case, that the way in which the courts deal with these matters is very much a binary one.  I only have to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that something happened.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, even if I am only just satisfied, the courts will then proceed on the basis that it did happen.  If I am just not satisfied, the courts will proceed on the basis that it did not happen.  There is no grey area in these situations.  Either it did happen or it did not happen.  I cannot say, "Oh, well, I am 55 per cent for saying that it happened, therefore it sort of might have happened, and CAFCASS need to prepare their report on the basis that it might have happened".  That is not what we are dealing with.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">How does the court go about this?  The court hears evidence, in this case from the mother and the father, they produce statements. Both have produced numerous statements, I suggest probably too many statements.  Anyway, they have been produced.  I case managed the case, so it is probably my fault if there are too many statements.  But they produce their statements, they go in the witness box, they are asked questions by the other side's advocate, they are cross-examined, and their evidence is so tested.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What is the court looking for to decide whether something has been proved on the balance of probabilities?  In an ideal world every allegation that is made, if it is going to be proved, would have some sort of independent corroboration.  So, for example, corroboration that mum has had some abortions can be seen from the Marie Stopes discharge papers.  That is something which corroborates in part what she has said.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court also assesses how a witness performs in the witness box.  Are they a good witness?  Are they a bad witness?  Do they appear to be consistent?  Are they consistent with their statement?  That is the judge's job, to see what he thinks of the witness's performance in the witness box.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_18">
	  <num>18.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, we are looking at the evidence, we are looking at the testing of the evidence, we are looking at corroboration of the evidence, and we are looking at whether the evidence is given properly.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_19">
	  <num>19.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To go back to something that I have said a few minutes ago, allegations have to be proved.  One of the problems that I have in this case is that I do have my doubts as to whether particularly the mother's case has been given a proper analytical consideration of what might or might not be proved.  In fact, I remember at the end of the aborted hearing last time, almost the last thing that I said, because there seemed to be perhaps some realisation from the emergency advocate who was instructed on that occasion that maybe there might be some difficulty in proving things, that maybe somebody needs to have a good sit-down with the mother, discuss whether she really is going to be able to prove her allegations; that sometimes you make things worse by pressing on with allegations that are not proved.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_20">
	  <num>20.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not know whether that happened, and I still doubt whether that has happened, I do not know whether Ms Ellison had that conversation with her client, I do know that Ms Ellison has not been involved in any of the previous hearings.  So, I suspect she, unlike her instructing solicitors, has not had the opportunity to make that assessment.</p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_21">
	  <num>21.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as the witnesses giving evidence is concerned, on balance I found the father to be a more credible and consistent witness.  The mother I am afraid did seem to go off at a tangent.  I make allowances for the fact that, as she said, she tends to talk quickly, but there were times when her answers to Mr Shojaei's questions appeared to be reactive, she was looking for an explanation of the points that he was putting to her, whether they were true or not.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_22">
	  <num>22.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What I would say about the father however, and here I certainly agree with the approach that Ms Ellison took in cross-examination, and she hinted at it in her closing submissions, is it does not take much to look at the messages that were passing between these parties to see that this is a gentleman who one might say adopts a slightly old-fashioned approach to the relationship of husband and wife, or one might say this is a man who seems to see himself as in some ways superior to a woman.  That came through in the evidence that he gave.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_23">
	  <num>23.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So, whilst I may consider that he was a better witness in some ways, in other ways his superiority as a witness perhaps laid clear some of his faults behind his relationship with the mother.</p>

So, although I didn't see her do it, she was doing what she had said she was going to do".  Mum says, "I just slipped".

Two are discharge notes from the Marie Stopes clinic, the other is making an appointment with British Pregnancy Advisory Service, BPAS.  Even that does not confirm that the appointment took place, it does not confirm that the procedure actually happened.  Again, even if BPAS do destroy their notes after 8 years, which is what mum said, then it must be on your GP notes, a letter will have been sent to your GP.
