	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application in relation to AB who is a young woman of 34 years old and who has a serious and life threatening cardiac condition, the recommended treatment for which is surgery. In addition to her physical problems , AB is an inpatient at a low secure private hospital under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>(MHA). She has a mild/borderline learning disability which has been the case since her childhood years; a working diagnosis of autism which affects her anxiety levels, impulse control and mood regulation; a schizophrenic illness with prominent persecutory thinking. It is argued that the combination of the above factors in relation to her functioning leads to the conclusion that she lacks the capacity to litigate and to make a decision about her medical treatment.   </p>

There was real urgency in arranging a final hearing of the application which should be close enough to AB&#8217;s placement to allow her to attend and/or meet with the judge and/or give evidence. In those circumstances the application was released to me to be heard sitting as a section 9 judge and as a judge of the Court of Protection. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As it transpired, the view was taken that it would not be in AB&#8217;s interests to meet with the judge because she was becoming increasingly anxious about the number of professionals who were coming to see her and asking her what her views were. She did not want to speak to any one further even if that was the judge who was to make the decision. The position was agreed that no specific arrangements would be made but it would be left open should circumstances change during the hearing or before the order was made. The fragile nature of both her physical health and her psychological health were important matters to be taken into account. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court made an order for two independent expert reports; from a cardiac surgeon and from a consultant psychiatrist with expertise in learning disability. I have heard evidence from Mr McGoldrick and from Dr Matthews, both of whom filed helpful and comprehensive reports. Additionally I have heard from Dr K, the consultant cardiac anaesthetist, who will look after AB if the operation takes place and from Dr M, who is AB&#8217;s responsible clinician, each of whom had filed statement evidence. The evidence was explored fairly but economically and with a proper focus on how the court could be assisted to make the very difficult decision about AB&#8217;s future medical care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AB&#8217;s Independent Mental Capacity Advocate was present for the hearing but did not make any oral representations. AB&#8217;s parents are both alive and in recent years have been able to resume a relationship with their daughter through her mother visiting her and telephone contact with her father. Her mother filed a letter which explains fully the difficulties they feel they are placed in. Understandably they are concerned about AB&#8217;s health and also about the impact of an operation on AB which they feel she would find very stressful. They want the best outcome for her whatever that may be and take a position of sophisticated neutrality. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Health Board accept the medical evidence that AB lacks capacity to make decisions about her own medical treatment. Further that the medical need for surgery is clearly made out as the risk of death from the untreated cardiac condition is significant and increasing and can only be properly addressed by elective surgery rather than a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; approach which would mean surgery as a last resort in the event of a rupture of AB&#8217;s aortic aneurism. It is also accepted that there should be dental surgery to remove AB&#8217;s lower teeth before the heart operation takes place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whatever be the strength of the medical evidence, AB is firm and clear that she does not want surgery. Attempts have been made by her treating clinicians and the clinical team around her to explain the benefits of surgery and by Dr Mathews and the representative of the Official Solicitor. AB has understandable fears around the procedure such as not waking up which may be held by a capacitous adult. Equally AB does not want to die but she would rather see what happens without surgery. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014 AB was diagnosed with an aortic dilatation/swelling (aneurism) of 6.8/7cm at the level of the aortic root which is just as the aorta leaves the heart and the aortic valve is leaking blood. It is asymptomatic although AB has had an abnormal heart rhythm and was diagnosed with an abnormal connection between the two main chambers of the heart in her childhood. Mr McGoldrick was of the view that the congenital heart defect was a &#8220;red herring&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a high risk of rupture of the aneurism which would lead to sudden and immediate death with little or no opportunity for emergency surgery and she would be in extreme pain. The hinge point for surgery is an aneurism of 5.5cms because the likelihood of rupture is over 30% with a mortality rate increasing by 15%yearly thereafter. The size of the aorta at the point of the aneurism is now twice the expected dimension and it will get bigger. Eventually it will rupture if it is untreated. The main trigger events are severe exertion or emotional events.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no medical treatment that can be recommended and surgery with a repair of the aneurism and the use of a tissue aortic valve replacement is the treatment of choice. The tissue valve may degenerate over time and could require a second replacement operation in 8-15 years. However there are developing catheter based techniques which may remove the need for further surgery over the next 10 years or so. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If a mechanical valve was used there is a risk of blockage if warfarin is not taken as prescribed to thin the blood. There is a likelihood AB would not be warfarin compliant in the light of her other difficulties. If the valve was to jam, AB would die and there could be fatal consequences for her as a result of uncontrolled bleeding if she had an accident when she was taking warfarin. Mr McGoldrick preferred the prospect of two operations to one operation with warfarin treatment which involved greater risk to AB. The only available medical management which delays rupture but does not cure the problem is to manage blood pressure and stress. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The statistics for mortality are 8-14% for elective composite Aortic Root Replacement which is what is proposed for AB and 35-40% for emergency procedures. However these are based on a cross section of operations and surgeons who may be of differing levels of skill and experience. Generally mortality figures for cardiac surgery are less than 5%.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Aside from general mortality risks, there are possible post operative complications from smoking (AB smokes at least 1 cigarette per hour), possible Infective Endocarditis as a result of AB&#8217;s poor dental hygiene and the extent of the decay in her remaining lower teeth, and the need to prevent active resistance from AB to the necessary monitoring and treatment equipment that will be attached to her. She may require kidney dialysis for a period to help her limited kidney function because of the change in the nature of the blood flow during surgery but it should not last more than a few days. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr McGoldrick did not think it would be possible to get AB to stop smoking in advance of the surgery and it would have to be managed. AB needs to have her remaining teeth removed before her cardiac surgery and he would prefer to see a period of healing to minimise the risk of infection. He described dental sepsis as a real concern.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The current proposal is to have a 5-6 day gap between the dental surgery and the main cardiac operation. AB would remain in hospital as an inpatient during the whole period. The advantage is that this would reduce the need for sedation or anaesthesia on a second occasion to get AB to hospital. However the period is much shorter than the 2-3 weeks envisaged by Mr McGoldrick in his report. I was informed by the advocates that when the plan was discussed with him outside of court he did not express any contrary view. On further enquiry the applicant Board was able to reassure the court that there would be a senior dental clinician available during this period to monitor the state of healing from the dental surgery and the presence of any possible infection. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;------ The reasons identified by Mr Moon and Miss Street are as follows : (1) The prohibition on making an order which authorises the person being deprived of his liberty is expressly restricted to the Court of Protection exercising its statutory jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> and is not , but could have been extended to the High Court exercising its inherent jurisdiction.(2)Following McFarlane LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">In Re L, </span>the clear implication is that Parliament did not intend to prevent the High Court exercising its jurisdiction to make an order in the best interests and in order to uphold the article 2 rights of a person lacking capacity in the circumstances of a case such as this . (3) Furthermore Parliament cannot have intended to remove the safety net from a person lacking capacity who requires the orders sought to be made in order to prevent his death. (4) The relevant concept is his ineligibility to be &#8220;deprived by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref>: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref>A(1) and paragraph 2 of Schedule 1A . (5) If a person is ineligible to be deprived of his liberty by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref>A provides that &#8220;the court may not include in a welfare order provision which authorises the person to be deprived of his liberty &#8220;.In this provision: (a) &#8220;The court&#8221; means the Court of Protection; and (b) &#8220;the welfare order&#8221; means an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/16/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16(2)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> by the Court of Protection. I agree with those submissions. &#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 96 he confirms the existence of the inherent jurisdiction and refers to the possibility of clarification of the interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/16" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 16</ref>A by the courts. No authority which offers a different interpretation and which has been decided subsequently to the decision of Baker J has been drawn to my attention. Therefore I approach this case on an identical basis as to the existence of the inherent jurisdiction. As indicated above this is an agreed position between the advocates. </p>

Otherwise a person in need of a protective decision would be at risk of being treated less favourably than any other person. </p>

In addition there is a real measure of urgency because of the immediate risk to her health and life. Sadly, AB has been experiencing her psychological difficulties for most of the last 15 years based on Dr Matthews&#8217; evaluation of her clinical records (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 3</ref> pp83-90).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AB&#8217;s participation in the proceedings has been recognised as an important factor in the management of the case. A combination of her own expressed wishes and consideration of the impact on her physical and psychological health of taking part in the hearing or meeting with the judge has meant that her participation has been indirect. She met with Mr McGoldrick and Dr Matthews as well as the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative. I have through them as accurate a picture of AB and her wishes and feelings about the possibility of surgery as is possible in the circumstances.</p>

She knows that she was told that she had a heart problem when she was younger and nothing has happened to her as a result of that (her Ventricular Septal Defect). She is right about that but her major medical problem has a different cause, namely the swelling in the aorta and the leaking aortic valve. She does not agree that she has a problem with her heart that needs to be treated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical evidence is uncontroversial and powerful. The only treatment for this heart defect is surgery. Without surgery there is an increasing likelihood of rupture and almost instantaneous death. She is beyond the hinge point when surgery is necessary and she is fortunate that this has not happened already. Over 30% of patients who have not had surgery die by the time that the aneurism has reached 5.5cm with most having died within 5 years after the hinge point. There are mortality risks in surgery but they are far less than the risk of AB dying as a result of a rupture of the aneurism. AB&#8217;s individual risks because her kidney and smoking needs can be dealt with clinically.</p>

This included the potential impact on AB of living with the consequences of having something done to her which she does want and the reminder of having an operation scar. Her clinical team consider that AB&#8217;s concrete thinking will be protective in the longer term. </p>

On the issue of continuing medication for her heart, AB been used to taking other forms of medication for many years with greater or lesser success depending on her situation at the time. It is likely that any additional treatment in the longer term can be managed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court recognises that imposing two unwanted surgical procedures on AB, one of which is serious and accompanied by risks in itself undermines her personal autonomy over her own body and is therefore a very serious step and only to be taken where it is necessary in her own interests. This is not a case in which the proposed course of medical treatment is merely desirable or would make AB&#8217;s day to day life easier. She is at risk of dying if she does not undergo this particular cardiac surgery and the necessary pre &#8211; operation dental extractions. Any further restriction of her liberty during the two surgeries and the pre and post operative processes is also necessary and in AB&#8217;s best interests. </p>
