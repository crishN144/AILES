Such permission was given simply from a practical point of view to enable me to consider the additional bank statements which were attached to that statement. Since the Husband indicated he had already provided a full response in correspondence so that the statement had already been considered - there was no prejudice in admitting it.  I do stress, however when it comes the inevitable argument on costs I would not have been minded to let this in otherwise and certainly not simply to allow the Wife to expand on the issues with regard to the breakdown of the marriage and the Children Act proceedings.</p>

The applications in respect of the judicial separation and divorce petitions and the cross applications for financial relief were scheduled for a hearing in Malaysia which took place before Judge Peters on 7 February 2023. I will set out the details of the financial terms of the Order later but effectively Orders were made in similar, and for all intents and purposes, identical or mirror terms as to the financial provision in both the petitions for judicial separation and the divorce.</p>

Also, that her earlier involvement had given her every opportunity to engage with the process. He submits that by the time of the hearing the issue of the children&#8217;s residence had been conceded so that the Wife would have had nothing to fear by returning.

This surely must have been the logic in ensuring that the order contained the indemnity by the Wife as to the obligation to the parents. There would have been no need for such an indemnity had the matrimonial Order had finally compromised their claim. The fact that the references to such a specific sum seems to suggest that the Husband had had some mechanism for satisfying himself at least as to the amount due but if the Wife&#8217;s parents are unhappy then, from all documents I have seen they will be able to continue with their civil claim and the Wife will then indemnify.</p>
