That was initiated by the mother on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2012 in Poland and accepted by the Polish Ministry of Justice some four months later on the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March of this year. It was finally transmitted to the English Central Authority on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May and brought before the Courts on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June for emergency relief.</p>

The application was issued as I have indicated on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On that day also Mr. Justice Jackson refused an invitation to set up the trial dates for the two issues putting both matters over to this hearing. In her closing submissions, Miss Jacqueline Renton, Counsel for the mother, pointed out that a consequence of that order was that much time and endeavour, as well as considerable sums of mostly, but not exclusively, public money, had been spent in preparing for a hearing which might never take place, as indeed will occur here if I rule on the issue of enforcement in favour of the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">She therefore asked me to consider giving guidance on this issue which has not, so far as she is aware, been the subject of any published views by my brothers and sisters or the Court of Appeal.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I have thought about her invitation but am of the clear view that such matters as severance are essentially matters for the discretion of the Directions Judge in each case and are not appropriate for general guidance. As long as Judges and Advocates are alive to the cost (in every sense) implications of rolling the two issues up into one hearing, or separating them, the issue can conveniently be left to be considered at the case management hearings, the earlier the better.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">There is no Annexe II certificate provided in this case as required by Articles 37(1)(b) and 39 of the Regulations. Is this fatal? Not necessarily, for Article 39(1) of the Regulations allows for judicial discretion so that I can set a time for their production, accept equivalent documents, or consider that I have sufficient evidence to dispense with their production. I have in this case in my view an abundance of information mostly emanating from litigation in Poland. For my part I see no reason not to exercise my discretion under Article 38(1) and do without the Annexe II certificate.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">One effect of the Annexe II certificate, where it exists, is that it provides some basic information about the Court, the parties, for example, their identities and contact details; whether or not the judgment is the subject of the procedure has been served on the person against whom enforcement has been sought, etcetera. Of particular note is that the certificate also provides in paragraph 9 attestation of enforceability and service imposes the question whether or not the Judgment is enforceable according to the law of the member state of origin.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">If such a statement by way of Annexe II is supplied duly completed that is the end of the argument so far as recognition is concerned subject to two points. The first is relevant to England and Wales and other United Kingdom Courts with which I am more concerned. By Article 28(2) the Judgment needs to be registered. See also the <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2955" canonical="S.I. 2010/2955" type="legislation">Family Procedure Rules 2010</ref>, Rule 31.8 and 31.11. Here it was so registered on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July of this year by District Judge Gordon- Saker. The father has two months to appeal the decision to register, but has not to me indicated through Counsel any intention so to do. I have also heard no argument suggesting he has any grounds so to do either.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The second point is that in this case it is argued that by virtue of Article 23(a) and (b) of the Regulation the Judgment should not be recognised. The two relevant subparagraphs read as follows:</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;(a) If such recognition is manifestly contrary to the public policy of the Member State in which recognition is sought taking into account the best interests of the child or (b) if it was given, except in cases of urgency, without the child having been given an opportunity to be heard in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of the Member State in which recognition is sought.&#8221;</p>

They were never married. As I have indicated earlier, &#8220;B&#8221; was born on the [a date in] 2005. There was much travelling backwards and forwards between England and Poland which does not matter for the purposes of this Judgment. It is said that the parents of &#8220;B&#8221; had business interests here and also rented homes. It appears from the documentation I have seen that both parties would have agreed, had they given evidence, which was not needed, that the relationship was a stormy one and from time to time there were separations of one sort or another and in whichever country they were based at any one time there were visits, not infrequently, from the local police forces because of domestic difficulties between them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.00in;text-indent:-0.50in">ii)<marker name="tab"/>In December 2008 the parties separated and on that occasion the mother and &#8220;B&#8221; left England returning to Poland. In April 2009 the father obtained an ex parte contact order in Poland providing for him to have contact in Poland one weekend in four. The documents suggest that he was not particularly vigorous in keeping up with that permission, although I make no findings of a formal nature in that respect. In June 2009 the mother applied to the Court to vary that contact order. In September 2009 that application was refused and the Polish order for one weekend in four in favour of the father was sustained. Again, the mother suggests that the father, despite all this endeavour, did not take up the full measure of what was ordered. There were clearly between them, on both accounts, difficulties in the ensuing months. </p>

There had been an altercation, the mother says involving violence to her, at the nursery attended by &#8220;B&#8221;. At some stage the police were called and although those parents were due to attend upon the police later that day the mother says &#8211; and there is no serious disagreement to this &#8211; that the father drove away with his partner, with whom he still lives, taking &#8220;B&#8221; with him. I need not make formal findings in respect of each and every aspect of that day. Indeed, without hearing live evidence &#8211; and again I emphasise it was not needed for the purposes of consideration of the Regulation &#8211; it would be difficult so to do, but I have a flavour of it in one of the Judgments at the Polish Court. It is dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012 and it refers amongst other things to a judicial finding in that jurisdiction that the mother had multiple injuries after the events at the nursery suggesting by way of corroboration of her account that she was indeed the subject of violence. </p>

Just prior to that hearing, on the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, the mother had her last sighting, until very recently, of her little boy. The evidence suggests that he was at the home of the paternal grandparents when the police attended with the mother in order to see her son. The grandparents held the little boy up to the window. Thus, her last sighting of him at that time was through the glass. I can only imagine what it must have felt like for both child and mother.</p>

The mother was granted an interim residence order in respect of &#8220;B&#8221; and I am told in the chronology, although I have seen no supporting document that I can recollect in this morass of paper, there was an order of security that was issued which was in effect a warrant for the return of the child to the mother.</p>

The father did not comply with that order to return, just as he had failed to comply with the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September order. In recent documents the father suggests, although there is no objective proof of this, that he brought &#8220;B&#8221; into England in the footwell of his car. He accepts that he did not have the consent of the mother. Indeed, she did not even know of this flight. For my part I am quite unable on the material before me to determine whether indeed he came at that time or not, but happily that does not fall for consideration at this hearing.</p>

It was almost a year before the next event when, on the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2011, the District Court of Wroclaw removed the father&#8217;s parental responsibility and dismissed his application to remove the mother&#8217;s parental responsibility.</p>

He had not attended one in England prior to that time after his father had taken him in April 2010. On the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012 the father&#8217;s appeal against the order of the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October of the previous year, striking out his parental authority, was dismissed. In April of last year a criminal investigation into the father&#8217;s actions was initiated after a further complaint by the mother. On the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April the mother was informed by the Polish prosecutor that &#8220;B&#8221; was no longer in Poland and therefore the criminal investigation was ceasing. On the 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May the mother contacted the London Metropolitan Police who were unable to locate either father or child in England. On the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July of last year the mother appealed against the decision of the Polish prosecutor not to pursue criminal proceedings against the father. It is not clear to me whether the arrest warrant for him &#8211; for there is indeed one issued in Poland &#8211; arose from that occasion or some other time. The short point is that I am informed that that warrant remains extant.</p>

Both parties were legally represented. Although the order was for interim residence a Guardian (what I suspect in this jurisdiction would be called the Family Court Reporter rather than a Guardian representing the child with full party status) made some essential preliminary welfare enquiries and made recommendations to the Court. The order was duly made in favour of the mother. The father&#8217;s cross-application for interim residence was refused. The father had 14 days to appeal. He did not do so. It should be noted that he was both able and permitted to litigate these issues even though he had the child in hiding. He continued to keep &#8220;B&#8221;, as I have mentioned earlier, quite unlawfully, despite the orders for him to hand the child over to the mother.</p>

I can start with <span style="font-style:italic">Krombach v Bamberski</span> (citation as above) where the CJEU had to consider Article 27(1) of the original Brussels Convention which provides, &#8216;A judgment shall not be recognised if such recognition is contrary to public policy in the state in which recognition is sought&#8217;. It will be noticed that this differs in two respects from Article 23(a) of BIIR. It does not contain the word &#8216;manifestly&#8217; which in BIIR appears immediately before the word &#8216;contrary&#8217; nor unsurprisingly given the subject matter of the earlier convention does it contain the concluding words &#8216;taking into account the best interests of the child&#8217;.</p>

In order for the prohibition of any review of the foreign judgment as to its substance to be observed the infringement would have to constitute a manifest breach of a rule of law regarded as essential in the legal order of the state in which enforcement is sought or a right recognised as being fundamental within that legal order.&#8221;</p>

Whilst there may be some difficulties in enforcement they do not individually, nor collectively, cross the very high hurdle set by the regulation and the authorities referred to above. I am reinforced in that view by the information that not only have both parties continued to litigate these issues in Poland over the years, they each also have lawyers ready to bring any necessary applications before those Courts. For example, any application arising from the consequences of enforcement including, but not limited to, application by the father for permission to permanently relocate &#8220;B&#8221; back to England, and/or to determine contact issues, for it would be na&#239;ve of me to assume that for the foreseeable future this mother and father will be able to agree on such issues between themselves.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The question arose because in passing in a paragraph of Miss Renton&#8217;s skeleton argument No. 2 there was some reference to the &#8220;timing and way in which the child is handed over&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Miss Renton nevertheless overnight carried out further indefatigable researches into the Court&#8217;s powers, if any, to make such orders. The issue has not been argued by any other Counsel before me, nor indeed I think put forward as something I must decide, although again there is said to be a paucity of decision on the subject. But in the light of the new planning for a return it becomes wholly irrelevant to me to give any views, and I decline to do so save for a very provisional view that in such cases orders are unlikely to fall in my judgment within the terms of the Regulation, and in particular Article 20. </p>
