However, since October 2019, the father has accepted that the children will remain living with their mother in England. In May 2019, this court accepted jurisdiction with respect to the children who were made Wards of Court in July 2019.

In the intervening period the court has undertaken two substantial and entirely distinct fact-finding hearings. The first related to the mother&#8217;s time in Dubai but included findings with respect to the father&#8217;s conduct in relation to two of his older children, Sheikha Shamsa and Sheikha Latifa. The second fact-finding investigation, over a year later, related to the deployment of highly sophisticated hacking software in order to infiltrate the mobile telephones of the mother, key members of her security staff, and two of the partners in the solicitor&#8217;s firm acting for her in these proceedings.</p>

Although the proposed property purchase was abandoned, the court imposed a substantial exclusion zone around the mother&#8217;s homes in London and Berkshire preventing, amongst other activities, the purchase or renting of property;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to the substance of the issues before the court, it is necessary to describe the unusual context within which these proceedings generally, and this welfare hearing in particular, have been conducted. In short terms, the father as an individual has played no part whatsoever in the process. He last filed a statement in the wardship proceedings in November 2019. The content of that statement related largely to the fact-finding issues, and it has not been referred to during the present hearing. The court has, on a number of occasions, encouraged the father to engage directly with the court process, and with me as the judge charged with determining the issues regarding the welfare of his two children, in some manner which falls short of giving formal evidence and being open to cross-examination. These requests have been politely, but flatly, turned down. It follows that His Highness has neither attended nor played any direct part whatsoever in the many court hearings that have taken place during the past two and a half years. The process has been conducted entirely by English lawyers acting upon his behalf. Through position statements and oral submissions the court has simply been told of the father&#8217;s instructions on the various issues that have from time to time arisen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fortunately, the father has engaged more directly with the children&#8217;s guardian. The guardian initially appointed for the children was Mr John Power. In October 2019, Mr Power spoke to the father and, subsequently, met him in Dubai (together with the children&#8217;s solicitor Ms Melanie Carew). Unfortunately, it was necessary to replace Mr Power, who had left Cafcass, and, in September 2020 Ms Lynn Magson was appointed as the children&#8217;s guardian in his place. In November 2021, Ms Magson, again with Ms Carew, visited Dubai and met the father.</p>

Thus, evidence which had been filed by two nannies, who had participated in the care of the children when they had lived in Dubai, have not been referred to and neither has the evidence of a security expert who gave advice on possible venues at which the father might meet the children in secure circumstances.</p>

The purpose of the meeting was solely for the children to meet the judge. Both children understood that they had expressed their wishes and feelings to the children&#8217;s guardian who, in turn, had reported on them fully to the court. My meeting with the children, who were accompanied by the guardian and Ms Carew, was therefore conducted in the most general terms. </p>

Whilst the father accepts that the mother should have unilateral responsibility for &#8220;routine&#8221; matters of this nature, he objects to the mother being able to unilaterally consent to psychological or therapeutic assessment or to treatment or surgery. He seeks an order directing that the father&#8217;s consent is required for any of these categories of intervention. It is agreed that the mother will provide the father with reports about the children arising from any significant consultations, subject to any necessary redactions.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is necessary to maintain focus upon the unusual factual background to this application. The father is an individual of immense wealth, political power and international influence. The findings of fact made in December 2019 demonstrate the manner in which he is prepared to use his position to impose his will on family members when he considers that it is right to do so. The findings with respect to the abduction of two of his adult daughters, one from England and one in international waters off the coast of India, demonstrate his ability to act and to do so irrespective of domestic criminal law.&#8221; (Non-molestation judgment &#8211; 9 December 2020 &#8211; <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2020/3305" uk:canonical="[2020] EWHC 3305 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWHC 3305 (Fam)</ref>, para. 48)</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Having stated my conclusions on these factual matters, the focus of the court will, at last, turn fully to the welfare of the two children. In this context, I note that in a position statement dated 2 October 2020 the father stated that &#8220;it is hard to see how the hacking allegations make a substantial difference&#8221; to the issue of the father&#8217;s contact with the children. The Court will return to this aspect in detail at the welfare hearing, but to assist the father at this stage I wish to make it plain that I regard the findings I have now made to be of the utmost seriousness in the context of the children&#8217;s welfare. They may well have a profound impact upon the ability of the mother and of the court to trust him with any but the most minimal secure arrangements for contact with his children in the future.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">It does not take long to contemplate just how an individual would react to discovering that their personal phone, and those upon whom they rely for confidential advice, support and protection, have been infiltrated by the most sophisticated software that is available, and to know that a very substantial amount of personal data has been stolen, yet not knowing precisely what. It is often said that the most important thing that a house-burglar steals is the peace of mind of the householder. The same must surely be true of phone hacking.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The Court has, on many occasions, stressed to the father since the start of these proceedings that the most important goal should be to build up &#8216;trust&#8217;, so that the mother and the court, and indeed the children, can trust him &#8211; in particular trust him not to take unilateral action to remove the children from their mother&#8217;s care. The findings made in this judgment prove that he has behaved in a manner which will do the opposite of building trust. The findings represent a total abuse of trust, indeed an abuse of power, to a significant extent. It is an abuse which has been compounded by the manner in which the father has contested these allegations and instructed his lawyers&#8230; . At no stage has the father offered any sign of concern for the mother, who is caring for their children, on the basis that her phones have been hacked and her security infiltrated. Instead he has marshalled a formidable forensic team to challenge the findings sought by the mother and to fight the case against her on every point. It is of course the right of a litigant to contest proceedings as they see fit, but to do so may not be without consequences for the relationships of trust and mutual understanding that the court has been keen at all stages to see developing.&#8221; (paragraphs 172 &#8211; 174)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From these short references, and from the detail within the judgments from which they are taken, the overall context within which the welfare decisions now fall to be taken could not be more clear. It is one in which the father has consistently displayed coercive and controlling behaviour with respect to those members of his family who he regards as behaving contrary to his will. Given his immense power and wealth, the potential for the father, and those in Dubai who do his bidding, to act remorselessly against the interests of the mother has been proved during these proceedings in three entirely separate contexts. In addition the manner in which the mother has had to face a very substantial and most expert legal team, who have been instructed to contest these matters in every legitimate manner, both at first instance and on appeal, over two and a half years, is in itself a manifestation of the same desire to coerce and control her.</p>

There is no evidence to the contrary.

Part of the equation necessary to determine the mother&#8217;s suitability to act on her own as the parent with responsibility for all issues of health, psychological well-being and education must be to question whether she can be trusted to do what is necessary and right in all such circumstances for each of the two children. Fortunately for the children, the answer to that question, in my view, is clear. Indeed, there is no evidence to the contrary. It is very difficult to contemplate that Her Royal Highness would do anything other than diligently investigate the needs of one or other of the children, should circumstances require that, and then, after consideration, choose the best way forward in those circumstances.</p>

Despite that positive development, in a case that has been otherwise so hotly contested, Mr Geekie points to what then followed in terms of correspondence between the parents&#8217; respective solicitors. The father&#8217;s consent had been given before the end of 2019. Mr Geekie, however, took the court to the solicitors&#8217; correspondence, relating to the medical procedure [redacted] (which took place in early February 2020) with letters passing between the solicitors on the topic until April 2020. The procedure [redacted] had been undertaken without difficulty and the child [redacted] recovered well, yet solicitors acting on the father&#8217;s instructions continued to press for details of the procedure and for redactions that had been made to the short medical report for security reasons to be removed.

His Highness&#8217; behaviour towards the mother, in each of its separate manifestations, whether by threats, poems, coordinating press reports, covertly arranging to purchase property immediately overlooking hers, phone-hacking or in the conduct of this litigation, has been abusive to a high, indeed exorbitant, degree.

Although the highly negative impact of his behaviour upon Her Royal Highness, who has the responsibility of caring for their children, has been well documented in her court statements and elsewhere, there has been not one word of apology to, or sympathy for, her. Equally, on behalf of the father, there has not been any acknowledgement, or even any reference to, the success that the mother has made of the most difficult task of bringing the children up in their present circumstances. Despite the most positive description that the children&#8217;s guardian (whom the father praises for her work) gives of all aspects of the children&#8217;s care and upbringing, the most that is said by the father, through his leading counsel, are the grudging words of Lord Pannick that he would not be making submissions to dispute the credit that is due to the mother.</p>

Although it was normal for the children and the mother to visit England, she made it clear soon after arrival that she and the children would not be returning to Dubai. Since then she has stood up to him as best she can, both within these legal proceedings and no doubt in other ways.

It will have totally dominated her thoughts, taken away her peace of mind and removed from her any sense of autonomy.

The need for security and to live their lives in restricted circumstances will continue to be required. But the children are being harmed by the degree to which their mother is compromised emotionally and in terms of the time and focus she has been able to give to them because of the need to engage with all of the issues that have preoccupied her these last three years, and by the impact that the need constantly to engage with the demands of this court process has had on her. The harm to the children from all of these factors will, I am clear, continue if she is, in the future, required to communicate with His Highness to gain his approval for matters, even serious matters, relating to the children&#8217;s health, education or psychological wellbeing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further aspect which is of real concern to this court is the fact that, since the very start of these lengthy proceedings, and at a number of key stages in their progress, I have stressed the need for the father to do what he could do to increase the ability of the mother and the court, and the children, to trust him to behave in a benevolent manner and to build bridges. Trust has, as it is in many family cases, been at the very centre of this case. Despite the very clear understanding that the father must have had of what was necessary to rebuild the relationship that he had with his children, and the relationship that he must continue to have with their mother in order to share in the joint task of parenting, his actions have been entirely to the contrary. The covert property purchase and the astonishingly intrusive and abusive action in hacking her telephone and those of her staff and principal solicitors were carried out in the very lead up to the court&#8217;s planned hearing on the issue of welfare. If any bridges were being built, and there was no sign that they were, each of these two episodes on its own would have obliterated them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The result is that the co-parenting relationship between these two intelligent and valuable parents is entirely bankrupt. There is no communication between them, other than via remorseless legal correspondence or during court hearings. They cannot even agree on who might be an intermediary who could act as a channel of communication in the absence of solicitors. Instructions given by the father to his legal team are so proscribed that not one word is said by them even to acknowledge Her Royal Highness&#8217; role as the children&#8217;s mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept in full the mother&#8217;s evidence of the impact that this remorseless and unremitting behaviour, which has now gone on for nearly three years, has had on her. She simply cannot contemplate any prospect of sharing parental responsibility for any aspect of the children&#8217;s medical or educational care with their father. She needs time out, time away from all of the business of litigation and all of the stress that it has generated. Based on her experience of sharing responsibility even for the modest decisions that have been taken jointly during this time, and noting that in fact His Highness was not in dispute about her choices once he had become involved, she sees the whole experience, embellished and drawn out as it was by those acting on his behalf, in a wholly negative light. As I have said, I accept her evidence, which was unchallenged, and it is on that basis, as well as my own overall view of the case, that I make my decision, which is to accede to her request to be given sole responsibility for determining all issues relating to the children&#8217;s medical care and schooling in the terms that I set out at paragraph 20. It is agreed that the mother will keep the father informed of any significant matters that arise with respect to the children&#8217;s welfare and I am satisfied that she will do so, just as she has done in the past.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The decision to afford the mother sole responsibility for these important matters is justified by the need to reduce the potential for continuing harm to the children. It is very much in their interests for the balance to be recalibrated and for their mother to feel that she now has enhanced autonomy as a parent and that this will be protected by a court order. This step will reduce the potential for the children to be harmed by the impact on their mother from the need to be involved with their father, and it will enhance her ability, as their primary carer, to concentrate on them and their immediate needs.</p>

I trust the mother to inform the father if serious circumstances of that nature were to arise, but, in any event, she is in agreement with a requirement in the court&#8217;s order that she would give him immediate notice of any serious medical condition or injury relating to the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as indirect contact is concerned, by the end of the hearing it was apparent that any supposed dispute was not one of substance. In Dubai, the father told the guardian that he was happy with the calls as they were. The idea that there might be change seems to have arisen from a misunderstanding generated from Ms Fottrell&#8217;s position statement, and not something that the father was separately wishing to pursue. In closing submissions, Ms Fottrell clarified the position to the effect that the guardian did not support a change in the current arrangements. In any event, there is no evidence that there is anything about the arrangements which is contrary to the children&#8217;s welfare or otherwise impracticable; in short the need for any change is not made out.</p>

He is the father of two fine children, neither of whom is shy, and each of whom has much of interest to speak about. As the guardian says, they are children to be proud of. The time for building bridges is not over; in some sense it may now begin, or at least begin from firmer foundations without the ongoing tension of the court process. It is my earnest hope that these children will continue their relationship with their father through indirect contact and that this will over time develop.</p>
