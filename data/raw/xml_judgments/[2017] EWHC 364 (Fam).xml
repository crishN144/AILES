The application for a Care Order was first issued on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background which led to the initiation of proceedings is uncontroversial.  On 9th October 2014 (3 weeks prior to R&#8217;s birth) the mother (M) tested positive for amphetamines. On 15th November 2015 the mother left R in the care of the maternal grandmother.  The mother whilst socialising took the illicit drug GBH and as a consequence was unable to walk.  She was returned to her hostel by builders who had found her slouched in the car park outside.  On 7th December 2014 the police attended the mother&#8217;s home to undertake a welfare check. The mother admitted that she had taken a legal high called &#8216;G&#8217; the night before, notwithstanding that R was in her sole care.  On 8th December 2014 the local authority received a referral raising concerns about the mother&#8217;s drug use.  They responded by commencing an assessment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before the assessment was completed the local authority applied for an Emergency Protection Order in respect of the child on 30th January 2015, this followed his removal from his mother&#8217;s care pursuant to police protective powers, on 29th January 2015.  On that day the mother had used the drug GHB whilst caring for R.  Whilst under the influence of the drug she took him to the local shop to buy cigarettes.  She was seen to be &#8216;staggering around&#8217; with R in her arms.  He was seen to fall from her arms and slide down the shop counter onto his head.  A member of the public flagged down a passing police van.  On arrival of the police the mother was sitting in a chair outside the shop and R was seen drooped over his mother&#8217;s arm, with his &#8216;head a couple of inches away from the pavement&#8217;.  The mother was leaning forward, shaking slightly with &#8216;her body swaying from side to side&#8217;.  She was not able to speak or sit up straight in a chair.  The police immediately removed R from his mother.  The mother was unresponsive and could not be roused until the ambulance service administered medication, &#8216;Narcan&#8217;, to block the effect of opioids and reverse an overdose.  The mother was arrested by the police and accepted that she had taken GHB at 10.30am that morning, that being approximately 1 &#189; hours before the police arrived at the scene.  The mother received a police caution for the offence of child neglect and later that day R was made subject to police protection.</p>

At the first hearing of the matter on 2nd March 2015 the mother conceded that the interim threshold criteria were met and did not oppose the local authority&#8217;s application for an Interim Care Order, under which regime R remained in foster care.  The timetable for R contemplated proceedings being completed by 24th August 2015.  At this stage the mother appeared to be fully engaging with the FDAC process, she was attending a weekly drugs service called IDASS and attending NA (Narcotics Anonymous) daily.  A system of weekly oral swabs/urine tests for drugs along side hair strand testing, intensive substance misuse treatment and psychological treatment were proposed by FDAC and agreed by the mother.  The mother accepted she had a long, chronic history of drug misuse.</p>

The results indicated the reducing presence of crystal meth and a cocaine metabolite. FDAC analysed the results as either being capable of being consistent with the mother&#8217;s self reporting that she last used drugs at the end of January 2015 or capable of representing on-going crystal meth use between December 2014 and March/April 2015.  FDAC concluded that the mother&#8217;s self-reporting was the more likely explanation in light of her positive engagement in services.</p>

That same day the latest hair strand drug results were made available and upon the mother&#8217;s application an expert report was prepared by Mr Stephen Ramsay based at Alere Toxicology in respect of the results.  The results support M&#8217;s use of methamphetamine, from the middle of June to middle of September 2015; consistent with the mother using cocaine from the middle of June to the middle of August 2015 and; supportive of the mother using MDMA between the middle of June and the middle of July 2015.  Upon receipt of the test results the mother denied any illicit drug use since the end of January 2015 and disclosed to Tim Quinn from FDAC that she had met with DS at his home on 22nd June 2015 and that she had seen a meth pipe and believed he must have spiked her drink.  The mother later disclosed she had been meeting with DS for casual sexual encounters.  This was despite FDAC identifying him in clear and unambiguous terms to the mother as a real threat to her continued abstinence from drugs.  The mother accepts that she met with DS the very morning that R was returned to her care and again 9 days later.</p>

Accordingly, at this rehearing, there are two central issues.  Firstly, the determination of the conflicting hair strand analysis.  Secondly, resolution of R&#8217;s welfare interests.  During the course of these proceedings directions have been made for a further hair strand test to be undertaken, on this occasion by Lextox Drug and Alcohol Testing.  In addition, a psychiatric assessment of the mother has been undertaken by Dr Rachael Jones.

Again, this is uncontentious between the experts and so I can summarise the evidence on this point.  In essence, after a drug has entered the body it becomes broken down into compounds, known as metabolites which are derived from the drug itself.  Thus, the &#8216;parent drug&#8217; and its metabolites are both present in the blood stream.  I have been told that as the hair follicle undergoes rapid growth it is provided with a healthy blood supply which, along with sebaceous secretions and sweat, are the main mechanisms by which the drugs and their metabolites are incorporated into the hair.  For convenience, I highlight the summary in the report of Ms Angharad John BSc, for no other reason than it is expressed succinctly.  </p>

This is due to the fact that at any one time approximately 15% of scalp hair is not actively growing. This resting hair can stay on the scalp for approximately 3 - 4 months before being shed. This resting hair would contain drugs that would have entered the hair during the period of drug use (Tsanaclis, 2007).</span></p>

The presence of a metabolite indicates drug usage. When the parent drug is detected but a metabolite is not present, there is no evidence that the drug has been metabolised by the body (Tsanaclis, 2007). Explanations for this finding could be due to low/infrequent usage or passive/environmental contamination.</span></p>

Studies with individuals receiving the same dose showed substantially variable drug concentrations in hair (Henderson, 1993). Therefore, the levels of drug detected in the hair are best used as a guide to changes in use by the individual and not to the amount of drug consumed (Jurado, 2007).&#8221;</span></p>

The video link ultimately failed and the telephone link was barely satisfactory.  By effectively reorganising the courtroom and sitting around a table together with the Judge, the advocates were able to proceed satisfactorily.  Quite why this link did not work has been impossible to discover.  I see every reason why experts from different jurisdictions should be encouraged, particularly where they appear to hold differing views to those that predominate with colleagues in the UK, but it is crucial that they are able to contribute just as effectively as their counterparts here.  For this reason I would be reluctant in future to take video link evidence from an <span style="font-weight:bold">expert </span>overseas, unless the connection had been properly tried and tested from court.

He formed this conclusion on the basis that a cocaine metabolite (here Benzoylecgonine) detected along with the presence of cocaine itself, indicates a result consistent with its use.  In respect of methamphetamine, this was detected in each of the three hair sections.  The metabolite of methamphetamine is amphetamine, this was not detected in the hair tested.  However the concentrations of methamphetamine were so significant, in Dr Ramsey&#8217;s view, as to explain the absence of the expected metabolite.  The breakdown of the &#8216;parent drug&#8217; i.e. methamphetamine, was at such a gradual rate that it was more consistent with a decreasing use of methamphetamine in the relevant time period.</p>

These guidelines are based on research: Cooper, Kronstrand &amp; Kintz Forensic Sci Int 2012.  The Guidelines appear to state that a positive test requires at least two of the following indicators to be present: concentration in the parent drug, greater than the positive cut off level; identification of the metabolite; the presence of some specific minor metabolites, which are highly suggestive of use of the parent drug.  </p>

Both assure me, and I accept, that in cases which involve intermittent use of drugs, their approach is entirely within the parameters of professional consensus here in the UK.  Professor Kintz, who contributed to the writing of the Guidelines and whose views are clearly highly authoritative, considers that the rules are to be interpreted strictly and inflexibly, anything less he considers does not provide strong enough analytical data to establish abuse.  The test results, he considers, &#8216;could&#8217; indicate that the mother had been in an environment where drugs were being used.

The high reading for Benzoylecgonine (0.13ng/mg), i.e. higher than cut off level, plainly requires some explanation.  Firstly, it is agreed that Benzoylecgonine is a major metabolite of cocaine.  Whilst it can be produced outside the body Mr Ramsey reasoned that metabolised Benzoylecgonine can be differentiated from contaminant by considering its concentration.  At a concentration attaining 5% of the parent drug, says Mr Ramsey, that is far more suggestive of metabolisation within the body, thus it follows it was more likely that the cocaine was ingested.  In my judgement Professor Kintz proffered no reasoned response to this.  His report sets out his approach:</p>

I strongly suspect that if all the experts had been together this data would have been considered at the experts meeting.  Of course, part of the difficulty has arisen because of the strict interpretative approach that Professor Kintz has advanced and which has prevented him from engaging fully with the exchange of ideas.  As it happens, his changed conclusions did not require him to abandon his &#8216;strict&#8217; interpretative approach.  Nonetheless, I am quite sure that had he taken a more inquisitive part in the discussions with his colleagues, the raw data would have come to his attention sooner.  As I have said above, none of this is to be taken as discouraging experts from other jurisdictions, but it is intended to emphasise the importance of ensuring that there is proper exchange of information and efficient meetings of experts.</p>

He had opened the case on the alternative basis that if the scientific evidence did not establish illicit ingestion of drugs then the Local Authority considered R should be rehabilitated to the mother&#8217;s care.  I indicated to Ms Morgan that I considered that decision, by the Local Authority, to be premature and that I would proceed to hear the whole of the evidence on the basis that the full range of welfare decisions were to be considered.  Moreover, for the reasons that I have taken some care to explain above, I was not prepared to regard the scientific evidence as determinative until I had the chance to evaluate the mother.  </p>

He has been employed by the London Borough of Islington since October 2005, initially working with unaccompanied asylum seekers and then with looked after children.   I note that he gained a BA degree in social work in 2013.  When he began his evidence I told him that I was rarely attracted to a binary case advanced by Local Authority with such starkly polar alternative outcomes.  Mr Ward told me that he shared my discomfort and had thought carefully about the presentation of the case on this basis.  In particular, he told me that if the Court found the mother had been using illicit drugs in the relevant period, he had initially wondered whether that would necessarily indicate that a plan for adoption was the only outcome here.  </p>

He told me that it had been repeatedly pressed upon M that her boyfriend, DS, was a dangerous relationship for her.  He was a known drug user who had used drugs with her in the past on many occasions.  He was a real threat to her abstinence.  As I have mentioned, at para 20 above, FDAC were particularly concerned as to the lack of insight shown by the mother regarding her relationships with men who themselves use drugs.  This was plainly the focus of many discussions, as well as therapeutic input.  Mr Ward told me that DS had, in his view, no interest in the child but was pre-occupied with M.  This latter point M agreed with.  </p>

However, he felt M was an impulsive personality for whom DS remained alluring, at least for a long time after these proceedings began.  The mother had also attended a support group called Sex &amp; Love Addicts Anonymous, to address her relationships with men more generally.  Mr Ward told me, candidly, that he, whilst determined to be professionally objective,  could not help drawing a link between the re-involvement of DS in M&#8217;s life (however extensively) and the arrival of the positive hair strand tests, as analysed by Mr Ramsey and Ms John.</p>

Mr Ward emphasised that the mother had repeatedly shown herself to be capable of being a thoughtful, loving mother, in the context of contact arrangements where she had frequently anticipated R&#8217;s needs and devised stimulating play.  Mr Ward assessed that the foster carer, to whom R was returned at the breakdown of the rehabilitative plan, was R&#8217;s primary attachment figure.  The mother, to her credit, agreed with this.  I was extremely impressed with Mr Ward.  His analysis of the issues struck me as reflective, measured and open minded.  Within the somewhat strained confines of the case, I thought he had developed a respectful working relationship with M.  I am sure that she would agree.</p>

Her reasoning for this lapse is not easy to distil and, at best, reveals an immaturity of personality for a woman in her mid-thirties.  Essentially, the mother contends that having been wrongly traduced by the emergence of the failed drug tests she determined to demonstrate to the social services &#8216;what a real lapse looks like&#8217;.  </p>

Though the mother was a regular NA attender, she selected a particular group, that she had attended only infrequently.  Despite this limited acquaintance, she said that she was sure that, upon her suggestion, a number in the group would immediately agree to relapse and use drugs with her.  </p>

Not only does it lack any coherence but it is entirely devoid of detail.  The mother may very well have admitted using crystal meth but, in my judgement, she has been far from honest about the circumstances in which she came by it.

Her primary source of drugs at this stage in her life had been DS.  On her own account, even allowing for her conflicting recollection, she had seen DS twice in the late summer of 2015.  I think it likely that it was he who provided the crystal meth in November 2015.  The facts point strongly to this inference and the mother&#8217;s own unconvincing account of how she came by the drug supports it.  When asked directly, in evidence, M denied it. </p>

She told me that she was highly motivated to encourage a father/son relationship and to encourage DS to meet his commitments, at least emotionally.  Again, I find this entirely unconvincing.  Whatever the mother&#8217;s motives might have been that day they were not driven by a concern to meet R&#8217;s interests.  This was her son&#8217;s first day back from foster care. A day in which he would be, inevitably, unsettled, require attention and entitled to expect to be the focus of his mother&#8217;s attention.  A mother who has been consistently observed to meet her child&#8217;s needs so skilfully at the contact sessions would have known that on the first day of her son&#8217;s return home that would be entirely the wrong moment to introduce his father.  I am clear that on that day than the mother was putting her own needs first.  </p>

At the conclusion of the evening, they spent the night, as planned, at a London hotel.  It also needs to be stated, as Mr Ward pointed out, that R (aged 12 months) at this stage did not have a strong relationship with his grandmother, into whose care he had been placed overnight.  It is an understatement to say that the mother was placing herself at risk of relapse.  She was, on my assessment of the evidence, putting herself directly in danger. I emphasise again, she would have understood this very clearly.  Even on her own account therefore, this was risk taking behaviour.  </p>

However, she was up by 7am and returned early to her mother, to resume responsibility for her son.  It struck me that having the full time care of a 12month old baby recently restored to her, coupled with a late night out and an early start, the mother must have been exhausted.  The mother made no mention of feeling tired at all.  Earlier she had told me, in an entirely different context, that when she had taken drugs she could keep going for days without sleep.  </p>

I am also satisfied that she has made some concerted attempts to address her dependency on drugs.  However, I have found everything that she has said concerning DS to be implausible.  He has been inextricably connected to her drug usage.  Ultimately, the connection between the positive drug tests and his role in her life in late summer 2015 is impossible to ignore.  It is the feature that unifies the various strands of the evidence and provides the most rational explanation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should also add that whilst there are many positives to the mother&#8217;s personality I found her to be somewhat uni-dimensional in her outlook.  She was eloquent and articulate in the descriptions of her own life and therapy.  She had a strong sense of herself as a valiant victim of a difficult childhood.  However, she had little sense of her own responsibility for her present predicament.   She was notably less eloquent in talking about R&#8217;s needs.  Indeed, despite being given the opportunity she rarely mentioned them at all.  Notwithstanding Ms Morgan&#8217;s skilful efforts she really found it too painful to acknowledge that, in respect of the presenting incident in this case, R could easily have been killed.  Perhaps it is the very nature of her addiction and her attempt to address it that requires this mother to be so self focused.  R quite simply needs more. He needs a stable, secure family life in which he can develop his potential.    Having spent most of his childhood in foster care, now at 2 years of age, R&#8217;s need for a resolution of these protracted proceedings is pressing.  </p>
