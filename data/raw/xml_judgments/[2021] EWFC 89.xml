Shortly put, it is normally the right date because the economic features of the parties&#8217; marital partnership will have remained alive and entangled up to that point. The fruits of the partnership will not have been divided and distributed. The share of one party in the partnership assets is likely to have been unilaterally traded with by the other. I accept that a different view might be taken in respect of a completely new asset brought into being during the interregnum between separation and trial. But that is not the case here. Here we are concerned with assets acquired pre-separation but worked on during the period up to trial.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

This argument crops up from time to time and is completely untenable. The concept of the sharing of the acquest is predicated on the parties being in an economic partnership. The decision of the judge at trial is to dissolve the partnership and to distribute fairly, which means normally equally, the partnership assets. The idea that a valid claim can be made to share assets which have already been divided and distributed, or to share earnings or profits which have been generated after the dissolution of the partnership, is completely unprincipled. It would be a good thing if this argument were finally to bite the dust.</p>

This sum does not include the cost of renting a home, albeit she told me that she has no wish to purchase one. This claim for periodical payments is wholly unrealistic and unprincipled. The wife is backed by very large sums of discretionary trust money, as I have explained. Her trustees have indicated that they will help her by only lending her money, although I consider that there is a degree of forensic defensiveness in that stance.

It is an elementary principle that a claimant of periodical payments must meet her needs first from her own resources, including her non-marital resources, before a call is made on her ex-husband&#8217;s resources.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;I am asked to dismiss the spousal maintenance order altogether. I am close to doing so but ultimately have held back. Within a matter of months, the elder child will be 18 and either this summer or next would have left secondary education. Within four years so will the daughter. As I&#8217;ve indicated, it&#8217;s rare to find nominal spousal maintenance outside the child dependency context. Unless something very substantial occurs soon, I cannot see any basis upon which the former wife would be able to convert the nominal maintenance order. Another reason for my preparing a written judgement was so that this is available for the future. I don&#8217;t think I should dismiss but I would be very surprised if circumstances justified bringing back to court and they would have to be very significant.&#8221;</p>

By contrast, the husband has incurred costs of &#163;273,000, about &#163;200,000 less than the amount of costs incurred by the wife. The husband points out that the wife&#8217;s figure is likely to be understated. He has seen on joint bank statements numerous payments made by the wife to a forensic accountant, Jeffrey Nedas, amounting to around &#163;45,000. The joint asset schedule records a further &#163;34,800 owing to Mr Nedas. Thus it would appear that the wife has run up a total of approximately &#163;80,000 in such costs. Yet her Form H1 records total disbursements of only &#163;8,262. Presumably these are her share of the fees of joint experts. It would appear therefore that her Form H1 does not include the fees of Mr Nedas. If correct, this is unacceptable. For reasons that are obvious, it is of paramount importance that Form H1 is fully and accurately completed in every case. The statement of truth on it is there for a good reason.</p>

Inevitably, there will be a deficit of knowledge on the wife&#8217;s side which will require many chargeable hours to fill. Experience shows that costs of an applicant wife will always be somewhat more than those of the respondent husband, as the applicant wife has to spend much time in working out what information to ask for and then in analysis of what is received. But, a difference of &#163;281,000 is completely unacceptable. Spending &#163;80,000 on a forensic accountant is inexplicable; the information in this case was always capable of being understood by experienced legal practitioners in this field, as the presentation before me by counsel has demonstrated. Each counsel has been completely on top of the figures and their written and numeric work has been of the highest quality. I make no complaint about the figure of &#163;87,000 for counsel&#8217;s fees recorded on the wife&#8217;s Form H1, or about the figure of &#163;90,770 on the husband&#8217;s.</p>

This is still &#163;131,000 more than the costs incurred by the husband, but that difference is a reflection of the factors I have referred to above. It is at the limit of what is acceptable.</p>

This is his highly personal project, where he intends to spend a great part of his retirement tending to the olive trees planted over 10 hectares. It cannot be disputed that the husband has built a domestic dwelling without authorisation. He hopes eventually to obtain planning consent. The sums that have been spent have exceeded the value of the property. That value has been conscientiously assessed by the SJE on a hybrid basis having regard to the value of agricultural property and domestic property. There is no claim for an add-back of the excess expenditure, and if there were I could not say that the husband&#8217;s conduct in this regard has been wanton. That criterion of wantonness applies whenever it is said that expenditure has been wasted, save in respect of costs which is a special case for these purposes.</p>

She argues that she was disabled from doing so earlier because key disclosure was not made by the husband about the profits from the management company and his consequent investment made into Fund 2 until May 2021. But this did not prevent an FDR taking place in December 2020. Obviously, there was scope for an open negotiation to see if a deal in principle could be done from the moment that the FDR failed. The wife did not need to know the exact future value of the husband&#8217;s carry in Fund 2 in order to make a proposal in respect of it. The proposal would be formulated as a percentage &#8211; which is exactly what she later did.</p>

It proposed that the wife should have no share of carry whatsoever in either fund.

In effect she was arguing that 100% of the husband&#8217;s carry in Fund 1 and 80% of the carry in Fund 2 formed part of the marital acquest, notwithstanding that the lives of those funds stretched respectively for 4&#189; and 6&#189; years into the post-divorce future. It demanded that the Italian property should be sold. And, extraordinarily, given the scale of trust money behind her it proposed that the husband should pay her &#163;235,000 per annum in spousal maintenance indefinitely.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Although the husband&#8217;s offer in respect of the Fund 2 co-invest was about &#163;455,000 less than the present value of the wife&#8217;s half-share, that shortfall is more than matched by his spousal maintenance offer, and by not seeking a costs add-back. These two items represent a transfer of value from the husband to the wife of &#163;475,000. The husband plainly succeeded on the controversy about the Italian property. Although his offer in relation to carry was less than the court awarded he was, at last, certainly firing at the right part of the target. </p>

Views have been expressed that I have snatched away an established right to anonymity in such judgments. This is not so. I do not believe that there is any such right. My personal research tells me that before the 1939 &#8211; 1945 War, and indeed until much more recently, there was no anonymity in the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division (&#8216;PDA&#8217;), children and nullity cases apart, and even then only sometimes. For example, there is no example after 1858 of a first instance judgment in a variation of settlement case being published anonymously until as late as 2005 when <span style="font-style:italic">N v N and F Trust</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2005/2908" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 2908 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 2908 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 FLR 856" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 FLR 856</ref> was reported in that form.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is therefore difficult to understand how the practice arose of routinely anonymising ancillary relief judgments given in the Family Division (the successor to the PDA) or in the Family Court proceeding at High Court judge level. So far as I can tell, it is traceable back to the provisions in the Matrimonial Causes Rules (&#8216;MCR&#8217;) that made the Registrar the usual first instance judge - see for example rule 77(1) of the 1973 rules which stated that &#8220;on or after the filing of a notice in Form 11 or 13 an appointment shall be fixed for the hearing of the application by the Registrar.&#8221; The Registrar always sat in chambers. Rule 78(2) allowed an application to be referred to a judge, and rule 82(2) provided that the hearing of a referred matter &#8220;shall, unless otherwise directed, take place in chambers.&#8221; I believe that the earlier versions of the MCR said the same. It is to this banal provision that all the secrecy that has surrounded financial remedy judgments can probably be traced, although routine anonymisation of first instance judgments does not seem to have taken hold until the 1990s. So far as I can tell, the practice of anonymising judgments given by High Court judges is explicable only by reference to the hearing having been in chambers and behind closed doors. But that of itself would not explain the adoption of the practice as a chambers judgment is not secret and is publishable whether or not anonymised: see <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allan and Another</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 819" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 819</ref> at [24] &#8211; [33], [74], [117] &#8211; [118] and [150].
