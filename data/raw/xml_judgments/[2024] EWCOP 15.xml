It is agreed between the parties that Laura is correctly diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and autistic spectrum disorder. Other diagnoses are subject to disagreement. A reporting restriction/transparency order was made permitting the identification of Laura and her parents. The same order contains an injunction prohibiting reporting of the identity and location of any institution or home where Laura is treated or resides. The injunctions also prohibit the naming of treating clinicians or those who care for Laura<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> The second and third respondents&#8217; counsel&#8217;s position statement served on the morning of day one of the hearing sought to vary the reporting restrictions to provide for no reporting restrictions, which would have permitted the naming of treating staff and the address where Laura resides. I refused to hear such an application without an application supported by evidence properly filed and served. Mr Mahmood accepted this. </p>
	      </authorialNote>. Laura and her parents sought for her to be identified in these proceedings, and Francis J considered this matter carefully, and acceded to that application. There has been reporting of her situation.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">At the conclusion of the evidence (including an address by Laura directly) and after hearing submissions from counsel, I made a remote judicial visit to Laura on the last day of the hearing for the purposes of explaining my decision to her first. I then announced the outcome in open court: namely that Laura lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings and to make decisions about: (i) her residence (including consenting to the deprivation of her liberty in her current placement for the purposes of being treated); (ii) her treatment and care; and (iii) her contact with her parents. Pursuant to section 21A MCA, I extended the standard authorisation of the deprivation of her liberty and listed the matter for a final hearing with a time estimate of two days. I dismissed the purported challenge to the mental capacity requirement of the standard authorisation. I made some interim best interests orders on Laura&#8217;s behalf and further directions. This judgment endeavours to set out my reasons for coming to these conclusions. </p>

Such visits have been conducted with the agreement of the parties, consistently with Laura&#8217;s wish to meet the judge, and have taken place in compliance with the Practice Note on Judicial Visits found at&#160;<a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2022/5.html" title="Link to BAILII version" class="Hyperlink">[2022] EWCOP 5</a>, dated 10 February 2022.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I have been asked to meet with Laura in advance of this hearing. Her solicitor set out a written plan for Laura&#8217;s participation in this hearing. It anticipated I would meet with Laura in advance of this contested three day capacity hearing. I indicated, in an email to the parties sent in advance of the hearing, that whilst I would welcome the parties&#8217; submissions on the issue, my preliminary view was that I would meet with Laura at the conclusion of this stage of the decision making process to explain the outcome and to permit her to engage with the person (me) who is making decisions on her behalf. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I was concerned that there was no directly meaningful purpose to meeting with  Laura in advance of the hearing. It would not be to elicit her wishes and feelings, in a section 4 MCA sense for obvious reasons and I am aware her view is that she has capacity to make the decisions with which this application is concerned. Nor am I carrying out an assessment, formally or informally, of Laura&#8217;s capacity. Instead I am required to read and hear the written and oral evidence on these issues and the apply the law to the evidence to reach determinations. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Not only was there no obvious reason to meet with Laura in advance, I was concerned a judicial visit with Laura may influence my decision making one way or another, based upon my own observations which could not necessarily be fully communicated in her solicitor&#8217;s written note of the meeting. The non-verbal communication and observation undertaken may have provided additional information that would be incapable of being communicated in a written note. Not only is there a risk of unconscious bias; a visit may cause an unfairness to the parties who are deprived of the context and non-verbal communication. Whilst judges are used to hearing evidence and then excluding it, my experience is that a judicial visit can leave a lasting impression. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">In terms of the law, I note that section 4 (4) of the MCA places a duty on the court: "<span style="font-style:italic">so far as reasonably practicable,&#160;</span>[to]<span style="font-style:italic">&#160;permit and encourage&#160;</span>[Laura]<span style="font-style:italic">&#160;to participate, or to improve her ability to participate, as fully as possible in any act done for her and any decision affecting her</span>." However this must be interpreted consistently with the language and purpose of the MCA. Section 4 (4) is set out within section 4 which is concerned with best interests. The heading to section 4 is &#8216;best Interests&#8217;. I consider the qualified duty on the court to ensure Laura&#8217;s participation in these proceedings is principally directed at best interests decision making. Sections 2 and 3 which deal with capacity do not provide for a similar qualified duty. Whilst I accept that the court&#8217;s determination of the capacity issues is a &#8220;decision affecting [Laura]&#8221; the common sense reading of this duty is that it relates to best interests. The Practice Note on Judicial Visits does not envisage judges conducting remote visits to P in respect of contested capacity. That is not to say such visits are prohibited. They are not. However, the decision whether or not, or how, and when, a judicial visit to P should be carried out is a case management decision which should be undertaken consistently with the Court of Protection Rules and in particular in compliance with Rule 1.1 (the over-riding objective) which requires decisions to be made <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia </span>&#8216;justly&#8217; and  by &#8216;having regard to the principles contained in the Act&#8217; which of course includes the qualified section 4 (4) MCA duty). Regard must also be had to Rule 1.2 which deals with the participation of P in the proceedings. This issue was largely dealt with by Cobb J in the normal way at the outset of the proceedings, but I have kept that matter under review. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I also remind myself that in the context of the Family Court<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> See the learning of Peter Jackson LJ (with the agreement of William Davis and Elisabeth Laing LJJ) at paragraph 59 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Child: Ability to Instruct Solicitor)&#160;</span>[2023] EWCA Civ 889.</p>
		<p class="FootnoteText"/>
	      </authorialNote>, there is an increasing focus on the concept that a meeting between a child and a judge is a visit for the child to meet the judge; and not for the judge to meet the child.  There is something of a read-across of this concept into this adult welfare jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, I did not meet Laura (or hear from her in open court) for the purposes of my need to meet her to consider her capacity, or otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I have not overlooked Laura&#8217;s participation in these proceedings which determine decisions affecting her. First, she is a party. Secondly, I have already met her on at least three occasions (each at her request to meet the judge). I have that background firmly in mind. Thirdly, she is represented in these proceeding by experienced solicitors and counsel. Fourthly, I have ensured there is a hybrid link so she is able to follow the hearing from her placement (and I delayed the start of the hearing for around an hour as various technical problems were worked through to ensure Laura could hear and see the proceedings). Fifthly, I determined to meet with Laura to explain my decision, although I emphasise this was for her to meet me to hear the outcome before others.</p>

Laura wanted this opportunity and no party opposed it. She spoke in public with members of the public watching her. She was not daunted by this although I do harbour doubts about the appropriateness of an incapacitated person choosing to address the court from her hospital bed in respect of intimate aspects of her life. As was apparent, whilst she was mostly calm, she appeared distressed before the short adjournment on day three and I quickly rose to provide her with a break. As I communicated to the parties after the adjournment, I was giving active thought, of the court&#8217;s own motion, to making the case management decision to sit in private for the purposes of protecting Laura<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> See CoP Rules Practice Direction 4C at paragraph 2.5 where the &#8220;need to protect P&#8221; is listed as a good reason to sit in private (amongst others). </p>
	      </authorialNote>. I indicated I would hear submissions from the parties and from any member of the public observing before making such a decision. Thankfully, this was unnecessary and Laura presented as calm and collected.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Laura comes from a close knit family. Her mother and father have been married for a long time. Dr Wareham is a consultant intensivist/anaesthetist. Mrs Wareham is a retired nurse. They met on the Isle of Wight, where Dr Wareham was training. They then moved to the north east of England. Then the family lived in Sheffield. There was a further move to Southampton. Then the family moved to Oxford and moved again back to the Isle of Wight. When Laura was sixteen the family moved to Australia. In 2015 the family moved back from Australian to Rotherham. I am told these moves were in furtherance of Dr Wareham&#8217;s medical career. Laura was initially educated in the state sector but moved to an independent special school with a specialism in dyslexia and learning difficulties. When the family moved to the Isle of Wight she went to school, then to a tuition centre and was then home educated and obtained some GCSEs. As part of the background, I note Dr Camden-Smith states: &#8220;[o]<span style="font-style:italic">wing to the family&#8217;s multiple moves and her parents&#8217; reluctance to allow her current treating team to access past records, it has not previously been possible to go through all her notes to develop a clear sense of which diagnoses have been substantiated and which not.</span>&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">For around the last four years Laura has been bed bound for reasons related to her neck which are said to be related to her Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. She considers she is in too much pain to stand. Her treating clinicians do not agree with this.   She is dressed in a hospital gown. She refuses to go to the toilet or use a commode. Laura has been consumed with researching Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and has spent a very significant amount of time researching it and contacting specialists about it. She is reported to have no friends outside of a small circle of people with a shared interest in Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. No mention is made in the written evidence of her having had  significant partner(s) in her life. She has lived with her parents until her admission to hospital in 2022. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Laura is her parents&#8217; second child. Their first child died of sepsis in 2020. Laura was admitted to hospital as an emergency patient in April 2022. She required to be treated in critical care. She was then nursed in the high dependency unit. It follows that at the point of admission to hospital, from her parents&#8217; care, she was extremely ill. It is not necessary to detail the extent of Laura&#8217;s over-medicalisation in the run up to April 2022: not only would it take a very considerable amount of time to do so, it would also publicly provide too much detail. However some context is necessary as it underpins the risks to Laura from her parents&#8217; medical views as to what they think she needs. She was repeatedly being admitted to Leeds General and Doncaster Royal Infirmaries because of complications with &#8216;parenteral nutrition&#8217;. She was receiving large amounts of parenteral antiemetics and antihistamines. When her former GP retired, I am told, from an expert report dated 5 May 2023 in the (nearly 2000 page) bundle, the other GPs in the practice refused to continue to prescribe IV fluids. Clinicians at Leeds General had also withdrawn the intravenous nutrition. For reasons that are not clear, but clearly in a poor state of health, Laura was taken to north Wales. When she was admitted to hospital she was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">on an exceptional amount of parenteral nutrition (x8-9) as well sublingual fentanyl and inhaled methoxyflurane.</span>.&#8221;</p>

They have undertaken MRI scans of her neck which have revealed no injury. Laura considered the scanner is &#8220;inadequate&#8221; and the clinicians interpreting the results are &#8220;unqualified&#8221; and have failed to listen and understand the research that she has carried out.  </p>

I made directions for a hearing to determine Laura&#8217;s discharge from hospital. At a hearing on 13 December 2023  I was in receipt of detailed written evidence in respect of the options for discharge from hospital and the best interests opinions in respect of discharge. Dr and Mrs Wareham, represented through leading counsel, submitted she should be discharged to their home. I determined it was in Laura&#8217;s best interests to be discharged from hospital to a rehabilitation unit as it was less restrictive, but safe. I gave an <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment explaining my reasons in some detail. I extended the standard authorisation until 12 January 2024, on the understanding Laura would be discharged before then. I ordered an increase in contact with her parents including supervised face to face and Christmas contact. I made further directions for the contested capacity hearing.

In terms of residence Dr Camden-Smith framed the options as remaining in hospital or living in her parents&#8217; rented home without a care package. She opined that: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">due to her inability to recognise and understand the realities and practicalities of her circumstances and her inability to use and/or weigh the relevant information to come to a realistic decision. This is fundamentally due to the impairments of her mind associated with her autism.</span>&#8221; In particular Dr Camden-Smith drew from the records and her conversations that Laura failed to understand the difficulties putting together a care package for her; would return without a care package; failed to understand why earlier care packages had failed. Her ideal would be to live in London and see medical specialists although &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">she would be willing to live anywhere else where she could live with her parents and receive the care she believes she should receive</span>&#8221;.</p>

Dr Camden-Smith acknowledges, as not unreasonable, Laura&#8217;s argument that her family circumstances are not &#8216;usual&#8217; and that autism runs in the family. Neurotypical standards should not therefore be applied to them and they function differently. Contact restrictions violate her human rights, believes Laura.  At the bottom of page 14 of her January 2024 report Dr Camden-Smith becomes somewhat distracted into considering best interests decision making, commenting on the need for contact restrictions to protect Laura from her parents. I discount that evidence in my assessment of Laura&#8217;s capacity.  However she is clear Laura is unable to use and/or weigh relevant information to come to a &#8216;realistic&#8217; decision and this is &#8216;fundamentally&#8217; due to her impairments of mind associated with her autism.</p>

We understand that Laura has not been definitively informed of her team&#8217;s working diagnosis, prognosis, specific care plan and treatment goals relating to this, nor reasons for restricted access to others, the telephone, the internet or social media. If this has been explicitly discussed with Laura, what information was she told and was it accessible? If this has not been discussed with Laura explicitly what are the plans to do so?

She said that whilst the opinion set out in the joint report was her understanding at the time, she had since checked her notes and the records. She told me: &#8220;I have more information than I did when I met Dr Eccles. ....I discussed her [Laura] with the treating team&#8230;.a lot of information has been given to Laura about her needs. ..&#8221;. She told me Laura is aware of the findings made by Francis J. She gave evidence that: &#8220;she lacks capacity. It is clear on reflection she has been given the information. She has been able to access it.&#8221; She said there was a difference between &#8220;Laura not knowing and Laura not being told&#8221;.  Ms Power comprehensively took Dr Camden-Smith through each item of the information set out in the joint report that it is said Laura had not been told. Dr Camden-Smith clarified that after checking her notes and looking at records that Laura had been provided with this information. It was clear from her evidence that Laura has been provided with her care plan. In answer to questions from Mr Mahmood, she gave evidence that Laura is &#8220;extremely distressed by the proceedings&#8230;.the longer it goes on the more distressing it is&#8230;.&#8221;. She accepted the term &#8216;opioid dependence&#8217; may not be accurate but said that Laura was dependent on pain relief.  She said that Laura&#8217;s &#8220;ability to understand is incredibly impaired by her autism&#8221;. She repeated that the proceedings are &#8220;counter-therapeutic&#8221; and that Laura is focused on demonstrating her capacity not developing a therapeutic relationship..&#8221;. She said the proceedings were sufficiently traumatic that they &#8220;may very well&#8221; stand in the way of her regaining capacity.&#8221; In answer to questions from Mr Brownhill she said that Laura is &#8220;fixated&#8221; on &#8216;the correct form of treatment&#8217; and &#8216;specialist treatments&#8217;.

These are the kinds of decisions that people with autism, and Ms Wareham in particular, can find more readily accessible. The information is concrete and scientific, there is no nuance, what uncertainty there is can be quantified, and there is a single decision to be made. When it comes to more nebulous decisions with multiple viewpoints and information to be taken into consideration, and where Ms Wareham is required to make decisions about what weight to place on the different components and aspects of the relevant information, it remains my opinion that Ms Wareham lacks capacity. Decisions of this kind are those such as conducting proceedings and making decisions about residence, contact with others, and her medical care and treatment taken as a whole.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">By way of a direction I made in December 2023, the experts were required to attend the Royal Courts of Justice in person to give evidence. I was informed around 10.15 on the second day of the hearing that Dr Eccles planned to give evidence remotely.  No application had been made by Dr and Mrs Wareham to vary the earlier direction made. No proper reason was given to the court. I invited counsels&#8217; submissions. Mr Mahmood invited me to hear from her remotely. I sought to understand why Dr Eccles was giving evidence remotely and whether she had been informed of the December 2023 direction by her instructing solicitors. I was told she had been made aware but that she was busy and had other meetings. Ms Power submitted she was in flagrant breach of a clear direction and she should be required to attend in person later that day. Mr Brownhill submitted the position was unacceptable but left the matter within the ambit of the court&#8217;s case management discretion.  Given the clear evidence from the previous day that the proceedings are distressing for Laura I was focused on resolving the outstanding issues without delay. I was told a link was available and Dr Eccles could join and would clear her diary. It is unacceptable for a direction to be disregarded by an expert for no good reason. There is a real risk that should an expert not attend as directed, they will not be permitted to give oral evidence and as a result less weight will be attached to their evidence. Alternatively, an adjournment may be required, with cost consequences for the expert and/or the instructing party. No public apology was made to Laura or her parents, who had gone to the expense of instructing Dr Eccles. Looking at all the matters in the round and having regard to the over-riding objective contained in the CoP Rules, on this occasion, justice, having regard to Laura&#8217;s welfare, dictated that I vary the earlier direction and permit to Dr Eccles to attend remotely. This was, on balance, necessary.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Dr Eccles was politely and rigorously cross-examined by Ms Power. She accepted this was the first time she had acted as an expert witness, although she had given evidence as a witness of fact before in an inquest. This was the first time she had written an expert report. She had not seen the order of Francis J in which he records  the court had made findings against Dr and Mrs Wareham although she says she was aware of it. She confirmed she did not discuss this with Laura. She accepted she may be wrong in respect of what information Laura has been told. Ms Power sought to establish that Dr Eccles relied too much on what Laura told her without any adequate method of triangulating this information with clinical staff. Dr Eccles said she had discussed matters with staff but accepted her report was very light on the details of any such conversations: she said: &#8220;There is no explicit information about the contents of that interview&#8221;. She challenged Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s reliance on Laura&#8217;s rigidity. She attempted to give examples of Laura holding different opinions in her mind and choosing between them. She said: &#8220;I accept she lacks capacity to conduct the proceedings pending more work being done&#8221;. In respect of decision making about residence, Ms Power established that Dr Eccles accepted that the risks to her from her parents was relevant information that had to be considered. She said in evidence: &#8220;She [Laura] is not fully aware of the risks of contact with her parents&#8221;. She ultimately accepted: &#8220;I can&#8217;t say whether she can use/weigh the relevant information to decide on residence&#8221;. She also said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if she has capacity in respect of care&#8221;. In terms of contact with her parents, Dr Eccles opined that it was not her role to explain why some think she should not have contact with her parents. Dr Eccles was not aware as to whether Laura knew of the reasons why contact restrictions with her parents had been made. I understood her evidence to be that ultimately she would need further information before opining as to whether Laura has capacity to made a decision to have contact with her parents. </p>

I observed at the time that whilst sympathetic to the bereavement and understanding of why this was not provided in the addendum report, this detailed factual information could and should have been provided: (i). in the original report; or (ii) otherwise in a further written report as Dr Eccles stated would take place (a month passing between the addendum report and the hearing). I was not prepared for large swathes of factual information which could and should have been presented in writing in reports to be elicited in oral evidence at the hearing. This would have been unfair to the parties and to the court. Furthermore such a disjointed presentation would have been of limited forensic value and ultimately would have been evidence in respect of which little weight should be attached. It would also have been time consuming and extended the evidence well beyond the reasonable allocated time. It would likely have required the parties to seek further time to obtain instructions in respect of the new factual information.   Experts must set out their core opinions with reasons in their written reports in advance of trial. The purpose of cross-examination is to challenge the written evidence provided. Ms Power accepted this and no counsel suggested such an approach was unfair or wrong. </p>

This led to a capacity assessment being carried out by a registered nurse. The assessor carried out a detailed assessment process, contacting multiple people with knowledge of Laura. The assessment took place on 8 January 2024 after the assessor had taken the trouble to call the ward to ensure an understanding of Laura beforehand to ensure the assessment took place when Laura would be most able to engage. The assessor states all practicable steps were taken to  maximise Laura&#8217;s involvement in the assessment. She found that Laura could not understand relevant information, incorrectly believing she required treatments contrary to the views of the clinicians. Furthermore, she was over-focused on her own &#8216;narrative&#8217; about breaches of human rights law.

I have also been able to meet with Miss Wareham on the 08/01/2024. From this, I have concluded on the balance of probability that Miss Wareham lacks the capacity to make an informed decision regarding her accommodation in hospital and her treatment. This meets the &#8216;functional test&#8217;. Miss Wareham&#8217;s inability to understand, use or weigh up the relevant information is because of her cognitive impairment secondary to episodes of Mania and traits of autistic spectrum disorder. This is considered to meet the &#8216;causative nexus&#8217; of any Mental Capacity Assessment.</p>

None of them evidence Laura&#8217;s capacity in February 2024, although they provide helpful background information. He said in his oral evidence that Laura was kind, empathetic and thoughtful, that she is evidence driven, wants to verify the facts and does not change her mind easily. He strongly believes Laura has capacity. He said that how she processes information is different from the non neuro-diverse but remains valid. He referenced her grasp of current affairs. He told me in answer to a question from Mr Brownhill &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">We don&#8217;t accept we were interfering with Laura&#8217;s care</span>&#8221; </p>

She told me a lot of information, which I briefly summarise. Laura said she was tired and concerned she had an infection. She made reference to paragraph 1.2 of the MCA Code of Practice and said there was an assumption she has capacity whilst all steps are being taken to maximise this and it was necessary to look at the least restrictive options. She wanted a care package at her parents&#8217; home because it would reduce the human rights infringements. In respect of her current placement she was making an application under Article 34 to the European Court of Human Rights for breaches of her Article 2 and 3 rights. Her transfer to the unit had caused harm. She had received poor care. She held religious views. There was a lack of female staff to carry out her care regime.    She was unwell with increased inflammatory markers and wanted antibiotics. She was very concerned about being de-medicalised and raised issues with the General Medical Council obligations on doctors. She disputed some diagnoses made. She said she would not weigh up medical advice if it was &#8220;based upon hearsay&#8221; as this was not &#8220;valid evidence&#8221;. She said she needed facts. She made reference to a lasting power of attorney. She said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I don&#8217;t think my parents were interfering in my care</span>&#8221;. She referenced her current situation as &#8220;dystopian&#8221; and made reference to the &#8216;optional protocols&#8217; of the UN Convention on Disabled People. She had been denied a word processor. She wanted to be &#8220;moved to a place of safety&#8221; so she could demonstrate her capacity. She was most looking forward to having good food when she meets with her parents for her imminent birthday. </p>

Once the correct formulation of "the matter" has been arrived at, it is then that the court moves to identify the "information relevant to the decision" under section 3(1) of the 2005 Act.&#160; That latter task falls, as recognised by Cobb J in&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">Re DD</span>, to be undertaken on the specific facts of the case. Once the information relevant to the decision has been identified, the question for the court is whether P is unable to make a decision in relation to the matter and, if so, whether that inability is because of an impairment of, or a disturbance, in the functioning of the mind or brain.</p>

The remaining provisions of ss 2 and 3, including the specific decision making elements within the decision making process described by s.3(1), were characterised as statutory descriptions and explanations in support of the core provision in s.2(1), which requires any inability to make a decision in relation to the matter to be because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.&#160; Within this context, the Supreme Court noted that s.2(1) constitutes the single test for capacity, albeit that the test falls to be interpreted by applying the more detailed provisions around it in ss 2 and 3 of the Act. Again, once the matter has been formulated and the information relevant to the decision identified, the question for the court is whether P is unable to make a decision in relation to the matter and, if so, whether that inability is&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">because of</span>&#160;an impairment of, or a disturbance, in the functioning of the mind or brain."</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The Supreme Court has made clear the assessment of capacity should begin with the functional test. However, it seems helpful to consider Laura&#8217;s diagnoses. There was no dispute between the parties, or the experts, that Laura has a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder or autism. It causes Laura to have rigidity of thought and poor theory of mind. The latter creates a difficulty for her to understand people&#8217;s motivations and in particular, her parents&#8217; motivations in respect of her over medicalisation. This is made worse by the significant discrepancy between her verbal comprehension and her working and memory. I accept Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s evidence on the effect of her autism and its symptoms. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I need not go on to consider specifically whether any of the other diagnoses made are correct. It is not suggested Laura currently has Bipolar Disorder. There was a dispute between the parties and the experts in respect of Bodily Distress Disorder and Factitious Disorder Imposed On Another. I need not resolve this issue as I am satisfied that where Laura is unable to make a decision in respect of a matter this is caused by her autism. I need not go on to consider whether it is caused by other contested diagnoses. And for the avoidance of doubt in as much as it could be said (although no party made this submission) that my decision not to resolve this issue may cast doubt on the causative link between functional decision making and autism, I am not persuaded by this. Laura&#8217;s autism is clear and pervades her thought processes. I understood both experts to accepts that autism is the primary psychiatric diagnosis.  In any event, after having surveyed all the evidence, and without making a finding of a formal diagnosis beyond autism, Laura&#8217;s autism, taken together with her highly fixated preoccupations about her medicalisation and disorders, amounts to an impairment and/or disturbance of the mind or brain. That is my finding after having considered all of the evidence.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Ultimately there was little dispute between the parties on these issues. The need to identify, in the evidence, consideration of the Schedule A1 mental capacity requirement was not clear, but on the facts of this case, it very much forms part of the overall evidence in respect of residence and care and treatment. Secondly there was something of a debate as to whether the decision in respect of contact was with &#8216;others&#8217; and indications this included Laura&#8217;s attempts to contact medical specialists, the Food Standards Agency, the Office of the Public Guardian and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. However, the evidence does not deal with these wide body of &#8216;others&#8217; and does not deal with Laura&#8217;s aunt or an identified friend. In any event, I would need some considerable persuasion that the Court of Protection should be making declarations that P lacks capacity to contact others to grant itself a best interests jurisdiction to make an order that it is not in P&#8217;s best interests to contact regulatory agencies. That issue seems very much a matter for the agencies to manage and not the court. In any event, the evidence filed does not support further consideration of this issue. On care and treatment all parties accepted this did not include specific medical procedures (which will need to be assessed as and when by treating clinicians) but rather relates to the routine level of care and support provided to her by her caring team.</p>

The parties accept this is relevant to contact. I prefer Ms Power&#8217;s submission that this underpins a risk to Laura which she should understand, retain, weigh up and use, in respect of the decisions related to where she lives; how she receives care and support; and in respect of consent to the deprivation of her liberty. If she were not placed and deprived of her liberty at her current placement, the other option would be to live with her parents and receive some care and support from them. It is therefore relevant information for each distinct decision on the facts of this case. Dr Camden-Smith agreed with this position and I accept her evidence. However, should I be wrong about that and it is not relevant information, other than for contact with her parents, it makes no difference to the outcome as, for reasons explained below, Laura is unable to understand the other aspect of the relevant information. </p>

She accepted she had not put all the relevant information to Laura. Her view was that this was for the treating team to do. She accepted she had overly relied on what Laura had told her and had not triangulated this with treating clinicians. She accepted her reports did not set out in writing the conversations she had had with Laura when discussing the functional tests in any detail. She also accepted that her conversations with treating clinicians had not been set out in any detail in her reports.  As I have set out above, on each decision, she ultimately was not asserting that Laura had capacity. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Where there are remaining differences of opinion I prefer Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s opinions on capacity for a number of reasons. First, her methodology was not questioned or challenged. Secondly, her report provides details of her conversations with clinicians and with Laura which evidences the rigor with which she assessed whether the functional test was met or otherwise for each decision. Thirdly, she had a very firm, indeed expert, understanding of the MCA and her report was reasoned and structured around the appropriate tests. Fourthly, whilst Dr Eccles is experienced in the overlap between psychiatric matters and hypermobility, her expertise in capacity was less apparent in her written and oral evidence. Lastly, Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s evidence was supported by the written evidence from several treating clinicians and was consistent with their various opinions on capacity over the course of these proceedings. Seen overall, I place greater wright on Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s evidence than on Dr Eccles&#8217;. I had regard to Dr Wareham&#8217;s written and oral evidence but as Laura&#8217;s father I place limited weight on it. He is keen for her to  be assessed as capacitous and for her to return to his home and to his, and his wife&#8217;s, care. It is also the case that whilst he is a doctor, he has not carried out a capacity assessment of the identified decisions and his evidence did not purport to do so.</p>

Furthermore whilst it is not for Dr and Mrs Wareham to prove Laura has capacity to make a decision about her residence, Dr Eccles accepted that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I can&#8217;t say whether she can use/weigh the relevant information to decide on residence</span>&#8221; an evolution of her opinion that she accepted, given she had not put all the relevant information to Laura and her written report did not set this out.</p>
