A contested hearing then took place. At the end of that hearing the Court made an interim care order and sanctioned the removal of the children from their parents&#8217; care.  </p>

The information with which I have been provided in these current proceedings (BM19C00293) is that the treating physicians who initially saw her were not satisfied that the fracture was consistent with the history given by the parents. </p>

Unfortunately, the Judge who had case managed and heard the proceedings is not currently at work and is not able to consider this matter. Having spoken to the DFJ, I have listened to the tape recording of that hearing, and provided a note of it to counsel instructed in the present proceedings. The quality of the recording is not particularly good. It was not considered necessary or proportionate either by myself, or the parties, to obtain a transcript of the hearing. The following appeared clearly from the transcript:  a. No Judgment was given.  </p>

On 21 November 2019 while working with his class teacher, M made a number of statements suggesting that his father hit his mother that his mother hit him and that his mother hit the baby. That is a brief summary of some of the evidence I heard. The precise evidence given regarding those statements during the contested ICO hearing is recorded in the ICO Judgment. As a result of what he said that day, and a visit by police to the family home on the same evening, the children were placed into police protection and the second set of care proceedings was issued.  </p>

Secondly, the requirement embedded within a fair and just society, that it is important to be able to identify accurately those who cause serious injuries to children, wherever that identification is possible. Recognition of that tension assists in understanding and advancing the &#8216;principled flexibility&#8217; so important in this area of law. That approach does not, in truth, denote a lack of rigour when properly applied. On the contrary, it is one example of the way in which clear, yet flexible legislation and rules are applied in order to achieve just and good outcomes for children and their families.  </p>

Determined facts in children&#8217;s cases can be reconsidered in an appropriate case: failure to do so may mean that the first principle of finality in litigation takes precedence over the second and prevents it being achieved, to the detriment, ultimately of a child or children. A decision, however, to permit the re-opening of issues previously litigated, must be based on sound reasons, applying relevant law so that the first principle of finality of litigation is not entirely lost on the basis of possibilities or speculation alone.  </p>

The explicit robust analysis which might have been expected is not evident. Nonetheless, having regard to the provisions of the Order, it would appear that all agreed that the Court was being asked to sanction withdrawal of the proceedings. Furthermore, the fact that &#8216;no order&#8217; was made, suggests that, contrary to the submission made by the local authority, this was a case in which the Court concluded &#8220;&#8230; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> that no order was necessary; that is to say on the basis that withdrawal was consistent with the welfare needs of&#8221; Z (per Hedley J in the <span style="font-style:italic">Redbridge </span>case);  alternatively, that the Court concluded that &#8220;withdrawal [was] consistent with the welfare of the child such that no order [was] required pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>&#8221; (per Macdonald J as set out above). Some might dismiss this analysis as speculation. I agree that nothing is certain. This conclusion is not however based on mere speculation; it is, in my judgment, the best structured analysis that can be done after considering the Orders, the evidence and the recording of the hearing. Sadly, the Judge who determined the case cannot, at this time, consider the issue.   </p>

At its highest, there may have been a conclusion reached that Z might have &#8216;brittle bones&#8217;, that hypothesis requiring further investigation. No oral evidence was heard. The parents did not ask to give evidence and establish the truth (on the balance of probabilities) of their account. The Guardian did not invite further consideration of the evidence or seek to disprove the truth of their account. Nor did the local authority or the Court. All agreed that the local authority should be permitted to withdraw the proceedings. No more. No less. I accept that that occurred within a binary system where facts are found or not. However, in this instance, all sidestepped the impact of that binary system by not actively pursuing determination of disputed allegations, consenting to the local authority, in lay terms, &#8216;walking away&#8217; from that contest in the light of the evidence then available. All agreed that no order was the right order in the light of the application to withdraw. There should have been a more structured analysis and reasoning. There was not. No one appealed.   </p>

There are in my judgment solid grounds for doing so: M has talked to his class teacher about events at home, something which he had not done before. That which he has said, against the background of Z&#8217;s injury both in the summer of 2019 and that seen in November 2019, requires the Court to look again at that which occurred in the summer of 2019.  </p>
