	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case needs little introduction as it concerns a child B who has been the subject of proceedings since February 2014, during which time the case has been before the High Court, Family Division, in June 2014, Court of Appeal <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Habitual Residence) (Inherent Jurisdiction) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/886" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 886" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 886</ref>, and the Supreme Court in, <span style="font-style:italic">In the matter of B (A child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2016/4" uk:canonical="[2016] UKSC 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] UKSC 4</ref>. Judgment was given on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2016 and by a majority decision of three to two the case proceeded to a substantive hearing in the Family Division. For numerous reasons, to which further reference will be made below, the substantive hearing did not take place until February 2017.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">B was lawfully removed from this jurisdiction to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan by her biological mother and principal care-giver (R) in February 2014 and has remained there since. In February 2014 J made applications for a Child Arrangements Orders (CAO) pursuant to s 8 of the Children Act (CA) 1989 other orders and relief under the inherent jurisdiction. Her applications were refused by Mrs Justice Hogg on the basis that the court did not have jurisdiction as R and, by extension B given her very young age and dependency on her mother, were no longer habitually resident in the UK. J appealed and the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of Hogg J. The decision of the Court of Appeal was overturned in the Supreme Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Briefly, R and J lived together in a same-sex relationship between 2004 and December 2011. Before their relationship began R had begun to try having a child by artificial means; she was unsuccessful in doing so. After she moved in with J she continued to do so and eventually, following NHS intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment in 2007 B was born on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2008. In 2011 R and J separated and for the following two years J had contact with B which was reduced to two hours every three weeks in the year prior to the move to Pakistan. There is no doubt that J was to all intents and purposes co-parenting B when the parties were living together and that B was treated by J as her child and that B saw her as a mother, and that she continued to see J in that context after the two women separated. B has not had any direct contact with J except for some limited telephone contact since B left the UK with R to live in Pakistan in 2014.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Prior to this hearing the guardian met B and filed an analysis/report in which she recommended, amongst other things, that B remain with R in Pakistan and that there should be a CAO in place for indirect contact only, including by telephone or Skype. Despite the guardian&#8217;s conclusions, which were based in part on the child&#8217;s wishes and on R&#8217;s reluctance to agree to direct contact, R, having read the guardian&#8217;s analysis arranged for B to see J over the weekend albeit for a very short time. On the second day of the trial, having carefully considered the recommendations of B&#8217;s guardian J pursues contact but no longer seeks the return of B to this jurisdiction and has accepted the guardian&#8217;s recommendation that B remain living with R in Islamabad. Thus, J and R have moved towards some consensus and to the beginning of co-operation in the interests of B. After three years of bitterly contested proceedings they are both to be commended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applicant applies for a CAO for B to spend time with her, for telephone and Skype contact, and for indirect contact by way of letter. J had by the end of the hearing broadly accepted the guardian&#8217;s proposals for contact. J applies for the case to return before the court in 9 months to ensure that the CAO has been given effect and to review that order. Under the inherent jurisdiction of the court J applies for B to be made a ward of court and declarations in respect of parental responsibility; as it is submitted on her behalf that the court cannot make a parental responsibility order (PRO) in her favour under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref>Z (as inserted by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilization and Embryology Act 2008</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/56" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 56</ref>, Sch. 6, Pt 1, para 27); a statutory lacuna which needs to be filled by application of the inherent jurisdiction.

She opposes the applications for the case to return to court; for wardship proceedings to be initiated; for a parental responsibility order and/or declaration; and, for a finding that J was a psychological parent to B. R is concerned that a PRO will be used by J to bring further proceedings and create further conflict; and to undermine and interfere with her parenting of B.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The guardian originally recommended that there should be a CAO for indirect contact only. She did not recommend that B and R should be forced to return to the UK as Ms Demery did not consider that was in the best interests of B&#8217;s welfare either at present or in the near future. The guardian did not consider that R was able to give her daughter emotional permission to see J or spend time with her, but when R had arranged for B to meet J before this hearing and for another session on Thursday 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February, the guardian recommend that there should be contact once a year; allowing for the practical and financial realities of the parties&#8217; circumstances. The guardian recommended that there should be a parental responsibility order in the interests of B which would recognise the role and status of J in B&#8217;s life; but on the basis that J will not be able to exercise parental responsibility in Pakistan. She recommended that the case return to court, for, she said that B re-establishing contact and her relationship with J was in a fledging stage and needed some oversight. The guardian was neutral as to wardship. She supported a finding that J was a psychological parent to J.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both the guardian and J seek a finding that J was the &#8220;psychological mother&#8221; of B.  In cases of same-sex parenting where parental responsibility does not automatically exist in law and where it has not been agreed the courts may consider making a parental responsibility order or a child arrangements order in favour of both parents.

The court&#8217;s first and paramount concern is the welfare of B, who is to be nine years old in about six weeks&#8217; time; any decision as to the role played by J will inform but not decide what is in B&#8217;s best interests in future.</p>

There was limited court time available to dispose of these prolonged proceedings; a passage of time which directly has affected the child as her life has, inevitably, moved on; when the proceedings started she was rising six, now she is almost nine. The decisions that the court must make are about what is in her best interests in February 2017, not what they may have been in February 2014, and still less what they were in December 2011 when the two women separated. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Some of the facts concerning the background to this case have been agreed include the following (non-exhaustive) facts and observations: starting with the fact that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent was at all times, and remains, B&#8217;s primary carer. As counsel for the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent observes, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;on any view the applicant &#8216;pressed for contact&#8217; with [B] and on any view the respondent was &#8216;to some extent resistant to it&#8217;&#8221;</span>; which is another way of saying that the parties have been in considerable conflict, since they separated, about the continuing role the applicant should play in B&#8217;s life. When the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent took B to Pakistan the applicant, who was a central figure in B&#8217;s life, and probably the second most important figure at the time, was left behind in England. The move to Pakistan took place without the applicant&#8217;s knowledge or approval, and B was aware that the move to Pakistan was to be kept secret from the applicant. B had significant emotional links with the applicant and she feared she would miss her when she had moved to Pakistan. There can be little doubt that B did miss the applicant when she first moved.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nonetheless, B&#8217;s removal to Pakistan was lawful. The applicant and the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent could have taken steps to formalise their relationship; that they did not choose to do so may well have been for reasons associated with their own perception of how they may have been treated by their own families and the wider communities to which they belonged. There may well have been good cause for their fear of rejection and disapproval. The result was that the applicant was not in law a parent nor was she accepted by the community at large as a parent to B, and, despite the fact that she could have brought proceedings much earlier when the time she spent with B was reduced, she did not do so until February 2014. During the two years following their separation the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent progressively reduced the level of B&#8217;s contact with the applicant from 6 hours every week for the first few months, to 3 hours every fortnight in the following year (for most of 2012) and then to two hours every three weeks in the year (for most of 2013) before moving to Pakistan.</p>

The applicant, in turn, must have felt that she had been shut out of B&#8217;s life and rejected as a member of B&#8217;s family. Once she brought proceedings the applicant has pursued them with some considerable vigour. Her counsel, Mr Perkins, accepted that the threat of summary return to the UK, committal to prison, sequestration and fines was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;at the Draconian end of the opportunities more usually available in domestic and some international disputes&#8221;</span> but said there was &#8220;little other option&#8221; given the lack of alternatives there was at the time.

In the second place, J asserted that she would be unable to travel to Pakistan and would be personally in danger and unsafe if she did so; so that R&#8217;s offer of contact in Pakistan was meaningless. It must be noted that J has not, at any time, applied, or even attempted to apply for a visa to enter Pakistan; therefore, there is no evidence that she could not have travelled, in a private capacity, to take up the offer of contact, notwithstanding her Indian heritage.</p>

While the fluctuating socio-political situation between India and Pakistan is a matter of well-known international dispute there was, and always has been, individual travel and connections between the two countries. It may well be true to say that to travel openly as a lesbian, bi-sexual, gay or transsexual person could place a person at risk and compromise their safety either in Pakistan or in India; it could also be said that may well be true for a single woman. It is not, however, an established fact on the evidence before this court, that J, individually, could not have travelled to Pakistan with appropriate arrangements put in place to visit B there.</p>

It is accepted that R had been made redundant and had to look for employment in order to support herself and B. It is accepted that two months earlier she had carried out a reconnoitre of possible arrangements in Islamabad. She did so in the knowledge that B had a close relationship with the applicant, one that she had encouraged and recognised when B was a baby and infant growing up in their joint household. R did not discuss the move, its timing or any other particular of her decision with J. While she was not legally obliged to do so, she did so in the full knowledge that J was pursuing an agreement over arrangements for her to spend time with B. Mediation had been arranged and R took part in it without divulging her plans. While it is the applicant&#8217;s case that R acted in a duplicitous manner to avoid her having contact with B, it is the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent&#8217;s case that J was pursuing her, was unnecessarily intrusive and seeking to control her life long after they had long ceased to be a couple.

Although R needs to keep her sexual orientation hidden from society at large, just as she had seemingly done from members of her own family in the past, theirs is not an isolated existence. Her mother, R, has friends in the LBGT community in Pakistan and B is aware of that fact. R has a close friend who visits regularly from the UK who is in a same-sex relationship, both of whom B knew before she and R went to Pakistan. R has set up a catering business and runs a European-style caf&#233;, from which she supports herself and B. They live in rented accommodation with a female first-cousin of R&#8217;s; who B calls &#8216;auntie&#8217;. B attends an English medium school which follows an English curriculum. She is happy at this school (which she has been attending since September 2016) well integrated into the school community with a circle of friends whose company she enjoys. As observed by her guardian, B is reaching an age where society outside the family, particularly the friendship of other girls, is increasingly important. She is reaching an age where children should and do become increasingly independent of their parents. </p>

The guardian recommended that the case return to court in nine months to a year&#8217;s time.</p>

This observation was well made, particularly as there will be a child arrangements order in place. The reasoning behind the application for wardship was seemingly based on the assertion that the courts in Pakistan would be more familiar with the concept of wardship. This may provide some additional support for parents who both have connections with Pakistan and seek to enforce English and Welsh court orders there, but as the applicant is clear that she considers herself unable to travel to Pakistan to do so herself, there is little force in the argument advanced on her behalf. </p>

Indeed, B still retained positive memories of her and spoke about her, in particular, about going on holiday to Cuba with her. The guardian considered it of benefit to B to maintain contact and for B to re- build a relationship with B; this would provide B with a link with her past and would enable her to have a greater understanding of where she came from and the circumstances of her birth and infancy. For this reason, to emphasise to B the relevance and importance of the role the applicant had played in her life, the guardian supported the making of a parental responsibility order. The guardian said that the parental responsibility order should be limited in effect and was not to provide the applicant with school reports or medical records. Indeed, the applicant accepted that she would not be able to approach B&#8217;s school in Pakistan with requests for school reports as it would be likely to meet with refusal and may cause embarrassment for B and difficulties for the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent. </p>

The phrase "psychological parent" gained most currency from the influential work of Goldstein, Freud and Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973), who defined it thus: &#8216;A psychological parent is one who, on a continuous, day-to-day basis, through interaction, companionship, interplay, and mutuality, fulfils the child's psychological needs for a parent, as well as the child's physical needs. The psychological parent may be a biological, adoptive, foster or common law parent.&#8217;</span></p>

There is no need to dwell on whether or not the applicant was a &#8220;psychological parent&#8221; for it cannot be disputed that J undertook a parental role when B was a baby and later when she was an infant and young child. This has been recognised by the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent who has agreed to direct contact and arranged for B to see the applicant prior to the hearing.

The guardian recommended indirect contact by way of letters, cards and telephone/skype on a fortnightly basis.  She further recommended that the applicant should have parental responsibility and that the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent should keep the applicant up to date <span style="font-style:italic">vis-&#224;-vis</span> progress at school, photographs, health and general wellbeing. The guardian&#8217;s position was that the case should remain before the court and return to court in nine months to a year for three reasons; the CAO has just been made (as alluded to above); secondly, the case is one with an international dimension and, thirdly, there is means by which to put mirror orders in place in Pakistan to safeguard the child&#8217;s best interests. The court accepts those reasons as valid and, in the circumstances of this case will retain some oversight.

Lord Wilson noted at [25] on 3 February 2016 that, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;The consequence of the conclusions reached in the lower courts, in both of them by judges of great experience in the field of family law, is that applications intended to secure for B a continuing relationship with the woman who, with the respondent&#8217;s consent, has acted as one of her parents and who, even for the two years following the separation, managed to maintain a significant, loving presence in her life have been dismissed without any appraisal of B&#8217;s welfare; without any knowledge of her current situation; without any collection of her wishes and feelings; and in circumstances in which no such applications can be entertained in any other court.&#8221;</span></p>

He makes a strong point when he suggests, that in future cases, where there is dispute as to habitual residence, early consideration should be given to joinder of the child(ren) so that the court maintains a fluid picture of the child&#8217;s circumstances, wishes and feelings.  The orders made by this court reflect the reality of this child&#8217;s life and her best interests as considered by her guardian and the court when the case came before it in February 2017 some three years after she had moved to Pakistan with her mother. This court endorses his suggestion; it must be right that children in these cases should be separately represented to avoid the focus being on the dispute between parents and/or care-givers and their &#8220;rights&#8221;.</p>

Further contact between B and J was to take place on Thursday. The reasons for the orders made by the court are set out in the body of this judgment. The order contained recitals which set out the parties&#8217; respective positions and recorded various facts germane to the case and the orders made. There is now a CAO in place which reflects the agreement reached between the parties; nothing in the order would stop the parties making any additional arrangements for B to spend time with the applicant or for additional exchanges of information, letters, cards or gifts, provided they both agree in advance.</p>

The applicant is to send letters or cards to B once a month; arrangements are to be put in place for this to take place.
