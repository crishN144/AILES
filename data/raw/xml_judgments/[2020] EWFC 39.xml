It is not just for myself or for [Mr and Mrs Z] (who have never intended to be her legal parents), but because I want her to have the surname [Y] and to have her father recognised. It will break my heart for her, and him, if it is not possible for [Mr Y] to be put on her birth certificate. We have been through so much for so many years; the clinic thought we deserved a chance to be parents, and [the egg donor and Mr and Mrs Z] all gave so much to make this possible. The fact that [Mr Y] has died should not change anything. The way [X] was conceived was all about love, and [Mr Y] is &#8211; and always will be &#8211; her daddy. I know, had he been here, that he would never have stopped talking about her, and she would have made him so proud. She deserves to have a parental order which recognises him as her father, and I hope that the court will find a way to make it possible.&#8221;</span></p>

Following this they were advised to consider surrogacy. Through the friend who donated eggs, Mr and Mrs Y were introduced to the respondents, Mr and Mrs Z. After getting to know each other better, they decided to enter into a surrogacy agreement in 2017. That agreement sets out the intentions of the parties, which included Mr and Mrs Y applying for a parental order after the birth of the child. </p>

The key lies in a careful consideration of the essential principles and scope of the legislation being interpreted.  If the insertion of one word contracts those principles or goes beyond the scope of the legislation, it amounts to impermissible amendment.  On the other hand, if the implication of a dozen words leaves the essential principles and scope of the legislation intact but allows it to be read in a way which is compatible with Convention rights, the implication is a legitimate exercise of the power conferred by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(1)</ref>.&#8221;.&#8217; </span></p>

In other cases the easiest solution may be to put the offending part of the provision into different words which convey the meaning that will be compatible with those rights.

That is different, which is why there is no parallel.  IVF involves a woman becoming pregnant herself and giving birth to her child &#8211; there is not a direct parallel.

The issue was whether any part of the cause of action arose in the City of London, to bring it within that court within the relevant statutory provisions at that time. The delivery of the goods had taken place in Surrey, the assignment of the debt took place in London. The defendant argued that the assignment itself could not be part of a cause of action giving rise to jurisdiction in the Mayor&#8217;s Court, since the assignors did not possess that right. </p>

At paragraphs 8.59 to 8.76 it considers the attribution of legal parenthood in situations where the child dies, the surrogate dies and where both intended parents die. Paragraphs 8.71 to 8.76 set out what should happen when both intended parents die and recommends that in such a situation it should be possible for the intended parents to become legal parents and be registered on their child&#8217;s birth certificate. The consultation paper does not consider the situation, as here, where one intended parent dies. </p>

It is central to his being, whether as an individual or as a member of his family. As Ms Isaacs correctly puts it, this case is fundamentally about X&#8217;s identity and his relationship with the commissioning parents. Fundamental as these matters must be to commissioning parents they are, if anything, even more fundamental to the child. A parental order has, to adopt Theis J's powerful expression, a transformative effect, not just in its effect on the child's legal relationships with the surrogate and commissioning parents but also, to adopt the guardian's words in the present case, in relation to the practical and psychological realities of X's identity. A parental order, like an adoption order, has an effect extending far beyond the merely legal. It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious, consequences. It creates what Thorpe LJ </span>in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Adoption: Non-Patrial) [1998] INLR 424, 429, referred to as "the psychological relationship of parent and child with all its far-reaching manifestations and consequences."

X was born in December 2011, so his expectation of life must extend well beyond the next 75 years.

Theis J focussed on that aspect of Article 8 which protects &#8220;family life&#8221; but Article 8 also protects &#8220;private life&#8221; and &#8220;identity&#8221; on which she appropriately laid stress, is an important aspect of &#8220;private life&#8221;. So, any application for a parental order implicates both the child&#8217;s right to &#8220;family life&#8221; and also the child&#8217;s right to &#8220;private life&#8221;. The distinction does not matter in the circumstances of the present case &#8230;. But I make the point because it is, I suppose, possible to conceive of a case where, on the facts it might be more difficult, or even impossible, to demonstrate the existence of &#8220;family life&#8221; </span></p>

Again I quote from the President's judgment in Re X; "Adoption is not an attractive solution given the commissioning father's existing biological relationship with X. As X's guardian puts it, a parental order presents the optimum legal and psychological solution for X and is preferable to an adoption order because it confirms the important legal, practical and psychological reality of X's identity; the commissioning father is his biological father and all parties intended from the outset that the commissioning parents should be his legal parents."  </span></p>

The application is made by Mrs Y and on behalf of Mr Y who died after the embryo, created using Mr Y&#8217;s gametes, was transferred to Mrs Z and as a result of the embryo transfer she gave birth to X and the requirements in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s54 (2)</ref> &#8211; (8) are satisfied. Mr and Mrs Y were married at the time of his death, X has had her home with Mrs Y since her birth and Mrs Y is domiciled here. Mrs Y is over 18 years and Mr Y was at the time of his death. The application was issued less than 6 months after X&#8217;s birth<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> The respondents, Mr and Mrs Z,<span style="font-weight:bold"/>consent to the making of a parental order, with Mrs Z&#8217;s consent being give more than six weeks after X&#8217;s birth.

She does, however, only know [Mrs Y] as her mother since she had been her main caregiver since her birth. She was the first person to hold her and feed her and the attachment will be strong. [X] is flourishing under her intended mother&#8217;s care. It is therefore reasonable to assume that, if she could, she would say that she would want to live with and be cared for by her intended mother and remain in the home that has been provided for her by her biological father.&#8221;  </span></p>

Moreover, a child&#8217;s birth certificate is a very powerful document; it is a tangible document which states very clearly who you are, where you come from and confirms you parentage and this will be essential for this child as she matures.</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt">&#8221;</span></p>
