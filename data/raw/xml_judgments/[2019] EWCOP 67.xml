He has a diagnosis of mild learning disability combined with significant deficits in adaptive functioning. He has autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. P&#8217;s cognitive impairment and concomitant ASD and ADHD place him at risk of offending.  </p>

He currently resides at a supported living placement facility in the North of England.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Earlier in these proceedings the judge to whom these proceedings were then allocated, a tier 1 judge, determined that the proceedings should be heard in private. Once the proceedings were re-allocated to me, I raised the issue of why the case relating to P should not be heard in public but subject to a suitably worded transparency order. I invited the local authority, in whose favour I had made a deprivation of liberty order, the Official Solicitor, as P&#8217;s litigation friend, and the National Probation Service to file and serve written submissions on the issue of whether the proceedings should continue to be heard in private or heard in public with a transparency order.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am immensely grateful to counsel for each of the three parties for their succinct but helpful submissions. The local authority and the National Probation Service contend the proceedings should be heard in private.  The National Probation Service submitted in the alternative that the proceedings should be heard in public, but with the court making an appropriate transparency order, with which the Official Solicitor agreed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The usual approach is that hearings are heard in public and a transparency order will be made (see paragraph 2.1). The background to the &#8220;usual approach&#8221; was a desire to ensure that the Court of Protection, which has the power to make a wide range of orders involving those who lack capacity including medical treatment and deprivation of liberty orders, avoided the label of &#8220;the secret court&#8221;. This label had been adopted by numerous press organisations. The concept of a &#8220;secret court&#8221; had the potential to undermine the confidence of the important work of the Court of Protection.  </p>

For present purposes the decision of the House on the facts of Campbell and the difference between the majority and the minority are not material. What does, however, emerge clearly from the opinions are four propositions. First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test&#8230;.&#8221; </p>

Previous placements have broken down and the difficulties, in the event that this placement broke down, would be significant in terms of identifying an alternative placement. P himself appears to have no ability to control the information which may lead to reprisals against him. He reveals information to others about his offences. To the extent that P&#8217;s welfare (in its widest possible sense) would be compromised by a public hearing, there is evidence to support the concern that P&#8217;s welfare could be compromised. There is accordingly a need to protect P as a party to the proceedings. </p>

However, that risk can be reduced with appropriate orders in relation to what can be reported. Furthermore, the court should have confidence that accredited media organisations will report the proceedings in a responsible way. </p>

The subject matter of the application may cause an adverse reaction from persons attending. The Official Solicitor submits that there is a risk of disruption to the proceedings but the nature of this risk cannot be predicted at this stage. Members of the public who have a genuine interest in the work of the Court of Protection are unlikely to be disruptive during the course of the hearing. However, members of the public who for example could be part of a vigilante group or family members of P&#8217;s victims are more likely to be disruptive during the course of the hearing. In the absence of any evidence as to whether there would be disruption, this is speculative at this stage. Furthermore, if such disruption occurred the court would have the power to remove persons from the court.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">When considering the factors set out in PD 4C, the need to protect P is a very powerful factor in favour of holding the proceedings in private. The sanction for a breach of a transparency order is contempt proceedings. If the order is breached, however, the information which the order sought to protect may already be in the public domain and the harm to P and/or his placement may have already occurred.  </p>
