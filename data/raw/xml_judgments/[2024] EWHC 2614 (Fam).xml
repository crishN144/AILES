	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 28 August 2024, I heard a rolled-up hearing for permission to appeal with the appeal to follow. The Appellant was Mr Mainwaring. The case had been listed for a two-day hearing, but I was able to hear submissions on behalf of both parties on the first day and to adjourn to give a written reserved judgment. I formally handed down judgment on 5 September 2024. It is reported under neutral citation number <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">[2024] EWHC 2296 (Fam)</span>. At paragraph 73 of that judgment, I gave directions to enable determination of any application for costs.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I now give this further judgment in relation to the Respondent&#8217;s application for costs. The application is for indemnity costs. Her total costs of responding to this appeal amount to &#163;20,240.60. On behalf of Mr Mainwaring the application for costs is resisted, particularly the application for indemnity costs. On behalf of the Appellant, I am urged to make no order for costs between the parties. I have the Appellant&#8217;s N260. His costs are said to amount to &#163;18,341. I note that the amount claimed relates to both solicitor costs and Counsel&#8217;s fees.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of Ms Bailey, two basic submissions are made. They are (i) that costs should follow the event of this hopeless appeal and (ii) that the Appellant&#8217;s litigation conduct significantly contributed to the costs of the appeal.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In response and on behalf of Mr Mainwaring, it is submitted that I have a discretion as to costs and that I ought not to make an award against him. It is argued that I should disallow Ms Bailey&#8217;s costs prior to my order of 25 July 2024. It is said that before that date the Respondent was not obliged to respond to the appeal. Given it was always her case that it was a hopeless appeal, it is argued on behalf of the Appellant that it would have been reasonable for her not to engage with the process before being required to do so by the court. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On behalf of the Appellant, it is submitted that Mr Mainwaring &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">essentially self</span>-<span style="font-style:italic">represented</span>&#8221;. It is said that the Appellant&#8217;s filing of documents without court direction or permission was because he did not understand the Family Procedure Rules. It is argued that the additional documents Mr Mainwaring placed before the court did not trouble the Respondent and clearly took the appeal no further. In addition, on behalf of Mr Mainwaring, the amount of costs claimed are challenged. Three separate items are identified and are said to be excessive. </p>

However, as I stated at paragraph 50 of the substantive judgment, I determined it necessary to consider a number of examples of bias relied upon by the Appellant in support of ground 1 because they were interwoven with grounds 2 and 3. Having heard argument on those specific examples as well as grounds 2 and 3, I dismissed the appeal. This was a hopeless appeal and one wherein I considered whether I should simply refuse permission to appeal and certify it as being totally without merit or proceed to dismiss it. Because I had heard full argument, I decided to dismiss it.  </p>

At no point before the appeal was dismissed by me did the Appellant concede that the appeal was hopeless. He did not even withdraw ground 1 on the basis that it lacked merit. Instead, he continued to argue the specific factual examples which were interlinked with grounds 2 and 3. </p>

The Respondent has engaged with the process. She has filed her skeleton argument as directed and has chosen to attend the hearing before me with Counsel. Given the way the Appellant has pursued the appeal, I consider that her engagement with the process was necessary and proportionate from the moment Mr Justice Keehan set down the appeal for a rolled-up oral hearing. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 16 April 2024, Mr Justice Keehan listed the Appellant&#8217;s application for permission to appeal for an oral hearing on 23 May 2024 with a time estimate of 1 day. The application was to be on notice to the Respondent with an appeal to follow if permission was granted. The May 2024 hearing did not proceed and was adjourned to 21 June 2024. On 17 June 2024 those instructed on behalf of Mr Mainwaring applied for an adjournment of that hearing because of his professed need to obtain transcripts of the hearing at first instance (note the judgment was available). That application was allowed by consent. That consent order provided for a hearing on 28 August 2024 but also contained a provision for the automatic dismissal of the appeal in the event of the Appellant&#8217;s non-compliance with the proposed revised timetable for the filing of transcripts, grounds etc. The date for compliance was 17 July 2024. On 24 July 2024 the Appellant made an application for an extension of time. That was 7 days after the date for compliance provided in the earlier order which should have led to the automatic dismissal of this appeal. However, the Appellant&#8217;s application did not refer to the consent order. In the context of that significant omission, on 25 July 2024 I made my first case management order in this appeal. I gave directions which re-timetabled the appeal but would enable the hearing date in August 2024 to be held. The directions I gave included the direction that the Respondent must file and serve any skeleton argument upon which she sought to rely by a specific date. On 12 August 2024 I made a further directions order to manage the appeal in response to a yet further application on behalf of the Appellant for an extension of time to file transcripts of the hearings.  I gave written reasons for the direction I made on that occasion. Within those written reasons I reminded both parties of PD30A r.4.24 and stated this &#8211; &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the issue of costs will thus be live and litigation conduct will be one of the issues I will be required to factor into any application for costs</span>&#8221;<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

I do not agree that those costs should be limited to those incurred after my order of 25 July 2024. This was always a hopeless appeal. I consider that the proper order in this case is that the Appellant should pay the Respondent&#8217;s costs of this appeal from the date of Mr Justice Keehan&#8217;s order, namely 16 April 2024. That order set down the rolled- up permission and appeal for hearing. The Respondent's engagement with the process thereafter was not only reasonable it was necessary and proportionate because of the way in which the Appellant conducted this litigation.</p>

When making that assessment I have considered the Appellant&#8217;s suggested and itemised deductions from the Respondent&#8217;s costs. In my judgment the items said to be either excessive or unnecessary were reasonably incurred given the way in which the Appellant chose to litigate this case. However, I have already decided that costs should run from 16 April 2024. The application for permission to appeal was issued on 6 March 2024 and the Respondent chose to submit a Response before any court direction. Looking at the cost schedules and assessing costs on a standard basis I have decided that the appropriate award for costs is therefore &#163;16,192.48 inclusive of VAT. That sum is 80% of the costs the Respondent has incurred. In my judgment, such costs were reasonably and necessary once the application for permission with appeal to follow was set down for a rolled up hearing. That sum is proportionate to: (i) the issues raised; and (ii) the manner in which the Appellant litigated this appeal.</p>
