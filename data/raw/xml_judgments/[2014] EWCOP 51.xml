He underwent a further capacity assessment in November 2013 prior to discharge from hospital after nearly six months treatment and he was again assessed as having the capacity to make the very difficult and important decision as to his destination and future place of residence following his discharge. There has been no stroke activity since the incident in May 2013, nor any other event which might cause or signal a material change in his capacity since the last test was carried out some nine months ago. There is therefore no valid reason why he should not be presumed to have capacity at this time.&#8221;</p>

I also consider that he is subject to recurrent episodes of delirium which are probably due to a combination of cerebrovascular disease, prescribed medication and UTI&#8217;s. Fortunately for the purpose of my examination, I do not think that he was delirious at the time.</p>

Its hallmark is a disturbance of conscious awareness and the sleep-wake cycle. Delirium also differs from dementia in other ways: it is of more rapid onset, i.e. days or hours, compared with years for dementia; and resolution either by remission or death occurs within hours, days or weeks, although it may recur frequently in vulnerable individuals. The causes of delirium are legion and can be summarised as any underlying physical illness or toxicity, especially drug toxicity. If the underlying cause remits, delirium too resolves itself. Older people are at particular risk of delirium because they lack cerebral reserve. Dementia sufferers are at high risk of delirium, often as a result of an underlying infection, such as of the urinary tract. Delirium is sometimes termed &#8216;an acute confusional state&#8217; by physicians and surgeons.&#8221; </p>

I am not making any comment here about the quality of the advice he now gets from EY because this is beyond my remit and I have no information on it anyway. However, because he is now dependent on her for his day to day care he might be more likely to accept her advice without more careful consideration.</p>

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.25in">[40] Of course, it is right that the court should follow the general rule where appropriate. Parties should be free to bring personal welfare issues to the Court of Protection without fear of a costs sanction. Local authorities and others who carry out their work professionally have no reason to fear that a costs order will be made. The submission that local authorities will be discouraged from making applications to the Court of Protection if a costs order is made in this case is a thoroughly bad argument. The opposite is, in fact, the truth. It is only local authorities who break the law, or who are guilty of misconduct that falls within the meaning of rule 159, that have reason to fear a costs order. Local authorities who do their job properly and abide by the law have nothing to fear. In particular, the Court of Protection recognises that professional work in this very difficult field often involves very difficult judgments and decisions. The court is not going to impose a costs burden on a local authority simply because hindsight demonstrates that it got those judgments wrong.</p>

Professor Jacoby stated, &#8220;in my opinion CT&#8217;s prognosis is poor and he is likely to deteriorate over time. For instance, it would not surprise me if he had lost all the above capacities in six months or a year, if he lives that long.&#8221;</p>

I agree that the matter could have been handled better but, ultimately, it made no difference to the outcome of the report. At the hearing I asked EY&#8217;s counsel whether it would have made any difference. He replied, &#8220;Fortunately not. The second respondent was present when the visit took place, but if her witness statement had been attached, she would have made the point about attending in the afternoon.&#8221; This response was not entirely satisfactory because it is clear from Professor Jacoby&#8217;s report that he had made two phone calls to EY to arrange the visit, and she could have informed him during the first call that CT was at his best in the afternoon, rather than in the morning. In paragraph 15 of his report the professor said, &#8220;I phoned EY in September to fix the appointment and I phoned her on 2 October 2014 to confirm the appointment.&#8221;</p>

The reason why the OPG asked a Special Visitor to see CT was so that a specialist could look for objective evidence that would be sufficient, on the balance of probabilities, to establish whether CT had capacity or not and, accordingly, whether the Court of Protection had jurisdiction or not.</p>

However, because he is now dependent on her for his day to day care he might be more likely to accept her advice without more careful consideration.&#8221;</p>

The only interpretation of this can be that Professor Jacoby believed that, although CT still has capacity in certain areas, he is being influenced by his daughter, and her advice is anything but disinterested.</p>
