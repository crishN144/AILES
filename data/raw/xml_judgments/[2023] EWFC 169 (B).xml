This represents a significant proportion of the assets in the financial remedy proceedings, and [Company A] is the family&#8217;s primary income stream.  The husband asserts that even if these shares were not held on trust for him by the wife and she owned them outright, they should be regarded as matrimonial property.  On the expert&#8217;s valuations, 51% of the shareholding is either &#163;90,000 or &#163;301,000. The husband questions why the wife sold them for only &#163;51.00.
