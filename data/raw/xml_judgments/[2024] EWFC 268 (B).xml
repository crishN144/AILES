	    <p class="Heading1" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">Short judgment </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">Jamie is a happy, healthy baby, with a big smile. He loves music and having cuddles.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">M and F</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">M and F love Jamie. They would love him to come home to them. They want to look after him. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">It was hard for M and F to leave home and go to [residential placement]. They did it for Jamie. They were brave to go there. They wanted to learn how to take good care of Jamie. They listened to the staff. They did their best.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">Babies need someone to be checking on them all the time. Babies need to be held gently. A person caring for a baby needs to learn all the different signs the baby makes. Sometimes a baby might cry because they are hungry, or make a different cry and wriggle if they need their nappy changed. A baby might rub their eyes if they are tired. The carer needs to learn the different signs so they can give their baby what they need. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">A carer also needs to plan ahead. This means thinking about what their baby needs before the baby has started crying or showing other signs to say what they need. If the carers have planned ahead, they can give their baby what he needs straight away.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">F and M tried hard, but they were not able to look after Jamie by themselves. They were not always able to pay him attention when he needed it. They did not find it easy to work out what he needed. Sometimes they did not hold him gently.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">This is why the time at [residential placement] came to an end after three weeks.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">M and F have showed their love for Jamie by going to all the contact sessions. They have learned a lot about how to take care of him, like how to play with him, how to settle him to sleep, and how to change his nappies. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">But M and F still need adults to tell them how to take care of Jamie. They need adults with them to remind them about the things they have learned and to make sure that Jamie is safe. They have not learned how to plan ahead for Jamie. That means thinking about what Jamie might need, even if he doesn&#8217;t show them a sign. If they could plan ahead they would bring food to contact, or toys for Jamie to play with. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">Planning ahead also means thinking about the plan for Jamie. Like if Jamie came home, where would he sleep? Or who would look after Jamie when M and F are at college?</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">M and F are both doing really well at college. It would be hard to go to college and also have the responsibility of looking after a baby.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">These are the reasons that M and F are not able to look after Jamie by themselves.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">MGM and PGF</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">MGM and PGF love M and F. They love Jamie. They want to help F and M. They would like Jamie to come and live with them.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">MGM and PGF have F, M, [and their children A, B and C] to look after. PGF has a job with [redacted]. These are the main reasons that MGM and PGF cannot give M and F the help they need to look after Jamie.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">I have decided that Jamie cannot go and live with M and F at MGM and PGF&#8217;s home.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">[Jamie&#8217;s foster carers]</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">[Jamie&#8217;s foster carers] love Jamie. They can keep him safe and look after him. Jamie is happy and settled living with [his foster carers]. They would like him to stay with them and be a part of their family.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">It is best for Jamie if he stays with [his foster carers].</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:14pt">Although Jamie will be living with [his foster carers], M and F will always be Jamie&#8217;s mum and dad. They will love him for his whole life.</span></p>

	    <p class="ColorfulList-Accent11" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the event, the placement came to an end after three weeks. This was because the staff at [residential placement] reported that M and F were not able to meet Jamie&#8217;s basic needs on their own. Both M and F were finding it difficult to be away from home. The staff asked F to leave because sometimes he was getting angry. Even after that short time, it was clear that there was no prospect of the assessment being positive. </p>

There were delays in the assessment of PGF and MGM due to the assessor going on maternity leave and a new social worker being assigned. It was ordered that family members abroad should be assessed as potential carers. The family members who were assessed were F&#8217;s grandparents who live in [Country B], and a paternal cousin, [name redacted], who lived in [Country A]. These assessments took a very long time to conclude. In the end, [paternal cousin] withdrew from the process. F&#8217;s grandparents were negatively assessed, and did not seek to challenge that assessment. Finally, in January, F&#8217;s mother [name redacted] was assessed, but this also resulted in a negative conclusion. She lives in [Country B]. She has not seen her sons [F] and [child A] since they moved to England with their father in November 2015.</p>

[Female foster carer] has a lifetime&#8217;s experience of being a foster carer. Her own mother was a foster carer, and she herself has been a foster carer throughout her adult life. While Jamie has been in their care, [she] has made sure to get to know M and F, to chat to them at contact, give them updates about Jamie. She has given them presents for them to give Jamie and has given mother&#8217;s day and father&#8217;s day cards to M and F from Jamie. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is no formal application for a contact order before the Court.  On behalf of F, Ms Hudson invited the court to make a contact order to ensure a minimum of monthly contact. I do not consider it appropriate to make such an order where (i) there is clear evidence that [Jamie&#8217;s foster carers] are committed to and are well able to promote contact regularly, flexibly and in accordance with Jamie&#8217;s best interests; and (ii) they have not had the opportunity to take advice or make representations to the Court about the need or otherwise of a contact order. There have however been useful discussions between [Jamie&#8217;s foster carers] and the parties about contact. The local authority&#8217;s proposal is that F and M see Jamie five times a year. On top of that [Jamie&#8217;s foster carers] have agreed to arrange for Facetime contact once a month, and to send updates to M and F regularly, for example if Jamie meets a particular milestone or there is a celebration.</p>
