The third respondent is the grandmother of the seven children.  It was indicated by the applicant's counsel at the outset of the hearing before me that no order was sought against the third respondent, and accordingly I indicated that I would discharge her as a party, although in the event she remained present during the hearing.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is the applicant's case that the mother and father intend to force her to marry.  She asserts that during a family trip to Bangladesh in August of last year she had cause to believe that they were imminently planning to force her into marriage, but she was able to escape with the assistance of the Forced  Marriage Unit at the British High Commission.  The applicant further asserts, however, that following her escape her parents successfully forced her sister, B, to go through a ceremony of marriage against her will.  The applicant's allegation is now supported by B who, following the family's return to England, managed to get away from the family home in circumstances I shall describe below.  As a result of these event, the applicant asserts there is a risk that, unless prevented by a court order, her parents will in due course force her younger siblings to marry against their will.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As a result of these allegations, the local authority for the area in which the family lives in England, Bedfordshire County Council, has started an assessment under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/47" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the applicant proposes that, in the event that I make the findings and orders she seeks, a copy of my judgment should be disclosed to the local authority.   The father and mother emphatically deny these allegations.  They deny that they have ever forced, or attempted to force any of their children to marry.  They accept that B went through a ceremony of marriage in Bangladesh in September 2011, but assert that she did so voluntarily.  It was, they say, a love match.  They assert that the applicant has fabricated the allegations because of her antagonistic feelings towards  them derived from previous difficulties between the applicant and her parents, and that she has persuaded B to support her false allegations.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">At the outset of the hearing the parties indicated that they would agree to a continuation of interim forced marriage protection orders, made at an earlier stage in these proceedings, to last until the children reached the age of 18.  But it was made clear on the respondents' behalf that their agreement to this clause would be on the basis that no findings were made in respect  of the applicant's allegations.  I indicated, however, that I did not consider this to be an appropriate way forward.  In my judgment the allegations were sufficiently serious for it to be necessary for the court to conduct a hearing to determine whether or not they were true.  Accordingly, a fully contested hearing has taken place at which the applicant, B, and their parents have all given oral evidence.  At the conclusion of their evidence, and having heard submissions from counsel, I reserved judgment until today.</span></p>

I have set out the dates of birth of their children above.  The parents assert that the applicant was a difficult teenager, who displayed aggressive behaviour towards her siblings and the parents and caused damage to property leading to the police being called on at least one occasion.  It seems that the applicant also got into trouble with the police in other respects, and received cautions for shoplifting and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  The applicant accepts that there were difficulties between her and her parents, but asserts that she was the victim of domestic violence inflicted by them.  She asserts that she suffered years of domestic violence at their hands, culminating in an incident in October 2008 when her father struck her on the head with a plank of wood.  Whatever the circumstances of this incident it is agreed that the applicant left the property and thereafter stayed away from the family home for some time.  She is still living away and currently studying religious studies and sociology at university.  Subsequently, however, a reconciliation of sorts was achieved, although as I have said, she has not returned to live at the family home.</span></p>

After some discussion and negotiations the applicant agreed but only on certain terms, namely: (i) that she had possession of her passport throughout the trip, (ii)  that she had possession of a return ticket throughout the trip, (iii) that an internet connection was set up at the accommodation where she would be staying; and (iv) that her parents paid her a sum equivalent to one week's wages to ensure that she had sufficient money in Bangladesh.  The parents agreed to these conditions and thus the whole family departed for Bangladesh on 15</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August.</span></p>

The agreed facts are as follows. A few days after arriving in Bangladesh, the applicant contacted the British High Commission claiming that she was in danger of being forced into marriage, and with the assistance of members of staff she returned to England on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> August.  About a fortnight later, in early September, B met a young man, R, who is the son of a religious leader in the village where the family was staying.  On 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September, having known R for less than three weeks, B went through a ceremony of marriage with him attended by other family members.  A few days later B spoke to the applicant over the telephone.  The contents of the telephone call are a matter of some uncertainty, but it is the applicant's case that B told her that she was going to get married and did not wish to do so.  </span></p>

At an emergency hearing on that day Bodey J made an order: (i)  giving permission to the applicant to apply for forced marriage protection orders in respect of her six siblings, (ii) making a forced marriage protection order in respect of the applicant and the six children, (iii)  making a non-molestation order preventing the parents molesting or threatening violence towards the applicant or the six children, (iv) directing the parents to produce the six children to the British High Commission in Bangladesh and disclose the children's whereabouts, (v)  directing them to facilitate the return of the children to the jurisdiction within seven days of service of the order; and (vi) making all six children wards of court.  He further made passport orders in respect of the passports of adults and children, and gave other ancillary directions, including listing the matter for a further hearing on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October.</span></p>

It seems that in fact they did not tell Moor J that B was married at all.

With the assistance of the police B thereupon left the family home and moved to a confidential address.  In subsequent conversations with various people, including the applicant, B disclosed the fact that she had, in fact, been married in Bangladesh, and furthermore asserted that she had been forced to go through the marriage ceremony by her parents.  Thereafter, B has lived at a secret location.  She has left the school that she was attending, where she was studying A levels, having previously obtained 12 GCSEs.  She tells the court that she wishes to return to college in September.  </span></p>

Furthermore, I can also confirm that B, at paragraph 3 of her witness statement denies, that there was any marriage in order to be able to return back to Bangladesh as soon as possible, where she was happily married and living with her husband prior to returning to the UK.  I have subsequently realised that it was a mistake on my part to mislead the court, and I now wish to set the record straight and seek the court's clemency in this regard."</span></p>

As to the conditions which she laid down before going on the trip, she said that her father had handed over her passport, and money at the airport, but that the ticket given to her was an open-ended ticket with no return date specified.  She stated that her parent told her that the return flight had to be booked in Bangladesh.  But when they subsequently visited the airline office in Bangladesh, they were told that no flight was available until the end of September.  The applicant asserts that, once in Bangladesh, she was told by her mother that she would be getting  married and kept there for ever.  The applicant then locked herself in her room, although she was able to access the internet which had been set up for her at her request under the conditions agreed prior to the trip.  Through that means she was able to contact her key worker in this country and, via her, the British High Commission.  The applicant's case is that, once back in this country, she spoke to B over the telephone and, as a result of this conversation, she became further concerned about the risk of forced marriage.  </span></p>

There is no reference in the statement to B alleging, during the telephone cal, that she was being forced into a marriage, and later in the statement the applicant asserted that she "believed" that B was being forced into a marriage as a result of the call.

B described how she had been introduced to R shortly before the ceremony by her parents.  She emphatically rejected the suggestion put by Mr. Islam that she had voluntarily formed an attachment to R and married him out of affection.  She described him as a nice person but said she did not want to marry him.  She said that she had got married because she kept having arguments with her mother but could not take any more so just gave in.  She said that she was told by her parents that if she did not agree to getting married she would not be able to return to the UK.  She said that her younger siblings had joined in pressurising her about the marriage.  She had been unable to contact the applicant because the internet connection had only been arranged for one month, which had expired before the suggestion of the marriage was made.  She said that she had not appreciated that the ceremony on 23</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">rd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September was a wedding because it was conducted in Arabic not Bengali. She stated that the plan had been for her to return to the UK and then subsequently arrange for her husband to join her after she was 18.  She described her husband as a very controlling person who insisted on sexual intercourse against her wishes, and spoke of how, after she  returned to England, he would regularly telephone her to check what she was doing.

He stated that the reason why he had misled the court was that, after returning to  this country, B wanted to go back to her husband in Bangladesh, and it was feared that she would be prevented from doing so if they told the court that she had been  married.

I find B, in particular, to be a compelling witness, whose oral evidence was undoubtedly reliable.

I find that, when she contacted the British High Commission in Bangladesh in August, she was genuinely fearful that she would be forced into marriage.  The subsequent events concerning B confirm that her fears were justified.  In short, this is an example of exactly the type of conduct which the forced marriage protection order was created to prevent.  Forced marriage is a serious problem in certain communities in this country, and where it is proved that young people have been forced into marriage, or at risk of being so forced, the court will act to protect them.  </span></p>
