That was approximately 25 years ago.  They married soon afterwards, and have been together ever since, residing in the area of the Applicant Local Authority.  They have no children, although AF has children from a previous marriage.  SF is able to undertake certain domestic tasks, including cooking, but requires increasing levels of support with most of her daily living activities.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It became apparent in 2018 that when AF was leaving home for work, a man known only as &#8216;Dennis&#8217; was visiting the couple&#8217;s home, and taking advantage of SF by engaging in sexual intercourse with her; the evidence strongly suggests that SF did not consent to this sexual activity.   AF was advised of this, and agreed to work with the supporting agencies to prevent any recurrence of this exploitation of his wife.  In these discussions, AF agreed that for the time being he would not engage in sexual intercourse with SF, until clarity could be achieved about her capacity to consent to sexual relations.  Indeed, he advised that they had not engaged in sexual intercourse for 2-3 years, as he had lost his sexual desire.  The police discussed the situation with Dennis, firmly advising him that to pursue a sexual relationship with SF further would be unlawful, as it did not appear that she could consent to sexual intercourse.  Dennis agreed that he would no longer visit SF and, so far as is known, he has not done so. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This investigation into this sexual exploitation provoked more intensive adult social services involvement with the couple.  Concerns were swiftly raised about SF&#8217;s deteriorating mental health, and her diminishing level of functioning. She had, according to AF, experienced and displayed a recent change of personality, declining language skills, and a degree of hypersexuality.  It was apparent that SF was suffering depression for which she was prescribed antidepressants. While an MRI scan in October 2018 had been unremarkable, a repeat scan in September 2019 revealed the presence of &#8220;atrophy that would be abnormal for a person of her age&#8221;. The neurologist considered that this could be consistent with frontal lobe dementia and/or chronic mental illness.   Capacity issues required determination, hence this application. </p>

Dr. O&#8217;Donovan described SF as someone who has always been happy to &#8216;go along with&#8217; a decision even if she would have her own opinion; she cannot now even formulate her own opinion, as the process of gathering information is lost because of her frontal lobe dementia.  This is not attributable simply to her passivity.  In the past, SF is described by her husband as having been &#8220;funny and outgoing&#8221; but &#8220;has got no personality at all now&#8221;.  Dr. O&#8217;Donovan was influenced in her assessment by the fact that SF&#8217;s husband has noted quite &#8220;a significant shift&#8221; in her presentation.  This is important to an understanding of her responses to questions posed relevant to her capacity generally, and specifically in relation to her husband and her attitude to sexual intercourse.  </p>

SF has a premorbid level of knowledge of her husband which she has retained and uses it to make decisions about her relationship with him. There is evidence in dementia that the understanding and conduct within wellestablished long-term relationships remains intact for some time, and this appears to be the case here. Whilst there are concerns that SF may be influenced by her husband, it is likely that this has been a feature of their relationship for many years. Whilst her apathy will have an impact on her decision-making, it would be difficult at present to determine how much of her decision-making is affected by this and to what extent her relationship with her husband has always been of such a nature. However, as her dementia progresses it is likely that this will have a more negative impact on her ability to make decisions about her relationship with her husband.&#8221; (emphasis by underlining added). </p>

Her view that males take the lead when in sexual relationships to decide about sexual relations and that women do not refuse to have sex with their partners, as this would negatively impact on the relationship, indicates that she is aware that she has a choice and has considered the perceived consequences of consent versus refusal. This in the context of her marriage does illustrate a degree of passivity. However, this is not unique to her mental disorder and predates the onset of this.
