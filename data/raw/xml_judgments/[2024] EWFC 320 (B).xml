I have made findings as to final threshold which is appended to an order that I made on 18 September 2024.  The most relevant paragraph in so far as today&#8217;s hearing is concerned is this: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is happily a case where the plan agreed by everybody is for S and A to remain in their mother&#8217;s care.  The sole issue that I have been required to decide, for which I have heard detailed submissions, is whether I should make a supervision order for twelve months, which is what the local authority seeks, or make no order at all, which is what the mother invites me to do, as does the guardian.  S&#8217;s father effectively is in support of her remaining with the mother, the identity of A&#8217;s father is not known.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There has been a psychological report on mum by Dr Gregory.  It sets out that mother demonstrates a large number of traits of borderline personality disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder.  It comments that there are patterns of instability, difficulties in controlling anger and stress-related paranoid ideation as well as patterns of unstable and intensive relationships.  It recommends that she needs to engage with therapy of a multi-disciplinary approach.  It comments that the mother has limited insight into professional concerns and the risks posed.  Notwithstanding this, the recommended work can be done whilst the children remain in her care, but subject to there being respite in the event that the therapy is found to be difficult for her on top of her childcare responsibilities.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I also have the benefit of an independent social work parenting assessment.  It reports that mother has a complex mental health history which she minimises and lacks insight into its effects on the children and her parenting.  It also reports she has a mistrust of professionals.  Having said that, positively, the situation throughout these proceedings has improved.  There is no concern with regard to the home environment and mother&#8217;s mental health has been stable.  However, it defers to the psychologist such that therapeutic support is required to deal with her trauma and to avoid further deterioration at times of increased stress.  It therefore proposes a safety contingency plan and a respite plan devised with the assistance of Dr&#160;Gregory.</p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority in their final evidence comments that there has been a number of marked improvements and that both children now remain in the care of the mother (S having never been removed from her care). The plan is for both children to remain in mother&#8217;s care under a supervision order for twelve months.  </p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A family group conference has taken place which highlights extensive support from mother&#8217;s family both here and abroad.  However, there are concerns as to the co-operation of the mother due to lack of trust with professionals and a subsequent downturn in her mental health which, it is contended, mother remains susceptible to.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children&#8217;s guardian, at the previous hearing before me, questioned whether the matter should conclude by way of a supervision order or whether or not matters could conclude by way of a child in need plan instead, and wished to consider why a supervision order was considered necessary.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, matters have been listed for today for me to give full consideration as to the respective parties&#8217; positions, the matter not having been concluded at the hearing before me on 18 September due to amendments that needed to be made with regard to the proposed support plans and for the guardian to give consideration to them.  The support plans have now been approved by the children&#8217;s guardian.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mother, as I have indicated, opposes a supervision order and has filed a lengthy statement of 19 pages plus a position statement.  I think it is fair to say that mother does not agree with the threshold as found by this court.  Indeed, at the last occasion I determined that that issue should be addressed and heard submissions before determining the final threshold.  Mother has not sought to challenge that subsequently.  She also challenges the evidence that it was based on.  It is fair to say that she holds a certain mistrust of the local authority.  </p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the support plan, she questions its potential benefits.  She feels confident that she will be able to manage her mental health; she has an extensive social network.  She disputes that she lacks insight into her difficulties and quite rightly points out that not all mental health problems prevent a person from adequately parenting children, which indeed is correct, although of course there are cases where the opposite applies.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She maintains that a supervision order is not proportionate to the legitimate aim it sets out and is not necessary.  She is happy to continue to receive support from and to work with the local authority and other professionals.  She points out that S has always been cared for by her, as indeed both her children prior to proceedings and both children have remained in her care for a significant period within the proceedings under the scrutiny of the local authority without concerns being raised.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">
	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue in this case is mother&#8217;s potential deterioration in her mental health and the need for support.  She has a significant support network and, therefore, the involvement of the local authority is likely to be negligible and that the aims set out in the supervision plan can quite equally be met under a child in need plan.  A supervision order adds nothing, and, in any event, she says, lacks teeth by way of compulsion and enforcement.  </p>
	  </content>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s main concern is the potential relapse in mother&#8217;s mental health which, when significant, prevents her from affording the children an appropriate level of care requiring intervention during the recovery process, and without successful completion of the recommended therapy, the risk remains (as per the threshold) The local authority feel, therefore, that matters should be finalised by the underpinning of a supervision order.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">They raise concerns as to mother&#8217;s insight and lack of acceptance of the concerns around her mental health.  They point out that achild in need plan is voluntary and are meant for people and parents who see the need for help and are willing and ready to accept it.  The local authority has concerns as to the potential for mother&#8217;s disengagement and feel that the local authority still needs to maintain oversight, particularly given that the therapy itself may have a detrimental impact on mother&#8217;s mental health, and that a supervision order would provide a statutory basis for ongoing support.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children&#8217;s guardian does not support a supervision order and that matters can be maintained under a child in need plan.  Mother is subject to a positive parenting assessment which supports the children remaining in her care.  That is notwithstanding, of course, the comments made in mother&#8217;s own witness statement.</p>

They also question whether mum really recognises the need for help and support, or indeed will accept that help and support, and therefore such an order, they say, is both necessary and proportionate.</p>
