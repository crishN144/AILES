	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applications arise in the context of Mr John-Baptiste currently preparing, with the assistance of Ms Berg and her extensive experience of reporting on family law cases, a special report into the use by the family courts of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguarding Orders (colloquially known as DoLS orders) in respect of children and young people. Mr John-Baptiste has a particular interest in the care system arising out of his own experience as a looked after child.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of his journalistic investigation, Mr John-Baptiste made contact with Ms Codsi in January 2024.  Ms Codsi is now an adult.  As a child, Ms Codsi was the subject of court orders that have had the effect of restricting her liberty. She recalls being the subject of a DoLS order before being subject to a series of secure accommodation orders pursuant to s.25 of the Children Act 1989.  The orders that this court has been able to locate on the court file comprise the secure accommodation orders made pursuant to s.25 of the Children Act 1989.  It has not yet been possible to locate the DoLS order that Ms Codsi recalls being the subject of.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr John-Baptiste considers that Ms Codsi has a compelling story to tell arising from her being under orders of the court that restricted her liberty (and a story that is not usually told from the perspective of someone who has been the subject of such orders).  Ms Codsi wishes to contribute to the programme that will be produced as the result and to be identified in that programme.  Ms Codsi hopes to highlight her experience of being the subject of such orders.  Within this context, Mr John-Baptiste and Ms Berg contend that there is a public interest in reporting Ms Codsi&#8217;s case in detail, including why the court made the orders it did.  They are also anxious to ensure that the reporting of matters concerning Ms Codsi is fair and accurate, in line with the BBC&#8217;s Editorial Standards as promulgated under its Royal Charter. Within this context, they seek material from the proceedings concerning Ms Codsi as summarised above.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In circumstances where the application concerns a request for disclosure from previous proceedings, on 7 March 2024 the court directed that the Court Office serve the parties to the previous proceedings, in circumstances where it is the court that holds the relevant contact information. The court further directed that any party to the proceedings who sought to oppose the applications should file a Position Statement by 4 April 2024. It has not been possible to serve Ms Codsi&#8217;s parents, who were respondents to the previous proceedings, in circumstances where the court was never provided with their address or addresses.  Indeed, the orders in the proceedings make clear that the whereabouts of Ms Codsi&#8217;s parents remained unknown for the duration over which the court was seised of proceedings with respect to Ms Codsi (and despite the court making a disclosure order against the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on 17 May 2018).  The court has received no representations from the local authority or from Cafcass with respect to the application made by the Ms Berg and Mr John-Baptiste.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Codsi was placed in foster care in November 2016.  Ms Codsi&#8217;s foster placements broke down on several occasions and she experienced multiple moves within the care system before a decision was taken to accommodate her in a residential placement.  As I have noted, Ms Codsi recalls first being made the subject of a DoLS order in the context of a residential placement, before being made the subject of a series of secure accommodation orders pursuant to s.25 of the Children Act 1989, Ms Codsi being placed at one stage in a secure unit in Scotland.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court system records three sets of proceedings with respect to Ms Codsi.  The first in time were proceedings for a secure accommodation order under s.25 of the Children Act 1989, issued on 20 March 2018.  These were followed by proceedings with a public law case number issued on 13 June 2018 and further proceedings, again with a public law case number, issued on 21 September 2018.  Court staff have been able to locate secure accommodation orders made in respect of Ms Codsi on 21 March 2018, 13 June 2018, 15 June 2018, 28 July 2018, 30 August 2018, 20 September 2018 and 1 November 2018.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is apparent from an order of the court dated 15 June 2018 that, during the course of proceedings, the court expressed serious concerns regarding the local authority&#8217;s conduct in discharging its responsibilities towards Ms Codsi, in particular the failure to search for and locate for Ms Codsi a therapeutic placement, rather than a placement that simply acted to contain her, and the failure to provide Ms Codsi with an Education and Health Care Plan (EHCP).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Codsi is now supported by a friend, Ms Verna Casey, a qualified social worker with over thirty years&#8217; experience in fostering and adoption, who currently works as a supervising social worker supporting foster carers caring for looked after children.  The statement of Ms Casey relates that Ms Codsi considers that being the subject of court orders restricting her liberty as a child has had a huge and continuing impact on her life.  Ms Codsi did not understand as a young person why she was placed under such restrictions, stating that no one explained this to her.  Ms Codsi has further stated to Ms Casey that being the subject of such orders felt like a punishment and has created difficulties for her adjusting to life as a young adult and forming healthy relationships. In her own statement in support of the applications before the court, Ms Codsi states as follows:</p>

Mr John-Baptiste contends that there is a strong public interest in his being able to report on Ms Codsi&#8217;s experience of being the subject of orders restricting her liberty for the following reasons:</p>

In these circumstances, very little is known publicly about the individual circumstances, ethnicity and experiences of the children who are made the subject of such orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr John-Baptiste contends that it is important for the public to know that the High Court is making orders restricting the liberty of children and young people in the foregoing context, and to be provided with the opportunity to understand the difficult decisions the courts are required to make and the competing considerations the court must balance when making those decisions.  Mr John-Baptiste contends that the best way to engage the audience on these issues is to focus on the experiences of the children and young people who are made the subject of DoLS orders and provide them with the opportunity to tell their stories in detail.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr John-Baptiste contends that the provision of the transcripts of the hearings at which orders were made with respect to Ms Codsi, the orders made at those hearings and the Skeleton Arguments and Case Summaries used will provide the proper context of her experience and will explain how the orders came to be made.  Mr John-Baptiste further argues that these documents will permit reporting based on full information in circumstances where, for understandable reasons, Ms Codsi&#8217;s recollection of these matters from her childhood is incomplete. Mr John-Baptiste also contends that this approach is consistent with the greater transparency the family courts are seeking to achieve in line with the Transparency Implementation Group Reporting Pilot that was extended on 29 January 2024.</p>

Ms Codsi is one of the subjects of that special report and, as an adult with capacity, also wishes to tell her story by participating in that journalistic endeavour.   In that context, the applications made by the BBC, and supported by Ms Codsi, engage the Art 10 rights of the applicants and the Art 8 and Art 10 rights of Ms Codsi.  Whilst not before the court, the Art 8 rights of the respondents to the proceedings under the Children Act 1989 are also engaged.  Were the applicants seeking to publish the names of social workers or other professionals involved in the day-to-day care of Ms Codsi, their Art 8 rights would likewise be engaged although, as confirmed by Ms Overman, the applicants do not seek to take that course in this case. </p>

In undertaking the required balancing exercise between the Art 10 rights of the applicants and the Art 8 and Art 10 rights of Ms Codsi, I start by reminding myself that neither the Art 10 right to freedom of expression enjoyed by the BBC and by Ms Codsi, nor the Art 8 right to respect for private life enjoyed by Ms Codsi and by the other respondents to the proceedings, has, as such, precedence over the other.  By reason of Ms Codsi&#8217;s agreement to the disclosure and publication of the information sought by the applicants, the rights engaged in this case do not compete as starkly as in some cases.  However, where the material in issue is rendered confidential by operation of s.12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1960, where the rights engaged are nonetheless in tension with each other to a degree, and in circumstances where the rights of the other respondents to the proceedings are also engaged, I consider it remains the responsibility of the court to consider carefully the comparative importance of the competing rights and to take into account the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right.</p>

Even if they are outweighed in the balance by other of her rights or the rights of others, Ms Codsi continues to have inalienable rights under Art 8 of the ECHR.  In the circumstances, pursuant to Art 8 Ms Codsi has a right to respect for private life.  The ambit of that right under Art 8 is a wide one, encompassing not only the narrow concept of personal freedom from intrusion but also Ms Codsi&#8217;s psychological and physical integrity, personal development and the development of social relationships and physical and social identity (see <span style="font-style:italic">Botta v Italy</span> (1998) 26 EHRR 241 at [32] and <span style="font-style:italic">Bensaid v United Kingdom</span> (2001) 33 EHRR 205 at [46] and [47]).  In the context of the background set out above, Ms Codsi makes plain that she continues to struggle with her mental health and has had difficulties adjusting to life as a young adult and forming healthy relationships.  In these circumstances, on the face of it, importance attaches to Ms Codsi&#8217;s Art 8 right to respect for private life when placed in the balance.  The Art 8 right to respect for private life is also important for the other respondents to the proceedings concerning Ms Codsi in circumstances where those proceedings dealt with matters arising in the context of private family life. </p>

This is so because the foundations of democratic society rest, in part, on the free debate of information and ideas.

Ms Codsi wishes to engage with the BBC to tell her story. In particular, she wishes to publicise her view that being the subject of orders that restricted her liberty had a huge and continuing adverse impact on her life, that she was left in the dark as to the reasons she was made the subject of such orders, that the orders resulted in her being supervised and restrained by male carers and that being the subject of such draconian orders felt like a punishment and created difficulties for her adjusting to life as a young adult and forming healthy relationships.  In these circumstances, Ms Codsi wishes to exercise her right to freedom of expression to inform wider society of her belief, as someone who has been the subject of such court orders, imposed on her by the State, that they are antithetic to the care vulnerable children need and wishes to do so through the medium of Mr John-Baptiste&#8217;s special report.</p>

This in the context of Judges of the Family Division and the President of the Family Division having expressed concerns about the use of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to make DoLS orders and the effect those orders have on young people.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept Ms Overman&#8217;s submission that there is an important public interest in the public being able to understand and scrutinise the operation of the family courts.  The family justice system, and the family law that it interprets and applies, provides the forum in which, and the legal framework within which, disputes as between members of society and between members of society and the State arising out of the rights and obligations attendant on familial relationships can be determined.  In these circumstances, the public has a substantial interest in the operation of the family courts. This interest will be particularly acute where the family court scrutinises and endorses, or refuses, intervention in family life by the State.

As was recognised in the American case of <span style="font-style:italic">Brooks v Brooks</span> 35 Barb at 87-88 in 1861, the sound development of the child in all aspects is indispensable to the good order and the just protection of society. Human society benefits from the addition of the child as a member of that society, but the child and society will also suffer if society then fails to safeguard and promote the welfare of that child where the parents have proved, by reason of circumstance or inclination, unable to do so. G's welfare is the court's paramount consideration. But amongst the reasons that this is so is that the wellbeing of our society is dependent upon the physical, emotional and educational health of our children, including G.&#8221;</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">N.&#352;. v Croatia</span> (2020) Application No. 36908/13 at [103], the European Court of Human Rights confirmed that the course of public law proceedings concerning children and any deficiencies in that process are matters of public interest, particularly as regards the functioning of the system of family justice.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The publication of the information sought by the applicants is desired by the person who is the subject of that information.  Publication meets a clear public interest for the reasons I have set out.  The proceedings from which that information arises have now concluded and the circumstances to which the information relates are historic.  Whilst Ms Codsi was a child when the subject of those proceedings, she is now an adult.  Whilst the other respondents to the proceedings benefit from Art 8 rights, they did not at any point participate in those proceedings.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, the disclosure and publication of the information that is the subject of the current application being necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, I am satisfied that the interference in Ms Codsi&#8217;s Art 8 rights and the Art 8 rights of the other respondents to constituted by publication is proportionate. Likewise, in the circumstances described above, prohibiting the publication of the information sought by the applicants cannot be said to be necessary for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary for the purposes of Art 10.  In such circumstances, I am satisfied that refusing the application would constitute a disproportionate inference in the Art 10 rights that are engaged.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, as the family courts continue to promote greater transparency, it may be anticipated that there will be further applications for retrospective disclosure and publication by the press of material from concluded family proceedings.  Indeed, Ms Overman informed the court of a further, and identical application due to be made before Judd J in the days following this hearing.  Where such applications are made, the following matters will need to be borne in mind:</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The application for permission to obtain transcripts from proceedings, disclosure of information from proceedings and permission to publish material from proceedings should be made in the first instance to the court in which the original proceedings were conducted.  Consideration can thereafter be given to the correct tier of Judge to hear the applications, having regard to the allocation guidance.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The information sought by applications of this nature is likely to concern proceedings that have concluded.  In the circumstances, careful consideration will need to be given to how service of the application concerning disclosure and publication will be effected on the parties to the concluded proceedings, whose rights may be engaged.  In cases where only the court which dealt with the proceedings has the contact details for the former parties, it may be appropriate to direct that the court serves the application on such parties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The desire of an individual to tell their story can be a strong one, particularly where that individual considers that he or she has been the victim of an injustice.  Each application of the type made by Ms Berg and Mr John-Baptiste in this case will fall to be determined on its own facts, having regard to the nature of the information from the proceedings which it is sought to publish and the balance of the competing rights engaged.  However, I venture to suggest that it will be an unusual case where the balancing exercise falls against a person who has had their childhood liberty restricted by the State being given permission to publish information relating to the proceedings in which that deprivation of liberty was authorised.  Perhaps more than any who have experienced the family justice system, such children and young people require the hallowed principle of open justice to aid them in drawing their breath and telling their story.</p>
