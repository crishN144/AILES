	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The parents&#8217; relationship ended in around August 2021. The parties each report domestic abuse by the other. Whilst it is accepted that there was some domestic abuse during the relationship, no specific findings as to who perpetrated that abuse have ever been made (each parent says the other assaulted them). On Kate&#8217;s first birthday the father failed to return Kate to her mother&#8217;s care and relocated with her to his mother&#8217;s home in Town B (which is approximately 120 miles away from Town A where the family were living and the mother remains living). Proceedings commenced shortly thereafter when the mother sought a non-molestation order and the father applied for a child arrangements order providing that Kate should live with him. He cited domestic abuse and the mother&#8217;s alleged poor mental health and drug use. In the months that followed, records show that the father told professionals that the mother was &#8216;not involved&#8217; with Kate due to her mental health. The mother was in fact seeking contact with Kate, which the records suggest the father had not prioritised.</span></p>

	  <num style="font-size:11pt">6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">For a substantial period during the proceedings it appears that the mother&#8217;s contact to Kate was restricted to contact centre contact for a couple of hours, and I am told that there were regular breaches of the orders by the father, though I do not have specific details. During the proceedings the court in Town B received two substantive reports from Cafcass (there may have been others but if there were I do not have them). The first, dated April 2023 recommended that the child should remain living with her father and should spend time with her mother every third week from Weds-Sun. The second, dated July 2023 recommended a reversal of those arrangements. The two reports concluded, contrary to concerns raised by each parent about neglect and in particular the adequacy of care for Kate&#8217;s skin condition, that both parents could meet Kate&#8217;s basic care needs to a satisfactory standard and that they each had a good relationship with her. In large part it appears that the shift in recommendation was because there was emerging concern about the father&#8217;s ability to permit Kate to have a relationship with her mother, and even if he allowed contact, about his ability to support that relationship. in the summer of 2023 there appears to have been a brief hiatus in the father&#8217;s contact arising from bruises on Kate&#8217;s ribs which was the subject of a safeguarding investigation, ultimately NFA&#8217;d. I do not know much about what happened in the proceedings in 2022, or why it took so long to reach final hearing, other than that there appear to have been some listing mix ups in 2023. On 2 November 2023 though, having heard evidence from the parents and the Cafcass officer and having considered the evidence within those proceedings, DJ C ordered that Kate should remain based with her mother (as had recently been the case), but should live with her father every third week from Weds-Sun plus half the holidays. The order was expressed in the shared &#8216;live with&#8217; format, perhaps in the hope that the history of adult conflict would be quelled by a recognition of the importance of each parent.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">Whilst unfortunately I do not have DJ C&#8217;s judgment, it is apparent that he must have concluded, on the evidence, that there was no major safeguarding risk that precluded either parent from caring for Kate for long periods, and that it was in Kate&#8217;s welfare interests to be based primarily with her mother, but to spend substantial amounts of time regularly with her father. It must be the case that DJ C concluded, as had all the professionals, that neither mental health nor drug or alcohol use represented a barrier to the mother continuing to meet Kate&#8217;s care needs and from continuing as her primary carer, and nor was there any evidenced risk arising from the bruising investigation that precluded the father continuing to care for Kate unsupervised. Indeed, DJ C must have concluded that this arrangement met Kate&#8217;s needs better than a return to the previous arrangement in Town B would do. </span></p>

However, it is clear from his actions since and from his evidence to this court that the father did not and does not accept that decision, because he has regularly breached it and continues to maintain, through counsel and his own evidence, that the mother poses a risk. The professionals continue to hold different views and say that the mother is a safe parent.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-size:11pt">On 5 March 2024 District Judge Brown found as fact, after hearing both parents&#8217; oral evidence that D failed to return Kate to her mother on 12 November 2023 (only 10 days after the order was made), instead returning her 3 days late on 15 November. The father&#8217;s explanation in his recent statement was that he was &#8216;unable to book a train ticket&#8217; and, by way of attempted clarification in oral evidence, that he probably hadn&#8217;t been able to afford a train ticket but couldn&#8217;t remember why he had returned Kate late, as it was a long time ago. </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-size:11pt">On 5 March 2024 District Judge Brown found as fact, after hearing both parents&#8217; oral evidence that D failed to return Kate on 3 December 2023, only returning her on 21 December when, at an urgently convened hearing in Town B that day, Recorder Stott ordered him to return Kate by 6pm. The father&#8217;s explanation for this breach in his recent statement was that a welfare check on 3 December by a social worker meant that &#8216;the contact schedule was disrupted&#8217; and he was &#8216;unable to return Kate until 21 December&#8217;. In oral evidence when asked to expand the father told me that the welfare check was in fact by a police officer in uniform and that this distressed Kate so he was unable to return her. However, he had also told me that the officer arrived as he was putting Kate to bed on 3 December. Given that she was due for return to her mother earlier that day it appears he had decided not to return her on time before the police attended. The father told me that the following day, he discovered that the mother had raised a concern about bruising sustained by Kate and that on realising that there was another live safeguarding investigation he &#8216;simply said [to himself] this is not gonna carry on its gonna stop. something needs to be done&#8217;, and he decided to take Kate into the police station to show them she was fine (as told both to the social worker and myself). When asked if he thought this was child focused given that he had earlier told me that Kate had been very distressed at seeing a police officer in uniform, he changed his evidence to suggest that he had &#8216;just remembered now&#8217; that he had not taken her in to the station, leaving me unclear what to make of his suggestion that the purpose of the visit was to show Kate to the police. </span></p>

It is accepted that Kate had been delivered late to this contact (two days late on 9 February) as a result of her being unwell with a swollen arm following her MMR earlier that week, though D says that the mother&#8217;s concerns were exaggerated. Having read the GP records, and seen the pictures of the redness and marked swelling (which the father was sent at the time) I do not agree.

Since those documents predate the decision of DJ C I considered that I can proceed without them because they were available to DJ C and were factored them into his decision. For instance, the suggestion in the position statement that the mother had pursued &#8216;false allegations of sexual abuse&#8217; by means of a C2 at some unspecified point in the previous proceedings was wisely not pursued. There is no trace of it in the Cafcass reports, and in any event it did not give DJ C sufficient concern to prevent him making the order he did. It would clearly have been impossible for me to consider making findings that &#8216;false&#8217; allegations were made when no notice has been given and I have no evidence at all (even in the father&#8217;s statement) of what those allegations were let alone to conclude that they were false. What is apparent from the older papers is that the mother at one point used the term &#8216;grooming&#8217; to refer to alleged manipulation of her older daughters by the father during the relationship and post-separation, that she had not intended to imply sexual misconduct, and that it took some time to unpick this crossed wire; and that a social worker raised concerns about the inappropriateness of the father sending naked pictures of Kate to her (to show the issues regarding her skin condition), and about boundaries in the household. Those matters are not current and are not relevant to my determination. </span></p>

In her report and oral evidence she made clear that the father had poor insight into the effect of his behaviour on Kate, her mother and the whole household.

When challenged on the impromptu account of taking Kate to the police station the next day, given Kate had been &#8216;very distressed&#8217; by the mere sight of police the night before, he changed his account and said she hadn&#8217;t gone in.

In fact, Kate&#8217;s GP records (and the GPs later explanation to the social worker) confirm the mother appropriately sought medical attention for what is obvious from the photographs was a quite significant reaction to her jab. It was striking that the father did not seem to accept that the mother was right to delay the long drive to Town B until she was feeling better, and that he suggested to me she had been withheld for five days, before being reminded of the dates and the court&#8217;s findings, when he accepted in fact that Kate had been brought only 2 days late.

I have formed the view in light of this specific evidence and the tenor of the father&#8217;s evidence overall, that &#8216;safeguarding&#8217; was a pretext for keeping Kate, simply because he wanted to keep Kate.</span></p>

He acted knowing he was breaching the orders, and did so purposefully. In my judgment he will have known that his actions would leave the mother fearful as to when she would see her daughter again, that his actions in retention (and inaction in not communicating with her or applying to the court) would compel her to expend time and energy trying to recover Kate&#8217;s care through court applications, thus forcing her to expend her own resources for his own gain, and heavily impacting her everyday activities: she has been criticised at every turn for her care of Kate and forced into jumping through hoops in order to secure contact with her child, even though she already has orders to that effect. Even if it was not his intention or specific motivation, he acted knowing that the order prohibited his actions (these were not inadvertent breaches), and he knew or ought to have known that those actions would have these consequences for the mother (if not the first time, on all subsequent occasions). </span></p>

The father must have known that his actions would have had that effect on the mother and it seems to me that in the simple meaning of the words he has used Kate to both punish and frighten her mother.

I am bound to say that it appears with the benefit of hindsight that this has been a pattern of behaviour that probably goes back as far as the initial removal to Town B on Kate&#8217;s first birthday.

I know precious little about the paternal grandmother, save that the mother considers her instrumental in the father&#8217;s relocation of Kate to her home in 2021, and as a member of the household who has retained her repeatedly since, (and I note the record of her supporting the father at meetings in the course of the s47 enquiry relating to the bruises, when she told the social workers that the mother had &#8216;munchausens by proxy&#8217;). The social worker did not consider she could supervise contact and I agree. Any supervisor must be independent, and to be able to be relied upon to challenge and enforce the rules, and to report breaches. Without making any findings against the grandmother, who I have not heard from, such a close family member is patently not suitable for this role. That necessarily will restrict Kate&#8217;s contact with her father, but it is in my view unavoidable. It may be that funding will further limit that contact, but I cannot be dissuaded from my conclusion as a result of cost alone.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">I do not think it is appropriate (or even possible in light of the current lack of DAPP provision) to direct the father to attend a DAPP. I agree that if he developed sufficient insight and acceptance of my findings to be accepted on such a course, and if he could find the funds to attend such a course privately, that would probably be beneficial. But I have no doubt that at present he would not qualify for a DAPP, since he is absolutely clear he is not a perpetrator of domestic abuse. In any event my order is not necessary in order for him to privately fund a DAPP should he wish to.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">What is clear is that if the father is to seek unsupervised contact at any stage in the future he must be able to evidence a development in his thinking and to reassure the mother that he will adhere to orders or agreements. Whether that is through (in part) successful completion of a DAPP, counselling or some other work I know not. What I am clear about is that I cannot now plot a chart through to unsupervised contact, I am not able to assume there will be a material change of circumstances, and I cannot let the tail wag the dog. Kate&#8217;s needs now and for the foreseeable future are for supervised contact. If and when that changes  the matter will have to be considered on its merits at the time. If the parents can agree a move forwards I will not prevent that, but any changes must be agreed clearly in writing before being implemented. In the event that the parents cannot agree between themselves or with the help of a mediator or arbitrator, the father must apply back to the court with such supporting evidence as he can provide.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">In my view on any basis supervised contact should continue for a year, and there can be no proper basis for applications from the father to progress or vary contact in this period. In view of the litigation fatigue that it is clear the mother is suffering from, and remote prospect of sufficient change, it seems to me that I should make a s91(14) order against the father for a period of two years. A s91(14) order will not prevent an application in the case of genuine safeguarding concern, or evidenced material change of circumstances, but my order does mark the importance of a period of stability and calm without litigation until Kate is well established in her school life. In my view that is a proportionate order to make. </span></p>

Regrettably a large number of judges have dealt with this case and it has not benefited from judicial continuity but it need not return before me in view of my part time status, as that is likely to cause undue delay. A copy of this judgment must be appended to any future application.</span></p>

Neither the parents nor Kate will be identified, and I will remove reference to Town B, stating only that it is a town approximately 120 miles from Kate&#8217;s home with her mother. My provisional view, subject to representations is that these arrangements will reflect an appropriate balance between the parties Article 8 rights and the countervailing &#8216;open justice&#8217; factors. Any objections to publication or representations about the specifics of anonymisation can be made at the hand down hearing or, if further time is required by email to the court, copied to the other party, by 4pm on 23 August.</span></p>
