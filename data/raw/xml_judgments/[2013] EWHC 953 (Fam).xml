	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Huntington&#8217;s disease, formally known as Huntington&#8217;s Chorea and now often shortened to HD, is a hereditary disorder of the central nervous system caused by a defective gene on chromosome IV. The faulty gene causes damage of the nerve cells and areas of the brain which in due course leads to physical, mental and emotional change. Anyone whose parent has the disease is born with a fifty per cent chance of inheriting the gene. Anyone who inherits the gene will, at some stage, develop the disease. The symptoms usually emerge when people are between ages 30 and 50, although in some rare instances they arise at an earlier stage. The extent of the symptoms varies from person to person. In the later stages of the disease, the physical and mental disabilities can become profound and, if so, much care and support is required.</p>

The boys are the subject of care proceedings in the county court in which the local authority is likely to propose that they be placed for adoption. The question therefore arises as to whether the boys should be tested for HD in the course of these proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Y, now aged 3, and Z, now aged rising 2, are the children of a 21-year-old mother and a 44-year-old father who never married but lived for several years in a turbulent relationship characterised by drug abuse and occasional domestic violence. The family was referred to social services by the police in January 2012 and a child protection conference was convened in March, at which the father admitted he had been violent to the mother. The father also informed the conference that his mother and brother suffered from HD, and that he suspected that he too suffered from that condition. A child protection plan was drawn up and implemented providing that the father should not return to the family home. In May 2012, however, social services discovered that the father was still at the property. The police were called and illegal drugs were found in the property. At that point, the mother agreed that the children should be accommodated by the local authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. She subsequently obtained non-molestation and occupation orders against the father. A parenting assessment of the mother carried out by the local authority concluded that she lacked insight into her problems and the concerns about the children, and did not have the capacity to care for the children so as to enable them to maintain the progress they had made in foster care. The father has chosen not to comply with any proposed assessment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In January 2013, the mother and her new partner attempted unsuccessfully to remove the children from their foster home. On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, the local authority filed an application for care orders in respect of both boys. At the first hearing on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, the Family Proceedings Court transferred the case to the county court on the grounds of complexity including inter alia the question whether the children should be tested for HD. On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February, a circuit judge gave directions including listing the matter before a judge of the Family Division to determine whether the children should be tested for the HD gene. Save for that issue, the proceedings remain in the county court where they are currently listed for an issues resolution hearing on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, some four weeks hence. In those proceedings, it is anticipated that the local authority will file a care plan proposing that the children be placed for adoption. </p>

Most cases concerning applications under section 38(6) involve a proposal to examine or assess the child for the purposes of obtaining information specifically to assist the court in reaching its ultimate decision in the care proceedings: see eg <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C (Interim Care Order: Residential Assessment)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 1</ref>, and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T (Residential Parenting Assessment) </span>[2011] EWC 8 Civ 812, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 308" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 308</ref>.

It is her evidence that, if Y and Z do not have HD, the local authority should be in a position to identify an adoptive placement for them within six months. Although it is more difficult to find adoptive placements for sibling groups, the fact that the boys are young should be a positive factor when seeking such a placement in this case. At present, this local authority has two families approved for a sibling group of two children, together with others whose application to be approved are in the pipeline. In the event that the local authority is unable to find such a placement from its own resources, it is able to widen its searches to seek to find a suitable family from within the region or nationally. </p>

If it proves impossible to find a placement that will take both children where one has the gene, the local authority would consider separating the children so that the child without the gene is placed for adoption and the child with the gene remains in foster care.</p>

All genes come in pairs and the defective parent will have a normal gene and an abnormal gene. When they come to have children, they have a 50:50 chance of passing on the abnormal gene. When genetic testing is carried out, there is a clear answer in 98% of cases. In small minority where the answer is unclear, it is now known that these intermediate results may cause a milder later onset pattern of disease. Otherwise, the test does not predict the age of onset of the disorder. It simply determines whether the gene is passed on or not. This aspect of the test is accurate and as it is usually run twice in the laboratory, there is no scope for false positive or false negative results. </p>

He discusses the pros and cons of predictive testing and goes through the reasons why people at risk may choose to take the test, for example to reduce uncertainty, because they wish to start a family, or to deal with issues about insurance and employment. He draws attention to the progress in  research and informs the patient that it is his view that there may be new approaches to treatment that will alleviate the condition. After this preliminary consultation, Professor Patton allowed the patient a period of about a month to consider the points raised. Thereafter, if the patient wishes to proceed, the test is taken and the results are available within 4 weeks. </p>

This does not entail our recommending that families should avoid discussing the issues with younger children, but rather that formal genetic testing should generally wait until the &#8216;children&#8217; request tests for themselves, as autonomous adults. This respect for autonomy and confidentiality would entail the deferral of testing until the person is either adult, or is able to appreciate not only the genetic facts of the matter but also the emotional and social consequences of the various possible test results. </p>

Arguments against testing, in addition to those identified above, would include specific points relating to adoption namely &#8216;that the diagnosis will label the child and affect the (already difficult) process of identity development [and] that it is irrelevant to the needs of the child for the acceptance as he/she is&#8230;..&#8217; The working party continued:</p>

In practice, this situation may arise infrequently, but will call for a careful consideration of the child&#8217;s overall best interests when it does so. In general, it would seem best, wherever possible, to find adopters who can accept the child as a whole, and subsequently participate in any testing that is appropriate for the child as a confirmed member of their family.&#8221;</p>

Professor Patton summarises his own experiences of the main reasons for not using predictive testing in a child as being that it would not produce any medical gain for the child and, whilst there may be no medical harm as a result of the test, there could be adverse psycho-social consequences from having a diagnosis of an adult disorder in the future. He highlights, in particular, the risk of discrimination, altered relationships with parents and siblings, and the removal of the child&#8217;s autonomy in making his or her own decision at a later and more relevant stage in his life. Furthermore, Professor Patton points out that, whereas the likelihood of both children being free from HD mutation is 25%, the chances that one is affected and the other not is 50%. There is therefore a significant risk that testing may lead to the children being separated if an adoptive placement can be found for the child who does not carry the gene.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is difficult to determine the psychosocial harms and benefits of testing in childhood. Most discussions on this issue have focussed on the right to make the decision and the impact on the child&#8217;s (future) autonomy. Opposition in genetic testing in childhood where there is no direct or medical benefit is rooted in concerns to protect the future autonomy of the child, i.e. preserving the right of the child to make his/her own decision. On the other hand, it has been argued that parents have the right to make decisions on behalf of their children because they have primary responsibility for their child and they know their child best. The lack of evidence to corroborate that testing young people would cause psychosocial harm and the fact that existing guidelines are based on assumptions rather than empirical evidence has also been highlighted. Assumptions about harms have included the possible lessened self esteem, distortion of the family&#8217;s perception of the child, altered upbringing, discrimination and increased anxiety both of parent and child. Arguments in support of testing children/young people are that the untested child loses the opportunity to grow up with and adapt to genetic knowledge during his/her formative years and that not testing may cause harm if parents were made anxious and the young person finds uncertainty difficult.&#8221;</p>

On the other hand, adopting parents face multiple uncertainties about any child they adopt, and the desire to reduce uncertainty, when this is possible, is understandable. We think that there may be special circumstances which mean that genetic tests are undertaken  for adoptive children, although they would not be carried out at that stage for children in the care of their birth families. Even so, we recommend caution for carrier testing (or future reproductive significance only) and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">even more so for predictive testing for later onset conditions (with no useful medical interventions in childhood)</span>  [my emphasis].&#8221;</p>

Mr. Reynolds invited the court to conclude that the uncertainty about the father had the effect of halving the statistical likelihood of the boys carrying it, so that the chances of both boys having inherited the gene were reduced to 12.5% and of one boy having inherited it but not the other reduced to 25%.

In particular, it is submitted that, from a psychological perspective, knowing the position one way or the other is better than not knowing at all. The local authority&#8217;s case is that, from a welfare perspective, whatever the psychological consequences of testing, they are outweighed by the likelihood that an unknown diagnosis will significantly decrease the chances of a successful adoption. </p>

The respondents submit that any outcome which leads to the separation of the children should be the last resort. Separating the children will deprive each of the life long sibling relationship which is so important to children who are removed from their birth parents. In addition, the child left in foster care will be in danger of particular disadvantage, carrying a stigma of a child in care throughout his childhood as well as the difficulties he will face having inherited the gene. The respondents contend that it should be an overriding priority and those planning for the future of these children that they should stay together. </p>

I have to say that I cannot at present conceive of any circumstances in which this would be other than an abuse of power as directly or indirectly requiring the practitioner to act in contrary to the fundamental duty which he owes to his patient.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is, as all parties accept, a significant possibility that both boys carry the gene and a greater possibility that one boy carries it but not the other. Professor Patton assesses the former possibility as 25% and the latter at 50%, assuming their father has the gene. On the latter point, however, there is uncertainty. One course would be to make a finding as to whether the father has the gene, but given the paucity of the evidence that would not be feasible. The local authority, supported on this point by the other parties, invites me to halve the figures cited by Professor Patton to take account of the uncertainty about whether the father has the gene. In the absence of expert evidence from a statistician, however, it would be unwise to make a precise calculation as to the statistical possibility of one or both of the boys having the gene.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the right basis on which to make the decision about testing is as stated above, namely that there is a significant possibility that both boys carry the gene and a greater possibility that one boy carries it but not the other.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_44">
	  <num>44.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The principal arguments in favour of testing seem to me to be as follows. First, and most importantly, a decision not to direct genetic testing will reduce the number of prospective adopters for the boys. I accept that, if Y and Z cannot be returned to the care of their parents, it is in their interests to be found permanent placements that provide them with as much security as possible. In most cases, adoption is the option that provides the greatest security. In every case, however, an assessment has to be made as to which outcome meets the needs of the children. I accept the opinion of SS and the position of the local authority that, if the tests are not carried out, it will be significantly harder to find adoptive placements for the boys. I do not, however, accept that it will be impossible to find adoptive placements in those circumstances. The guardian considers that it is possible to find adoptive placements for both boys and that accords with this court&#8217;s experience of cases involving children being placed for adoption. Many children with profound disabilities are successfully adopted. Nevertheless, I accept that it will be significantly more difficult to find adoptive placements and that this is a factor that points in favour of authorising the genetic testing at this stage. Furthermore, there is considerable force in the argument that matching children with adopters who are fully informed about the children affords the best opportunity for a successful placement.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_45">
	  <num>45.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are, in addition, other factors in favour of authorising testing in this case. As a general rule, all children have a right to be brought up with knowledge of their background and inheritance. Unless and until testing is done, there will always be uncertainty which will affect the children&#8217;s carers and in due course the children themselves. I note the point made in the research literature that, as children are not, as a matter of course, tested and thus do not acquire knowledge about the genetic inheritance until they have become adults, the medical consensus against testing in these circumstances is substantially based on assumptions about psychological and social harm rather than empirical evidence. In addition, although there is no course of counselling specifically designed for children to assist them to come to terms with the knowledge that they will develop a serious disease in adult life, it would obviously be possible to devise a course drawing on counselling that is given in other circumstances.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, it is the general practice not to provide genetic testing to children to determine whether they have a condition whose onset occurs in mid adult life where there is no treatment which could be provided in childhood. I accept the evidence of Professor Patton, who is a world-renowned expert in this field, that it is generally recognised that it is contrary to the interests of the patient for testing to be carried out under the age of 18. Professor Patton describes in careful detail the preparatory steps he takes with all patients prior to a decision being taken about testing. Those steps require the patient to have the capacity to comprehend and reflect on the issues before taking the decision. Professor Patton also describes the programme of therapy and counselling available for dealing with adults who have been diagnosed as having the gene, and for helping them come to terms with the risk of psychological harm and the sociological and economic consequences of the diagnosis. Although as stated above I think it likely that a course of counselling could be devised for children in these circumstances, I accept his evidence that there is currently no set or recognised process for addressing the risks of psychological harm which, I find, will be likely to arise.</p>

	  <num>48.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, and following from the previous point, I accept the principle that it is undesirable to treat children differently simply because they are being considered for adoption. I accept the argument set out in the BAAF paper quoted above that all children, whether they are living with their birth families, being looked after by local authority or adopted, need protection from the potentially negative effects of genetic testing. Therefore, wherever possible, unless there are convincing indications to the contrary, looked after children should have the same rights as children who are living with their birth families. Save in exceptional circumstances, all other children will be given the opportunity to decide for themselves when they are older whether or not they should have the test. To order testing of Y and Z at this stage would deny them the right to make their own decision when they are older. I reject the submission that this point should carry little weight because it is based on personal autonomy. Manifestly, personal autonomy is part of the characteristics of a child, and thus a factor within the checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(3)</ref>(d) to be taken into account in any assessment of his welfare. Furthermore, personal autonomy is an integral aspect of a person&#8217;s right to private and family life under Article 8. As Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">NHS Trust A v M</span><span style="font-style:italic"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] Fam 348" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] Fam 348</ref> at para 41 ,&#8220;Article 8 protects the right to personal autonomy, otherwise described as the right to physical and bodily integrity. It protects a patient&#8217;s right to self-determination and an intrusion into bodily integrity must be justified under Article 8(2)&#8221;. More recently, the European Court of Human Rights has observed in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses of Moscow v Russia</span> [2011] 53 EHRR 4 (at para 136) that : &#8220;The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy.&#8221;</p>

Adopters are found for children with profound disabilities with reduced life expectancy. Here, it is very unlikely that a child carrying the gene will develop the disease until mid life. A crucial component of any search for adoption is educating those who come forward. I agree with Professor Patton&#8217;s view that prospective adopters should have the option of knowing more about the disorder and in particular how today&#8217;s research is leading to the possibility of treatment in the future. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, when children have been removed permanently from their birth family, it is important, if possible, that they be placed permanently together. As stated above, there is a significantly greater risk that one boy will be found to carry the gene and the other not. In those circumstances, there is, on the basis of the local authority&#8217;s plans, a significant prospect that these children will ultimately be separated. Such a course would not only cause emotional harm to each boy by separating him permanently from his brother but also be likely to cause additional harm to whichever boy is left in foster care in the form of psychological harm through having to grow up with knowledge for which he may not be prepared and the risk of severe damage to his self-esteem. I accept the view of the guardian, and the parents, that this course should be avoided if possible and that the children can be placed together. </p>

The risk, identified in the consensus of opinion amongst professionals working in this field including Professor Patton, of emotional and psychological harm to the boys if one or both of them has the gene, including the risk of separation of the siblings and the damage to their personal autonomy by being deprived of the right, available to all other children, to decide for themselves when they reach adulthood whether or not to undergo the test, outweighs the risk of harm arising from the likelihood that it will be harder (though not, in my judgment, impossible) to find an adoptive placement if genetic testing is not carried out. </p>

It is to be stressed that this decision involves an untreatable condition which is unlikely to develop until mid-adult life. Cases involving conditions that develop during childhood, or which are susceptible to treatment in childhood, will involve a very different balancing exercise and are likely to lead to a different conclusion. </p>
