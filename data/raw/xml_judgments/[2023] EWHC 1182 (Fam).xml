She described X as being visibly distressed and shaking and asked Ms H for help, including if she could find someone who protects children and showed her a handwritten letter addressed to the NSPCC. Ms H asked if X had spoken to her mother and reports X saying her mother does not  understand and cannot protect her. X described hearing her mother on the phone crying, looking for properties in Mauritius and when she asked her mother if everything was okay she responded it was fine and not to worry. Ms H considers X had not been told about any order for return and X had worked it out by overhearing conversations. X informed Ms H she had google searched how she could be helped and represented in court. As the Safeguarding &amp; Child Protection Officer at the school, Ms H states she made a referral to the local authority and sought further information from the Head Teachers Forum. It was through that forum that she was given the name of Ms Broadley and made contact with her. Ms H confirms the school has continued to support X and states X is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;petrified of going back to Mauritius. She does not believe her mother really understands how strongly she feels and how scared she is.&#8217;</span></p>

Whilst this is to the mother&#8217;s credit, the resultant effect is that [X] feels completely shut out of decisions made about her and feels that she has not been heard properly.&#8217;</span> Ms Broadley set out her experience in representing children in international child abduction proceedings and her assessment of X&#8217;s competence to instruct her. She agrees with Ms Callaghan&#8217;s that X&#8217;s maturity is commensurate with her age and her headteacher&#8217;s description of X&#8217;s maturity as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;sophisticated maturity beyond her years&#8217;.</span> In Ms Broadley&#8217;s view <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;It is the earnestness and strength in which she conveys her wishes and feelings and why she feels the way she does and that it is consistent with what she believes is right for her which satisfies me without doubt that [X] is competent to instruct me. [X] is a naturally guarded person when she speaks but the more you speak to her the more she opens up and conveys how she feels with quiet conviction&#8230;In my view, her level of maturity and level of understanding and her ability to reflect upon in a mature manner her short, medium and long term interests, demonstrates to me a very quietly determined and capable young person.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her second statement, dated 15 March 2023, after Ms Broadley had the opportunity to consider the trial bundle, the note of Ms Callaghan&#8217;s evidence and further discussions with X she states that X <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;instructs me in a very assured, compelling, clear and heartfelt terms that she will not go back to Mauritius. This is not said in a churlish or disrespectful way. [X] carries a gentle and sweet sincerity in how she expresses herself in her belief that that she has not been heard effectively in these proceedings as she struggles with how and why the court would order her return to Mauritius, she would say, a return which would take her away from a country which she strongly identifies as her home.&#8217;</span> Ms Broadley considers X has the intelligence to comprehend the Hague process and a court order being made, it is  at an emotional level with which X <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;struggles&#8217;.</span>  Ms Broadley distinguishes X from other children who have sought her advice in similar circumstances. Ms Broadley considers <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;There is immense anguish and confusion which [X] appears to have internalised, dealing with it by deflecting away from facing those feelings and memories&#8217;.</span> Ms Broadly stated she was not surprised by Ms Callaghan&#8217;s evidence that X kept deflecting from talking about Mauritius save in a superficial way, and considers it may be a coping mechanism for X, coupled with the fact that she only met Ms Callaghan once and Y was present. As Ms Broadley sets out <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;For whatever reason, the depth and extent of [X&#8217;s] wishes and feelings and her objection to a return to Mauritius was not evident  when the matter came before this court for final determination; but it is clearly evident now&#8230;Her anxiety and anguish at the prospect of her going back has clearly heightened and changed with her suffering sleepless nights, crying every day&#8230;The strength of her feeling caused her to research being represented by her own solicitor and seeking help from her teacher, teaching assistant and head teacher. She felt unable to turn to her mother and in fact she currently refuses to talk to her mother&#8230;When I suggested her mother may have been shielding her from court proceedings she refused to accept this describing times when she has felt the need to protect her mother from her father&#8217;s, at times&#8217; violent and abusive behaviour. Whilst she instructs me that she loves her mother dearly she sadly does not have any confidence in her mother&#8217;s ability to protect her and her brother from harm&#8230;She herself describes being the focus of his anger and outbursts and later he behaves normally as if nothing has happened which also frightens her. She will not return to Mauritius and refuses to feel that sense of fear and dread again.&#8217;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the previous judgment, I summarised the written evidence from the parents and have reconsidered that evidence again. In their most recent statements they have each emphasised their respective position. The father considers X&#8217;s desire to remain in the UK is based on a preference which has come about due to her aligning herself with her mother&#8217;s wishes, as Ms Callaghan referred to. He considers X&#8217;s wishes have hardened due to the outcome of the earlier hearing. He states &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">The only place where we call home is Mauritius, and this is where issues in relation to [X&#8217;s] and [Y&#8217;s] welfare ought to be determined.&#8217;</span> The father sets out in his statement the positive evidence about X and Y&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;caring and nurturing&#8217;</span> life in Mauritius, relying on the positive school reports for X in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The father denies X&#8217;s account of her alleged fear of him, stating her fear has  no reflection in reality, as he only had very limited contact with her since November 2020. He says he has done what he can to try and maintain his relationship with her and places the responsibility for the difficulties on the mother. His view is the mother has exposed X to her own views about the father. The father denies the allegations of abusive behaviour, although recognises that X was present during arguments between her parents which he places responsibility for on the mother. He takes issue with many aspects of the account given by X in Ms Broadley&#8217;s statement about her father and the time in Mauritius. He considers he and X had a loving relationship prior to the parties separation in November 2020 and he has produced a number of videos to demonstrate that. His fear is if X does not return to Mauritius that his relationship with X will be irreparably damaged and details the more recent difficulties he has experienced in maintaining contact with X and Y. Although the final details regarding the protective measures are now in place the father describes the mother placing obstacles to those being put in place. The father considers X will comply with any orders made by the court, stating it is within the mother&#8217;s gift to ensure X returns to Mauritius, he considers &#8216;&#8230;<span style="font-style:italic">the circumstances since the making of the return order have not changed in any way and all relevant issues have been considered by this court.&#8217;</span> and that X should not become <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;overburdened and conflicted by being allowed to decide her own fate in this manner&#8217;.</span></p>

It appears the mother did not tell X  about the court&#8217;s decision at the time, for the reasons she gives, now feels she is not trusted by X and is blamed by the father for the situation they are now in. The change in X has had a direct impact on her relationship with her mother and brother, her behaviour within the home and her attendance at school. The mother fears for the emotional consequences for X if the set aside application is not successful.</p>

Whilst Ms Broadley agrees with the assessment of X&#8217;s maturity being commensurate with her age the court now has the additional evidence from Ms H and the evidence in Ms Broadley&#8217;s statements. Ms Broadley describes X informing her she will not return to Mauritius in <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;very assured, compelling and heartfelt terms&#8217;</span>. She describes her manner as being quiet and determined. The impact on X of the previous order has caused X serious stress and anxiety such that she requires counselling and Ms H referred the matter to the local authority. The evidence provides details of what X&#8217;s own experiences have been from her perspective. The mother details in her statement the difficulties that have occurred in their relationship. Ms Baker refutes any suggestion by the father that this is being orchestrated by the mother and relies on the evidence from Ms H and Ms Broadley about the way they were approached, and Ms Broadley&#8217;s view about whether X has been coached by the mother. </p>

The desire to remain here and her objections to return to Mauritius are consistent with her overall welfare interests, understandable bearing in mind the period of time she had spent living here prior to 2019 and the circumstances in Mauritius from her perspective. Ms Baker recognises the court must have regard to the powerful policy considerations in this case but when balanced with the other matters she submits the discretion should be exercised so that X is not ordered to return to Mauritius.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If the court does exercise its discretion so as not to order X&#8217;s return, Ms Baker submits the court needs to consider Y&#8217;s position. She submits for the children to be separated would result in each of them being placed in an intolerable situation and they would be at grave risk of psychological harm. This is due to the fact that they have never lived separately, their mother has always been their main carer and the father has never had the full time care of Y, other than for limited periods of time. The impact of the harm and the level of intolerability cannot be ameliorated by the protective measures offered by the father. The level and nature of the contact proposed by the father is entirely different to what Y has known to date and is likely to have long term impact on Y and his relationship with both his mother and X.  She submits the threshold is established in relation to both Y and X and when the court re-visits the discretion, whilst factoring in the important policy considerations, the balance falls clearly in favour of the court refusing to order Y&#8217;s return.</p>

The deterioration in X&#8217;s emotional presentation, writing the letter to the NSPCC and her position as set out in the statements from Ms Broadley which clearly describe X&#8217;s objections and the impact on her if a return is ordered. This is not a situation of parental influence as X considers she needs to protect her mother from the father and does not feel the mother can protect her and Y.

Any proceedings in Mauritius are likely to take many years and there are more limited provisions for her engagement in those proceedings, both  of which is likely to have a further detrimental impact on her. He submits that this defence is met in relation to both children. In relation to Y the father&#8217;s revised position regarding separation will place Y in a position that he has not experienced before, namely living separately from his mother and sister, with them remaining in another jurisdiction and Y with a parent who has never had his full time care previously. Such separation, he submits, is likely to put both children at grave risk of psychological harm and place them in an intolerable situation. In relation to X he submits to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the return of this articulate intelligent 12 year old would have a significant impact on her physical and mental health and such a return would put her at risk of grave risk of harm.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Kirby accepts the real issue is whether the court&#8217;s discretion should be exercised in a different way. She resists that relying on the following matters. X has been under the influence of her mother with no contact with her father for a number of months, in circumstances where the mother has not supported the continued relationship between the children and their father. The Hague Convention policy factor is important in the circumstance of this case, where the mother took the action she did, an application could have been made in Mauritius and there is no evidence that the actions taken by the mother were child focussed. Her actions disrupted the relationship between the children and the father and disrupted the children&#8217;s schooling. The aggravating features before, during and since the court&#8217;s decision in February, including the poor handling of the way X was informed of the courts decision, the inability of the mother to support ongoing contact with the long term consequences of that and how credible it is that X was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;used by M as a last ditch effort to set aside/not enforce the order that had been made correctly on the law&#8217;.</span> The father is confident that the mother and X would not want to be separated from Y and they would return to Mauritius if a return order was made in relation to Y, he considers <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;it would be worth the short term separation from his sister and his mother for his longer term interests of having a relationship with both of his parents&#8217;.</span> The most recent complaint of domestic abuse was more than a year prior to the abduction and that related to allegations about the father allegedly having shouted at X. The mother&#8217;s own complaints of domestic abuse were two years prior to the abduction. The protective measures now in place manage any risks relied upon. There remains, Ms Kirby submits, great uncertainty about the children&#8217;s position in this jurisdiction, including their accommodation, the distance from their school and which school X will be attending in September when she moves to year 7.</p>

Ms Kirby suggests the increase in X&#8217;s objections since 3 February 2023 is likely to have been influenced by her mother as she now is unable, as she could to Ms Callaghan, say anything positive about her school or life in Mauritius and now suggests her mother cannot protect her, which she did not mention to Ms Callaghan. Ms Kirby suggests that the mother may have instructed X to go to her school rather than take her straight to a solicitor. She submits the court should not be swayed by X stating she will not return to Mauritius, it is likely, bearing in mind the wider evidence about X, that she would comply with any order.</p>

Ms Kirby submits if this is right it leaves X in a more vulnerable position here where there is no, or limited, wider family support. What is more apparent now is the impact on X of what she reports she observed regarding the alleged abusive behaviour between her parents and what she alleges was directed towards her. Whilst the father in his written evidence denies any such behaviour and there has been not findings about that behaviour, he does not demonstrate any recognition, from X&#8217;s perspective, of the impact she reports such behaviour has had on her.</p>

However, I need to weigh in the balance the length of time such an application would take (1-2 years, if not more) and the detrimental impact that delay would have on X.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">Whilst the policy considerations remain strong, in the light of the evidence the court now has they are, in my judgment, outweighed by the other evidence and considerations in this case. The court is very conscious of the points made by Ms Kirby about the involvement of children in these cases. Each case is fact specific and the court is alive to the risks of children becoming involved at the instigation of one parent or another. I am satisfied this is not one of those cases relying, in particular, on the evidence of Ms H and Ms Broadley. For whatever reason, whether due to Y&#8217;s presence or needing more time to feel able to open up, X was unable to convey the strength of her objections in her meeting with Ms Callaghan. This is no criticism of Ms Callaghan but more likely due to X&#8217;s particular circumstances and her characteristics. I have carefully considered whether X&#8217;s position is being orchestrated by the mother and whilst I can&#8217;t rule out the mother&#8217;s position having some impact on X the evidence, when looked as a whole, supports X&#8217;s wishes as reported by Ms H and Ms Broadley as being X&#8217;s own wishes and feelings that are genuinely felt. There would, in my judgment, be significant emotional consequences for X if despite those clearly expressed wishes the court nevertheless made a return order. It would be more than the uncertainties, turmoil <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;rough and tumble, discomfort and distress&#8217; </span>involved in everyday life, and would cross the line where, in the words of Baroness Hale, would then risk the Hague Convention being turned into an <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;instrument of harm&#8217;</span> .</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning now to consider the Article 13 b defence. This is relied upon by X and the mother in different ways. In relation to X, Ms Baker submits if the court reaches the conclusion it has in relation to her, it would put Y at grave risk of emotional harm and/or place him in an intolerable situation if he was ordered to return on his own. In addition, Ms Baker submits, the defence also applies to X as any order for her to return, in the light of the court&#8217;s conclusions about her wishes will also put her at grave risk of emotional harm and/or place her in an intolerable situation. X&#8217;s position is supported by the mother. Ms Kirby submits the court needs to carefully balance the impact on the father&#8217;s relationship with the children if they remain here, together with his assessment that it is unlikely the mother and X will want to be separated from Y, so are very likely to return to Mauritius voluntarily. The father contends the measures that he can put in place, as outlined in his most recent statement, provide a clear known framework for Y to return to and will help reduce any consequences for him of being separated from his mother and sister, which the father considers is only likely to be short term.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having carefully considered the wide canvas of evidence and the submissions of the parties, I have reached the conclusion that in the circumstances that exists now the Article 13 b defence is established and that the protective measures proposed will not prevent the children being put at grave risk of harm and/or be placed in an intolerable situation. Y has only ever lived with his sister, there is no suggestion they have other than a close sibling relationship. His mother has been his main carer, for over half his life, since November 2020. Whilst it is right he had regular weekly contact with his father until October 2022, which has effectively ceased following the unilateral removal by his mother, to remove him from those who have cared for him and been an integral part of his life will put him at grave risk of emotional harm and/or place him in an intolerable situation. I recognise he has an existing relationship with his father, knows his paternal grandmother and will have some familiarity with the surroundings the father proposes, however those factors would not, in my judgment, manage the risks arising from the separation from his mother and sister. I do not share the confidence the father has that the mother and X will follow and, in any event, that uncertainty alone is likely to increase the grave risk of harm to Y. </p>

To order her to return against her express wishes, where the court has accepted that evidence, would undoubtedly place her at grave risk of harm. The protective measures proposed, which are largely in place, would provide some reduction in that risk but in my judgment, in the circumstances as they exists now, are now not sufficient that she would not remain at grave risk of harm.</p>

It is likely to expose her to continued litigation here if, as would be likely, she does not comply with any order for return bearing in mind the steps she has taken in speaking to Ms H and in her discussions with Ms Broadley over a period of time. This is not the court being held to ransom but a realistic assessment of the evidence the court has.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">In relation to Y he has not lived without his sister or mother for the whole of his life. The evidence points to his place being firmly anchored within that arrangement and a consequent strong bond between the siblings. To separate him from the known stability of care, with the consequent grave risks to his emotional and psychological welfare would need to be clearly justified. The importance of the father&#8217;s continued relationship with Y must, of course, be weighed in the balance, together with what the father alleges is the mother&#8217;s lack of support in maintaining that relationship. Also, the father&#8217;s proposals do involve some arrangements that would be familiar to Y (such as returning to accommodation he knows where his paternal grandmother lives) thereby providing some amelioration of the other considerations. Whilst it is right the removal of Y from Mauritius has had a detrimental impact on his relationship with his father, there are other ways that can be managed that would cause Y less harm than separation from his sister and mother. For example, part of the father&#8217;s recent evidence is that he would come over to this jurisdiction to spent time with the children. There is no reason why that could still not take place, thereby providing a foundation for that relationship to be restored.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">The father&#8217;s confidence about the mother and X returning to Mauritius voluntarily is not shared by the court. Whilst it is recognised they would not want to be separated from Y it is contrary to Y&#8217;s welfare, as well as X, for them to be put in that position. Until very recently the father did not support the separation of the children, he still does not but in the event of the court determining X does not return he seeks for that option to be considered. Having reached the conclusion about X based both on her objections and under Article 13 b it would be counter intuitive for this court to then endorse a course, as suggested by the father, that places pressure on X to return. This is not only inimical to X&#8217;s welfare but also to Y, as the continued uncertainty with the real risk that there could be a long term separation between the siblings does not meet his welfare needs. If the father still maintains that position for Y to be returned to Mauritius that can be considered as part of a wider and more detailed welfare enquiry than is possible within these summary proceedings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">This is a summary process and, as a result, has its limitations. A more detailed welfare examination, in the context of the long term arrangements for the children, may justify different orders, but that would a matter for another court, if agreement cannot be reached. The welfare enquiry sought by the father as part of his adjournment application sought to introduce within this summary process full welfare evidence that is more commensurate with a contested application within the jurisdiction that is required to determine issues regarding the long term care arrangements. That is not the purpose of the summary Hague Convention proceedings, which are aimed at securing (subject to Article 13 defences) the child&#8217;s swift return for decisions to be made in that country as to the child&#8217;s long-term future.</p>

However, the father&#8217;s position that unless both or Y returns he will lose his relationship with them forever overstates the reality. The recent evidence of the father&#8217;s ability to come to this jurisdiction to spend direct time with the children, in particular Y, provides some mitigation of that important welfare concern. He works remotely which provides added flexibility. It also has to be viewed in the context of the longer term history of the mother supporting the contact arrangements between the father and Y over a two year period following the parties separation.</p>
