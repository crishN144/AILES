It was agreed by all parties at the outset of this hearing that I should nonetheless consider the domicile of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">both</span> parties, and if I was to conclude that the Respondent <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">is</span> domiciled in this country, I would be likely to give leave to the Petitioner to amend her petition.</p>

In September 2015, the Respondent issued divorce proceedings in the Municipality Court in Sarajevo, Bosnia, where all the family then lived.  Those proceedings were dismissed by that court on the basis that the Petitioner was able then to assert diplomatic immunity in relation to the suit.  This immunity is no longer available to her (she has moved to live in Serbia, albeit that the Respondent and children remain in Bosnia), and the Respondent has filed a fresh petition in Sarajevo (3 November 2016), which awaits judicial consideration.  The Petitioner has answered that petition, taking issue with the Bosnian Court&#8217;s jurisdiction to deal with the claim.  Nonetheless, on 29 November 2016, the Petitioner issued her own application in the Municipal Court of Sarajevo seeking a determination of child arrangements for the two children. The Respondent maintains that the courts of Sarajevo offer a more appropriate forum.</p>

In or about 1957, when he was 13 or 14, his family moved to London, principally because his own father considered that educational opportunities for his five children would be superior in the U.K.  His father liquidated all his assets in India.  In 1960, when the Respondent was still only 15 years old, his father became a naturalised British citizen.</p>

Having pursued further academic studies (postgraduate research), the Respondent joined the UK civil service in 1972, then aged 28.  He remained in the civil service continuously for 23 years; it is said that he was employed in the civil service for altogether 33 years.  A daughter was born to the Respondent and his first wife; she is now aged 42, is married with a child, and currently lives in India where she is involved in a sustainability project. </p>

He never married Ms. B, but purchased a property with her in Hammersmith.  In 1995 the Respondent briefly left the civil service (although the continuity of his employment remained) and became an administrator at the European Parliament in Luxembourg. He, together with Ms. B and their son, moved to live in Luxembourg.  The Respondent maintains that he has not lived in England since this time. In 1997 the Respondent moved from Luxembourg to Brussels where he was offered work with the European Commission. He purchased a property in the outskirts of Brussels, but his relationship with Ms. B foundered, and it was while he was there (the date is not agreed, either 1997, according to the Petitioner or 1999 or 2000, according to him) that he met and formed a relationship with the Petitioner.  The early days of their relationship were spent in Brussels.  In October 2001, the Respondent&#8217;s contract with the European Commission came to an end.</p>

After a holiday to India with the Respondent, she moved back to England at the end of 2001, to take up work for a company based in South West London on a time-limited contract. During the next eleven months, she shared the Fulham property with the Respondent.  In October 2002, she and the Respondent made a trip to Ireland to collect all of the Petitioner&#8217;s personal items which were still stored at her parents&#8217; home.  She relocated them all to the Fulham property: mahogany mirrors, mahogany furniture and a bust, together with other items which she boxed and then stored in the cellar there. In November 2002, the Petitioner moved to Tirana, Albania, to take up a one-year renewable post as a &#8220;Junior Expert in Delegation&#8221; for the Delegation of the European Union; the Respondent followed her, taking up part-time work (and then full-time work) in Albania.  In order to qualify for her posting, the Petitioner applied to the Home Office in London for a police security check; she did not make a similar application from the authorities in Ireland.  I have seen some correspondence which was generated at that time in relation to her employment which was addressed to the Petitioner in Ireland; however, the Petitioner&#8217;s &#8220;place of origin&#8221; recorded on her terms and conditions document was shown as &#8216;London&#8217; inscribed in manuscript in place of &#8216;Galway&#8217; (it is difficult to see when the change was made).  The preponderance of the correspondence to the Petitioner from this period (and wholly thereafter indeed) appears to have been sent to the Fulham property.  During this period, the Petitioner applied for work in London but was unsuccessful; the Respondent disputes this fact, but I accept the Petitioner&#8217;s account, though it is inconsequential to my determination.</p>

She has manifestly fulfilled her ambition.  Throughout her adult life she has travelled extensively for her work, but there appears to have been, throughout, an anchor laid in London.  From as early as 1998<span style="color:#FF0000"/>or thereabouts she used a London address for all formal or business correspondence while she was working abroad.  She does not appear to have used an Irish address for such correspondence from that time.  Initially the given address was that of the home of a friend of the Respondent&#8217;s in north London (the Respondent claimed not to know this person, but I accept the Petitioner&#8217;s account), but from 2000 to date she has used the address of the Fulham property.

One bedroom at the property historically was kept locked and reserved for their use throughout the time they were together (although apparently on a reasonably flexible basis for the use of the tenants&#8217; friends), and the Petitioner had left her personal possessions there which she had retrieved from Ireland (see above).  The Respondent told me he saw it differently, letting the property out until recently on a room by room basis; it is now let as a whole.

The Respondent makes the further, sound, point, that quite apart from any other consideration, the Fulham property is very heavily mortgaged, and the parties needed, and continue to need, the rental income to service the repayments.  The Petitioner describes how in 2010 the parties investigated changing the mortgage into their joint names, but this in fact did not happen given (apparently) the size of the mortgage and the Petitioner&#8217;s limited income.</p>

The Respondent disputes that the Petitioner has made <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">any</span> payments for the Fulham property (he referred to this as &#8220;impossible&#8221; in oral evidence); the Petitioner has demonstrated a number of payments, not amounting to the aggregate sum asserted on the evidence filed for this application, but sufficient for me to reject the Respondent&#8217;s denial of her having made any contribution.  Interestingly the Petitioner maintains that she has spent more than double that sum on the Respondent&#8217;s other properties in Brussels and Italy.    I accept that the Petitioner made a loan from a jointly-held account to pay back constructors for the renovations. She has asserted that overall she has contributed &#163;300,000 to a number of the Respondent&#8217;s properties around Europe (London, Italy, Brussels).

Given the limited period for which it was paid, some time ago, it matters little to my determination.  From 2002 the Petitioner has paid income tax at source through Brussels. However, perhaps more notably, she has paid National Insurance contributions, I believe throughout the period from 2002 (this is clearly documented from 2007-2016); specifically, in 2006 she wrote to her accountant asking to bring herself &#8220;up to date with these payments&#8221;.

I am not altogether persuaded by these points; true it is that the Petitioner has Irish heritage, but I do not see this as having the same importance for her now, as it plainly once did.  Her relationships with her own family are, or certainly have been, strained; she did not stay with them when she visited with the Respondent in 2002, and they were absent from her wedding, as I have earlier mentioned. She has not lived in Ireland since 1995, and has visited only reasonably infrequently, sometimes to participate in work-related courses or programmes.  She has no state pension or equivalent rights in Ireland; she has a dormant Irish bank account with a modest credit.  She has had no dealing with the Irish tax authorities. I accept her evidence that she does not read the Irish press.  She has, it seems to me, been interested in multi-cultural life, and (rightly or wrongly, but in my view sincerely) she perceives Ireland as not offering this style or opportunity, describing Ireland as &#8220;too mono-cultural, too small and too remote&#8221;.</p>

I am satisfied that the Petitioner returned to London for ante-natal and post-natal checks for their first child, and post-natal treatment for the second, and that the first child was born here.  Both children have received their vaccinations in London, and other treatments. Both parties are registered with General Practitioners in London, and have been so since 2001. The Petitioner has not been registered with a GP in Ireland for many years.  When the Petitioner has required gynaecological and other similar treatment, it is to England that she has returned for this. I have seen correspondence verifying the same.  The Respondent counters the Petitioner&#8217;s case by asserting that on only a &#8220;small number&#8221; of occasions has the Petitioner obtained medical treatment here, and that the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of treatments have been abroad.  Of the medical records available and analysed, it appears that only about 26% of the Petitioner&#8217;s medical consultations / treatments have taken place in London, whereas nearly one-half have taken place in Bosnia.  The Petitioner maintains, and this is to some extent borne out by the records, that the consultations and procedures in London have been for significant treatment and/or her more serious conditions, whereas she says that her visits to the GP or dentist in Bosnia have been for the more mundane/routine matters.  It appears (on what I have seen) that this is so.  The Respondent himself observes that hospital standards in Sarajevo were poor, which may of course explain some or all of the above.

It matters not, argues Mr. Hale, because the Respondent probably acquired a domicile of choice in England once he had become 16.  </p>

He lived in London from 1958 through to 1995, nearly 40 years.  The Respondent worked for the British civil service for a number of years (at least from 1972-1995, when he was seconded to the European Parliament, and then back in 2001); he has the benefit of a civil service pension, which he transferred to the European Commission but receives weighting on the basis of his residence in London. He made, on my finding, no return trips to India in this period; I accept the Petitioner&#8217;s account that he visited a few times, but only for short visits, and only after 2001.  He has no property in India; he had no bank account there, and does not hold an Indian passport.</p>

His first wife was English; he had homes and a long and distinguished career here.  This commitment to the country was undoubtedly tainted in my judgment by the fact that he experienced racism in the 1960s and 1970s in England. I accept his account of this.  He describes being the victim of racial abuse and prejudice.  He says that England &#8220;was somewhere where I once lived and whose intractable tribulations I had to suffer regardless of how hard I worked, rather than as a welcoming home&#8221;; this slightly exaggerated description of his life nonetheless reveals, I accept, at least an underlying ambivalence about England.

What I found surprising and distracting about the Petitioner&#8217;s case was that the Petitioner spoke with relatively little emotional warmth about, or attachment towards, England as a country. Even when discussing her thesis, the evidence was given without much discernible enthusiasm or passion for her quintessentially English subject; she told me little of what she actually liked about London or England.  It was notable (as the Respondent observed) that she has not ever chosen to holiday here.  This factor caused me to hesitate long before reaching my ultimate conclusion, but in the end it was not sufficient to counter-balance the other factors which demonstrated that London had, in my finding, become her &#8216;centre of gravity&#8217;, and the place of her permanent home (see [9](ii) above).</p>

As may be apparent from my review of the evidence (see in particular [51] / [52] above, for example), I consider that at one time, as a man in early adulthood through to his early 50s, the Respondent probably did acquire a domicile of choice here in England, based largely on a combination of (a) the duration of his lengthy residence here, (b) his first marriage (to an English woman), (c) the establishment of a family home in London, (d) his investment of additional property in London (the Fulham property), and (e) the tenuous continuing links to his domicile of origin (no visits to India prior to 2001 indicating a lack of connection with India, there being no property or investments there).  His experience of England was not uniformly positive, I accept, and doubtless affected the depth of his emotional integration here.  He nonetheless deposes in his statement to the fact that London was at one time his &#8220;home&#8221; (&#8220;London has not been my home for many years&#8230;.&#8221;).</p>

It is however of importance to remember that each party will seek to establish the existence of certain matters which will assist him in persuading the court to exercise its discretion in his favour, and that in respect of any such matter the evidential burden will rest on the party who asserts its existence. Furthermore, if the court is satisfied that there is another available forum which is prima facie the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, the burden will then shift to the plaintiff to show that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that the trial should nevertheless take place in this country (see (f), below). </p>

I can see no reason why the English court should not refuse to grant a stay in such a case, where jurisdiction has been founded as of right. It is significant that, in all the leading English cases where a stay has been granted, there has been another clearly more appropriate forum. In my opinion, the burden resting on the defendant is not just to show that England is not the natural or appropriate forum for the trial, but to establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the English forum. In this way, proper regard is paid to the fact that jurisdiction has been founded in England as of right (see <span style="font-style:italic">MacShannon's</span> case <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1978] AC 795" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1978">[1978] A.C. 795</ref>, per Lord Salmon). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">(d) Since the question is whether there exists some other forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, the court will look first to see what factors there are which point in the direction of another forum. These are the factors which Lord Diplock described, in <span style="font-style:italic">MacShannon's</span> case <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1978] AC 795" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1978">[1978] A.C. 795</ref>, 812, as indicating that justice can be done in the other forum at "substantially less inconvenience or expense." Or adopting the language of Lord Keith of Kinkel, in <span style="font-style:italic">The Abidin Daver</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] AC 398" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] A.C. 398</ref>, 415, when he referred to the "natural forum" as being "that with which the action had the most real and substantial connection." So it is for connecting factors in this sense that the court must first look; and these will include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (such as availability of witnesses), but also other factors such as the law governing the relevant transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. </p>

In this enquiry, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including circumstances which go beyond those taken into account when considering connecting factors with other jurisdictions. One such factor can be the fact, if established objectively by cogent evidence, that the plaintiff will not obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction; see <span style="font-style:italic">The Abidin Daver</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1984] 1 AC 398" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1984">[1984] 1 A.C. 398</ref>, 411, per Lord Diplock, a passage which now makes plain that, on this enquiry, the burden of proof shifts to the plaintiff. </p>

This had not been trailed in the written evidence or in the opening statements at all, and is not well-evidenced (if at all).  Mr. Scott advised me in final submissions that the Respondent may be able to acquire a temporary residence permit to be in Bosnia for one year, until his right of occupation there becomes more durable by his obtaining property.  All of this seems to me to be somewhat speculative. If the Respondent is unable to stay in Bosnia, there plainly is no merit whatsoever in the parties litigating there.</p>

The Respondent&#8217;s unconditional agreement to this exercise of matrimonial jurisdiction is far from assured, particularly given the Respondent&#8217;s clear perception, unapologetically asserted in his oral evidence, that the Bosnian judiciary are corrupt. </p>
