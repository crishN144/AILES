As will be apparent, the medical expert in the case, who is a paediatrician, had hitherto  been identified only as Dr. M  by Judge Bellamy, and the principal issue which I have to decide is whether or not Dr M&#8217;s identity should be revealed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When I had the case for directions on 20 January 2011, it occurred to me that it raised a number of  broader issues relating both to the circumstances in which expert witnesses in family proceedings should be identified, and transparency in family justice generally. With the agreement of the parties,  then before the court, therefore. I wrote to the Presidents of  both; (1)  the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and (2) the Royal College of Psychiatrists,  alerting them to the fact that the issue was before the court. As a result, I received a long statement from the President of the RCPCH, Professor Terence Stephenson and, without opposition from the other parties, I  granted his application for leave to intervene. I have heard nothing from the  Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p>

In the event, given Mr. MacDonald&#8217;s level of expertise, it was sensibly agreed that I should hear submissions <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">de bene esse</span> from him in relation to the position of children generally. This I did, and I am extremely grateful in particular to Mrs. C, the mother of X, Y and Z for her agreement that I should do so.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It would, however, be courteous if judges, when they have it in mind to identify in any subsequent judgment experts who have given evidence in front of them, were to alert the expert in question to the fact that he or she might be named. My personal view favours transparency, provided the identity and whereabouts of the children concerned is protected. From your perspective, being named is only likely to cause you professional harm if you have fallen below the standard demanded by your profession and are properly criticised by the judge. If, as this Handbook constantly states, you have done your work conscientiously you have nothing to fear from the courts. </p>

My personal view is that greater openness will show the public the extreme difficulty and sensitivity of the decisions it has to make, and how conscientiously it goes about making them. I see no reason why you should not share fully in that process. &#8220;</p>

In other words, he neither supports not opposes Mr Morgan&#8217;s application. I shall deal in detail with the arguments advanced on his behalf later in this judgment. As he had not been heard by Judge Bellamy, however, he did ask, (in the event that I decided he should be named) that  his rebuttal of Judge Bellamy&#8217;s criticisms should also be made public.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already noted, however, that the judge was highly critical of Dr. M . It does not seem to me that it is  for me to analyse the judge&#8217;s reasoning in this regard or to express any view about the substance of Judge Bellamy&#8217;s criticisms, Whether or not he was wise to make them in the particular circumstances of the case is another matter. On this point I am invited to comment, and propose to do so, since the fact of the criticisms inevitably forms part of the subject matter for my decision. Indeed,  the judge himself is at pains to point out that  Dr M was not called to give evidence at the hearing which led to the withdrawal of the proceedings,  had not had the concerns about his report put to him, and thus has had no opportunity to date to respond to the judgment. Judge Bellamy appears to have taken the view that since Dr. M was not identified, he was not damaged by the criticisms. This is a point to which I will return.</p>

Whilst those decisions, as I have previously  made clear, are not binding on me, they are plainly highly persuasive, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the erudition and  industry displayed by the judge both in his analysis of what the law is and in his application of the law to the cases before him. Indeed, I can say at once that although I have taken the opportunity to read all the relevant cases, I am able to take the matter relatively shortly  because I find myself in agreement with Munby LJ&#8217;s analysis.

It  is not part of the law of England and, as I have already stated, may never be. Family Law is littered with Statutes, and parts of Statutes which have never been brought into force.

The canons of statutory construction are clear, and do not apply to prospective changes in the law.

Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test. This is how I will approach the present case.&#8221;</p>

Whilst not suggesting that anonymity  would resolve the problem, he is of the view that  there are very strong arguments for retaining anonymity for treating doctors who appear as witnesses of fact in Family Court cases, not least the need to protect the anonymity of the child. He  recognises that there is a distinction between the expert witness and the treating clinician, but remains of the view that the promise of anonymity would encourage the right people to give evidence.</p>

Equally, each Article qualifies the right it propounds so far as it may be lawful, necessary and proportionate to do so in order to accommodate the other. The exercise to be performed is one of parallel analysis in which the starting point is presumptive parity, in that neither Article has precedence over or "trumps" the other. The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each. It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided upon the basis of rival generalities. An intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary before the ultimate balancing test in terms of proportionality is carried out. Having so stated, Lord Steyn strongly emphasised the interest in open justice as a factor to be accorded great weight in both the parallel analysis and the ultimate balancing test and stated that, at first instance, the judge had rightly so treated it. However, nowhere did he indicate that the weight to be accorded to the right freely to report criminal proceedings would invariably be determinative of the outcome. Indeed, he acknowledged that although it was the "ordinary" rule that the press, as public watchdog, may report everything that takes place in a criminal court, that rule might nonetheless be displaced in unusual or exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</p>

Ever since I began in practice, it has been a constant theme of child protection work under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> that there are insufficient experts &#8211; particularly paediatricians and psychiatrists - and that the disincentives for undertaking forensic child protection work (vilification, unjustified reporting to the GMC, suspensions and  damage to careers and reputations) gravely outweigh the advantages. Indeed, one of the three reasons I gave for writing my <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Handbook</span> (as the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Introduction</span> to the first edition makes clear) was &#8220;to encourage doctors and mental health professionals who have expertise in relation to children to undertake work in Children Act proceedings as expert witnesses&#8221;.</p>

A number of myths about expert witnesses need to be exploded. The first is that they are &#8220;hired guns&#8221; supporting invariably the side which pays them. In my experience, nothing could be further from the truth. The FJS depends upon the integrity of the expert witness, and the duties of the expert witness to the child and to the court are spelled out in case law, in the Rules and in the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Practice Direction.</span></p>

Unfortunately, particularly in the county court, where the pressure is greatest, there are rarely either the resources or the time for this to be done.

There is, in my judgment,  considerable force in the observation made by Munby LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Ward</span> at paragraph  152 that it is not for the family court by controlling the information it allows to be  disseminated to seek to control the disciplinary procedures. In other words, if   there is a problem here, I agree that it is a problem to be solved by others &#8211; by the GMC, by the medical profession, by Parliament &#8211; not by the family court controlling the information it allows to be disseminated or the form in which it allows such information to be disseminated.</p>

As I am at pains to point out in my <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Handbook</span> the work is extremely important both for children and for the Family Justice System.  Experts are experts because they know more about their subject that anyone else. The extract I have cited from paragraph 35.7 of the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Handbook</span> shows that where work is properly done and the methodology is professionally sound paediatricians have nothing to fear from the courts. Professor Sir Roy Meadow was cleared of serious professional misconduct by the courts: - see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Meadow v GMC</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/1390" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 1390" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 1390</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 1398" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 1398</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, there will be cases in which the anonymity of the expert will need to be preserved.  If, for example, a child makes it clear to a psychiatrist that the child simply will not engage in the process  - or refuses to be interviewed by an individual psychiatrist -  if there is any possibility either of confidential information entering the public domain or the name of the psychiatrist  being made public, I can well see the argument for invoking the protective jurisdiction, and  the court forbidding disclosure of the psychiatrist&#8217;s identity: -  see, in this respect, the powerful views of  Dr. Danya Glaser as published in the October 2009 issue of the magazine <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Family Law</span> (2009 Fam Law 911)   and the decision of Sir Mark Potter P in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re X (a child) (Residence and Contact: Rights of Media Attendance)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2009/1728" uk:canonical="[2009] EWHC 1728 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWHC 1728 (Fam)</ref> [2009] 3 FCR 370.</p>

Although I have not heard argument on the point (which, of course, I will do if any part of the order which I make is not specifically covered by  the arguments addressed to me), my judgment is that informed discussion of Dr. M&#8217;s report is not dependent upon the children being identified, and that the report should be published in redacted form, with the children remaining as X, Y and Z, and their parents remaining as &#8220;the mother&#8221;  and &#8220;the father&#8221; respectively.  I assume that Dr M&#8217;s report is available electronically. If so, redaction (which would normally be undertaken by the guardian) should be a relatively easy task, and will have to be undertaken  either by Dr. M or the local authority. Copies of Dr M&#8217;s two letters to me will also be annexed to this judgment</p>

Taking all the arguments adduced in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"> Ward</span> into account, I have come to the conclusion that in this respect the risk to the children being identified in the ensuing debate is minimal, and that, in this instance the ECHR Article 10  arguments prevail over the ECHR Article 8 rights of the children..</p>
