	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">On 18 November 2019 I handed down a judgment following a hearing at which the court determined a dispute between the parties as to the correct legal principles to be applied and the correct procedure to be adopted where one party to private law proceedings under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> seeks disclosure and inspection of documentation from the successful asylum claim of the other party for use in the family proceedings.  That judgment was published as <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Disclosure of Asylum Documents)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2019/3147" uk:canonical="[2019] EWHC 3147 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWHC 3147 (Fam)</ref>.  The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal from the Court of Appeal but permission was refused by King LJ on the grounds that the application was premature, this court not yet having determined whether or not to order disclosure in this particular case based on its formulation of the applicable legal principles.  That is the question that now falls for determination and the question which this second judgment addresses. </p>

On 24 April 2017 the Secretary of State nonetheless refused the mother&#8217;s application for asylum on grounds that the mother had failed to demonstrate a genuine subjective fear and that, even if the mother&#8217;s fears of the father were well founded, she could relocate internally in [country given] to a place where she would not face a real risk of harm. </p>

I accept her claims that she and her son would be located in [country given] on return by [the father] via his family members and computer records.  She gave details of the names of the appellant&#8217;s brothers and their positions within the police and prison force.  This is far more information than is usual with asylum seekers claiming that they fear persons with influence in the security forces of the country from which they have fled.  I accept that [the father] has filed a missing person&#8217;s report and that the immigration authorities would be alerted to this fact on their return to the airport.  Assuming they were returned, I find it has been established that there is a real risk both the appellant and her son would face ill treatment at the hands of [the father]. </p>

On that date, no objection was raised by the mother to such disclosure and the documents were provided to the father&#8217;s solicitors in accordance with the order of Roberts J.  However, subsequently the mother <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> raise objection to the disclosure of documents from the asylum process.  This appears to have been based on the mother&#8217;s concern that the documentation contained names and pictures of people who had provided information which could compromise the safety of themselves and their families.  At a hearing on 9 April 2019, and in light of her objection, the mother&#8217;s asylum documentation was returned to her and the issue of disclosure of the asylum documentation was listed for determination before HHJ Corbett, who refused to order disclosure.  That order was made in the context of then ongoing summary proceedings brought by the father under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> for relief pursuant to the provisions of the 1980 Hague Convention. </p>

Any qualification of the right to see documents relevant to the issue to be determined by the court will only be acceptable if directed towards that clear and proper objective and any nondisclosure must be limited to what the situation imperatively demands and will be justified only when the case for non-disclosure is compelling or strictly necessary.

However, whilst Mr Payne sought to resurrect the argument he ran before Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M</span> that, within the context of the cardinal importance of confidentiality to an effective asylum process, a presumption of exceptional circumstances applies to questions of the disclosure of documents from the asylum process, I too reject that submission.

However, in line with the decision of Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M</span>, I have already rejected the notion that there is presumption of exceptionality when considering the question of disclosure.  Further, in <span style="font-style:italic">R v McGeough</span> the Supreme Court (in observations that were not dependent on the factual matters that distinguish that case from this one) made clear that Art 22 of Directive 2005/85/EC (from which Paragraph 339 IA of the Immigration Rules is derived) containing the prohibition on disclosure to an alleged perpetrator is specifically relates to the process of examination of the claim and does not extend beyond its determination.   Within this context, nowhere in the Directive or the Immigration Rules is it suggested that a test of exceptionality applies following the successful (or unsuccessful) conclusion of an asylum claim.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">First, and unsurprisingly, Mr Goss once again urges the court to give very great weight to the confidentiality of the asylum process and the duty Secretary of State to ensure that a group of adults and children who are extremely vulnerable, namely asylum seekers and refugees, have their rights protected within a process that deals with those who have endured ill-treatment, including torture, and have arrived from areas of the world in which coming to the attention of the authorities is dangerous in the extreme.  Within this context, Mr Goss submits that there is a strong public interest in not providing disclosure to a person who is considered within the asylum process to be a perpetrator, such disclosure risking harm to both the person seeking asylum and, potentially, to members of the asylum seeker&#8217;s family and community remaining behind in the country of origin, particularly where the latter have in the past given assistance to the asylum seeker. </p>

Within this context, Mr Goss again submits that to order disclosure and inspection in such circumstances would have a devastating effect on confidence in the asylum process, a chilling effect on the willingness of those seeking international protection to provide information and would prevent the United Kingdom authorities discharging their international and domestic obligations.  Mr Goss again highlights the fact that asylum seekers are informed when they claim asylum that the information they provide will be kept confidential and will only be disclosed where there is a requirement in law to do so and that, in circumstances where asylum examinations are conducted in private, the asylum seeker has a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Within this context, he again reminds the court that the provision of information by asylum seekers is at the heart of that which the confidentiality of the asylum process is designed to protect. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In further particularising the impact of disclosure in this context, Mr Goss submitted that, beyond cutting across assurances given to individual asylum seekers and the need to keep individual asylum seekers safe, disclosure of the documents in issue would impact on the ability of the Secretary of State to encourage full and frank disclosure from those seeking asylum generally, with disclosure of material from the asylum process increasing the likelihood that other asylum seekers will withhold details about or aspects of their claim.  Mr Goss submits that this in turn hampers the ability of the Secretary of State to make effective and accurate decisions about international protection and to produce guidance and policy in respect of the same. Further, and at a systemic level, Mr Goss submits that where initial screening interviews and substantive interviews provide a crucial source of information for the Secretary of State about particular countries, trends, and migration and trafficking routes, any decrease in candour on the part of asylum seekers will again prejudice the ability of the Secretary of State to formulate policy and guidance in this vital area. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">the need to protect the confidentiality of the asylum system has a similar genesis to the need to protect the identity of persons who make a referral to social services or other child protection agencies, which confidentiality is, Mr Goss submits, usually protected by the courts.  In this regard, and again by way of analogy, Mr Goss relies on the case of <span style="font-style:italic">D v NSPCC</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1978] AC 171" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1978">[1978] AC 171</ref>.  </p>

Mr Goss submits that the accounts provided by the mother and recorded in the asylum file (on the landing card, the initial screening interview and in the substantive interview) are all broadly consistent with the evidence provided by the mother in these proceedings.  Within this context, the Secretary of State submits that this material does not provide any real assistance with respect to the father&#8217;s case in that it does not undermine the credibility of the mother or offer lines of inquiry that are not already open to the father.  In the circumstances, the Secretary of State submits that disclosure of these documents is not required to protect the Applicant father&#8217;s right to a fair trial and that there is nothing in the material that justifies overriding the public interest in the confidentiality of the asylum process in this case. </p>

However, the Secretary of State further submits that to the extent that there are inconsistencies or omissions from earlier accounts, they are not such as would fundamentally affect the reliability of the mother&#8217;s account, either because they are minor or because they relate to areas where it is unsurprising that she was not initially fully forthcoming when providing her account on arrival in the jurisdiction and thereafter.  Within this context, Mr Goss submits that these examples constitute understandable and explicable omissions on the part of the mother, rather than forensically significant inconsistencies, rendering it unlikely that weighty forensic points could be made from them.  In these circumstances, Mr Goss further submits that it would be disproportionate to order disclosure of the documents in issue where their impact on the fairness or otherwise of the finding of fact hearing would be, in the submission of the Secretary of State, so slight. </p>

Mr Hames submits however, that the father is placed in that position by the material that is already before the court in the form of the evidence that the mother has filed in these proceedings, which is consistent with the accounts she has given within the asylum process, and by reference to the material from the asylum process that the father does have access to, in particular the decisions of the Secretary of State and of the Tribunal.

Mr Hames was clear that the mother did not wish to do so and that he had no instructions to seek disclosure of the material into the family proceedings, indeed the mother actively opposed the same.  Whilst maintaining fidelity to those instructions, Mr Hames properly accepted that if the court took the view that its role within proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> was a quasi-inquisitorial one, the mother&#8217;s position does not prevent the <span style="font-style:italic">court</span> from determining that material that might be said to be relevant to and to support the mother&#8217;s case should be before the court, notwithstanding that she objects to that course. </p>

Mr Devereux and Ms Chaudhry again remind the court that it is a serious matter for the court to exclude relevant evidence, citing the observations to this effect made in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Disclosure to Other Parties) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 1017" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 1017</ref> at [89]. In this context, Mr Devereux and Ms Chaudhry submit that in circumstances where the father faces grave allegations that are to be determined by this court and where the information from the asylum process is relevant to his answering of those allegations, both the Art 6 and the domestic imperatives of a fair trial that have existed for hundreds of years demand disclosure of that material to the father.  They submit that it would be wholly exceptional for a party to family proceedings facing serious allegations of domestic and sexual abuse to be disadvantaged in comparison to parties in a similar position simply by virtue of the fact that evidence relevant to the determination of those allegations has been the subject of prior consideration in the asylum process. </p>

With respect to the procedural elements of Art 8 similar principles apply, with a failure to disclose relevant documents to a parent within a process for determining contact arrangements between that parent and their child not affording the requisite protection of the parent&#8217;s interests as safeguarded by Art 8 unless that failure to disclose is justified by reference to Art 8(2).  With respect to the question of H&#8217;s best interests an analogous analytical paradigm likewise applies. The court has to consider first whether disclosure of the material would involve a real possibility of significant harm to the child. If it would, the court should next consider whether the overall interests of the child would benefit from non-disclosure, weighing on the one hand the interest of the child in having the material properly tested, and on the other both the magnitude of the risk that harm will occur and the gravity of the harm if it does occur. If the court is satisfied that the interests of the child point towards nondisclosure, the next and final step is for the court to weigh that consideration, and its strength in the circumstances of the case, against the interest of the parent or other party in having an opportunity to see and respond to the material. In the latter regard the court should take into account the importance of the material to the issues in the case.     </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I deal first, and within the foregoing context, with the factors that tend to militate against disclosure.  In this case the feared harm that is said to justify non-disclosure of the relevant material in issue in this case is threefold.  Namely, harm to the mother or to third parties were the father to be provided, as a person identified in the asylum process as a perpetrator, with information from the asylum documentation, harm to H flowing from the same circumstances and, finally, harm to the public interest in the operational integrity of the asylum system more widely as the result of the disclosure of material that is confidential to that system, such confidentiality being the very foundation of the asylum system&#8217;s efficacy.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">With respect to the contended for harm to the mother and to third parties, in rigorously examining that feared harm to determine whether non-disclosure of the relevant evidence is imperatively demanded and strictly necessary in this case I am satisfied that there is some force in the submission of Mr Devereux and Ms Chaudhry. The mother has adduced no evidence that articulates how the disclosure sought by the father will now place the mother at greater risk of harm in this jurisdiction, nor how the disclosure sought will place the third parties at greater risk of harm, where the disclosure sought is into proceedings that are by their nature confidential, where the father remains unaware of the address at which mother and H are residing in this jurisdiction and where the father does not seek disclosure of the same. I take account of the fact that such evidence is not easy to adduce where it may have to be sourced from a foreign jurisdiction, but court must nonetheless act on evidence.  I accept that the tribunal concluded that the mother and H would be located in [country given] by the father via his family members and computer records if they returned and, assuming they were returned, that it was established that there was a real risk that both the mother and H would face ill treatment at the hands of the father.   Further, whilst neither the Secretary of State nor the mother has pressed submissions on the question of whether these risks are sufficient to breach her rights under Art 2 or Art 3 of the ECHR, I accept that, generally, in the circumstances that drive individuals to seek asylum, such harm may extend to a breach the right to life under Art 2 or the right to freedom from torture or other cruel of inhuman treatment under Art 3.  However, within the context of these confidential family proceedings, the mother and H now reside in this jurisdiction and face no risk of being returned to [country given].  With respect to risk to any third parties, there is likewise no cogent evidence before this court to support the assertion that the father would act in an inappropriate or harmful manner against third parties as a result of disclosure to him of relevant documents in these proceedings.  In any event, in so far as such a risk is contended for it can be ameliorated by the appropriate redaction of documents in circumstances where the identity of any third parties is, I am satisfied, of marginal relevance to the issues before this court.   </p>

As Hayden J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M</span>, intrinsic to the operation of both the asylum system generally and the proper discharge by the United Kingdom of its obligations under the Refugee Convention, the EU Directive and the European Convention to those who are vulnerable by reason of, for example, discrimination, ill-treatment or torture is the confidentiality of the asylum process.  Within this context, there is a duty of confidence at common law owed to a person claiming asylum in respect of the information they provide in support of that claim.  Accordingly, the information in issue in this case remains material to which confidentiality attaches where it has come to the knowledge of the Secretary of State in circumstances where the Secretary of State has agreed that the information is confidential and will only be disclosed where there is a requirement of the law to do so.  In these circumstances, I have taken account of the importance of the confidentiality of the asylum process on two levels.   </p>

Within the context of the father being required to answer serious allegations of domestic abuse and child sexual abuse, I place in the balance the fact that Art 6 requires that the father be afforded an equal opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage, that this includes the right to the disclosure of relevant documents (see <span style="font-style:italic">Feldbrugge v The Netherlands</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1986) 8 EHRR 425" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">(1986) 8 EHRR 425</ref>) and that the right to a fair trial thus demands that, ordinarily, all relevant documents and information be before the court (<span style="font-style:italic">Re D (Adoption Reports: Confidentiality)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 687" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 687</ref>).  This means not only that the father is entitled to have access to relevant material that may assist his case, but to have access to material on which the mother will rely to support her own case.

Substantively, the father has a right to respect for family life with H pursuant to Art 8.  Any decision making process concerning measures which would have the effect of interfering with his rights under Art 8 must be fair and must itself be conducted in a manner which ensures the efficacy of those rights protected by Art 8 (see <span style="font-style:italic">TP and KM v United Kingdom</span> [2001] 2 FCR 289 at [7]). Within this context, the father&#8217;s Art 8 rights will be the subject of interference if he is not able fairly and fully to advance a case before a court for the effective implementation of those rights through an ongoing and developing relationship with H.  In the circumstances, the father&#8217;s rights under Art 8 also include the right to disclosure of information relevant to issues before the court that engage Art 8 (see <span style="font-style:italic">R (P) v Secretary of State for the Home Department; R (Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 1122" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 1122</ref>), subject to the usual principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.

In these proceedings under Part II of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> the mother levels against the father allegations of the utmost seriousness, asserting that he is the perpetrator of domestic abuse and child sexual abuse.  The father strongly disputes the allegations made by the mother (and indeed positively asserts they are fabricated).  The nature of the allegations is such that if found proved they are likely to have a very significant impact on the future determination of H&#8217;s welfare and, in particular, the extent to which the father and son are able to enjoy a relationship with each other. The mutual enjoyment by father and H of each other&#8217;s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life within the meaning of Art 8(1) of the Convention and, subject to the provisions of Art 8(2), domestic measures hindering such enjoyment amount to an interference with the right protected by Art 8(1).   </p>

It is a fundamental principle of fairness and natural justice that the father is entitled to have sight of all materials which may be taken into account by the court when reaching a decision adverse to him, including the determination of any allegations levelled at him.  The same principles apply with respect to procedural elements of Art 8.  A failure to disclose relevant documents to a parent within a process for determining contact arrangements between that parent and their child will not afford the requisite protection of the parent&#8217;s interests as safeguarded by Art 8 unless that failure to disclose is justified by reference to Art 8(2) (see <span style="font-style:italic">McMichael v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1995) 29 EHRR 205" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">(1995) 29 EHRR 205</ref>).

First, and as I have noted, the documents in issue do also contain certain inconsistencies that offer potential lines of forensic enquiry for the father and are relevant of credibility of the mother.  As part of a fair trial, the father would ordinarily be entitled to see evidence that undermines the case against him.  Second, insofar as the mother sought to advance a general assertion in the family proceedings that the documentation in the asylum proceedings demonstrates that she has been consistent in her allegations, as part of a fair trial the father would be entitled to see the documents that are said to make good that submission in order to have the opportunity to challenge them if appropriate.  Third, and a point which I address further below, even were the mother not to seek to rely on evidence of prior consistent statements, the court may nonetheless consider that it is in H&#8217;s best interests for such material to be before the court so as to ensure a fully informed decision on the facts in issue relevant to his welfare.   </p>

Part of the rationale for full and frank disclosure to a party of material that potentially undermines the case against that party is so that that party can consider by way of inspection, with his or her legal representatives, the material in light of the legally privileged instructions given by that party.  Neither the Secretary of State nor the court is privy to the instructions given by the father to his legal advisers, which legally privileged discussions may point up lines of enquiry and/or challenge that are not immediately apparent to either the Secretary of State or the court but which the father would be entitled to pursue as part of a fair hearing of the allegations against him.   </p>

The family court has a duty by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FGMA 2003</ref>, Schedule 2, paragraph 1(2) to &#8216;have regard to all the circumstances&#8217; and, to discharge that duty, the court must consider all the relevant available evidence before deciding any facts on the balance of probability and then moving on to assess the risk and the need for an FGM protection order. Although the family court will necessarily take note of any FTT risk assessment, the exercise undertaken by a FTT is not a compatible process with that required in the family court. It is not therefore possible for an FTT assessment to be taken as the starting point or default position in the family court. The family court has a duty to form its own assessment, unencumbered by having to afford priority or precedence to the outcome of a similarly labelled, but materially different, process in the immigration jurisdiction.&#8221; </p>

The starting point must be that the father is entitled to consider all evidence that is relevant in that context, pursuant to his cardinal rights under the ECHR and the common law principles of fairness and natural justice, as is H.  Given the gravity of the allegations in issue and the evidence before the court regarding the contended for risk of harm to the mother and H of disclosure, I am satisfied that these considerations outweigh the risk of harm to the mother and H and that the same is not, in this case, a clear and proper objective justifying withholding relevant evidence from a parent facing allegations of physical and sexual assault and child sexual abuse.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Finally, I accept that my decision will result, upon the determination of H&#8217;s claim for asylum, in the disclosure of certain documents from the asylum process to a person considered in the context of the asylum system to be a perpetrator.  However, for the reasons I set out in my previous judgment, the fact that the person seeking disclosure is considered within the context of the asylum process to be a persecutor does not mean that, at the outset, the scales are weighted against disclosure and inspection following a successful claim for asylum.  Whether documents from the asylum process will be provided to an alleged persecutor who is a party to proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> following a successful (or unsuccessful) claim depends on all of the facts of the individual case and the balance that is struck between the various competing rights and interests on the basis of those facts.  It is the balancing of those rights and interests on the facts of the particular case, and not the application of a general policy, that properly leads to the conclusion of whether disclosure should or should not take place in a given case. Within this context, this judgment constitutes no more than a decision on the particular facts of this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As I noted in my previous judgment, a tension is created in this case by the fact that the information in issue is relevant in two different forensic contexts, in which two forensic contexts precisely the same allegations are the subject of consideration, but in which the role of the person against whom the allegations are made is markedly different.  During the currency of the asylum claim the father has no right to know the allegations against him, no right to answer those allegations and cannot see the information that is said to evidence the conduct alleged.  By contrast, during the currency of the subsequent proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> the father has a cardinal right to know those same allegations against him, a cardinal right to answer those allegations and, ordinarily, is entitled to see the information that is said to evidence the conduct alleged.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, whether disclosure and inspection is appropriate in a given case will depend on the outcome of a balancing exercise that weighs the rights of each individual concerned (including third parties whose rights may be affected by disclosure, for example family members who remain in the refugee&#8217;s country of origin), the welfare of the subject child or children and the confidential nature of the documents that are the subject of the application and the wider public interest in maintaining public confidence in the asylum process.  In this case, that balancing exercise comes down in favour of disclosure of the documents I have listed.  In other cases, the balancing exercise will produce a different result on the facts.  As I have stated, and repeat, this decision does not signal any change in the general approach to disclosure into family proceedings of asylum documentation.  Rather, it constitutes no more than the application of settled legal principles to the very particular facts of this case. </p>
