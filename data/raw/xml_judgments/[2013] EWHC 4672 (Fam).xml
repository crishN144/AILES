At the end of that hearing I gave a detailed judgment which should be read together with this judgment. At the end of that hearing the professional evidence was united that final care and placement orders should be made, together with care plans resulting in permanent separation of these two young children from their birth family. However, I concluded the mother should be given a time limited opportunity to consider my judgment and the findings I had made. This was to see whether she could accept them in a way that could give confidence that she would be able to protect the children from harm in the future.</span></p>

The LA, supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, submitted that due to the violent history and the continued denial of that by the mother the risk of future harm to these children of being returned to the their mother&#8217;s care was so great that it was not manageable and, as a result, the children&#8217;s welfare demands they be permanently placed away from their parents and the wider family. The LA sought a care order and a placement order with a care plan for adoption; in effect permanent separation from the birth family.  The mother sought orders that would lead to a further assessment of her to enable her to demonstrate her acceptance of any findings the court makes and, in effect, a further assessment of future risk.</span></p>

One aspect of the case that everyone agrees upon is the strength of the mother&#8217;s relationship with the children. Prior to the children being removed from her care there is no significant criticism of the mother&#8217;s day to day care or relationship with the children. One of the witnesses who lived in the family home described her as &#8216;One of the best mothers to her children&#8217;. She has had frequent contact with the children, five times a week for 2 hours. Her attendance has been excellent and all accounts of the contact are glowing in what has been observed. In her evidence the allocated social worker described the mother as &#8216;very warm and loving with her children, she is very attentive to their needs and sings to them&#8217; a little later she said when asked about the mother&#8217;s engagement with the children &#8216;It&#8217;s warm loving, playful, creative and a joy to watch&#8217;. Mr Y said from his observations the mothers &#8216;practical, physical, emotional care of the children is excellent&#8217;.</span></p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.58in;text-indent:0.42in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">What is so puzzling about this mother is she is someone who on the one hand has such strength of feeling and empathy for her children. On one level she has a strong maternal instinct (as has been demonstrated during this hearing; she becomes emotional at the mention of her children and her sobs for them during her evidence were both powerful and heart wrenching) yet she seems completely unable to acknowledge the history and future risks to her and the children that unite the experienced professionals who have given evidence in this case. In their written and oral evidence the social worker, Dr R and the Children&#8217;s Guardian have outlined to the mother their concerns, but she has remained resolute in her denial of the history and, they suggest, has become more entrenched in her views as this hearing has progressed. This may be due to loyalty to the husband and/or deep feelings of guilt. Whatever its roots it caused the Children&#8217;s Guardian, in his oral evidence, to shut the door he had left open in his written report filed at the start of this hearing that he would support a short focussed adjournment if there was any movement in the mother&#8217;s position. There wasn&#8217;t and put simply, his position is the children can&#8217;t wait. It was a conclusion he reached with great sadness but not, in the light of the evidence, with reluctance.&#8221;</span></p>

He said that is why there seems to be progress and then a step backwards. That was illustrated by the mother&#8217;s evidence; at one level she accepted the father caused C&#8217;s death and then referred to it as an </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;accident&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> or the father&#8217;s responsibility being limited to the fact he was there.

He acknowledged the strengths the mother has in terms of her love for the children, their strong bond and her genuine desire to care for them. But he considered the barriers of her inability to fully accept the court&#8217;s findings, to hold the father responsible and to understand such violence puts her and the children at future risk were significant. His view was that the mother was only at the beginning of such a journey and in such a high risk situation the protective parent needs to be much further forward in the context of the timescales for these children. He considered there are far too many unknowns at the moment in relation to the mother; the children require a secure and permanent family. He referred to the mother&#8217;s detachment; at one level she can understand the risks of domestic violence but she cannot relate it to her own situation.</span></p>

The evidence from the LA, in the form of the joint statement from KM (the deputy team manager of the adoption and permanence team) and CW (team manager) is that the children could be placed in an adoptive placement within 12 months.

Whilst her statement filed after the judgment gave some hope, it expressed that acceptance in somewhat bold and simplistic terms. When the detail was explored by Ms G and Mr Y it was clear the acceptance was not full and unconditional and did not get anywhere near that. Whilst that alone would not be a barrier if this was due to any kind of lack of understanding or there was some other relevant context given. However, I am satisfied here that it is because, for whatever reason, this mother can&#8217;t fully acknowledge what has happened to her and the children. Despite her full acceptance of my findings in her statement at a number of stages since she has sought to minimise or deny the findings I made. The language I used could not have been clearer; the father caused the injuries that resulted in C&#8217;s death.

In the light of the history of the mother&#8217;s acceptance that she lied throughout the course of the previous hearing and her inability since to give a reliable account of her acceptance of the findings made does not give a secure foundation for such trust; which would be an essential component in protecting the children and the continual assessment of future risk.</span></p>

Such assessment of the mother would need to be undertaken by a forensic psychologist, it would take between 4 &#8211; 5 months and there is in, my judgment, a real doubt as to whether it would be successful. It is not something the mother seeks with any enthusiasm, she asserts she will co-operate with all professionals and any further risk assessment, but that is in the context that she does not really consider she needs it. In somewhat graphic terms Mr Y described the mother as being at the beginning of her journey of acceptance; he put her at 2 out of 10; his view was, due to high level of risk in the case, she needed to be at 8 out of10.

It has to be recognised that the longer that search is delayed the more difficult it will come to find placements for these children, and the more difficult it will be for them to make the transition from their current placement to any long term placement.

Both are acutely aware, as is the court, of the draconian nature of the care plan proposed by the LA but at the end of the day any decisions relating to these children has to be as a result of an evaluation of their welfare needs which is the court&#8217;s paramount consideration. None of the recent cases can be read as justifying unlimited delay based on the uncertain prospect of rehabilitation to the care of a parent.

She has already concluded that the mother does not suffer from any mental illness and her oral evidence at the last hearing was that even if there was a change in the mother&#8217;s position, as was hoped would have taken place prior to the conclusion of the last hearing, there would need to be 4 &#8211; 5 months of therapeutic work undertaken by the mother. As she said, in the context of waiting to see the mother&#8217;s reaction to any findings by the court, there were a number of stages; the court makes the decision, there needs to be agreement by the mother of the court&#8217;s decision, then agreement by the mother to take part in the work and then engagement in the work. As she observed it is &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">a long piece of intervention&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> which she estimates the work that would be required as being between 4 &#8211; 5 months. She considered the domestic violence programme would take about 12 weeks and one to one therapeutic work consisting of individual sessions with the mother regarding the father&#8217;s behaviour would take a further 16 &#8211; 20 weeks. Even if the mother did accept the findings of the court she said </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;the mother has to accept and then engage in work&#8217;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The mother has not really got to the first stage. Her acceptance of the findings is superficially there in her statement but on further investigation is, at best, guarded and hesitant which does not provide a secure foundation from which to work on within the timescales of these young children. There is no real agreement by the mother to take part in the work, other than the somewhat bland statement that she will co-operate with the professionals and any further assessments. In her oral evidence she did not see the need for her undertake such work. In the light of Dr R&#8217;s evidence at the September hearing I can see no benefit in seeking a further report from her. I do not consider it necessary for the court to have that information in the circumstances of this case before it reaches a decision as it is unlikely to provide any further information than the court already has. The reality is the prognosis for successful reunification of the children to their mother&#8217;s care remains very low. Both Ms G and Mr Y formed the opinion that the mother&#8217;s motivation for change was the external factor of her love for her children and wish to have them back rather than, importantly, the internal factor of her acknowledgment of a need to change. This lack of insight and acceptance and acknowledgement would, in their view, make it much harder to work with the mother to protect the children. I agree.</span></p>

In particular, the effect on these children of ceasing to become a member of their birth family and the relationship they have with their mother, in particular. The care plan proposed by the LA, supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian, is a staged reduction of contact with direct contact ceasing when the children are matched with prospective adopters. Thereafter there will be indirect letter box contact. The evidence is if they are placed in an adoptive family that family is very unlikely to be of the same national and cultural origin. Whilst these are important factors, in the circumstances of this case it is quite clear the lifelong welfare needs for these young children for secure and stable placements can only be met by an adoptive placement. It is only that type of placement that will give them the long term security their welfare requires.</span></p>

As set out above any other type of placement will not provide the long term security and stability they need. Remaining with long term foster carers will have the increased uncertainty of placement breakdown and the risks of further applications being made. Whilst acknowledging the consequences of this will be the loss of their ongoing relationship with their birth family (in particular their mother through direct contact) and their origins, that can be managed, in part, by effective life story work so they retain their identity and have an understanding of their origins, but their overwhelming need now, due to their young ages, is for a lifelong secure and stable home. For the reasons set out above that cannot be provided for by their mother or father. Their welfare requires the court to dispense with the consent of their parents as provided for in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/52" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 52</ref>.</span></p>
