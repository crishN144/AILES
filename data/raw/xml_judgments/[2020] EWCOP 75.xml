A transparency order is in place preventing the publication of communication of any information that identifies or is likely to identify FP. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition and the transparency order are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</span></p>

The matter then went part-heard until 16 March 2020.  It had been anticipated that a planned leave of absence would have been completed by that date.  Unfortunately, it was not until 24 April 2020 that I was able to return to full judicial duties.  The parties were notified, it has to be said, in error, that the matter would be listed for final hearing and heard before Her Honour Judge Smith instead on 16 and 17 March.  The case was of course part-heard, and the Court had heard from all the witnesses in the case apart from RT and the new social worker, NH.  The relisting of the hearing was bedecked with difficulties and that was before the pandemic caused a lockdown of all the courts.  As the case was part-heard, it was necessary to determine a date upon which all the advocates, the Court, and ST and RT were available.  Thus, it was not until 20 August 2020 that the hearing concluded. </span></p>

I am very grateful to the advocates, including ST of course, and to the Russian interpreter for their careful approach to this hearing, the entire hearing.  ST has tried to get RT to focus upon the details of the evidence which was required to determine the issues in the case, not always, it has to be said, successfully but usually with more success than the Court or the other advocates achieved in this regard.</span></p>

She has previously required inpatient psychiatric care and detention under the Mental Health Act.  FP has invariably been afforded diagnoses of psychosis, non-organic psychosis and paranoid schizophrenia.  It was clear at assessment and noted within the mental state examination that FP continues to present with a range of delusional beliefs, primarily relating to the harvesting of her internal organs.  There is no evidence that FP suffers from any other mental illness.  There is no evidence that FP would meet the criteria for any degree of learning disability.  I do note her significant care needs that exceed her own appraisal of necessity of input and would ascribe these deficits within her adaptive functioning and the dual comorbidities of epilepsy and cerebral palsy.  She has significant continence needs and there are further concerns regarding her behavioural presentation, with the provided documentation particularly referencing agitation, physical assaults, e.g., grabbing at both staff and RT, self-harms and breaking, swallowing objects. </span></p>

I would like to advise her to read [the placement] brochure, what they are promising.  I still wait to see any of it.  On Thursday, FP had a fall.  I caught her in time, and it was more like a slide.  It happened in front of the office.  FP was trying to turn around.  Her shoulder was a little bit red because she slid by the wall but no bruises or anything like that but suddenly, no, not suddenly, next day, M became concerned and sent FP to hospital for all day.  At first, I thought it is FP&#8217;s idea because it is usually her initiative but when I came to the hospital and asked FP if she is in the hospital mood, she said no, it was not her idea.  Urine infection found.  I do not believe FP has urine infection.  I am more inclined to believe that FP was neglected as usual and was not properly washed.  Now, she is on antibiotics again.  She just finished a short course of them for the same problem.  I am a little bit disappointed in A, to whom I praised in my previous letter.  It seems to me that she took the attitude of the bad company, &#8220;cannot force FP&#8221;, because I came on Saturday, 2 December, at 11.20, FP was still in bed, wet through with urine.  I see it as laziness because if she approaches FP in the right way, there will be any of what happening right now&#8221;. </span></p>

I have no doubt that RT worries about the welfare of FP but RT&#8217;s highly emotional presentation and her inability to allow FP to be supported by others than her is a source of high expressed emotion and the dynamics of the relationship contribute to an unhealthy cycle of FP and RT&#8217;s level of emotion and distress, increasing distress in the other and, in FP&#8217;s case, leading to increased agitation and a decline in her mental health.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is of considerable concern that RT has not been truthful in respect of her involvement with FP&#8217;s medication.  Her evidence before me made it clear that she thought she knew best in relation to her daughter&#8217;s medication.  She told me when she was asked if she had any idea how dangerous it is as a medically unqualified person to stop the medication, her response to me was: &#8220;I know my daughter.  I spend a lot of time with her&#8221;.  Later, she said; &#8220;I try my best.  Maybe I make a mistake but when something is not right&#8221;.  If RT was responsible for assisting FP with her medication, upon the basis of the evidence of past behaviour, if RT thought that the medication should be stopped or changed or was not the most efficacious for FP, I am satisfied that she would exercise her own choices without necessarily consulting with a doctor, not recognising how much of a risk she could subject FP to.</span></p>

While undertaking to the Court and it being explained to her the meaning of an undertaking, I find that RT breached the undertaking without a qualm, telling me she was justified in so doing because she had taken the view that the evidence of what FP wanted and how she was treated should be available in video form to the Court.  She was largely unapologetic.  She was in the right, entitled to do it, because she wanted to provide the evidence to the Court of FP in a distressed state.  It was justifiable, according to RT, to prove the points that she wanted to make.</span></p>

I am satisfied that RT has behaved in a way that is not in P&#8217;s best interests as detailed within the body of this judgment and the evidence of past behaviour is indicative of future behaviour.  The Council, supported by the litigation friend, invites me to revoke the LPA under Section 22(4).  Dr Ince expressed significant concerns as to FP&#8217;s ability to understand, retain and weigh information relating to the signing of documentation or that, on the balance of probability, FP understood the purpose of the document.  However, it is under Section 22(4) that I am asked to revoke the LPA on the basis that the donee has behaved or is behaving in a way that is not in P&#8217;s best interests or proposes to behave in a way that would not be in P&#8217;s best interests.</span></p>

The evidence leads me to a finding that RT has no insight into her behaviour and its effect upon the wellbeing of FP and, therefore, the prospect of any change in her behaviour is remote.  Even now, RT has no understanding of the basic consideration of capacity.  RT now believes the NHS and the Council are subjecting FP to a chemical attack by interfering with her medication.  Those beliefs entirely prevent RT from acting in FP&#8217;s best interests now or in the future.  There is every sign that if RT has the power to do so, she will continue to make decisions contrary to FP&#8217;s best interest.</span></p>

However, it is apparent from this judgment that the facts which have been determined upon hearing extensive evidence in this case must be relevant in considering contact.  There is a need to regulate and supervise contact so that RT&#8217;s highly expressed emotion and presentation, the strong negative and critical references to the support staff and carers and the conflicts in RT&#8217;s own relationship with FP can be reduced and managed so that they do not detrimentally affect FP and contribute to the deterioration in her mental health.  The issue of telephone contact and the removal of FP&#8217;s phone at night needs careful consideration and Dr Ince&#8217;s changing view between November, December and August requires careful analysis.  I do not feel I am in a position to express any more concluded views on contact at this stage. </span></p>

It would be potentially unsafe, not only in respect of possible interference with medication but also taking account of all the findings I have made based upon the evidence which I have read and heard and although it may well be a considerable period of time before FP is sufficiently well to be discharged from [hospital], I am satisfied that it is appropriate and within my power to make that declaration.</span></p>
