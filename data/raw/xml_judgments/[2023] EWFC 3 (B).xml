	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">This is an application for a declaration of parentage brought by joint applicants, Steven Lord Lloyd-Bagrationi (&#8220;the first applicant&#8221;) and Kate Lloyd-Bagrationi. They are brother and sister, and live in the Republic of Georgia. Both are aged in their 50s. They are not legally represented. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">There are no living respondents to the application. The applicants seek a declaration that their father was a British man called Stephen Henry Lloyd, who died in 1971. The other potential respondent to the application, Kate Bagrationi, the applicants&#8217; mother (who was Georgian), died in 2010. The applicants are the only children of their parents. In those circumstances it seems to me that there are good reasons to waive the obligation imposed by FPR 2010, r.8.20 to consider identifying and joining a personal representative of either deceased respondent.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is the applicants&#8217; case that they are members of both the English and the Georgian royal families. At points in the proceedings the applicants have used a variety of titles (eg &#8220;The Right Honourable&#8221;). In this judgment I intend to refer to them simply as the applicants. I mean no disrespect to them in doing so. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Although the proceedings were issued in May 2021 the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to hear the application has not yet been determined. The reason for that is that there have been significant difficulties in establishing reliable communication with the applicants. It has not been possible for the applicants to attend recent hearings, either in person or remotely, and in the end, after several attempts at communicating effectively with the applicants by any means other than email, I determined that the application should be dealt with on paper and made directions accordingly. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The evidence on which the applicants rely in order to support their case as to jurisdiction overlaps to a significant extent with their evidence in support of the substantive application. For that reason, and because it has not been possible to deal with the issue of jurisdiction at any of the preliminary hearings, I intend in this judgment to consider first the totality of the evidence filed, before turning to my conclusions in respect of both jurisdiction and, subject to my decision on that, the substantive issues with which the application is concerned. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">A first directions hearing took place remotely before Recorder Stirling on 15.7.21. The applicants attended by telephone. The Recorder considered the issue of jurisdiction and expressed a preliminary view, but did not decide the issue due to the lack of evidence then available. He made comprehensive directions for the filing of evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Recorder Stirling also directed, pursuant to FLA 1986, s 59, that the papers should be sent to the Attorney-General so that she could take a decision whether or not to intervene. It is recorded on the order that the reason for the referral was the fact that the applicants&#8217; motivation for the application, which was likely to be unopposed, was to obtain British citizenship. There were then substantial delays, initially because the court office failed to send the papers to the Attorney&#8217;General&#8217;s office as directed, and then because the response from the Attorney-General&#8217;s office was delayed.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On 20.6.22 the second applicant did not join the hearing. The first applicant did not join the hearing himself, but a McKenzie friend joined on his behalf and the first applicant was connected by a Skype link to her phone. This was a very unsatisfactory means of communicating with him, first because it was very difficult to hear what he was saying over a link that was &#8216;doubly&#8217; remote, and secondly because, perhaps understandably, his McKenzie friend was very anxious to speak on his behalf and tended to provide her own answers to questions rather than permitting a direct exchange between the first applicant and the court. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In advance of the next hearing on 13.7.22, my clerk made attempts to find a means by which the applicants could join a remote hearing and communicate directly with the court. Two videolink methods were attempted: the court&#8217;s own video platform, CVP, and MS Teams. The applicants were also offered the opportunity to dial in to the hearing via a telephone link. None of these methods worked. I adjourned the hearing and set out on the face of the order the need for the applicants to ensure that they were able to join the next hearing by videolink or telephone. </p>

The first applicant&#8217;s device joined the CVP link but he could not be seen or heard. My clerk invited him to dial in to the hearing by telephone but he informed her (by email) that he did not have sufficient credit on his phone to do so. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I took the decision at this point that the applications needed to be timetabled to a conclusion. I listed a final hearing to commence on 5.1.23, and a pre-trial review on 6.12.22. In my order I set out (a) the gaps in the evidence which I had identified, following a review of the documents submitted by the applicants, and (b) the practical steps that needed to be taken in order for an effective final hearing to take place. Among those steps was a direction that the applicants should contact the dedicated Foreign and Commonwealth Office email address provided in CPR Practice Direction 32<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span>The equivalent FPR provision is PD 22A, but for some reason, although the guidance (para 5) is the same, the FPR version does not include the email address. </p>
	      </authorialNote>, to establish whether there was likely to be any legal or diplomatic objection to either giving evidence remotely from Georgia. As far as I am aware that direction was not complied with. Nor did the applicants comply with a direction that each should file a separate witness statement accompanied by a statement of truth. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">At the PTR on 6.12.22 it was, again, not possible to join either applicant to the remote link and it was clear that, given the applicants&#8217; apparent inability to travel to the UK for the hearing, it would not be possible for me to hear oral evidence at the final hearing. I considered whether the application should be dismissed but determined, and recorded on the order, that the fairer course would be to proceed to determine the application on the papers. I gave the applicants a final opportunity to comply with directions made for the filing of evidence, reduced the time estimate for the hearing and dispensed with the requirement for the applicants to attend. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I recognise that the circumstances in which I am deciding this application are unsatisfactory. Although the applicants have now filed separate witness statements in the required form, in response to the direction repeated at the PTR, the content of each statement is identical and each simply repeats passages from previous documents. There remain a number of areas where the applicants&#8217; evidence lacks clarity and there would therefore have been a significant benefit in hearing their oral evidence. I am troubled by the fact that this has not been possible. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The applicants say that in recent years the Georgian authorities have refused to recognise them as Georgian and have revoked their Georgian citizenship. I have struggled to understand why that would be in circumstances where both applicants were born and currently live in Georgia, and there appears to be no dispute about their mother&#8217;s Georgian nationality at least. Be that as it may, it is the applicants&#8217; case that this development led them to make enquiries with the (UK) Home Office as to how they might establish British citizenship by descent. They were told that they would need to provide documentation in support of their claim, including their father&#8217;s birth and marriage certificates, and their own birth certificates. They have been unable to provide all of the documentation required by the Home Office, in particular their father&#8217;s birth certificate. They have made this application in the hope that a declaration of parentage will assist them. </p>

They say that he was born on 22.10.39. They have not been able to find any record of his birth or family, or indeed any documentation supporting his connections with the UK, and believe that this is because all records were destroyed in the war. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The difficulty faced by the applicants is the absence of any reliable evidence that their father was born in, lived in, or had any connection with England and Wales or any other part of the UK. The &#8220;testimonials&#8221; apparently produced by Georgian friends of their family can only, at their highest, establish the existence of a man known as Stephen Lloyd who taught at Tbilisi State University in the 1960s and was believed to be English. A substantial counterweight to that evidence, and a factor which significantly undermines it, is the absence of any records of Stephen Lloyd&#8217;s birth or existence in the UK in circumstances where, as I have observed, there would be a firm expectation that these would be available. </p>

It follows that I cannot make any finding as to either applicant&#8217;s domicile of origin. </p>

The first applicant&#8217;s case is that he lived in England and Wales, predominantly in the East London area, for an unspecified period of some years. He has declined to give a date for his return to Georgia in his written evidence although it appears that he told the court at the first hearing in these proceedings that he left his East London address and (it is implied) returned to Georgia &#8220;two or three years&#8221; before this application was issued. He has produced some very limited documentation in support of his asserted residence in this country.</p>

Even if it had been possible to find that the applicant lived in the UK at some point in the past, his apparent acceptance that he has not lived here for some time, and the absence of evidence that, as at the date of the application, he was intending to return, makes it likely in my view that by the date of the application he had lost any domicile of choice that he had previously acquired.</p>

It is the applicants&#8217; case that their passports have been removed by the Georgian authorities and they are stateless. Even assuming that to be correct, it would not be sufficient, in the absence of evidence, to establish a domicile in England and Wales. </p>

During the course of the proceedings the applicants applied for me to recuse myself (I refused this application on paper) on the basis, amongst other things, that the court&#8217;s requests for further evidence from the applicants were unreasonable. </p>

It may assist the applicants if I tell them that had the application proceeded I might have been prepared, at most, to find that their father was a man who taught at Tbilisi State University in the 1960s under the name of Stephen Henry Lloyd. It certainly would not have been possible, on the basis of the evidence produced, for me to make any finding about his nationality, background or the date or place of his birth. So even if I had been able to make a declaration of parentage in that limited form, it is highly unlikely that this would have been of any use to the applicants in establishing British citizenship. </p>

I have tried to approach this issue with caution as I have not heard oral evidence and so the applicants have not had the opportunity to explain directly what have appeared to be significant gaps and inconsistencies in their evidence. I have been mindful also of some cultural dissonance in this case: the applicants&#8217; focus throughout their witness statements has been on the hardships they have suffered, and their evidence (and that of their Georgian witnesses) is expressed in eloquent and beseeching language. It has been difficult to convey to the applicants, when I have had so little opportunity to engage directly with them, what has been required by this court, whose sole concern is to determine the facts. I hope that the applicants understand that the main reason their application has failed is in fact not that I do not believe them or am unsympathetic to their situation, but simply that the evidence they have produced is not sufficient. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">I intend to publish this judgment, after giving the applicants an opportunity to make representations in respect of whether or not they would wish their names to be anonymised. My main reason for doing so is transparency: there is a general public interest in increasing awareness of the workings of the Family Justice System and the wide range of cases that come before the courts. However, it has also occurred to me that if in fact there is more substance in the applicants&#8217; case than has been apparent from the evidence produced in these proceedings, publication of the judgment may perhaps assist them to locate and identify members of their wider paternal family and to produce the evidence which the court (or, probably more pertinently, the Home Office) would require in order to establish their British nationality. </p>
