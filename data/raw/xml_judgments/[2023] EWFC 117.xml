	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a fact finding hearing within care proceedings concerning a young girl (R) who is now about three years old. The fact finding centres around alleged injuries to her younger brother (T)  who died when he was just seven weeks old.  The post mortem did not establish any cause of death, but a skeletal survey conducted shortly after his death revealed two rib fractures and the post mortem several more.</p>

He has a reasonable relationship with their mother, and before the events in question had  contact with them albeit disrupted by the pandemic.  The father has worked as a bus driver for several years and neither party is known to the police.  Shortly after the parents&#8217; relationship commenced the mother became pregnant with R and then just a year later with T.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In August 2020 the parents took R to hospital after she had fallen to the floor from her pram. She had not suffered any injury and was discharged.  T was born in 2021.  The father had two weeks&#8217; paternity leave and then returned to work. For the most part he worked from Mondays to Fridays on a shift basis although he sometimes did overtime at the weekend. The mother remained at home caring for the children.  Although the children were very close in age the mother said she managed this without difficulty, especially as she and the father shared the care (including overnights with the new baby) when he was there.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2021 was a Sunday and both parents were at home.  The father was responsible for feeding and changing T for most of that day, and overnight too. The arrangement was that one parent would sleep in the main bedroom with R in her cot, and the other in the sitting room with T.  That night the father stayed with T. Both parents say that R was teething and did not go to bed until quite late. The mother herself went to bed late, probably at about 1 or 2am leaving the father and T in the sitting room. The father said he fed and changed T at about 4.30am and then at about 8.  He had taken 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May as holiday in order to clean up the flat and to take items to the dump in advance of an inspection by the landlord.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Once he had fed and changed T, he said he put him in the spare room where there were bunk beds, on the bottom bunk.  This was about 9am. T settled relatively quickly, albeit the father had to give him a dummy before he did so. The father said he left T lying on his back with his head on a pillow and pillows to either side of him.  He said he did not check on him again until shortly before the 999 call at 1.08pm when he was discovered to be lifeless.</p>

The mother then went into the sitting room with R, and also went into the kitchen to make breakfast and hot drinks.  She said she did not look in on T in the spare room, and does not recall whether the door to that room was open or closed.</p>

He took T into the sitting room and sought help from the mother. She called 999. The paramedics arrived quickly and after a number of attempts of resuscitation T was airlifted to hospital from a field nearby. He never regained consciousness.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An initial skeletal survey revealed he had two healing rib fractures.  As a result a forensic post mortem was arranged.  The results of that took almost a year.  No cause of death could be found, but he was discovered to have numerous healing rib fractures of at least two different ages.  Care proceedings were commenced in relation to R and she was placed in foster care. Unfortunately she has endured several changes of placement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority case as pleaded in the final threshold document is that T had a total of 16 fractures caused on at least two occasions. Between about 7 and 14 days before his death it is alleged he sustained fractures to the right 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> anterior and 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 12 posterior ribs, and the left 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> anterior, 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>,  9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> posterior ribs.  Between about 2 and 5 days before he died it is alleged he sustained fractures to the right 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> posterior rib and the left 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> (a possible re-fracture) and 7th  posterior and 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> anterior, ribs.  These fractures, say the local authority, would have been caused by forceful chest compression, causing pain at the time they were inflicted which would have been apparent to the perpetrator. The perpetrator must have been acting negligently, recklessly or intentionally.  It is alleged that neither parent sought medical treatment for T, and that they must each know more about the circumstances of the injury than they are willing to admit. If the person who did not cause the injuries to T saw or heard what had happened then they failed to protect him from further injury.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority also seeks findings that the father&#8217;s explanation as to how he placed T to sleep is not truthful, and that, in the event T was found to be face down on the bed, he must have been placed in that way by either the father or the mother.  It is alleged that the placing of T in that position was unsafe and would have posed a risk of significant harm for him.  The local authority state that as a consequence R is at risk of significant harm in the future as she is close in age to T.</p>

They each stand by the history that was given to the police and this court, namely that the father put T in the spare room on the bed with his head on a pillow and pillows around him and found him face down and lifeless some hours later. The mother states that she woke late that morning, and was unaware that there was anything wrong until the father brought T into the sitting room after finding him lifeless.  She is adamant that she did not check on him that morning and expresses regret that she did not do so.</p>

His evidence is not challenged by the parents. He found a number of rib  fractures as set out in a table in his report.  It is on his conclusions that the local authority has based the findings under this heading sought in the threshold. Professor Mangham found no pathological evidence of generalised bone disease or any other abnormality.  He found there to be injuries of at least two different ages, both older than the date of death.  He said it was not possible to say there were not traumatic rib injuries closer to the time of death than 2 to 5 days, but if so these were masked on microscopic examination by the presence of earlier fractures.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Professor Leadbeatter Consultant Pathologist was instructed in these proceedings to address the issue of bone injuries, general pathology and the cause of death. He concurred with the conclusion of Professor Jeffery (the Consultant Pathologist who reported on the forensic post mortem) that the cause of death was unascertainable. He opined that even in a situation where an infant is placed in an unsafe sleeping environment, it remains the case that the role of such in the cause of death cannot be determined with precision.  In a supplementary report he explained this in more detail and also concluded that it was not possible to narrow the timing as to when T had died or how long he had been lying face down.</p>

There were some differences between him and Professor Mangham as to one or two rib fractures (for example he only identified 2 fractures for the later time window) but essentially he agreed that there were multiple rib fractures likely to be of two different ages but no evidence that they occurred at the time of death.  His timing window was less precise than Professor Mangham but nonetheless he made clear he was not comfortable with the suggestion put to him in cross examination that all the fractures might have been caused at the same time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr. Olsen&#8217;s oral evidence closely followed that in his written report. As a radiologist he gave evidence only about the two rib fractures that he was able to see on the skeletal survey. From his perspective the fractures he saw could have occurred at either the same or different dates.   He said that in order for the ribs he saw to fracture there must be a mechanism and a level of force, part of the likely mechanism being some pressure from the back, forcing the backbone into the chest cavity. The child could be on his front with someone pushing hard on the back or held around the torso with fingers on the spine or backbone squeezing onto the breastbone. He did not think this would be part of ordinary handling.  The reason he felt able to be prescriptive about the fractures that he saw was that the fractures he saw were to the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> ribs which are &#8216;floating&#8217;, namely not connected to the breastbone.  Dr. Olsen gave reasons for the dating he gave to the fractures which was somewhat wide, given he only had one set of images to go on, but he was confident that the most recent date was in advance of T&#8217;s death.  He accepted that not all conditions that give rise to bony fragility are visible radiologically, but said that as a clinician he would be extremely worried if there was a fracture shown on an x -ray but there was no explanation for it.</p>

He said that the fractures would almost certainly cause pain which the child would express by crying, albeit after this the child might not show any symptoms of pain, particularly from those fractures which were partial.</p>

She said she could not remember if the father was getting things ready to go to the tip that morning, saying that she did not really have involvement with it.   She did not remember why she had not checked on T that morning or whether the door to the spare room was open or shut. She said that it was possible that she had not gone in to see him because she did not want to disturb him. She said she did not remember what she had asked the father about the morning, because she was so busy with R.   She said she had no reason to think anything was wrong, but now wished she had checked.  She said she did not recall having a discussion with the father about what could have happened to have caused the rib fractures, nor did she recall him giving any explanation as to why he had put T&#8217;s head on a pillow on the fateful day.  She said they did not like to talk about it because it was traumatic although she also said that she and the father had spoken &#8216;a lot&#8217; about putting T in the spare room, albeit she was not able to recall details of the conversations save to say that he did not know why he had done it.  She agreed that if she had seen that T&#8217;s head had been put on a pillow she would have questioned it.

He said he did not remember if he and the mother had had a conversation as to how the rib fractures had been caused, although he said he liked to think he would have asked her.

She did not look after T overnight or feed him in the morning. Getting up at 10.30 or so when you have sole care of a one year old is unusual, so too is it unusual that she did not even look in at T for over two hours that morning. Of course the fact that it is unusual does not mean it did not happen. As I have explained earlier in this judgment I found her evidence about the hours before T&#8217;s death in the witness box was vague. I think some at least of what happened that  morning before T was found the mother would have thought about many times, yet her evidence was punctuated by answers to the effect that she did not know, that she did not remember, whether that was if the door to the bedroom was open, what subsequent conversations she had had with the father about why he put T&#8217;s head on a pillow, or what she was doing that morning beyond making a cup of coffee or tea and playing with R or why she did not look at him when she got up.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She was also very vague about why she had had such a late night and morning.  She said that the father &#8216;beat himself up&#8217; about putting T in the spare room and that she had therefore not liked to question him and point the finger (an expression they both used in their evidence).  Even making allowances for the time that has passed, and for shock and grief I found the mother&#8217;s answers to counsel about the events in question superficial. Many answers seemed to me to be designed to avoid giving too much information and to show support for the father.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The same point arises with the father&#8217;s evidence.  Once again, I take into account the length of time since T died and also the shock and grief that he suffered.  The reports of him at the hospital describe this vividly.  Nonetheless, he said little about what the mother was doing that morning, or why it was that she would have woken up so late and not looked at T at all.  On any view, having cared for T all night and with chores to do in the morning he might have expected the mother to be up and assisting with both children.  His suggestion that he put T in the spare room because he had work to do in the house, moving things and painting was somewhat undermined when it was put to him that he seemed to have done very little of any of those chores that morning. There was no work done on the television sets, very few things moved to the tip, and not much cleaning up in the house.  There may have been some painting but, that day at least, not much. He really could not explain how T could have  moved from the position he put him in over onto his front.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other notable feature of the father&#8217;s evidence was his description of holding T around his chest and briefly letting go of him in play.  Given that T died when he was only 7 weeks old and at a stage where he was not yet smiling (this is in the medical notes) and would have had limited head control, this was an odd way to treat such a small infant.  The father&#8217;s evidence about this was once again, vague. At one point he said he had done it a few times, but then said it was once or twice. The issue of head control did not seem to have occurred to him.  If he had really done it as he said, I would have thought this would have been obvious.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Taking into account all the evidence that I have heard and read,  I have come to the conclusion that the father has not told the court the whole story about what happened that morning. T could not have rolled from the position the father describes when he put him on the bottom bunk to the position that he found him at 1 o&#8217;clock.  The consistency of the father&#8217;s accounts over time suggests that the framework of what happened is correct, but some things must have been left out, mistaken or are simple untrue.  Either the father did not put T down on the bed with his face up in the way he suggests or T was moved afterwards. There is no evidence that this played a role in his death at all, but nonetheless the way in which T was put on the bed was unsafe and risky. There were two dummies on the bunk when the police looked around the house and took photographs later that day which is important supportive evidence that T was placed there that day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moving onto the rib fractures, I have come to the conclusion that they were caused on at least two different occasions.  The mechanism was forceful compression to the chest, probably by squeezing. For the fractures close to the vertebrae there would have been an element of force applied to T&#8217;s back. I find that the force used was excessive and that T did not suffer from any condition that led him to have fragile bones. I accept that there is a gap in the medical evidence which cannot be filled in a child so young and without a full range of testing but make the findings despite this.  For fractures to occur there needs to be a causative event, even in the presence of some condition which causes bones to be weak or susceptible.  Neither of the parents give an account of anything which could have led to this. Squeezing with compression onto the back of the spine is not an event which occurs easily with everyday handling.   The father&#8217;s description of holding T by the ribs, letting him go slightly and catching him does not come with any account of T appearing to be hurt as a consequence. I do not think the father would have forgotten if it had caused him to cry out.  I have already found the parents to have been somewhat vague and avoidant in their evidence to this court, albeit about events surrounding T&#8217;s death.  The parents each displayed very little curiosity about the rib fractures. The mother said they had had a discussion about how they were caused but she could not recall any explanation for them. The father, when asked whether he had asked the mother about rib fractures said first that he supposed that he had asked her, then that he would have liked to have thought he had asked her but that he did not remember if he had.  He said that he trusted her and responded to questions in cross examination as to whether she might be responsible by saying words to the effect of &#8216;if you want to point the finger&#8217;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the mother&#8217;s brother looked after T on one or two occasions it is not realistically suggested that he could be the perpetrator. The only possible perpetrators of the rib injuries are the mother and the father.  I have considered whether it is possible to identify one or other of them as the perpetrator but have come to the conclusion, unfortunately, that it is not. Whilst the father&#8217;s evidence about his handling of T by holding him around the ribs and letting go was troubling, and I have rejected his explanation of how he placed T on the bed on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May I have come to the conclusion that these factors are not sufficient for me to identify him as the one who was responsible on the balance of probabilities.   I have concerns about the mother&#8217;s evidence overall which I have set out above. Each of the parents had the opportunity to cause the injuries and I can take things no further than to say that there is a real possibility that either of them was responsible.</p>

As to paragraph 9 I make these comments.  The fact that the fractures were painful at the time they were inflicted would have been clear to the perpetrator but the medical evidence is that a non-perpetrator would very likely have been unaware that T was injured.  So the non-perpetrator could not have been expected to seek medical attention, and the perpetrator may not have realised that fractures were present.   It is correct that if the non-perpetrator saw or heard what happened the first time and did nothing about it they did fail to protect T, but there is no evidence for me to make such a finding.  What I do find is that both parents have been protective of each other in this investigation rather than giving priority to finding out or explaining how T could have been injured.</p>

Paragraph 14 does not really add anything to the threshold especially as Dr. Leadbeatter was clear about the lack of evidence that this played any part in T&#8217;s tragic death.   As to paragraph 15 I make all the findings sought for the reasons I have set out, save that at (b) and (c) this should relate to the father only.  Whilst I have expressed concerns about the mother&#8217;s evidence there is nothing to suggest that she was involved in placing T on the bed or moving him.</p>

There have never been any concerns about her care, and I note I have the evidence of the parenting assessment carried out shortly after T died as well as evidence relating to the period of time before and after that. R lived with the parents for over a year after T died without coming to any harm.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I acknowledge the care that R has received from the parents, I do not accept the submission on behalf of the parents that the threshold criteria with respect to her are not met.  Although only two of the fractures T sustained were visible on x-ray, they are all serious injuries which occurred on more than one occasion. Whether they were caused deliberately, recklessly or negligently they represent a serious failure in his care, and would have been painful for him at the time.   R was part of that household. The injuries happened  in circumstances where there were no other concerns for the  care  of either child and the parents have said there were no domestic stresses. When T died there were no signs he had been neglected or any other signs of ill-treatment other than the fractures.  This means that the injuries took place in circumstances which are totally unknown. Neither parent appears to have challenged the other about them or shown  willingness to accept or believe that their partner could be a danger.  In those circumstances I find that there is a real likelihood or possibility that R will suffer significant harm in the future. This existed at the date that T died, at the date the proceedings were started and now.  I therefore make the findings sought at paragraphs 16, 17 and 18. </p>
