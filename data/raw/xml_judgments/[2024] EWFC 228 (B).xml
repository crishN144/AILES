      <p><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">This judgment was given in private. The judge gives permission for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of this judgment the anonymity of the children and members of their family must be strictly preserved. If the judgment is to be reported or published, there is a requirement to ensure that no reporting restriction will be breached. This is particularly important in relation to any case involving a sexual offence, where the victim is guaranteed lifetime anonymity (Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992), or where an order has been made in relation to a young person. All persons, including representatives of the media and legal bloggers must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so may be a contempt of court.</span></p>

I accept that the facts of the matter flow through the judgment, but I do not accept that the required redactions or anonymisations would render the judgment unintelligible or useless to the reader.  The redactions and anonymisations that are required are likely to be a challenging task but with some care and thought, in my judgement, it is possible to redact the judgement in such a way that it minimises risk.  </span></p>

They have had over 20 months to progress the investigation.  I was provided no detail as to ongoing lines of enquiry that would be jeopardised by publication of the judgment.&#160;&#160;Any such argument would, in any event, only be applicable to deferment of publication rather than publication itself.  I have considered whether publication should be deferred until such time as the investigation has concluded and have decided it should not be.  The investigation is not far off 2 years old.  There is no indication a file will be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service any time soon.  When this matter started in 2022 mention was made of the investigation taking years and, sadly, that has proved to be the case.  I do not consider it appropriate to defer publication to an uncertain unspecified date in the future.&#160;</span></p>

Police forces are public bodies.  There is a public interest in how they discharge their duties and of them being held to account if there are failings.  There is also public interest in an awareness of a recognition of failings and a commitment to implement change.  It cannot be right that this judgment should not be published as it may lead to press scrutiny and jeopardise non-related investigations.  If that argument were right no judgment critical of the police would ever be published.</span></p>

They submit that naming individuals represents an extraordinary measure that warrants careful consideration of the potential consequences such as possible infringement on their privacy and personal safety.  It is clear from my judgment that the failings were of a systemic nature.  They were the result of a lack of supervision; lack of appropriate management; lack of awareness of the most basic of legal principles and lack of awareness of the family justice system and procedures.  They are failings that have been recognised and assurances have been given that lessons will be learned, and changes will be implemented.  The naming of individuals adds nothing to the judgment, and I agree that there should be anonymisation of the frontline workers and police officers.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">There is also an issue as to whether the Local Authority and Police Force should be named.  I recognise that Local authorities are public bodies with a statutory responsibility for the welfare and protection of children and support of families.  Where that work results in proceedings the Local Authority is held accountable for its actions with families by the court.  I also recognise that the need for a public body to be identified when acting in respect of citizens is recognised to be important.  However, the major argument against publication of this judgment is the risk posed of identification or jigsaw identification.  Careful redaction and anonymisation of the judgment is required to ameliorate against that risk.  Naming the Local Authority and/or the Police Force in this case will set clear geographical boundaries to the location of this family that may serve to undermine work undertaken to redact/abridge other parts of the judgment.  For that reason, the Local Authority should just be identified as a Local Authority in Wales and the Police as a Police Force in Wales.</span></p>
