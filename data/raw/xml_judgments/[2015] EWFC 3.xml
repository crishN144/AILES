	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are care proceedings in relation to two children, B, a boy, born in July 2010 and G, a girl, born in July 2011 (these are not their real initials). In terms of their ethnic origin, both the father, F, and the mother, M, come from an African country which I shall refer to as country A, though the mother was born and brought up in a Scandinavian country which I shall refer to as country S (again, these are not the real initials). The family are Muslims. The proceedings were commenced in November 2013, triggered by M&#8217;s seeming abandonment of G in the street. B and G were placed in foster care the same month and have remained with the same foster carer throughout.</p>

She received her MBE in 2008 in recognition of her services to women&#8217;s healthcare. As a midwife, her primary expertise &#8211; and it is very extensive indeed &#8211; is in relation to pregnant women who have been subjected to FGM.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;On genital examination, [G] had evidence of a scar extending adjacent to her clitoral hood on the left side. There was also some distortion and adhesions around her clitoral hood, but underneath this there was evidence of a clitoral body. The labium minus on the left side appeared to be adhering to the inner aspect of her left labium majus. The labium minus on the right side appeared small but no there was no obvious scar tissue or adhesions. There were no disruptions to her urethra.  Her hymen was visualised using separation and traction. I feel there was a bump on the hymen at the 5 o&#8217;clock position. This is a normal variant. Her hymen was otherwise smooth and there were no obvious disruptions. Her anus was not examined.</p>

I am unclear as to the cause of her labial adhesion on the left side, this may be due to chronic vulvovaginitis, but it may also be due to removal of part of the labium and healing has allowed this labium to adhere to the labium majus. I think it is appropriate that a second opinion is sought so the findings can be confirmed, but in my opinion [G] has been a victim of female genital mutilation type 1 and possibly type 2.&#8221;</p>

She added, as recorded in the minute, that &#8220;it was always her view that if FGM has occurred it is through a nicking cut as detailed by the WHO as level 4&#8221; &#8211; a comment which, if accurately recorded, is at variance with what she was saying in this report and which, as Mr Myers put it, does not bear close scrutiny.

The discharge extends into the skin creases on either side of the clitoris making it impossible to distinguish between a skin crease and a scar. It may have been possible to wipe the discharge away with a cotton tipped swab to expose the scar but this was not done. No measurements are given for the length of the scar. The light reflection by the camera also interferes with the image in some of the views. It is not possible from the DVD images to confirm the present of the scar.  </p>

After I had queried this on the first day of the hearing (20 October 2014), the local authority reconsidered the matter.

I assume, therefore, that B either has been or will in due course be circumcised. Yet, entirely understandably, and, if I may say so, entirely appropriately, this is not a matter that has been raised before me. There is no suggestion, nor could there be, that B&#8217;s circumcision can or should give rise to care proceedings. So, given the nature of the local authority&#8217;s case on this point, we are in this curious situation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moving on to the second limb of the statutory test, Mr Hayes submits that in assessing whether the infliction of any form of FGM can ever be an aspect of &#8220;reasonable&#8221; parenting, it is vital to bear in mind that FGM involves physical harm which, it is common ground, has (except in the very narrow circumstances defined in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003</ref>, not relevant in a case such as this) <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> medical justification and confers <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> health benefits. The fact that it may be a &#8220;cultural&#8221; practice does not make FGM reasonable; indeed, the proposition is specifically negatived by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(5)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/31" uk:canonical="2003 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2003 Act</ref>. And, as I have already pointed out, FGM has no religious justification. So, he submits, it can never be reasonable parenting to inflict <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> form of FGM on a child. I agree.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is at this point in the analysis, as it seems to me, that the clear distinction between FGM and male circumcision appears. Whereas it can never be reasonable parenting to inflict <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> form of FGM on a child, the position is quite different with male circumcision. Society and the law, including family law, are prepared to tolerate non-therapeutic male circumcision performed for religious or even for purely cultural or conventional reasons, while no longer being willing to tolerate FGM in any of its forms. There are, after all, at least two important distinctions between the two.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>In saying this I do not overlook the other important distinctions identified in the authorities I referred to in paragraph 64 above.</p>
	      </authorialNote> FGM has no basis in any religion; male circumcision is often performed for religious reasons. FGM has no medical justification and confers no health benefits; male circumcision is seen by some (although opinions are divided) as providing hygienic or prophylactic benefits. Be that as it may, &#8220;reasonable&#8221; parenting is treated as permitting male circumcision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude therefore that although both involve significant harm, there is a very clear distinction in family law between FGM and male circumcision. FGM in any form will suffice to establish &#8216;threshold&#8217; in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>; male circumcision without more will not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since in the circumstances the point was only briefly explored in submissions, I propose to say very little about it. No generalisations are possible. Much will obviously depend upon the particular type of FGM in question, upon the nature and significance of any other &#8216;threshold&#8217; findings, and, more generally, upon a very wide range of welfare issues as they arise in the particular circumstances of the specific case. Arriving at an overall welfare evaluation and identifying the appropriately proportionate outcome is likely to be especially difficult in many FGM cases. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are two particular problems. The first is that once a girl has been subjected to FGM, the damage has been done but, on the evidence I have heard, she is unlikely to be subjected to further FGM (though of course female siblings who have not yet been subjected to it are likely to be at risk of FGM). How does that reality feed through into an overall welfare evaluation? The other problem is that, by definition, FGM is practised only on girls and not on boys. In a case where FGM is the only &#8216;threshold&#8217; factor in play, there will be no statutory basis for care proceedings in relation to any male sibling(s). Suppose, for example, that the FGM is so severe and the circumstances so far as concerns the girl are such that, were she an only child, adoption would be the appropriate outcome: what is the appropriate outcome if she has a brother who cannot be made the subject of proceedings? Is her welfare best served by separating her permanently from her parents at the price of severing the sibling bond? Or is it best served by preserving the family unit? I do not hazard an answer. I merely identify the very real difficulties than can arise in such a case. In cases where there are other threshold factors in play, balancing the welfare arguments as between the girl(s) and the boy(s) may be more than usually complex, particularly if FGM is a factor of magnetic importance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I add a final observation. Plainly, given the nature of the evil, prevention is infinitely better than &#8216;cure&#8217;. Local authorities need to be pro-active and vigilant in taking appropriate protective measures to prevent girls being subjected to FGM. And, as I have already said, the court must not hesitate to use every weapon in its protective arsenal if faced with a case of actual or anticipated FGM. An important tool which lies readily to hand for use by local authorities is that provided by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 100</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>. The inherent jurisdiction, as well as all the other jurisdictions of the High Court and the Family Court, must be as vigorously mobilised in the prevention of FGM as they have hitherto been in relation to forced marriage. Given what we now know is the distressingly great prevalence of FGM in this country even today, some thirty years after FGM was first criminalised, it is sobering to reflect that this is not merely the first care case where FGM has featured but also, I suspect, if not the first one of only a handful of FGM cases that have yet found their way to the family courts. The courts alone, whether the family courts or the criminal courts, cannot eradicate this great evil but they have an important role to play and a very much greater role than they have hitherto been able to play.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:1.12in">There is a dearth of medical experts in this area, particularly in relation to FGM in young children. Specific training and education is highly desirable. As Professor Creighton explained (Transcript pages 23, 27-28), there is an awareness problem and a need for more education and training of medical professionals, including paediatricians. In answer to my question, &#8220;presumably we need more paediatric expertise than we have at present?&#8221; (Transcript page 29), she said &#8220;Yes, definitely&#8221;. She told me (Transcript pages 28-29) that there are at present only 12 specialist FGM clinics throughout the country, of which six are in London, and that her clinic at University College Hospital is the only specialist paediatric FGM clinic in the country.</p>

Wherever feasible, referrals should be made as early as possible to one of the specialist FGM clinics referred to by Professor Creighton. If that is not possible, consideration should be given to arranging for a suitably qualified safeguarding consultant paediatrician to carry out an examination recorded with the use of a colposcope so that the images can be reviewed subsequently by an appropriate expert.</p>
