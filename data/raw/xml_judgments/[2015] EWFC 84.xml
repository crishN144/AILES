	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In 2010 the parties entered into an arrangement, the precise detail of which is in dispute, for JK to donate sperm to enable HS and KS to have a child. The dispute centres on what role, if any, JK should have in X&#8217;s life. Put simply, JK seeks an order that will enable him to have regular fortnightly contact, initially for a day, building up to alternate weekends, staying contact in the school holidays and other special occasions (for example being present at his marriage to his partner). He considers X needs a male role model, which he considers he should provide and should have the opportunity to get to know his family. HS and KS say they fully recognize JK&#8217;s position as regards X&#8217;s identity, but they do not support continuing direct contact. They submit it would be too stressful, caused by what they see as JK&#8217;s unreliability and his undermining of their relationship as parents for X by the enhanced role he seeks in X&#8217;s life.</p>

	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">As set out in my judgment in March it is quite clear these parties wholly underestimated the emotional consequences of the arrangement they embarked upon. For their differing reasons, they have each struggled to come to terms with the position they are now in. JK said he understood his role was going to be a full quasi-parental role, with regular direct contact. He bases this belief on the terms of a written agreement entered into by the parties in 2010. HS and KS whilst in part acknowledging the parties previously had a better relationship, say the position has now fundamentally changed caused in large part by JK&#8217;s behaviour towards them.</p>

	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In her report Ms Adams recommends indirect contact. She concludes that to impose direct contact between JK and X on HS and KS in the context of JK&#8217;s expectations as to his future role in X&#8217;s life, risks the stability of X&#8217;s otherwise secure and stable placement. In her view any benefits there may be from any direct contact between JK and X are significantly outweighed by the risks to X&#8217;s welfare, and the benefits can be met by indirect contact.      </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">For the reasons set out below, I have reached the conclusion that I should refuse JK&#8217;s application for direct contact with X; there should be indirect contact between JK and X. Whilst there is some force in what JK says regarding the expectations he had about his role in X&#8217;s life, bearing in mind the agreement they signed in 2010, X&#8217;s welfare has to be looked at in the context of what her needs are now, not what the parties might have intended prior to her birth. Her legal, psychological and social parents are HS and KS. They both have parental responsibility and meet all her day to day needs. They recognize JK&#8217;s position in X&#8217;s life but feel threatened due to his attitude if has more than indirect contact. In my judgment JK has displayed a lack of insight into the reality of the impact of his application and his behavior on HS and KS, with the consequent impact on X. He can only look at it through the prism of the written agreement between the adults 5 years ago; there has been no sign of any real understanding or insight being shown by him of the emotional costs of this application on HS and KS. When asked about this in his evidence, his response was to say how hard it has been for him too.</p>

The parties had met three&#160;years previously through a website.  HS and KS state that they were looking for a known donor.  JK disputes this and says they were looking for a co-parent.  There is an issue on the papers as to precisely what was on HS and KS&#8217; profile on the website.  There are two pages of that profile in the papers:  one that was printed, on the face of it, in December 2014 by the HS and KS, which indicates their status as looking for a known donor; whereas JK has produced what he says is a picture of the position as at January 2015, which indicates that in fact they were looking for a co-parent; which was what JK says he was looking for when he signed up to this website. It is not possible to make a determination on this issue, other than to observe that the uncertainty about it perhaps foreshadows the difficulties that were going to develop.</p>

A copy is in the papers.  It is, on the face of it, a standard form document, which HS and KS had downloaded from the internet in circumstances, they say, to deal with JK&#8217;s concerns in relation to any financial responsibility that he may have regarding any future child, in particular with the Child Support Agency.  That is disputed by JK.  He says it was done and prepared in order to set out in written form the arrangements that had been reached between the parties, in particular his role as a co-parent.  In fact, within the document, at paragraph&#160;11, it deals with the question in relation to financial responsibility for JK, and indicates that he would have no financial responsibility towards X.  As to  the future arrangements for any contact that JK would have with any child that resulted from the arrangement, paragraph 30 sets out extensive contact and  involvement between JK and the child, looking at alternate weekend contact, holiday contact and also that his name would appear on the birth certificate.</p>

HS and KS say that there was no adjustment or changes in relation to the typed terms; the only parts that were added in by them, apart from their names, were details in relation to location and signing, all of which appear in manuscript form on the agreement.

There is a dispute between the parties as to who ended their relationship, and what the precise circumstances were. There was then a gap of about eighteen months to two years before they met again, by chance, at a social event, in early 2013.  This meeting led to further discussions and an agreement by them to try again to conceive a child.  This led, in turn, to X being conceived.</p>

There are a number of disputes around the circumstances in which the contact took place.  There was dispute as to JK&#8217;s reliability, as to whether he was late on occasions and on one occasion did not attend at all. There is some evidence to suggest that some contact went well.  There was an occasion when they went out for a meal with JK&#8217;s wider family, and also when X was taken in to the office where JK and HS had worked; the response and texts about that from HS indicated that it had gone very well and she was describing him as a happy father figure.</p>

These comments suggest to Ms Adams <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;a pernicious attitude towards KS that would undermine the quality of X&#8217;s relationship with her parents if it were a feature of her childhood&#8217;.</span> She observed there was little positive about HS and KS&#8217;s parenting in JK&#8217;s statements. In her discussions with JK she did not consider he had considered the effect on X of the conflict between the adults, his rather simplistic solution was they would put it behind them. </p>

She considered JK considered his role to be more of a parents raising X. She considered his application is in large part being driven by his feelings of upset with HS and KS rather than being able to stand back and look at the position from X&#8217;s perspective. For example, he queried HS situational anxiety rather than reflecting on how it might impact on X. This she considered demonstrated his lack of insight. The documents generated in the case seem more focused on the adults than supporting HS and KS caring for X.</p>

She considered the research had moved on to demonstrate that children learn well from their wider environment. Many of the research extracts relied upon by JK are in a different social context. She felt JK was relying on selected research, rather than give a reasoned emotional response particular to this case. Her opinion was when looked as a whole the consensus of the research was that the outcomes for children were no different whether they were brought up by same sex or heterosexual parents. She said what is an important indicator is the quality of the relationships within the family. Whilst she acknowledged it was important for X to have knowledge of her biological father it was not something that she considered should be foisted on X at this stage, when it risked de-stabilising her home. She was clear that from her knowledge of the professional help being considered by JK to help the adult relationships it was either unsuitable (SPIP) or was not realistically available (Tavistock). She considered JK&#8217;s over simplistic reliance on professional help displayed a lack of insight as to why the relationships broke down. In her view that lack of insight would provide a big barrier to the effectiveness of any therapeutic work. She did not consider reduced direct contact would meet X&#8217;s interests, as it would inevitably result in stress and tensions and there is a real risk JK would ask for more.</p>

They support Ms Adams conclusions that the current research demonstrates that there are no different outcomes for children whether they live in a same sex family or not. They set out their concerns about JK approaching his application as a separated parent, the real extent he wishes to be involved in X&#8217;s life and the strain it would put on their household. They submit the way JK has behaved in the proceedings in producing documents late and the material he placed on Facebook are indicators of the way he will behave in the future, which makes it difficult to have confidence in what he says. They fear his application is being driven by his own needs and his own feeling of injustice, rather than a welfare decision for X. They consider any direct contact he is given will be used by him to push for more.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">On behalf of X Mr Anderson submitted that there is evidence in the past that the relationship between the adults was much better. The text exchanges at the time confirm that. However, those relationships significantly changed in the period up to September 2014 and since. The impact of that on HS in particular was profound and continues. JK&#8217;s indication to the court in March that he would not make unrealistic expectations for contact has either been ignored in his recent proposals, or he lacks insight into the realities of the situation. JK has displayed little understanding of the role he can play in X&#8217;s life; what he seeks would be imposed on X&#8217;s parents by an order sought by the person who they perceive as having caused the difficulties. The role he seeks would be undermining to X&#8217;s parents. Any benefits there could be by direct contact between X and JK are outweighed by the risks and can be managed by the indirect contact recommended by Ms Adams.</p>

I agree with Mr Anderson, there was a stage when the relationship between the parties could be described as good, but the evidence demonstrates it started to deteriorate before X&#8217;s birth and began its rapid decline soon afterwards. The result is JK has not seen X for 14 months. She has no existing psychological relationship with him.</p>

What he says in his recent skeleton argument is consistent with his view with was what was agreed should be his role in 2010, and it is a recurring theme in all his written statements. I am clear that is his view as to the role he should play in X&#8217;s life. That conclusion is supported by the proposals he put forward in September for extensive contact with X, consistent with that of a separated parent which in my judgment is what he considers his position to be. There was no indication in his contact proposals in September that he had taken on board any of the matters set out in the detailed report from Ms Adams, filed two months earlier. There is no real insight shown by him that welfare considerations for a child are not fixed in stone, they are dynamic and change over time.</p>

They fear he will undermine their position as parents for X; they vividly described this to Ms Adams and in their oral evidence. The impact of these proceedings and JK&#8217;s requests is they consider they have lost control as parents in making decisions about X and their family life. This they described as the most difficult aspect of these proceedings and the consequent impact on their relationship. They have both required considerable emotional support to manage the feelings about this fear and JK&#8217;s application. When HS gave oral evidence her level of distress was tangible, even making due allowance for the inherent stress in this type of application. She has recently been diagnosed with situational anxiety and her descriptions of the steps she was taking to avoid meeting JK in the area were illustrative of the daily effect of the strain she feels under.</p>

Indirect contact once a year meets her current welfare needs to have information about her biological father.

The written communication to JK will not include photographs of X until 2019 to allow for three exchanges of written communication to take place, for there hopefully to be a re-building of trust and it will be a condition of any order that none of the material sent to JK (photographs or otherwise) is to be posted by JK on social media of any kind.</p>
