The underlying issue is as to which party has to bear certain French tax (&#8220;the French tax charge&#8221;) charged on a valuable property which I will call Villa Rose in the South of France.  The amount of the French tax charge was about &#8364;9.2 million in June of 2014 and it will have increased since.  One of the key questions, for reasons which will appear, is as to whether the word &#8220;borrowing(s)&#8221; in the consent order means borrowings in the strict sense of &#8216;monies lent&#8217; or whether it should be so construed as to mean &#8216;liabilities&#8217; ie however arising.  </span></p>

As to the first of these pieces of information, the structure holding Villa Rose is moderately but not very complicated.  The property is owned by a French Societ&#233; Anonyme which I will call &#8216;Societ&#233; Anonyme D&#8217;, which is in turn owned by three UK companies.

The investments were held in trust in such a way that our identities would not need to be revealed until the assets were due to be realised&#8230;  Around this time [January 2006] X and I decided that as a result of my increasing political exposure, it would be in both our interests if I was seen to distance myself temporarily from our joint venture assets until the political reaction in [country named] to my recent statements quietened down.  Consequently X and I agreed in February 2006 that a story would be leaked to the effect that I was transferring my business empire to him.  This was intended to protect my assets.  Behind the scenes my interest in certain joint venture assets was transferred to trusts, companies or other legal entities associated with or controlled by his nominees with the intention that they would hold my share of those joint venture assets&#8230; until I called for their return&#8221;.</span></p>

In 2006 through the ownership structure, the husband had purchased Villa Rose off a Mr. B.  At that time Mr. B was in litigation with Orchard Finance over a sum of money, &#8364;9 million odd, said to be owing by Mr. B to Orchard Finance.  As a consequence, Orchard Finance had charged Villa Rose as security for its claim if it should be successful.  On the sale by Mr. B to the husband, therefore, an escrow account was set up into which &#8364;13 million of the purchase price was placed.  The terms of the escrow were that if Mr. B successfully resisted the Orchard Finance claim against him, then the escrow money would be released to him (Mr. B) whereby he would receive the totality of the purchase price from the husband or from one of the entities in the ownership structure.  If, on the other hand, Mr. B lost the litigation with Orchard Finance, then the escrow monies would go to Orchard Finance and Mr. B would not get that portion of the sale price which would otherwise have come to him from the husband.  </span></p>

French law is that, when a property is owned by a non-human entity, there is a tax on the value of the property charged annually, unless a declaration of its true beneficial ownership is made to the French tax authorities.  Each year, therefore, a 3% levy is made on the value of the property and the accumulating sums can be charged on that property, as occurred in this case.  </span></p>

This has brought to prominence the issue mentioned above as to where lies the responsibility under the consent order for the French tax charge?  Was it agreed that it would be paid by the wife, or by the husband, i.e. now his estate?  To resolve that question it is necessary to consider the consent order.  </span></p>

A simple example is that, although the net proceeds of sale are defined in the Recital set out at paragraph 15 above, that definition is not used at all later in the order; instead paragraph 2(c) re-states the deductions from the gross proceeds, using slightly different terms.  It is self-evident that, were the order not seemingly ambiguous as regards the French tax, then this application would not be taking place.  It will also be appreciated that, most significantly, the structure of the order is such as to leave the wife having to pick up any otherwise unprovided-for liabilities needing to be satisfied in order to realise Villa Rose.  That is the effect of the husband&#8217;s share being expressed as a fixed sum of money to come off the proceeds of sale in advance of the wife taking the bottom-line remaining balance.  On the face of it any sum taken off the gross proceeds as being necessary to be paid to realise the property must effectively reduce the wife&#8217;s share.  That is how the parties structured the order.  Whether it is what the parties intended and agreed and whether it is what the consent order means is effectively what this hearing is all about.  </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Mr. Marks relies on the relevance and importance of the overall context of this order.  Its purpose was to move wealth from the husband to the wife.  It was framed on the basis, he submits, that the husband could and would do all that was required to sell Villa Rose, as per his confirmation that he could do so in his undertaking A (i) and as per the concluding words of his undertaking D (ii) &#8216;&#8230;in order to give effect to this order&#8217;.  It was, he says, framed on a fiction that the ownership structure did not exist, because it was known that the husband was representing that he could procure the outcome which he wished in respect of it.  This not infrequently happens in &#8216;big money&#8217; cases, where although everything is nominally within trusts, a husband, if it be the husband, will agree to the case proceeding on the basis that he can in fact organise the finances as he wishes.  (I am not talking about the process of enforcement against specific assets, which is a quite different issue).  </span></p>

As to that, he points to the husband&#8217;s undertaking at D (ii), namely, &#8220;&#8230; To facilitate any necessary&#8230; redemptions of secured&#8230; charges in order to give effect to this order&#8221;.  </span></p>

He submits that the word &#8220;borrowing&#8221; in that proviso is an ill-chosen and inaccurate word and must have been meant to mean &#8220;liabilities&#8221;.

	      <content>
		<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Mr. Atherton emphasises that these were experienced family finance lawyers at work in putting the order together.  One would have expected, he said, to see these liabilities specifically covered in the order.  If they are not covered, or are not specifically covered, then it must have been intended for them to come out of the wife&#8217;s bottom-line share.  Similarly, he stresses that the only fixed sum in the order is the husband&#8217;s &#163;16 million.  Therefore the outcome under the order as properly interpreted should not be such as to invade that specified sum; otherwise the draftsman would have said so in terms.  He points to para.3 of the order and argues that that paragraph (about the wife taking a share in the husband&#8217;s recoveries from the actions) demonstrates that she was willing to take a risk as part of the financial settlement.  He submits that that is what she was doing under para.2 by virtue of the structure of the order, whereby she was the person taking the risk, he says, as to the size of the French tax bill.  </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Mr Atherton goes on to argue that if the husband had had a personal obligation to pay the French tax, then the order would have said so, but it does not.  Instead it says only that the husband will &#8220;facilitate&#8221; the redemption of the secured charges.  Nowhere does the order say that he must pay them.  Why is that, asks Mr. Atherton, rhetorically?  The answer, he says, is that the French tax was a liability of Societ&#233; Anonyme D and not of the husband personally.  Further, on his, Mr Atherton&#8217;s case, it was to be paid under the order by the wife.  The husband&#8217;s only obligation was to &#8216;try to sort things out&#8217; in accordance with the word &#8220;facilitate&#8221;.  </span></p>

He says it is &#8216;incidental to&#8217; the conveyancing because under the French practice of buying and selling property it is something which the Notary would ensure was paid to the French tax authorities as part of effecting the sale.  He argues that &#8220;&#8230;it is not a leap of faith&#8221; for the court to hold that 2(c)(ii) and 2(c)(iii) are wide enough read together to show that the parties were agreeing that the French tax would be dealt with as a deduction from the gross proceeds of sale and so would be at the wife&#8217;s expense, by virtue of the structure of the order.  </span></p>

It would not mean that the French tax would come out of the husband&#8217;s &#163;16 million, because (a) there is no provision for that and (b) in any event it would or might be giving the wife a preference over other creditors.  </span></p>

Those which weigh with me most strongly are as follows.  The definition of &#8220;net proceeds of sale&#8221;, although seemingly pointless (not being used elsewhere in the consent order) does not contain any reference to the three charges.  It is more likely that their absence was as a result of the fact that the husband was going to deal with the charges under his undertaking D (ii) (which by its language covers those charges precisely) than that the wife would have to pick them up by default.  In effect, what Mr Atherton is doing is asking the court to read into the definition of the &#8220;net proceeds of sale&#8221; the deduction of the three charges.  Either that or Mr. Atherton has to succeed in some other way e.g. on his arguments about the charges being embraced by paragraphs 2(c)(ii) and (iii) of the order.  </span></p>

I accept that the words &#8220;borrowing&#8221; in the schedule, if literally interpreted, would or might be seen as detracting from there being an obligation under D (ii) to pay the two charges which were not borrowings (Ms. F and the French tax) but I will revert to that word &#8220;borrowing&#8221; or &#8220;borrowings&#8221; later.</span></p>

Paragraph 2(c)(ii) is to meet &#8216;conveyancing legal costs and any tax incidental to that conveyancing&#8217;.  It may be and indeed it is that on any such a sale the Notary has to and will pass the money through to the French tax authorities, but this is not tax &#8216;incidental&#8217; to that conveyancing transaction.  Rather it is historical tax which goes back over many years as a result of the non-disclosure of the beneficial owner of the villa.  Similarly, as regards &#8216;tax attributable to the sale&#8217; (paragraph 2(c)(iii)) that would of course embrace for example French CGT; but it cannot in my view be said that the tax concerned here (the tax on non-disclosed beneficial ownership) is &#8216;attributable to&#8217; the sale, even though the sale would trigger the ability of the French Government to recover it.  </span></p>

In my judgment, it must have been intended simply to mean &#8220;discharge&#8221; or &#8220;pay&#8221;.  Mr. Atherton ingeniously suggested that the husband might have run up further borrowings so that he (the husband) might only have been able to &#8220;reduce&#8221; the amount of the borrowings out of the monies available to him, not discharge them.

Under para.9 above, this order did not become a full and final settlement (such that the wife&#8217;s claims for financial provision et cetera became finally dismissed) until paras.2, 3 and 4 of the order had been complied with.  None of them have yet been complied with.  If the wife had brought the matter back during the husband&#8217;s lifetime to say that he was not complying with undertaking D (ii) then she would or would probably have been awarded a lump sum out of his &#163;16 million so that she could use it to pay the quantified French tax herself.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Coming back to the troublesome word &#8220;borrowing&#8221; in the proviso to paragraph 2(c)(iv) it is difficult to see any logical reason, in the context of settling a family law money case, for lawyers to differentiate as between borrowings and other monies charged on the property.  The point was that all of the three charges had to be paid off so as (per the husband&#8217;s undertaking D (ii)) &#8220;&#8230;to give effect to this order&#8221;.  The precise juridical nature of the charge or liability would not have mattered to the parties when negotiating the settlement.  If strict borrowings alone were to be covered by the word &#8220;borrowings&#8221;, then it would only in fact be referring to the Orchard loan because the other two charges (Miss F&#8217;s and the French Tax Charge) were not related to monies lent; yet the parties were not at risk in respect of Orchard anyway, because they were protected by the escrow arrangement.  So the proviso to paragraph 2(c)(iv) would have been rather otiose.  Hence I cannot accept Mr. Atherton&#8217;s argument that the proviso was worded as it was so as to protect the wife from the Orchard loan or from any further borrowings by the husband.  I have explained above why there was no realistic likelihood of such further borrowings.  It seems to me to be most likely that this use of the word &#8220;borrowings&#8221; falls into the exceptional category where the drafting was, to adopt Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s words in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Chartbrook</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, &#8220;&#8230; careless and no one noticed&#8221;.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In view of the clear terms of undertaking D (ii), whereby I conclude that the husband was agreeing to facilitate the redemption of the charges in order to give effect to the order, I do not strictly need to go on as to construe the word &#8220;borrowing&#8221; within the proviso to paragraph 2(c)(iv) because in my judgment D (ii) covers the situation.  I accept that (D(ii)) uses the word &#8220;facilitate&#8221;, but words such as &#8220;procure&#8221;, &#8220;arrange&#8221; or &#8220;facilitate&#8221; are frequently used in consent orders precisely because of the existence of nominal structures which distance the individual from the asset.  If however, I did have to construe the word &#8220;borrowing&#8221; (whilst accepting that one has to tread cautiously when construing a word other than in its natural meaning) I would read &#8220;borrowing&#8221; as intended to mean and meaning &#8220;liabilities&#8221;, the word &#8220;borrowing&#8221; having been used through sloppy draughtsmanship.  If &#8220;borrowings&#8221; be so construed, then the proviso 2(c)(iv) makes perfect sense when read together with Undertaking D (ii).  Correcting also the second use of the word &#8220;reduce&#8221; as per paragraph 27 above, it would read: &#8220;&#8230;&#163;16million to the Respondent (unless he has failed to remove any secured liabilities, in which case the &#163;16million shall be reduced by such sums are necessary to discharge any such secure liabilities)&#8221;.</span></p>

The parties were free to make their own agreement and have it converted into a court order in whatever terms they wished and however they wanted to arrange their finances.  I am satisfied that the agreement and the intention behind this consent order was that it was not for the wife but for the husband to deal with the French tax, as he indicated he would be able to do by way of his expression of willingness to facilitate that it should happen.  Therefore, I hold that the French tax should not come out of the wife&#8217;s share of the proceeds provided for at paragraph 2(c)(v) of the order.</span></p>
