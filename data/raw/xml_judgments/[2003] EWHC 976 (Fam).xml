	    <p class="p22" style="margin-left:0.75in">This apparently simple case raises issues about the rights and duties of children&#8217;s guardians in care proceedings under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>), with particular reference to the guardian&#8217;s right to examine and take copies of local authority documentation under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref>. It also raises the question of the duty of local authorities to impart information relating to the child in question to the child&#8217;s parents, the guardian and the court. It is, I think, both surprising and disappointing that more than 11 years after the implementation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> such issues require a judicial decision.</p>

Ironically, had Mr. M attended, and had it been possible to arrange a DNA test in time for the hearing fixed for 20 June 2003, it is likely that both the local authority and the guardian would have withdrawn their opposition to the appeal, consequent upon the guidelines laid down by Holman J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re B (Care Proceedings: Notification of Father without parental responsibility) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 FLR 408" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 FLR 408</ref>.</p>

The sequence begins in the early hours of the morning of 16 October 2002, when the police visited the home of S&#8217;s foster parents and arrested the foster father in connection with their enquiries into what has become known as operation ORE, a national (indeed international) investigation into child pornography.</p>

The meeting was chaired by Ms JH, a senior manager, and child protection co-ordinator of children&#8217;s services for the local authority. Also present, amongst others, were police representatives and a number of social workers, including S&#8217;s social worker Ms. C. The meeting was told that children&#8217;s services had been contacted when Mr and Mrs. B had been identified by the police as local authority foster parents, and that as a result of that contact the two children being fostered by Mr. and Mrs. B, one of whom was S, had been removed. Mr. and Mrs. B had been foster carers for the local authority for 33 years, and there had been no complaint of any kind about them. They had, however, been suspended as foster parents as a result of Mr. B&#8217;s arrest. </p>

As I have already stated, on 16 October S was accommodated by the local authority with his mother&#8217;s agreement. As the sole person with parental responsibility for S, her agreement was required for both the change of placement and the medical examination. However, although it is not recorded in the minutes of the strategy meeting held on 16 October 2002, it appears that in order to obtain Ms J&#8217;s agreement, the decision was taken (1) to conceal the true reason for the change in S&#8217;s foster placement from his mother; and (2) to mislead her about the nature of the medical examination. </p>

What happened was that the social worker in the case, Ms C, was instructed by her seniors, Ms JH (who had chaired the strategy meeting) and Mrs MJ (who had been present at it) to telephone S&#8217;s mother, but to allow the telephone to ring only twice before putting down the receiver. This would enable Ms C to give evidence to the justices on the following day, at the hearing of the application for the interim care order, that she had attempted unsuccessfully to obtain the mother&#8217;s agreement to a change of placement and the medical examination. </p>

The guardian then joins the solicitor as and when he or she is, allocated.</p>

That, however, was quite different from denying the guardian access to the documents in the first place.

PII, he submitted, simply did not apply in this case, and such confidentiality which did exist did not override the statutory rights of the guardian under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> to access information from the local authority files. </p>

To the contrary, the public interest was served by making that information available to the court. Furthermore, making the information available did not amount to disclosure, since any such documents remained confidential to the proceedings as laid down by the FPR. The same point met the objection that disclosure was a breach of the foster parents&#8217; right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was in any event qualified.</p>

That letter is dated 22 January 2003, and raises three specific points: (1) the fact that vital information had been withheld from the justices on 17 October 2002; (2) the instruction from JH and MJ to Ms C about putting the telephone down before S&#8217;s mother could answer; and (3) what they describe in terms as the &#8220;lie&#8221; to Ms J about the nature of the medical S was to undergo. </p>

On 18 February the guardian orally requested a sight of the letter from the justices&#8217; clerk to Mr. P, which the local authority refused. The guardian then widened the scope of his request to the court for disclosure to include the letter, and documents created by the local authority following receipt of the letter. He also, for the first time, specifically sought an order for his costs. </p>

The balance of the application was put over to 5<span style="font-style:italic"/>March 2003. However, on that day, they acceded to an application by the local authority for the matter to be transferred to the county court. In their clear and succinct reasons, they state (1) that it was clear the documents sought by the guardian blended disciplinary and welfare matters; (2) that the court had made a formal complaint to the local authority about its conduct; and (3) the matter had become so complex that the guidelines and case law advised that the proceedings should be dealt with by a higher court. Thus it was that the case in due course came before me on 16 April 2003, following the hearing of Mr. M&#8217;s appeal against the justices&#8217; refusal to join him as a party to the proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="p22" style="margin-left:0.75in">Above all, however, the local authority has a duty to be open and frank in the evidence it provides to the court. Of course the local authority has to prove a case: it must establish the threshold criteria. But its assessment must always be balanced; the positive as well as the negative aspects of parents and families must be stated. This is why the welfare principle in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> requires the proceedings to be non-adversarial. </p>

	    <p class="p22" style="margin-left:0.75in">With one exception, I would like to pay tribute to the way the justices dealt with this case. Although the point proved academic, I think it likely that, had Mr. M prosecuted his appeal against the refusal to join him as a party, I would have allowed it for the reasons given in paragraph 8. I was, however, particularly impressed with the reasons which the bench gave for the making of an interim order on 17 October 2002, which are a model of their kind. The quality of those reasons heavily underscores the mischief perpetrated by the local authority&#8217;s behaviour in misleading them. Had they been told the truth, the result may still have been the making of an interim care order, but I have no doubt at all that before making it the justices would have made a number of detailed enquiries about S and would have insisted on a properly detailed care plan. </p>

In my judgment, as he is publicly funded, the correct order is for the local authority to pay the guardian&#8217;s costs of and in relation to the application for disclosure in the sum assessed by the costs judge on the detailed public funding assessment of his costs. In this way the Legal Services Commission will recoup the costs of this application which it would otherwise paid to the guardian, his solicitors and counsel. </p>
