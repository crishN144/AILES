	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">23.&#160; Secondly, that the court can have regard to the inherent probabilities: see Lady Hale in&#160;<a href="https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I722491F0383E11DD8A4EA24CCB7DFE2B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;ppcid=f884c7403632429c908c2e52b4f11ddf&amp;contextData=(sc.Search)"><span class="Hyperlink" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:none;color:initial">In re B (Children) (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) (CAFCASS intervening) </span><span class="Hyperlink" style="text-decoration-line:none;color:initial">[2008] UKHL 35, [2009] 1 AC 11</span></a>, para 31.

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">&#8220;There is only one rule of law, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">24.&#160; Thirdly, that the fact, if fact it be, that the respondent &#8230; fails to prove on a balance of probabilities an affirmative case that she has chosen to set up by way of defence, does&#160;<span class="coitalic" style="font-style:italic">not</span>&#160;of itself establish the local authority&#8217;s case. As His Honour Judge Clifford Bellamy recently said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re FM (A Child: fractures: bone density)</span> [2015] EWFC B26, para 122, and I respectfully agree:</p>

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in">&#8220;It is the local authority that seeks a finding that FM&#8217;s injuries are non-accidental. It is for the local authority to prove its case.&#160;It is not for the mother to disprove it. In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court&#8217;s task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not &#8216;has that possible alternative explanation been proved&#8217; but rather it should ask itself, &#8216;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">I agree with the judgment of Ward LJ. Family judges deal with increasingly difficult child cases and are much assisted in their decision-making process by professionals from other disciplines: medical, wider mental health and social work among others. The courts pay particular attention to the valuable contribution from paediatricians and child psychiatrists as well as others, but it is important to remember that the decision is that of the judge and not of the professional expert. Judges are well accustomed to assessing the conflicting evidence of experts. As Ward LJ said, judges are not expected to suspend judicial belief simply because the evidence is given by an expert. An expert is not in any special position and there is no presumption or belief in a doctor however distinguished he or she may be. It is, however, necessary for a judge to give reasons for disagreeing with experts' conclusions or recommendations. That, this judge did. A judge cannot substitute his views for the views of the experts without some evidence to support what it is he concludes.</span></p>

	      <p class="Indented" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.11in">No judge would consider it proper to reach a conclusion about a witness&#8217;s credibility based solely on the way that he or she gives evidence, at least in any normal circumstances. The ordinary process of reasoning will draw the judge to consider a number of other matters, such as the consistency of the account with known facts, with previous accounts given by the witness, with other evidence, and with the overall probabilities.  However, in a case where the facts are not likely to be primarily found in contemporaneous documents the assessment of credibility can quite properly include the impression made upon the court by the witness, with due allowance being made for the pressures that may arise from the process of giving evidence.  Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only &#8216;what happened in the past?&#8217; but also &#8216;what may happen in the future?&#8217;, a witness&#8217;s demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable. </p>

At this stage, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together and comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. Within this context, the right question is not &#8216;who is the more likely?&#8217; but rather &#8216;does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?&#8217; In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, the Court of Appeal highlighted a clear danger in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this can lead to an identification on evidence that falls short of a probability;</p>

In determining whether a person is properly included in the pool of potential perpetrators, it is essential that the court weighs any lies told by that person against any evidence that points away from them having been responsible for the injuries (<span style="font-style:italic">H v City and Council of Swansea and Others</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 195). In these &#8216;uncertain perpetrator&#8217; cases, the correct approach is for the case to proceed at the welfare stage on the basis that each of the possible perpetrators is treated as such (<span style="font-style:italic">Re O and N: Re B</span> [2003] 1 FLR 1169, HL). The House of Lords held in that case that it would be grotesque if, because neither parent had been proved to be the perpetrator, the court had to proceed at the welfare stage as though the child were not at risk from either parent, even though one or other of them was the perpetrator of significant harm. The judge conducting the welfare hearing should have regard to the facts found at the preliminary hearing when they leave open the possibility that a parent or carer was a perpetrator of proved harm and that conclusion should not be excluded from consideration.</p>

The Mother said she thought she had told the police the Father &#8220;had said he may have fallen asleep whilst holding CA&#8221; but thought she had told them &#8220;he woke up instantly while still holding CA&#8221; although she later went on to say the Father &#8220;said he wasn&#8217;t asleep&#8221; and she had a clear recollection of that. The Father denied there was a time when he fell asleep holding CA but conceded there could have been a time when he momentarily closed his eyes and although his evidence was somewhat muddled I think he conceded that at some point he could have closed his eyes and his head could have dropped and then instantly jerked up again and he could not remember when that has occurred or whether it occurred on the night of 24-25 April but was clear that he did not come-to gripping CA. I cannot come to any clear conclusion on this evidence but note if the Father had fallen asleep briefly it does not appear to explain the marks given he is adamant CA was not dropped and the Mother is adamant she was not told that.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">By way of summary of what is set out above the expert medical evidence that these marks were bruises is dependent on the accuracy of the treating clinicians&#8217; reports of the same. There is no evidence they had considered cutis marmorata. Since the blanching test may be insufficient to exclude cutis marmorata (because it may not appear to blanch) there is a risk of misdiagnosis by the clinicians. The absence of marks a few days post-birth is less consistent with cutis marmorata but does not exclude it. The resolution of the marks is more consistent with cutis marmorata than bruising. The shape of the marks is unusual for bruising. Taken on its own this evidence would be insufficient to satisfy the test the Local Authority have to meet i.e. I could not be satisfied these were bruises on the balance of probabilities.</p>

The pain relates to the force of impact, and occasionally in repeated trauma, to fear related to the event. The common reaction of a child under 3y to a blow or sustained pressure leading to bruising would be to cry at the time of each impact.</p>
