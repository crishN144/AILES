It can therefore be seen that we have spent half a day of valuable High Court time debating what the scale of support for the wife and the two children should be for two months.  It is a matter of some considerable surprise to me that relations are so antagonistic between the parties, and possibly their representatives also, that cover for that finite period has not been agreed on a no admissions without prejudice basis, but the court is here to adjudicate these disputes and to provide access to justice, even if the court might think that consumption of the resources of the court for such a&#160;temporarily trifling dispute is disproportionate.</span></p>

In the 1990s, his involvement in politics in his home country led to self imposed exile. .

In the traditional way, they were able to spend some of the time of the hot summer months here but they lived predominantly in the husband&#8217;s home country , visiting also Egypt, from where the wife hails.  It seems to me obvious that their respective domiciles are (in the case of the husband)  his home country , and in the case of the wife a domicile of origin in Egypt, possibly becoming a domicile of choice in  the husband&#8217;s home country  on the marriage.</span></p>

When Mr. Yates says the wife moved permanently here, that was permanent only up to a point, inasmuch as it is perfectly clear from Mr. Cusworth's chronology that, between July 2012 and August 2013, the wife was shuttling with the children between here and Cairo, arguably spending rather more time in Cairo than here, and indeed using &#163;1.8 million which had been provided to her by the husband in February 2012 to buy a villa in Cairo, which cost &#163;2.3&#160;million (EGP23&#160;million), she finding the shortfall by selling properties which she owned in Egypt.  That property was purchased in 2012 and is a&#160;substantial capital asset of the wife and must be borne in mind when I&#160;consider the claims which she makes.</span></p>

Indeed, inasmuch as, since August, she has put down deeper roots here and lived a very high lifestyle, Mr.&#160;Cusworth may yet to be seen as having a fair point in saying that this is nakedly tactical by her.</span></p>

Although the  court in the husband&#8217;s home country operates under a family law passed in, I think, 2006,  the husband&#8217;s home country  is nonetheless a conservative  state where pure principles of Sharia law apply and where it is perfectly possible and permissible to obtain a divorce, other than by proceedings, through pronouncement of triple talaq, without involvement of the court at all.  Moreover, according to the expert evidence of Mr. Edge, there are not even any sanctions for pronouncing bare talaq without the involvement of the court, in contrast to the position, surprising though it may seem, in Saudi Arabia, as was all explained in the decision </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">H v.

But, be that as it may, that is Parliament's will as expressed in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  So one can see that if the talaq  in this case is a valid talaq, entitled to be recognised here, then the wife has no right to make a claim for herself for financial relief, either under the Matrimonial Causes Act or under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> and will be confined only to a claim for child maintenance under schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.</span></p>

Indeed, Anthony Louca were writing to the husband's solicitors on 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2013 about various matters.  However, for reasons which are not known, on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;January 2013, at the hearing before District Judge Aitken of the preliminary issue, there was no attendance by the wife or her solicitors and, on that basis, the wife's petition was dismissed.  Given that there was before the court at that point the preliminary issue as to whether the parties had been already divorced by reason of a foreign divorce recognised in England and Wales, it must follow, it seems to me, that the court there adjudicated that the parties had been validly divorced in  the husband&#8217;s home country and that that divorce was entitled to recognition.  That was before the court, and the dismissal of the petition finally and conclusively dealt with that preliminary issue.  Therefore it seems to me that, although I have not heard the fullest argument on it today, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">res judicata</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> arose at that point.  It would have been open to the wife to have appealed that within 14 days but she did not.  After that, the husband relied, patently, on that order and went about his affairs on the basis that the court here had validly, conclusively and finally determined this issue.</span></p>
