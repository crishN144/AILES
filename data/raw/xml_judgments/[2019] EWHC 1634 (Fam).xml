The first application is by the Local Authority for a care order and the second, made on behalf of Z, is to revoke an adoption order made in favour of Mr. and Mrs. X.  The respondents to both applications are Mr. and Mrs. X, Mrs Y, Z's birth mother, and Z, through his Guardian, Mr. Collins.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.06in">The hearing started on 9 April, following the oral evidence of Dr. Anthony James, an adolescent psychiatrist, the parties agreed to consider their respective positions.  The thrust of Dr. James' evidence was that he emphasised the need for the adults to make decisions, taking into account Z's wishes.  He considered it important that through a care order the Local Authority would share parental responsibility and consult and discuss Z's care needs with Mrs.Y and Mr. and Mrs. X, but they would not make the ultimate decisions regarding Z&#8217;s care needs, that would rest with the Local Authority through the authority given to them by a care order.  This was, in fact, something that Z had been asking for.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.06in;text-indent:0in">Authority.  Both Mrs. Y and Mr. and Mrs. X agree with this.  This means the Local Authority will hold parental responsibility for you and they will be the ones making the overall decisions for you going forward that are in your best interest and when the Local Authority make decisions, they will discuss these decisions with you as well as with Mr. and Mrs. X and Mrs. Y.  Mrs. Y's involvement will be recorded on the care order so everybody who works with you going forward knows that she will be involved alongside the Local Authority and Mr. and Mrs. X.  Everyone agrees that contact will continue and gradually increase with Mrs. Y and Z's birth family working towards day-time contacts and overnight stays.  Mrs. Y does not think it will make any difference to your relationship going forward with her if the adoption is revoked or not at this time and she will continue being involved in your life.  Finally, Mr. and Mrs. X recognise that Mrs. Y is very important to you and likewise, Mrs. Y recognises that Mr. and Mrs. X remain significant people in your life." </p>

That is an application which I have no hesitation in accepting.

I am also satisfied that his welfare needs will be met by there being some continuity in relation to Ms. Reid's involvement, effectively to oversee the handover to a newly allocated social worker but also to have the benefit of the continuity during the transition period that there is likely to be following the conclusion of the assessment and also the planned move that there will inevitably need to be from his current placement. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.53in;margin-right:0.06in">The third matter is to play tribute to Mr. and Mrs. X and Mrs. Y for the way they have conducted themselves through what has undoubtedly been a difficult hearing.  When their respective relationships with Z and each other has been put under the spotlight, all three have demonstrated a strong joint interest to help and support Z in the future in what will, undoubtedly, be difficult times that he will have to negotiate in managing the arrangements for his future care, whatever they may be.  </p>

I have absolutely no doubt, particularly having met Z last Thursday, that it will have helped him enormously to be able to understand the decisions the adults have made during this hearing. To have it communicated to him personally the day after those decisions and to have them explained to him and, no doubt, in discussions with those that care for him in his placement, that that will give him a secure foundation to be able to understand the decisions that have been made at the conclusion of this case which have all been made with his welfare uppermost in everybody's minds. </p>
