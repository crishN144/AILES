The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition always that (a) the names and (b) the current address or present whereabouts of the Applicant and the children must not be published.  For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current address or present whereabouts of the Applicant and the children will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, it is important to note that, however extreme or exceptional the facts of a particular case, a prohibited steps order is a statutory restriction on the exercise by a parent of their parental responsibility.  Any such order made by the court must accordingly be based on objective evidence.  There is a high responsibility on the court not to impose such a restriction without good cause and reasons for imposing a restriction must be given (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Due Process) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 FLR 1239" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 FLR 1239</ref>).  Specific consideration must be given to the duration of the prohibition (see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Casey) v Restormel Borough Council </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2007/2554" uk:canonical="[2007] EWHC 2554 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWHC 2554 (Admin)</ref> at [38]).  </p>

All three children have suffered the trauma of experiencing their father seeking, in a particularly violent manner, to burn down their family home with them inside it and being made homeless as a result.  All three children have lived in a home environment in which it became apparent that the father was continuing his efforts to do harm to the family even as he served a sentence of imprisonment.  Each of the children will inevitably have experienced the impact on their mother, their primary carer, of these very traumatic events.</p>

Once again, he expressed contempt for the potential consequences to the children of homelessness and physical injury and demonstrated that the children&#8217;s welfare came a very poor second to his goal of harming the mother. </p>
