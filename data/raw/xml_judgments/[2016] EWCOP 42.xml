He had a large circle of friends, as the papers disclose, lived on his own and had a cat of whom he was exceptionally fond.  Very sadly, he suffered from vascular dementia.  He did not have the capacity to make decisions about his residence and care.  Final orders were made concerning his capacity by Judge Hilder in April 2015.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The backdrop to this application is a long-running case in the Court of Protection concerning MM.  It started in 2014, after Mrs. Kirk removed him from his home to hers in Sussex.  The matter came to the High Court once it became apparent that MM had been removed from the jurisdiction and taken to Portugal.  That was in April 2015.  It appears that those actions followed a report from an independent social worker which recommended that it was in MM&#8217;s best interests to live in a care home in the South West, where he had previously lived, rather than in Sussex.</span></p>

He remains in Portugal.  Committal proceedings were commenced again MM on 10 July 2015, but they have not been determined and, as far as I know, remain outstanding and adjourned.  Further orders were made in 2015 that MM should return to the jurisdiction (e.g., Mostyn J on 18 September 2015 ordered that he should be brought back to this jurisdiction as soon as he was medically fit to travel).  None of those subsequent orders have been complied with either and it appears that he was placed in a care home by Mrs Kirk in Portugal from September 2015, after he had been shortly hospitalised the previous month.  </span></p>

Comprehensive evidence was produced in relation to his care in Portugal and, on 10 June 2016, the court again determined that it was in MM&#8217;s best interests to live in a residential care home in this country, in the South West.</span></p>

The order had a penal notice attached to it, the recitals are very clear.  Mrs. Kirk was present in court.  It was self-evident and overwhelmingly obvious that Baker J explained to her precisely the meaning and terms of the order.  It was not in any way complicated; there was no room for misunderstanding.  That order was subsequently served on her formally by email on 27 June 2016 at 9.33.</span></p>

A significant number of discussions have taken place (on at least three occasions, for example face to face with representatives from the Official Solicitor&#8217;s Office and a number of telephone discussions too) during which Mrs. Kirk made it abundantly and unequivocally clear that she had no intention of signing the authority, and would not do so because of her strongly held beliefs that the court was wrong, and she was right.</span></p>

I am satisfied and sure that the documents that were served upon her set out the breach fully.  I am satisfied that she has been properly represented throughout.  Indeed, the hearing before Mostyn J earlier this month was adjourned for that express purpose, there being some difficulty, I understand, about either legal aid or her representation.  </span></p>

I am entirely satisfied and sure - indeed, it is accepted in the face of the court - that Mrs. Kirk has not provided the written declaration of authority which was appended to the order, she has not signed it and apparently continues to take the view that she will not do so.  Even today she refuses to do so.  That is very, very regrettable.</span></p>

Mrs. Kirk is 71.  She is of previous good character.  She is a retired lady of limited means and her assets and savings have been depleted in the pursuit of protecting the interests of MM as she sees it and in this litigation.  I acknowledge that she has deeply held, sincere beliefs as to the best interests of MM and is genuinely concerned about his welfare.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The problem, inevitably, is when a court is asked to make a decision, there will be two - sometimes more - solutions.  Baker J has determined the issues, his determinations remain extant.  Inevitably therefore it follows, as it will in almost every court hearing, that at least one person in court is going to disagree sometimes, fundamentally and strongly, with the decision of the court.  That does not mean that they then can simply be permitted to proceed as though the order does not exist; it goes to the very root of our judicial system.</span></p>

She is, it is said, entitled to some credit, some discount for accepting in the face of the court the breach &#8211; her position remains unaltered, and it might be therefore by some to be more akin to open defiance, she says she has no intention of signing it.  If it is mitigation, I take it into account.</span></p>

However, I shall suspend the warrant for a period of seven days only to give Mrs Kirk one last chance to comply; I urge her to do so.  If she changes her mind and signs the authority within seven days, the warrant will not be executed and I shall suspend the sentence for a period of 12 months.  If she does not she will go to prison.  If Mrs Kirk subsequently complies with the order, the matter should be immediately restored on an application to purge her contempt.  What happens next is in Mrs Kirk&#8217;s hands.  </span></p>
