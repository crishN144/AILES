	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">It is of some concern to the court that this application is dated 2 April 2018. The delay in this hearing taking place has been due to a number of factors, including the availability of experts to provide reports, their response to additional questions and availability to give evidence. In addition, there have been delays in submitting orders to the court for approval (notably between January and July 2020). These factors need to be considered in the context where since July 2019 the applicant&#8217;s legal team and their expert have acted pro bono, as X was unable to continue to meet her legal fees. </p>

X trained to become a bus driver and through that work was able to purchase her own home. She re-trained as a nurse whilst continuing to work and graduated as a registered nurse in July 2001.

There are no children from their marriage, due X&#8217;s inability to conceive naturally for medical reasons. According to X they separated in 2006 in difficult circumstances, in 2007 X sold the property they had lived in and purchased her current home. In 2012 X&#8217;s father returned the dowry, which she said equated with a divorce in Nigeria and X divorced him in this jurisdiction in 2014. </p>

Although her relationship with her eldest daughter is now strong she described her sadness at not being able to have had any involvement in her early life and upbringing. After seeing an advert in a local paper for adoptive parents she explored with the local authority where she lives here the option of adopting, in particular a child she shared a cultural background with. X reports it was not encouraging, as she was informed the local authority preferred married couples, not single adopters. It was then X decided to explore adoption in Nigeria and decided to make contact with the orphanage, due to her own experience of having had a child out of wedlock.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Both Ms Omovbude and Mr Nsugbe gave oral evidence. Ms Omovbude denied the suggestion by Ms van Overdijk that her report had not answered the questions in her letter of instruction or that she had dealt with issues not covered in those instructions. She referred to what was set out in her book about residence, the cases she referred to, stating that residency remains a subject of discussion. She also denied the suggestion that she was conflating citizenship with residency. Ms Omuvbude accepted the hierarchy of law as described by Mr Nsugbe and stated that there was no reported Nigerian family law cases that addressed the issue of residency.  </p>

He was troubled by the fact that section 134 (1) b) and c) were not mentioned and the judge did not pronounce herself satisfied about those provisions, although he accepted that magistrates&#8217; records can be deficient and mistakes are made. </p>

In her submission the extended and varied caselaw that has considered the terms &#8216;residence&#8217; and &#8216;resident&#8217; are clear indicators that these terms are not plain and unambiguous, they reflect abstract concepts requiring, as Ms Cronin puts it, analysis and explanation. Ms Cronin relies on the case authorities referred to by Mr Nsugbe. She submits none of the definitions referred to in the cases require the high degree of connection, permanence and stability as advocated by Ms Nsugbe. </p>

As Ms Cronin sets out the Nigerian court had evidence to show X&#8217;s strong cultural and family ties to the State, the presence of a family home in which her daughters lived, her strong connections to that home, her regular planned visits, the financial and practical support she provided for the children and her mother. Her periods of time in the State were not by chance but family focussed and regular with the clear intention and purpose to enable her to spend time with her children. </p>

Second, Ms Omovbude&#8217;s analysis does not depend on speculation, it reflects the issue in contention, the facts and is grounded in the welfare issues raised by the case. Third, to submit the decision to a searching textual analysis fails to recognise that the magistrate was exercising a discretion, deciding facts and saw and heard the relevant parties as set out in the information from both X and Mrs Oguji. In the circumstances of this case it is not possible to say the magistrate considered any irrelevant matter, left out of account any relevant matters, erred in law, or applied any wrong principle. Fourthly, the order is subsisting, as Mrs Oguji states the slip rule would be applied, if necessary. </p>

She relies upon the underlying principle as set out by James LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Goodman Trusts </span>where he confirmed that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;the rule which the English law adopts and applies to a non-English child&#8230;is a question of international comity and international law&#8217;</span> that comity as practised determines the status of a person <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;by the law of the country of his origin &#8211; the law under which he was born&#8221;.</span> James LJ stated later that it is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;almost an axiom that the family relation, once duly constituted by the law of any civilised country, should be respected and acknowledged by every other member of the great community of nations&#8221;.</span> Ms Cronin submits this principle informs the recognition process and the approach taken by the SSHD of a fine grained analysis of the position pays insufficient regard to that principle. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.54in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Cronin also relies upon Article 8 in the event that the court finds that the adoption order is not made in accordance with the foreign law. She submits the facts clearly establish family life as between X and Z. As a consequence, Article 8 is engaged. The obligation to respect family life may also include a positive obligation to permit family life to develop. In <span style="font-style:italic">S v S</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">[2016] </span>EWHC 2470 (Fam) MacDonald J made an order for recognition for a Nepalese adoption which could not be recognised under the inherent jurisdiction criteria and the child could not be adopted here under the domestic law of adoption. Ms Cronin submits that the barriers to X pursuing an adoption in this jurisdiction are formidable and disproportionate, for the reasons outlined in her written submissions. For Z&#8217;s application under rule 310 of the Immigration Rules X would have to be assessed and approved as a suitable adopter, involving costs (about &#163;20,000) and delay (X&#8217;s solicitor estimates about 12 months). In addition, there is the possible separation of Z and C, as C already qualifies to be able to make the application as her adoption order is automatically recognised. Ms Cronin submits in the circumstances of this case where the family relationship is established and the children have no known birth family, for the court to decline recognition of Z&#8217;s adoption would amount to a disproportionate interference in X and Z&#8217;s exercise of their Article 8 rights. </p>

This 2021 Order is made pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/20/section/9/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9 (4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/20" uk:canonical="2006 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children and Adoption Act 2006</ref>. By article 2 the SSHD declared that special restrictions are to apply to Nigerian adoptions. Ms Cronin submits it will not be possible for X to complete her assessment before this restriction comes into force, so after the 12 March she would be required to apply for an exemption which the DfE has confirmed will be made on a case by case basis and will take about 2 months to process. </p>

In any event, refusal of recognition on Article 8 ground is justified where the reasons for the 2021 order concern a lack of confidence that adoptions from Nigeria meet the safeguarding standards this jurisdiction expects in regard to intercountry adoptions processes to ensure that adoptions are genuine and are the best outcome for the children. This rationale is set out in more detail in the explanatory memorandum for the 2021 Order. </p>

The object of this is to connect the person with a particular system or rule of law determining personal or family status or property rights. The cases on domicile set out that the court is concerned with the ties that bind a person to a chosen domicile and the strength and durability of those ties. It is clear to the court that X has not lost her Nigerian domicile, it is her permanent home and she has concrete plans to return there with her children on her retirement. X&#8217;s lasting attachment with Nigeria which evidences her domicile including her early years spent in Nigeria, the obvious strength of her continuing ties and relationships with her family, including her mother, sister and her children, her daily contacts with them and their base in the family home. This is supported by her regular trips to Nigeria, the high value she places on the traditional culture and dress and her choice of Nigerian personal law for her marriage and the traditional divorce through the return of the dowry. </p>

This hierarchy is accepted by Ms Omovbude and Mr Nsugbe, although Mr Nsugbe adopts a more narrow interpretation of residence than Ms Omovbude and is clear about the unacceptability of any reliance on custom. There is no reference to custom in the documents submitted by the Ministry or by X prior to the order being made. </p>

Her periods of time in Anambra State were not by chance, but regular, family focussed and with a clear purpose to spent time with her children. She was living in the UK but maintaining a home for her mother and the children in Anambra State. It was, in my judgment, open to the Nigerian court to conclude that the requirement in section 134 (1) (b) was met as it provided some degree of permanence, some degree of continuity or expectation of continuity. These are long standing connections. The role of this court in determining whether this requirement is met is to consider whether such a conclusion was open to the Nigerian court, which in my judgment it was. It is not for this court to say whether the Nigerian court should or should not have come to that conclusion.  </p>

They spoke to her relatives and neighbours, had references for her and assessed her standing and attachments there. It is of note that in C&#8217;s adoption the Ministry explicitly raised the need for a waiver of the 3 month care requirement, but did not raise waiver of the residence requirement. The court can infer that from this position in both adoptions the Ministry and the Court consider their interpretation of the term residence and its application to X&#8217;s circumstances was established and not questioned. This interpretation and X&#8217;s family practice meets the purpose of the residence requirement, namely it ensures the adopted child is not lost to the State, her home and ethnic culture. There is no suggestion that X had been other than transparent about her circumstances in this case. </p>
