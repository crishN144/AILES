To preserve their anonymity, I will refer to them as James, Joshua and Jordan. I will refer to their mother as &#8216;the Mother&#8217; and their father as &#8216;the Father&#8217;. For the purposes of this judgment, it is not necessary to give their ages save to say that James is in his early teenage years but Joshua and Jordan are younger. I have also changed the name of the country where the parents met and where, the Mother alleges that they married.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:Cambria">In November 2023, the Local Authority issued applications for care orders seeking interim care orders for all three boys. Its plan was for the continued removal of James from the care of the Father, James having entered foster care as a result of the police exercising their powers under section 46 Children Act 1989. The applications were granted. James stayed in foster care and Joshua and Jordan remained in the care of the Father. By the time of the next hearing just a week later, the Local Authority sought the removal of Joshua and Jordan from the care of the Father but this was not agreed by the Court.</span></p>

There is also a plan to consider, under looked after child reviews, when it might be appropriate for James to join his brothers in the Mother&#8217;s care; James not currently wanting to leave foster care in City A to move to the care of his grandparents and mother in City B.</span></p>

It has been difficult because, for reasons I will explain, the allegations made by James against the Father that were the trigger for the issue of these proceedings are at the &#8216;lower end of the scale&#8217;, to use that expression, both in terms of the allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour and in terms of the excessive punishment suggested. Some of the allegations made, in my judgment, fall short of meeting requirements of section 31(2) even if I were to find them proved and other allegations of general neglect are also very much on the borders of being matters that, if proved, meet threshold.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:Cambria">It has been an extraordinary case because, for reasons I will come onto, I find the Father to have been dishonest with the Court on a very wide range of topics. When I come to my findings, I will conclude that he has lied about his own family background and its membership in a truly inexplicable way. He has lied about the nature of his relationship with the Mother. He has lied about the religion he was born into. He has lied about how he came to be a citizen of the United Kingdom and has lied about aspects of his student and working life. For reasons I will explain, I have concluded that the Father has been so dishonest with the court that I must be cautious before accepting his accounts unless it is corroborated by other evidence. </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:Cambria">However, just because he has chosen to lie to the court about himself and the many other issues I address in this judgment, that does not mean that he is lying when he denies all the allegations made against him by James. A very careful assessment of all the evidence has been necessary in reaching my conclusions.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:Cambria">It has also been an extraordinary case as despite, as I find him to be, the Father being an intelligent and well-educated man, he has wilfully and deliberately rejected all attempts to assess him. He attended for just one meeting with the psychologist so that assessment could not be completed. He refused to be assessed by a psychiatrist and his engagement with the Local Authority has been minimal, rejecting the first allocated social worker for what I find to be no good reason at all and then, when challenged by the co-allocated social worker, rejecting her also. This has resulted in a hearing that has concentrated on whether, or not, the threshold criteria are satisfied but there has been far less focus on whether there has been any change in the father&#8217;s parenting capacity since these proceedings were issued, as it is his case that there are no changes that he needs to make. His case is a simple one. James is lying about how the father behaved in the home and, when any person from outside of the home has recorded something with which the Father disagrees, that person is also lying.</span></p>

The Father&#8217;s written and oral evidence was that he has no siblings, he was never married to the Mother and she never met his own mother. He said this is all a fantasy invented by the Mother. The Mother told me that when she learned she was pregnant with her first child, she converted to Islam to prevent her and the baby being rejected by the Father&#8217;s family.</span></p>

The Father was cross-examined by all parties, and asked questions by the Court, about images seen that, the Father accepted, included photographs of him. What he denied was that the other persons seen in the photographs were his brothers and his mother. He accepted that the Mother was in one of the photographs but he claimed not to know who was the older woman sitting between them. This same person appears in a photograph on Facebook that the Mother tells me is the Father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s page and she says the older woman is the Father&#8217;s mother. There are also photographs of the Father, that he accepts were taken in Berlin, in which he is standing with the two men that the Mother says are his two brothers.</span></p>

The Father told me that he has travelled extensively and there are very many photographs of him on social media with people he had never met before the photograph was taken. However, in my judgment, the older woman in the photograph sitting between the Father and the Mother is, without doubt, the same woman who appears in the photograph with the man the Mother says is the Father&#8217;s brother and that same man appears in a photograph that the Father accepts was taken in Berlin. In the photographs taken in Berlin is another man who the Mother told me is the Father&#8217;s other brother and I, without any hesitation, accept her evidence.</span></p>

He sat in the witness box denying what was very obviously the truth and did so in a grandiose manner appearing to be immune to the ridiculousness of the answers he was giving to the questions asked. It was an astonishing performance that has led some of the advocates to question whether the Father&#8217;s mental health is poor. I understand why some have raised this possibility but I, for reasons I will come to, have reached the conclusion that the Father is a narcissist who has become so out of touch with how he presents to others that his capacity for dishonesty is without limit, if it serves the purpose of self-aggrandisement.</span></p>

The Father identifies as gender neutral and has dyed his hair blond, wears heavy black eye make-up, lip stick, nail varnish and some clothing that can be said to be more of a female style. The Father&#8217;s appearance, and his expression of his gender identity, is relevant as, he says, James became embarrassed about how his Father looked and this is, says the Father, why James has made allegations so he can now live with his mother. When the Father was asked if he was wearing white make-up to give the appearance of having lighter skin, he initially denied that he was and said it was &#8220;his natural skin tone&#8221;. This was a quite ridiculous lie as it was obvious to all in court that the Father was wearing a pale or white foundation and when I asked him again, he accepted that he was.

The Father was challenged on the basis that James was not born when he entered the country, and on the basis that it was not credible that he could not remember how he got permission to enter the UK and remain living here, but the Father continued to say he was not sure.

Therefore, these three boys have experienced a disrupted childhood that was, at that time, primarily due to the Mother&#8217;s misuse of substances. The Mother accepts this and expresses remorse; remorse that I accept as genuine. In his closing submissions, Mr Foster refers to the harm the children suffered in the care of their mother as being relevant to my determination of the allegations now made against the Father. Whilst I accept this history is of relevance in understanding the background and to how the children might react and behave, in my judgment these events that took place in and prior to 2019 are not matters to be addressed in a threshold finding in 2023 and 2024. The harm the Local Authority alleges that led to the applications to the court all arose when the children were in the care of the Father.</span></p>

The school informed the father that if he intended to home school James, then he would need to write a letter advising of this so he could be assessed for his suitability to deliver home education.

I asked him if he had called the GP to chase this up and he said that he had. If that is correct, it is inexplicable that Mindmate had formed the view that the Father was failing to respond to them. As I have already described, Cherry Tree school were unable to contact Father so had visited his home. There is an emerging pattern of Father failing to respond to communications. I do not accept that Mindmate&#8217;s correspondence is inaccurate and I find that although father was presenting James as requiring a mental health service, he then neglected that perceived need by failing to engage when the service was offered.</span></p>

He wouldn't go back home. He said he had to sit on the naughty corner and stare at the floor for 30 minutes then a further ten minutes in the morning. Dad had a meeting with someone from the safeguarding team, things improved a little after this according to James. Dad said he would refer to Mindmate to help James. James said no support was put in place. Dad called the head of year and said he didn't want anyone to support him in school as he was going to find someone externally&#8217;.</span></p>

After James had complained on 13 September, a meeting was arranged with Father on 14 September. At that meeting Father said that James had been arguing with him and misbehaving and was made to sit in the naughty corner as a punishment. Father explained the Mother&#8217;s history and how he thought James&#8217;s behaviour was more difficult after contact. The school suggested that a member of its safeguarding team checked-in with James regularly and Father agreed to this but then on 3 October 2022 told the school that he did not want anyone providing support to James as a referral had been made to Mindmate.</span></p>

James spoke of his feelings of anger and was happy to work on this with school staff. On 20 September 2022, James had a session about his feelings and said that one of the strategies he had to manage his feelings was to listen to music and to watch Youtube on his phone, but was unable to do this as Father had broken James&#8217;s phone during an argument. When Mother gave her oral evidence, she said that she&#8217;d had regular telephone contact but it stopped as a result of Father smashing James&#8217;s phone. Jordan spoke to the social worker about Father smashing James&#8217;s phone in an argument and now they could not speak to their mother any more. In his oral evidence, the Father said he had confiscated the telephone but had not broken it. James&#8217;s account was of the phone being broken in an argument, and this is corroborated by Jordan who told the social worker about this at a later date. James was speaking about having no phone in the context of not being able to use it to manage his feelings when he was being asked about this topic by the school safeguarding support staff, Ms Swann. </span></p>

In the same conversation, Ms Swann records James telling her that Father had taken away his phone and would not give it back until he &#8220;has worked on his anxiety&#8221; and this made James feel like running away again. It has not been suggested by any party that a phone was smashed by Father but then replaced and that phone then confiscated. It appears that James has given two accounts within a month of why he has no access to a phone and on that basis I am unable to find the allegation that F smashed the phoned proved. However, as the evidence I have is incomplete as to whether it was a different phone that was then confiscated, I take the view that it would be wrong to conclude that James had lied.</span></p>

I stood in the rain for another couple of minutes and then knocked the door again, parent shouted something again so I waited another minute and then posted the attendance letter. As I was turning the car around, I could see through the glass in the door that the parent had retrieved the letter and was reading it. He then opened his front door, held the letter in the air and tore it into pieces. He then threw the paper on the ground&#8221;. When he gave his oral evidence, the Father said he did not remember this event but he accepted there would have been no other adult in the home other than himself. This is, in my judgment, yet another example of the Father ignoring important correspondence about his child and avoiding contact with professionals.</span></p>

When Ms Rashid saw them again on 25 October 2023, Jordan told her that their Father had told them not to talk to visitors at school. When Father was asked about this, he denied telling them not to speak to social workers specifically but accepted that he had told them they did not have to speak to anyone who made them feel uncomfortable. I accept the submission made by Ms Persaud that Father put the children under pressure not to speak to the social workers and, had the Father been able to speak to James on 23 October 2023, in my judgment it is likely that he would have put pressure on James not to speak further or even to retract his allegations.</span></p>

The Father told me that he never spoken negatively about the Mother, even though Joshua told Dr Downs that Father speaks about Mother in a way that makes Joshua sad. When conversations took place about telephone contact between the boys and their mother at the parenting assessment session on 5 December 2023, it is recorded that the Father&#8217;s answers were vague and he deflected the conversation onto his complaints about the content of the Mother&#8217;s statement. As is set out in Ms Persaud&#8217;s closing submissions, just three days later, the social worker had a conversation with Jordan and Joshua about phone contact with their mother and they said &#8220;no, we don&#8217;t need this. This is what the visits to grandparents are for. We only spoke to her usually just before we went to visit. We see her on the visits we don&#8217;t need phone contact.&#8221; It is submitted that this is clear evidence of the children having been coached by the Father. The Father denied influencing the children but I do not accept his denial. I agree that the children were likely to be repeating language that was not their own and was a script given to them by the Father. I can see no reason why Jordan would lie to Dr Downs about Father&#8217;s attitude towards the Mother and I find it likely that the children had learned not to share information with their mother as this would enrage the father. In his police interview, the Father described the Mother as not an &#8220;existing person&#8221; in the children&#8217;s lives, a comment that demonstrates, in my judgment, the Father&#8217;s attitude towards the Mother.</span></p>

Father said that he did not want the children to have &#8220;bad thoughts&#8217; and I am satisfied from the evidence of both social workers that the children would have heard all that was said. In my finding, rather than seeking to assist the children by reassuring them about social work visits and the role of the social workers, the Father did the opposite. He then relied on anxiety he had caused himself as reason why there should not be visits to the children, in a similar way to how he behaved with the school, relying on James being upset about the police attending as reason why school staff should not visit. In my judgment this was deliberate and dishonest manipulation by the Father. </span></p>

I accept the submission that the allegations made are not of serious assaults, be them of a physical or sexual nature. The allegation made that Father required the children to kiss his hands is an unusual allegation. My assessment of James in the video recorded interviews is that he appeared uncomfortable in a way I would expect a boy of his age to be when speaking of these matters but he did not seek to exaggerate or embellish his account. There were a number of occasions when the officer was seeking more information about what James saw when walking in on the Father in the shower or when urinating. James did not take the opportunities given to him to make more serious allegations. </span></p>

These remarks can be interpreted as being an attack on James&#8217;s sexuality as much as they can as being an invitation to engage in sexual activity. </span></p>

It was not challenged that Mother and James had a close relationship. Indeed, it was relied upon by Father as a reason why James would lie about him. The Mother told me that James had never told her that he questioned his gender identity or his sexuality. The Mother does not believe the father to be telling the truth when he asserts that James has questioned his identity and sexuality. I accept the Mother&#8217;s evidence and I do not accept the Father&#8217;s evidence that James had been expressing the worries about himself that the Father alleges.

However, I accept the Mother&#8217;s evidence that the Father&#8217;s appearance changed most markedly during Covid lockdowns. I note that James complained to the school in February 2020, about the Father&#8217;s punishments, so this was before the first lockdown commenced at the end of March of that year. I also consider that James being open with his Mother about his embarrassment by the Father&#8217;s appearance is an indication that he was able to discuss this and seek support rather than to invent allegations. I have found the Father to be the person who lacks credibility and I reject his claim that James has invented his allegations to achieve his goal of living with the mother. </span></p>

He made him stand in corners for excessive periods of time and kiss his hand to demonstrate to James that he might be growing older but it was still the Father who was in charge. In my judgment, James was correct to associate these comments with the Father&#8217;s ego.

It identified that he had provided care for the children for a 5 year period since 2019, when the Mother was unable to provide good enough care. It identified that loving relationships were observed during family time. However, Father denied that he had ever harmed his children or that he needed to change any aspect of his parenting. He maintained this position in his oral evidence. The Father&#8217;s family time with Jordan and Joshua has been positive but, in my judgment, the Guardian accurately described the position at paragraphs 41 and 42 of her report:</span></p>

He initially would not work with the social worker Ms Rashid and now he will not work with the social worker Ms Ogden.

The children have been exposed to his challenging towards professionals and when Jordan and Joshua were removed from his care, the situation was much more traumatic for the children due to him not cooperating with the Local Authority and the police had to be involved.</span></p>

I have to proceed on the basis of the harm that I have found this father has caused to his children and the likelihood, as I find it to be, of that harm occurring again. The Father denies that he has any deficiencies as a parent. He accuses his children of lying if they have said anything that contradicts his own evidence and states the same about any professional or other witnesses if they report an event that he now denies. In my judgment, the risk of the children suffering similar harms occurring again in the absence of the Father demonstrating change is high.</span></p>

It is a comparison between these scenarios as there are no other proposals being made. In my judgment, the likelihood of harm being caused to the children if returned to the care of the father is high given the lack of any change and, when considering all the matters set out in the welfare checklist, I find that the making of care orders to be necessary and proportionate interferences with the private and family lives of the children and the parents.</span></p>

It is proposed that it will be supervised. In my judgment there needs to be a very tightly drawn and unambiguous contract of expectations prescribing how the Father is, and is not, to behave during the family time sessions. In my judgment he is very likely to try to exert control. It is not open to him to repudiate the safeguarding agreement that is imposed to protect the children from harm. It is my expectation that the Local Authority will carefully consider the risks and benefits of family time if the Father breaches the terms of the safeguarding plan that I have seen.</span></p>

The Local Authority seeks permission to refuse contact between James and the Father. In the circumstances, I grant that permission as in my judgment trying to force James to see the Father would be harmful to him and he will, with the assistance of the Local Authority, have to come to an understanding of his life story and decide for himself in the future what relationship he wishes to have with his father. His contact with the Father will be the subject of ongoing review while he remains the subject of a care order.</span></p>
