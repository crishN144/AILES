	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the final hearing in proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention in relation to Rocco John Ritchie, who is now aged 15 years and seven months.  Rocco is the son of Ms. Madonna Ciccone and Mr. Guy Ritchie.  The court is, at this hearing, concerned primarily with the mother&#8217;s application for permission to withdraw her application under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (hereafter the 1980 Hague Convention).</p>

As I noted in my previous judgment, following the end of the parents&#8217; marriage the arrangements for Rocco were agreed in February 2009 by way of a consent order approved by the Senior District Judge in the Principal Registry of the Family Division.  On 27 March 2009 the order of the Senior District Judge was registered in the State of New York by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, by which registration the order of the Senior District Judge is deemed to have the same force and effect as an order of, and is enforceable as if it were issued by, a court of the State of New York.</p>

At one point in these proceedings it was proposed that judicial liaison should take place between Judge Kaplan and myself.  However, having had, very helpfully, sight of full transcripts of the hearing that took place in New York on 23 December 2015 and a transcript of a conference call hearing before Judge Kaplan on 2 March 2016 it was not necessary for me to take up Judge Kaplan&#8217;s valuable time making enquiries as to what had transpired in the proceedings in New York.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother accepts that the Supreme Court of the State of New York has jurisdiction in this matter. The father made clear during the course of this hearing through Mr. Verdan that he, likewise, accepts that the New York Court has jurisdiction, albeit at the outset of the hearing Mr. Verdan submitted that this court should make certain substantive welfare orders in respect of Rocco.  Whilst in his Skeleton Argument Mr. Setright undertook an analysis of the jurisdictional position in this case (including an analysis of habitual residence) and submits that this court should, upon the withdrawal of these proceedings, give certain procedural directions aimed at any future applications made in this jurisdiction, he does not suggest at this time that Rocco disputes the jurisdiction of the court in New York.  Within this context, and with respect in particular to orders originally sought by the father, Mr. Williams submitted that it would be wrong for the English court to seek to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">park its tanks</span>&#8221; (to use his phrase) on the front lawn of the United States by taking any steps beyond those necessary to effect the withdrawal of the proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother sought to withdraw proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention for the summary return of Rocco to the United States of America but continued, at least formally, to seek his return under the auspices of an order made in the proceedings in New York. The mother contends she is entitled to withdraw her proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention without the need for permission from the court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father continued to object to the return of Rocco to the United States of America.  However, the father argued that (a) the mother requires permission to withdraw her proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention, the test for permission being Rocco&#8217;s best interests, and (b) that the court has jurisdiction to make, and should make, substantive welfare orders in respect of Rocco to protect his position within this jurisdiction.  Within this context, the Position Statement lodged on behalf of the father for the pre-hearing review on 3 March 2016 raised the possibility of the court refusing the mother permission to withdraw her application under the 1980 Hague Convention on welfare grounds and thereafter determining certain welfare issues identified by the father within these proceedings.  The father had issued no separate application to that end.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus the parent <span style="font-style:italic">seeking</span> return sought to abandon her application for an order for return and the parent <span style="font-style:italic">opposing</span> return sought, nominally, to resist the withdrawal of an application designed to achieve that end, at least until further substantive welfare orders were made.  The reason that the position I have described has arisen is tolerably clear.  The mother continues, at least formally, to seek the return of Rocco to the United States of America but has come to see the proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention in this jurisdiction as redundant to achieving that end in circumstances where the New York Court has acted promptly in hearing the case.  The father objects to the return of Rocco to the United States but considers that the continuation of proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention provides a shield against what he considers to be the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head in the form of the proceedings in the United States, or at least a vehicle for seeking substantive welfare orders to secure Rocco&#8217;s continued position in this jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For his part, Rocco welcomes his mother&#8217;s decision to withdraw her proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention as a substantive step toward that which he most desires, namely an end to <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> litigation between his parents in respect of him.   As noted above, on behalf of Rocco Mr. Setright submits that upon the withdrawal of the proceedings the court should give certain procedural directions aimed at any future applications made in this jurisdiction.  The directions sought are (i) that the mother will make no without notice applications in relation to Rocco in this jurisdiction, (ii) that notice of no less than seven days will be given of any applications, (iii) that the mother will raise no objection to Rocco being joined as a party to any application and (iv) that Ms Ray shall be appointed as Rocco&#8217;s Guardian in any application that requires him to have a Guardian.  Mr. Setright also suggests that any future applications in this jurisdiction be reserved to me.</p>

Further, Mr. Williams submits that if permission is required to withdraw proceedings under the 1980 Convention then there is a possibility that such permission will be refused.  What, asks Mr. Williams rhetorically, happens then?  Does the court compel a party to pursue an application they do not wish to prosecute?  If a party simply refuses to prosecute an application does the court proceed to hear it in any event?</p>

In any event, Mr. Williams submits that, save for a direction that any further applications in this jurisdiction be reserved to me (which direction Mr. Williams does not seek to oppose), all the provisions sought by Mr. Setright are provided for in the rules or case law, to which rules and case law the mother&#8217;s representatives would be expected to adhere upon issuing any further application in this jurisdiction.  Within this context, Mr. Williams argues that it would not be proper to make anticipatory directions in relation to proceedings that have not yet been, and may never be issued.

Further Mr. Wolanski submits that, in the context of the extensive amount of highly detailed publicity this case has already garnered since 23 December 2015, to publish versions of the judgment without anonymisation would not, in the particular circumstances of this case, be detrimental to Rocco.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, care must be taken in relying on these authorities in the context of the question at issue before this court.  First, those authorities were decided under the Family Proceedings Rules 1991 r 4.5 which, as detailed below, differs substantially from FPR 2010 r 29.4.  Second, and importantly, the conclusions in those authorities that the question of whether care proceedings should be withdrawn is a question which concerns the welfare or upbringing of a child, and that the test for whether permission should be given is the welfare of the child, are grounded firmly in the fact that the upbringing of the child is the main question falling for determination in such proceedings (see <span style="font-style:italic">London Borough of Southwark v B </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] 2 FLR 559" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] 2 FLR 559</ref> at 572).   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to note that the procedural requirement of permission for the withdrawal of proceedings is not limited to cases involving children, either in FPR 2010 r 29.4 or more widely.  FPR 2010 r 29.4(1)(a) applies r 29.4 to applications in proceedings under Part 7 of the FPR 2010, namely applications in matrimonial and civil partnership proceedings, and is not qualified as only applying where the application concerns the welfare or upbringing of a child.  Accordingly, pursuant to FPR 2010 r 29.4(1)(a) permission is required to withdraw an application for a marriage or civil partnership order governed by FPR 2010 Part 7 notwithstanding the proceedings do not concern the welfare or upbringing of a child.  There are also other areas of law where permission is required to withdraw an application in proceedings. For example, under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Insolvency Act 1986</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/266/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 266(2)</ref> a bankruptcy petition may not be withdrawn without the leave of the court.</p>

That context includes the fact that the FPR 2010 represents a new procedural code with &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the overriding objective of enabling the court to deal with the case justly, having regard to any welfare issues involved</span>&#8221; (FPR 2010 r 1.1).  The court must give effect to the overriding objective when it exercises any power under the FPR 2010 (FPR 2010 r 1.2(a)) and has a duty to further the overriding objective by actively managing the case (FPR 2010 r 1.4(1)).  Pursuant to FPR 2010 r 1.2(b) the court must also seek to give effect to the overriding objective when it <span style="font-style:italic">interprets</span> any rule.</p>

The previous rules, in the form of Part IV of the FPR 1991, made provision for permission to withdraw proceedings only in relation to proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (FPR 1991 r 4.5).  For example, although FPR 1991 r 2.8 permitted the discontinuance of a petition for divorce, judicial separation or nullity before service of that petition, the rules made no provision for the proceedings to be withdrawn following service.  By contrast, whilst pursuant to FPR 2010 r 7.9 an application for a matrimonial or civil partnership order may be withdrawn at any time before it has been served by giving notice to the court in writing (reflecting the provisions in FPR 1991 r 2.8), pursuant to FPR 2010 r 29.4(1)(a) following service the permission of the court is required before such an application can be withdrawn.  Neither FPR 2010 r 29.4(1)(a) or FPR r 29.4(1)(b), which deals with applications in proceedings where either of the parties is a protected party, are not qualified as only applying where the application concerns the welfare or upbringing of a child.  </p>

Mr. Setright further points out that the withdrawal of proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention (and for other applications under Part 10 to Part 14 of the FPR 2010) will often give rise to the need to consider the terms of the withdrawal and any consequential steps that need to be taken to settle the child&#8217;s arrangements.  </p>

Within this context, a requirement of permission to withdraw applying in respect of all applications covered by Part 10 to Part 14 of the FPR 2010, including applications under the 1980 Hague Convention governed by Part 12, is consistent with the duty of the court to actively manage the course of proceedings from beginning to end so as to achieve a just outcome for all involved, particularly in the absence of any provisions for giving written notice of withdrawal.  It is also of note that many of the applications under Part 10 and Part 11 that need not concern the welfare or upbringing of a child are the type of applications where the court may wish to consider the merits of an application to withdraw.  For example, where an applicant for a non-molestation order seeks permission to withdraw the court may wish to satisfy itself that that application is not being made under duress from an abusive partner.</p>

Further, having regard to the overriding objective, there are positive merits in this case to permitting the mother to withdraw her application in this jurisdiction.   As I observed during the course of the hearing, at present the existence of parallel proceedings in two jurisdictions, before two judges with two sets of lawyers is introducing unnecessary and unhelpful complexity and hindering attempts at settlement, as well as incurring considerable expense.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally on this issue, it can properly be said that unprecedented cases may make for poor precedent. I make clear that my decision to publish my judgments without anonymisation is based on the highly specific, and indeed quite exceptional facts of this case, most particularly the extraordinary amount of information already in the public domain worldwide concerning these matters.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, I give permission to the mother to withdraw her proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention.  Rocco&#8217;s passport will be released to him for the purposes of travel at Easter.  Upon his return to this jurisdiction, and if agreed, the passport should be held by Rocco&#8217;s solicitors.  If this is not agreed, then, as I say, I see no principled reason why Rocco should not retain his own passport pending determination of any issue regarding the same by the New York court.  I direct that any future applications made in this jurisdiction shall be reserved to me.  I direct that my judgment of 3 February 2016 following the hearing on 21 December 2015 and this judgment be published on the terms which I have set out above.  The reporting restrictions in this case will continue to be provided by the order that I have already made and will apply to the reporting of my published judgments.  I make clear that I have made no orders concerning the question of whether or not Rocco returns to New York, nor do I express any views on that question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I would say this.  For all the interesting legal argument and great learning that is apparent from the admirable skeleton arguments and submissions of leading and junior counsel, at the root of these proceedings (and, I venture to add, the proceedings in the United States) is a temporary breakdown in trust.  For all the media coverage, comment and analysis, this is a case born out of circumstances that arise for countless separated parents the world over.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court should always be the option of very last resort when parents cannot agree matters in respect of their children.  Whilst the law provides a mechanism for the resolution of disputes between parents in respect of their children it is but a blunt instrument when compared to the nuanced virtues of calm discussion and considered compromise between those involved, accepting that this latter path can be a hard one on which to embark, and to sustain, in the context of relationship breakdown. It is for this reason that during the course of the proceedings on each side of the Atlantic Judge Kaplan and myself have repeatedly urged the parties to adopt a consensual approach to resolving the matters of dispute between them for the benefit of Rocco.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context I renew, one final time, my plea for the parents to seek, and to find an amicable resolution to the dispute between them.  Because agreement is not possible today does not mean that agreement will not be possible tomorrow.  Most importantly, as I observed during the course of the hearing, summer does not last forever. The boy very quickly becomes the man.  It would be a very great tragedy for Rocco if any more of the precious and fast receding days of his childhood were to be taken up by this dispute.  Far better for each of his parents to spend that time enjoying, in turn, the company of the mature, articulate and reflective young man who is their son and who is a very great credit to them both.</p>
