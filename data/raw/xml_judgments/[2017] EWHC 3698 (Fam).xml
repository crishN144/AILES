	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">These proceedings concern a boy, C, born 13 August 2008 and, therefore, now aged nine.  C is a boy with a number of problems including a diagnosis that he is on the autistic spectrum.  He has been the subject of long-running and bitterly contested proceedings between his parents.  In this judgment, I consider whether, as his father and his children&#8217;s&#160;guardian maintain, the courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction over him in respect of matters of parental responsibility or whether, as his mother argues, jurisdiction now rests with the courts of Northern Ireland.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The parties were in what I understand to be a relatively brief relationship in 2007/2008 as a result of which the mother became pregnant.  That relationship broke down before the baby was born.  As set out above, C was born on 13 August 2008.  Initially, the father&#8217;s name was not on the birth certificate.  In spring 2010, the parties resumed their relationship briefly and the father&#8217;s name was added to the birth certificate.  The relationship broke down finally later that year whereupon the father filed an application for a child arrangements order and prohibited steps order. </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That was the beginning of what has amounted to almost continuous litigation since that date.  There were various allegations and cross-allegations made by the parties including an allegation that the father had assaulted the mother.  Various contact orders were made and the mother was repeatedly in breach of those orders.  Eventually, the father applied for her committal because of those breaches and in June 2014, the mother was sentenced to a period of imprisonment for contempt of court for breaching the orders, suspended on terms that she comply with the ongoing contact order. </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">That committal order was subsequently discharged when the mother, who had apparently failed to attend court on a number of previous occasions, finally came to a hearing and promised to engage with the hearings and make C available for contact.  Some limited indirect contact then took place but no direct contact, and the father then filed an application for a child arrangements order seeking an order that C should live with him, together with a prohibited steps order preventing the mother from removing C from the jurisdiction.  That latter order was made without notice to the mother and directions were given for a hearing on notice which took place on 13 February 2015. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On that occasion, HH Judge Black made various directions for a final hearing and ordered the mother to make C available for contact.  On 14 February 2015, the mother duly brought C to a contact centre but also brought a bundle of his clothes and said that the child should now live with his father.  Thus, at the time of the hearing listed as a final hearing on 18&#160;March 2015, C was indeed living with his father.  At that point, however, the mother asked the judge, HH Judge Sullivan QC, to make an order returning C to her care. </span></p>

The judge made a further order, a prohibited steps order, that the mother should not remove C from the jurisdiction without the father&#8217;s prior written agreement.  She also made an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.91(14)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> restraining the mother from bringing any further application to court for an order under s.8 of the Children Act without the court&#8217;s leave for two years. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In her judgment, the judge made a number of criticisms of both parents but her greater criticism was directed at the mother.  In her concluding section, the judge said at paragraph 29:</span></p>
	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;I find that the mother&#8217;s behaviour over the years to have not been in C&#8217;s best interests.  She has not remained in contact with the father and, although she has promised in the past to cooperate, she still is not prepared to encourage contact.  She told C that his father was trying to send his mother to prison and that is highly undesirable and unfair when it was her contact which caused the father&#8217;s application.  Her ability to abandon C to his father, if she really believed what she said C felt about his father, was clearly not in his interests&#8230;  It is clearly not in C&#8217;s best interests that the mother should abandon him if he is placed with his father.  I have no confidence, therefore, that the mother will put C&#8217;s needs above her own in future.  On the other hand, I consider the father will do his best.  He needs to mature and consider the impact of his behaviour on others&#8230;  I am satisfied that he will put C&#8217;s needs first and he will promote contact with all of C&#8217;s family.  I consider him to be the more appropriate parent for this little boy.  I therefore direct that C should have his home with his father and spend time with his mother, as has been agreed in principle&#8217;.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">After that hearing, therefore, C continued living with the father.  The first contact with his mother took place on the weekend of 25 March 2015.  The mother collected C as agreed but did not return him at the end of the weekend.  The father contacted the police who visited the mother&#8217;s property.  She told the police that the father was not in fact C&#8217;s father and, as I understand it, asserted to them that she had obtained DNA evidence to prove that he was not the father.  She contacted the local authority social services and, on her account, was told by them not to return C to the father&#8217;s care.  I am unclear as to what advice, if any, social services did in fact give to the mother at that point.  On 30 March 2015, the mother sent an email to the court saying that the father was not C&#8217;s father and attaching what purported to be a DNA result showing that to be the case. </span></p>

On 1 May 2015, he filed an application in Form C100 asking for a prohibited steps order and a specific issue order.  In the application, the father recited what he said had happened since the order of 18 March and added:</span></p>

As I was subject to a barring order at the final hearing on 18 March 2015, I have not been able to return the matter to court in order to present my DNA evidence proving that the father is not C&#8217;s biological father.  This is clearly highly pertinent to the matter as C should not be sent to live with a person who is not his parent when I, his mother, am well able to care for him.</span></p>

First, there were two applications before the court - an application for a child arrangements order and an application for enforcement of the earlier child arrangements order.  Secondly, the issues between the parties which needed to be resolved in the proceedings were (i) the outcome of the DNA-testing, (ii) whether C should continue to live with his mother or be returned to live with his father, and (iii) the level of contact with each of his parents.  In other words, arising out of or following on from the father&#8217;s application of 1 May 2015, there was a live issue concerning child arrangements as to where and with whom C should live and what contact he should have with the other parent, which would be reconsidered once the results of the DNA-testing were known. </span></p>

The matter next returned to court on 15 June.  On that occasion, Judge Sullivan made an order in which she recorded that the mother was in breach of the order of 5 May by failing to make C available for DNA testing.  The order included a recital that the judge had determined that the mother was aware of the hearing and ordered the mother to return C to the father &#8216;at 2pm on Wednesday 17 May 2015&#8217;.  That provision in the order contained an obvious misprint, namely reference to the month of May as opposed to the month of June, but at the hearing before me, Ms&#160;Cameron-Douglas, on behalf of the mother, has argued that that error made the order one which the mother was incapable of complying with, assuming she ever had notice of it.  The judge further directed both parties to attend court on 18 June. </span></p>

It is unnecessary to recite all of those orders in any detail.  They include orders of this court under the inherent jurisdiction relating to the mother&#8217;s passport and orders for the disclosure of information from various bodies and agencies concerned in the mother&#8217;s whereabouts.  A significant amount of effort was expended by courts trying to ascertain where the mother was.  Ultimately, on 1&#160;September 2015, HH Judge Levey made a recovery order under Section 34.  All these orders were to no avail.  The whereabouts of the mother and C remained unknown. </span></p>

The mother immediately applied to the High Court in Northern Ireland.  On 4&#160;October, Master Wells, sitting in the Family Division of the High Court in Northern&#160;Ireland, made an order on the mother&#8217;s application in which he recorded that the court was satisfied that the correct jurisdiction for determining the issue in this case was England, in particular the Family Court in Portsmouth.  He adjourned the case until further order.  He refused the mother&#8217;s application for wardship and adjourned the matter generally to afford the mother to make an application to the Portsmouth&#160;Family&#160;Court for the proceedings to be transferred to Northern Ireland, such application to be made by 29&#160;November; otherwise the application to the Northern&#160;Ireland court would be struck out.</span></p>

The matter came before Judge Levey on that day.  He adjourned it to be listed before me on 12 October. On that occasion, 12 October, having heard submissions, I made an order in the following terms: (1) that the mother&#8217;s application for the immediate return today for C to her care is refused, (2) that the child should live with the father until further order, and (3) the mother is prohibited from taking any step to remove C from the care of his father or from the jurisdiction of England and Wales. A penal notice was attached to the order. On 19 October, the matter came back before me for further directions.  In the earlier hearing I had joined C as a party to the proceedings and requested Cafcass to appoint a guardian - if possible, the guardian who represented him previously.  At the hearing on 19 October, I gave directions for a further interim welfare hearing and for a subsequent hearing as to jurisdiction. </span></p>

The mother had left Northern Ireland to travel to attend the hearing, notwithstanding the fact that she was heavily pregnant, but en route was arrested in Liverpool and taken to a police station in Portsmouth on suspicion of child abduction and of attempting to pervert the course of justice, this latter allegation arising out of her alleged fabrication of C&#8217;s DNA test results in 2015.  The mother was interviewed and subsequently released on bail, on conditions which included a condition precluding her having contact with C.  She was directed to attend the police station in the week of 18&#160;December for a charging decision.  At the time of writing this judgment, I am unaware of the outcome of that charging decision.  Because of the arrest, the mother was unable to attend the hearing before me in Bournemouth on 27 October.  The focus of her application had been her proposal that C be allowed to return to Northern Ireland to live with her, or alternatively at least to attend the mother&#8217;s wedding due to take place a few days later.  That application was refused.  C has, therefore, remained living with his father and I understand that to date no contact has taken place with his mother. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This argument is, if I may say so respectfully, impressively constructed but it is built on weak foundations, namely, the assertion there are no &#8216;live&#8217; or ongoing proceedings in England from May 2015 except enforcement proceedings.  As the extensive quotation from Judge Sullivan&#8217;s order of 5 May 2015 above demonstrates, there were at that stage ongoing proceedings under s. 8 of the Children Act.  Ms Cameron-Douglas says that the substance of the application made by the father was for the enforcement of the orders of 18 March 2015. The orders sought in the application, however, were a prohibited steps order and a specific issue order, which are of course orders under s.8 of the Children Act and therefore orders which come within the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(1)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref>. The order of 5 May says on its face that the father &#8220;has applied for a child arrangements order&#8221;, and this is supported by the summary of the issues set out on the face of the order. Judge Sullivan there identified the issues which remained to be resolved as being (a) the outcome of the DNA testing, (b) whether the child should continue to live with his mother or return to live with his father pursuant to the earlier order, and (c) as to contact that C should have with each of his parents.  It is plain from the statement filed by the mother that those matters were indeed in issue.  Ms Cameron-Douglas suggested that the request by the mother in her statement for orders placing C in her care and stopping all contact between C and the father cannot be regarded as an application by the mother because she was barred from making any application under s. 8 by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 91(14)</ref> order made on 18 March. On any view, however, the mother raised those matters in response to the father&#8217;s application dated 1 May, and they were unquestionably in issue.  Judge Sullivan plainly took the view - rightly, in my judgment - that there was now a substantive child arrangements order application in issue to be determined both as to where C should live and as to what contact he should have with the non-resident parent. </span></p>

Those proceedings have never been brought to an end.  They were effectively sabotaged by the mother&#8217;s abduction of C in breach of the prohibited steps order and her own assurances in the statement she filed on 5 May, quoted above.  Thereafter, the focus of the court&#8217;s attention switched to attempts to enforce orders, but nothing happened in those enforcement proceedings to terminate the ongoing proceedings started in May 2015, and very much alive at the time of the mother&#8217;s abduction of C to Ireland.</span></p>

In any event, I would be very reluctant to come to any concluded view as to whether C had acquired the necessary degree of integration in a social and family environment in Ireland and Northern&#160;Ireland on the basis of untested assertions made by the mother in her statements, given her history of deceitful and, at times, unpredictable behaviour.  As the Supreme Court has made clear, the fact that C was removed unilaterally without the father&#8217;s consent would not </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">per se</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> have prevented him acquiring habitual residence in Ireland and/or in Northern Ireland, but it is a factor to be taken into account in the overall analysis as to whether or not he has acquired habitual residence there.  The mother&#8217;s assertion that they were living quite openly in Northern Ireland is, again, not something I would be prepared to take at face value without hearing oral evidence, particularly in the light of C&#8217;s alleged comment to the guardian that Ireland was a good place to hide. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">A further difficulty arises on Ms Cameron-Douglas&#8217; analysis concerning the identity of the relevant date.  She opened her argument on the basis that the only &#8216;live&#8217; application before the court was that made by her instructing solicitors on 9 October 2017 but, on close analysis, it transpired that that application had in fact been concluded by the refusal of this court to order the return of C to Northern Ireland.  If, contrary to my conclusion above, Ms Cameron-Douglas is correct in saying there is no live application from 2015, it would follow that there is no &#8216;live&#8217; application before the court at all.  In those circumstances, the relevant date would be the date at which the court is considering whether or not to make the order.  If it were the case that there is no live application, this court would then have to consider whether it had jurisdiction as at the date of the hearing.  By the time of the adjourned hearing last week, C had been with the father for over nine weeks and on the evidence before me, in particular, the evidence of the guardian, had settled in his father&#8217;s care.  In those circumstances, my prima facie view</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">is that he has acquired some degree of integration in a social and family environment when living with his father.</span></p>
