I was also satisfied that in 2015 that she had previously intimated to father that she was not ready for sexual intercourse after her miscarriage and that father had sought to hasten her willingness to engage in intimacy.  Her body language and actions were that of a woman who was very upset about having sexual intercourse.

He presented as a person wishing to control the narrative.  I had no doubt that when under the influence of alcohol or drugs, that these traits would be enhanced and he would become even more difficult to deal with.  I was aware from his convictions that father was a man who has been prone to poor behaviour including to police officers just doing their job. There was no doubt in my mind from the scale of the messages professing apologies, that father had regularly behaved badly towards this mother.  In addition, father was contradictory at times in his evidence to me at that hearing and could not refrain from blaming mother.</span></p>

This did not assist father to be consistent in his communications with H.  I was very concerned that father sought to dispute paternity so late in the proceedings and that ultimately those DNA tests showed exactly what the mother said they would show, namely, that he was the biological father.

Whilst the special measures can protect mother from being in sight of father and being questioned by him, she has had to listen to the way that he conducted his case.  He has shown more commitment to blaming mother than he has to the indirect contact with his daughter. He has been given very generous opportunity to demonstrate his commitment to H and he has not done so by not fully engaging in the indirect contact and in undertaking the work recommended to him to ensure H was not exposed to his anger.  He is well aware that H had physical difficulties but he had not asked for information from the specialists treating her, asked how she was or in any way prepared himself to parent a child who had additional physical needs.
