	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">In June 2024 Sir Andrew McFarlane, the President of the Family Division, issued updated guidance to assist judges, legal advisors and magistrates in deciding whether and how to publish more of their judgments on the National Archive website.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText"><span> </span>Transparency in the Family Courts &#8211; Publication of Judgments, issued 19 June 2024</p>
	      </authorialNote>  According to that guidance the publication of judgments is an essential part of the process of achieving greater transparency about the work being done in the Family Court through the shedding of more light on its ordinary, day-to-day, workings.  Given the bad press which the Family Court and the family justice system more widely has had to endure in even relatively recent times it is both a laudable and a necessary aim.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_2">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">The Family Court, like all courts, exists not for the benefit of those professionally engaged within it but specifically for those who need its services and more generally for society as a whole.  The increased publication of judgments and the wider aim of greater transparency serves both constituencies.  Those who find themselves in the Family Court, whether voluntarily or not, need to be able to understand how the court works, how decisions are made and the importance of effective participation. Most importantly, participants need to appreciate that a court is not a discussion forum, a meeting or a committee and that its outcomes are not suggestions, recommendations or advisory opinions but decisions from which orders flow and compliance must follow.  Enabling individuals to quickly  appreciate the very different nature of a court from other decision-making organisations in which they may have previously participated is an important part of ensuring either effective engagement or informed disengagement; either way the process of litigation will proceed with more surety and solidity.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">For the wider public the importance of being able to repose trust in an unelected body taking decisions which can be of the gravest magnitude for individuals is essential.  The seven principles of public life apply to courts as much as to elected representatives and include amongst them integrity, objectivity, accountability and openness<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> The Seven Principles of Public Life (sometimes referred to as the Nolan Principles) are Selflessness, Integrity, Objectivity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership.</p>
	      </authorialNote>.  Transparency not only enables the public to understand the workings of the Family Court but to see for themselves those principles being actively applied for the benefit of those involved.  Even more importantly, through transparency, and in particular the publication of judgments, people can see that fairness of process and justice in outcome are hallmarks of the Family Court which can only generate confidence in its operation.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">Notwithstanding the benefits to transparency of publishing a judgment the decision to publish this one is not because of any notion that it will shed light to the wider public of the workings of the Family Court.  A judgment at the level of the Circuit bench is far more likely to litter the legal landscape than to illuminate it.  The law is rarely developed so far down the judicial hierarchy and principles are better framed from a higher vantage point where the view is better both in terms of definition and detail.  There is nothing in terms of the law set out below which has not been said more fully and eloquently in the superior courts.  The purpose of publishing this judgment is to highlight a problem which appeared to be an isolated incident at the time of the preparation and handing down of the unanonymised version of this judgment but which has since recurred and which suggests that it is a practice which, even if it is no more than a little local difficulty, needs calling out to ensure that in so doing repetition, whether by ignorance or design, is avoided.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">The problem which not only occurred in this case but in a subsequent and entirely separate set of proceedings is that of a failure to understand the importance of any conversation with a child once an issue of potential abuse has been identified and the importance of how recurring exchanges and conversations can undermine the process of evidence-gathering and create a confused and even chaotic picture of what actually happened.  The problem when good practice is not followed and steps are taken to hold further discussions with a child who has made allegations is that a proper understanding of the reality of what occurred is too quickly obscured and the consequences are far more likely to be negative rather than positive.  In a situation of disputed, contentious allegations clear findings as to what did (or conversely did not) happen are critical.  Time and again the appellate courts have stressed the importance to be accorded to the findings made by the trial court, they become in nearly all cases the fixed points around which later legal argument swirls, and overturning such findings as were made is a summit scaled only with difficulty<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">Accordingly this judgment is a revised version of that which was previously provided to the parties earlier in the year with full identificatory details and which was abbreviated only for ease of reading.  It has been significantly revised not just to anonymise those involved but to ensure that details of specific events or descriptions of individuals do not unintentionally becomes pieces in an exercise of jigsaw identification.  The family in question, to the best of my knowledge, continue to attempt to resolve their difficulties and should not be hampered in that regard by any impediment stemming from recognition.  Further this version of the judgment is focused upon the process of evidential collation and contamination rather than family-specific threshold findings or welfare outcomes.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">However just as publication is not intended to cause difficulties for the family involved neither is it intended to be a stick with which to metaphorically beat the professionals about whom I have felt the need to be critical.  I have considered the guidance referred to above in terms of identifying professionals or even the specific local authority and have reached the clear conclusion that no benefit will flow from identification.  Coruscation through publication will not assist in securing change.  In any event despite the legion of errors which are chronicled below I reached the clear view that no one acted in bad faith, that mistakes were borne of ignorance and not intent and what is required now is the highlighting of defective processes as opposed to the spotlighting of individuals or even organisations.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">These proceedings involve three children.  It is important at the outset to make that simple but obvious point because throughout these proceedings, and especially during this final hearing, the focus has almost exclusively been on only one child, a girl called Penny. But Penny is only one of a sibship of three as she has two brothers, Alan  and David.  These are not the children&#8217;s real names. Penny is older than her brothers followed by Alan then David.  All three children are of school age and all attend the same school.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">Prior to the events with which this judgment is concerned they all lived with their parents.  I will simply refer to the mother as M and the father as F hereafter.  The parents have been married for many years and have no other children. The parents are both professional individuals with different but time-consuming careers. Each parent succeeded academically and they place great store in their children fulfilling their own potential.  The parents undoubtedly aspire for their children to succeed and encourage them to do so.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">Although the family is close knit, or certainly was before the events with which I am concerned began, they are not isolated and there had been no record of involvement with social services and certainly nothing which might indicate anything other than stable, consistent and caring parenting of three contented children.  All of that is true of many families but three factors differentiate this family from many others. Firstly, they are a family of colour and therefore will have had a lived experience which will undoubtedly have been different from those not of ethnic minority status.  Secondly, although now long settled in the United Kingdom the parents were born, raised and educated in Western Africa and within families imbued with the culture, values and norms of that region.  Thirdly, the family as a whole, and particularly the parents, hold strong religious beliefs and are devout in the practice of their faith.  I raise those matters at the outset because each of them has, to some extent, been referenced within the proceedings and particularly during the final hearing and each will therefore form part of the material in this judgment.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">The proceedings in question are care proceedings and were initiated in the second half of 2023 as a result of Penny having spoken to a teacher at school about physical chastisement being inflicted by her parents upon herself and her brothers.  At the same time Penny also raised concerns about feeling emotionally pressured by her parents over her body shape and either being deprived of food or discouraged from eating by reason of comments made by them, to the point where it was impacting upon her health.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">As those concerns stemmed from a pupil and were raised directly with a teacher they were immediately picked up by the school which instigated its safeguarding procedures.  As part of those procedures Alan and David were spoken to because of what Penny had said and thereafter M and F were made aware of what she had said.  Their reaction to Penny and what she had said was, according to the Local Authority, itself harmful because it caused Penny to suffer such emotional harm that it became necessary to remove Penny from the family home.  As a consequence, since October 2023 Penny has been living with foster carers, a situation she apparently continues to prefer to returning to the family home.  In contrast, Alan and David have remained at home throughout this time albeit that whilst they continue to live with their parents they do so under the constant observation of support workers who are present in that home at all times.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">For the family as a whole this has been a highly pressurised, uncomfortable and difficult period in their lives.  Participation in care proceedings is rarely, if ever, considered to be something which adds to the enjoyment of life but these parents and their sons at least have struggled with the intrusion into their home and their parenting of observant strangers deemed necessary by the court to avoid the removal of all three children.  The stress has been considerable and may well have been a factor in recent health difficulties suffered by the father.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">Neither has Penny been spared from unhappiness.  She is currently effectively estranged from her parents by reason of her assertions and is steadfast in refusing to contemplate the possibility of returning home in the near future.  As Penny has never resiled from her allegations or even hinted at wanting to retract them Alan and David have been consistent in <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> making any allegations of their own against their parents and of rejecting everything Penny has said.  Holding such diametrically opposed views has resulted in an emotional separation between the siblings.  Despite the fact that the three children attend the same school and were having regular contact with each other outside of school there is now something of a fractured relationship between the boys and Penny whom the brothers have started to shun at school.  The parents, like their children, have been consistent from the start in their own denials of Penny&#8217;s allegations, and whilst they would very much like her to return to the family home they recognise the chasm which currently separates them from their daughter.  It is an understatement to say that this is currently a deeply divided family.</p>

In the event that findings of significance are made in respect of the principle allegations there would be a benefit in proceedings being paused for a short period, measured in weeks not months, to allow for a period of absorption of that factual reality and some reflection as to its impact and effect upon the family before attempting to plot a route which allowed some forward movement for as many members of the family as were willing and able to travel down that path.</p>

The parents seek factual clarity in accordance with their denials of any wrongdoing in order to bring the proceedings to an end.

The overall allegations are: (a) that physical chastisement, including the use of implements, has been practised upon the children; (b) that the parents have lied about this in denying the same when working with professionals and in court; (c) that emotional harm has been visited upon Penny, primarily by reason of her &#8216;whistle-blowing&#8217; but also in how they have pressurised her over her weight and so impacted upon her eating; and (d) the parents have failed to allow Alan and David to be assessed for additional needs which the school was stating required professional assessment and support.</p>

There are no noted injuries, no earlier reports made to professionals, no concurrence by siblings or admissions by parents of these allegations or similar ones made at some different time.

This was, so far as SJ was concerned, an unexpected encounter. In her evidence SJ said that she had taught Penny during the previous academic year and although not teaching her now she would acknowledge Penny when she saw her around the school. Although what followed was not something for which SJ was either prepared or experienced she grappled with the situation as best she could and in doing so, in my judgement, did not put a foot wrong.</p>

SJ immediately removed Chris and Penny from the Maths Office, which was not a private space, and took them to an empty classroom. As it was by now the end of break and both girls should have gone to their lessons she also emailed their teachers to inform them that the girls were with her.  Having taken those initial steps SJ listened to what Chris and Penny told her.  In accordance with safeguarding training she had received whilst studying for her PGCE and then whilst at school she made notes of what she was being told.</p>

SJ confirmed that the relevant CPOMS entry for this particular interaction consisted of the notes she made whilst listening to what she was being told and was equally clear that in  making her notes she had accurately recorded both the substance of what was said as well as the sequence in which matters had been raised.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">The accuracy of the sequence of the matters raised was confirmed by SJ in her oral evidence and therefore I can be confident that confidentiality was uppermost in the mind of Penny at the outset.  However it continues  to remain unclear as to which of the two girls then present had actually said what.  According to SJ this was because Penny, initially at least, struggled to speak and so asked if Chris could speak for her.  Thereafter Chris provided most of the information which was noted down but accompanied either by assents from Penny as to its accuracy or what were noted in the CPOMs as corrections but which, in her oral evidence, SJ redefined as more accurately being additions to what Chris was saying.  SJ said that Chris would often initiate a sentence which Penny would then complete.  However SJ was clear that whether information came from either Chris or Penny, Penny was present throughout and actively participating in the information provision that was going on.  I was not given the impression from SJ&#8217;s evidence that Penny was disowning anything that Chris was saying but accepting and adding where necessary to what was being said on her behalf.  Penny, in my view, undoubtedly &#8216;owned&#8217; the content of the information.  This view is supported by SJ agreeing with the view expressed that Chris and Penny were, to adopt the parlance of teenage girls, &#8216;BFFs&#8217; (Best Friends Forever), a term which, whilst it may not accurately reflect the actual longevity of a friendship, infers a depth of connection and mutuality of mindset which marks it out as a different relationship than is expected by reason simply of membership of the same &#8216;friendship group&#8217;. It is my general understanding of such matters that a BFF can speak with authority about the inner thoughts of their fellow BFF.  They tend to have a closeness which stems from a deep friendship.</p>

This had apparently all started during the previous July. Allegedly Penny when at home was described as being fat and her family (apparently including not only her parents and brothers but also her cousins) were in the habit of showing her pictures of herself when she was younger and unfavourably contrasting her appearance then with now.  It was claimed that not only was Penny not eating, which was impacting upon her mood and making her feel sleepy and unable to concentrate, but that this self-denial was known and even supported by her parents. Penny was becoming angry with herself when she did eat but M had then added to this self-pressure by complaining, when Penny recently purchased (whether or not she ate) a packet of Bourbon biscuits, that Penny was going to gain weight. It was stated (whether by Penny or Chris) that all that Penny was regularly consuming at that time was coffee or an electrolyte drink.</p>

It was further said that F&#8217;s behaviour was worse as whilst M did beat them occasionally she more frequently only screamed at them.  Recently sticks [plural] had been used and Penny thought that Alan may have bruises on his back.  Penny said that she currently had no bruises but that she did not get the majority of the beatings as they go to her brothers because they are in trouble at school all the time.  These beatings had been going on for as long as Penny could remember.  Two specific examples were given of occasions of assault.  It was alleged that a belt had been used on Penny when she stopped the playing of loud music at home.  More recently David had been beaten with a belt on his birthday because he had been naughty.</p>

At the same time all three children, not just Penny, were being told that their very existence had ruined their parents&#8217; lives, that Penny acted as though she was autistic and that she compared unfavourably to the children of friends or other students at the school.  </p>

In her evidence at the final hearing SJ was clear about what training she had received and demonstrated clear knowledge of the importance of allowing a person to speak rather than directing their conversation, of making a note of what was being said as soon after the episode as was practicable,  if not at the time, and of recording the circumstances and state of the speaker.  When asked about why she, as a less experienced professional, did not attempt to secure the presence of a more experienced or qualified colleague when first made aware that something of importance to Penny was going to be said SJ replied that the policy of the school was to prioritise the opportunity for the individual to speak rather than to stop them whilst such arrangements were put in place and in doing so risk losing the information or impacting the moment when a person had chosen to speak.  </p>

The entry of SJ&#8217;s account onto CPOMS automatically sent an alert to her and she communicated with TP, the Deputy Head, and also emailed DD, the Deputy Designated Safeguarding Lead, who happened to be working from home that day. Notwithstanding her absence from school DD contacted Careline who advised that until further notice neither Penny nor her brothers should be allowed to leave the premises at the end of the school day.</p>

During that time when all three children were together CK with LB decided to speak with them about the matters raised by Penny. It is not clear from her evidence why CK considered this to have been either necessary or appropriate as Penny had already given a full account of what she said was happening and had emphasised, repeatedly, that she did not wish her brothers or her parents to be made aware of what she had said.  It is not difficult to see how putting all three children together and directly raising Penny&#8217;s concerns was more likely to produce that which Penny was against rather than upholding her confidentiality. It was at best ill-advised and at worst reckless.  Be that as it may this is what occurred.  To compound matters CK, in her oral evidence, accepted that there was no contemporaneous notes taken of anything said by any of the children at the time because, despite being in an office in a school, neither CK nor LB could find a pen and paper to use.  No thought appeared to have been given of trying to make a digital record using, for example, a mobile phone or a laptop.  Although there is an entry in the CPOMS system, the input date shows that what was uploaded was not put there until Monday 16 October at 15:54, some three days afterwards.</p>

The next topic of conversation was whether they had any marks on their bodies.  In her oral evidence CK indicated that she raised this because it was an issue Careline had flagged up with DD and in her CPOMS entry a further justification was in case any first aid needed to be administered.  In the event negative answers were given to that question by all three children.  Some small talk then followed and it was noted that the boys were as monosyllabic when talking about topics which were of interest to them as they had been when answering those earlier questions.  Alan was asked about some bruising to his hands to which he replied that they had sustained while playing sport and was either ignorant about or unwilling to explain the cause of what appeared to be a ripped hole in his blazer.  </p>

It probably did not assist when Penny was informed by CK, possibly after her seeking the promise noted above, that such a promise could not be given but that help and support would be available.

In fact there is no record of the same and I can only conclude that DD was either misinformed or confused about this.  </p>

The document in question is, regrettably, of limited use as it was not a statement containing a statement of truth but a letter, albeit which described itself as a court report, which was not written until one month later on 17 November 2023 and conflated a number of different matters which had occurred by that date.</p>

Chris was described as having being present during the initial disclosures made to SJ only as &#8216;moral support&#8217; when the reality was that Chris was in fact a joint provider of information.  The process of the capturing of all that Penny wished to say reads not only as if it were a single incident involving only staff from school but is described by DD as being a process of information provision &#8216;without any questions being asked.&#8217;  The reality however, as DD would have been well aware, was that Penny&#8217;s full account was given over several different occasions, most of which DD was both present at and involved in, which involved staff from school, social services and a police officer.  It would not be unfair to say that far from being a considered and accurate statement containing a carefully compiled record of accurate information, DD&#8217;s document is more aptly described as an error-strewn summation and as will be seen below, whilst not reflecting anything approaching good principles of information collection and preservation was a good fit with the general approach taken to these important matters throughout these proceedings.</p>

In fact it was Alan who had hand bruising but who had attributed this to having been trodden on whilst playing sport.  There was a link made with an apparent episode when David was in primary school and had refused to get changed for a swimming lesson and one more recently when David had not wished to remove his school blazer before playing basketball.   Both of those events may well have occurred but neither, let alone both, should automatically have caused DD to have &#8216;theorised&#8217; that in acting so David might have been attempting to conceal injuries.  </p>

Further DD, when asked, advised that Penny had disclosed that all three children are struck upon the hands and sometimes on the back and on other areas of the body.  However this is not what had been recorded by SJ and, if it had been later told to DD, there is no record of that statement anywhere.  Confusingly the Minutes of the Strategy Meeting &#8220;confirmed&#8221; (the word associated with DD) that Alan and David were spoken to by school staff about disclosures made on 16 October, which did not accord with when the boys were actually spoken to, and they record that neither boy disclosed that they had been hit by either parent. Whilst that may not be inaccurate in that neither child did disclose being struck, it fails to fully and accurately describe the exchanges which would have shown that each boy had indicated that they had no marks on their body, that they were happy in themselves and at home with their parents and also that they were generally monosyllabic about all matters, including subjects in which they were interested.  Finally DD opined that Penny may feel the need to protect her younger siblings whereas the exchanges Penny had had with SJ, with CK and with DD herself was not about the need to protect the boys but about wanting to ensure that no one, whether her parents or her brothers, was made aware that she had said what she had said.</p>

That Penny had indicated that her attempts at weight loss had begun three months before in July does not seem to have been referenced.  Penny&#8217;s parents were referred to as being supportive of her attempts at weight loss and did not challenge Penny if she chose to skip meals.  It is not at all clear where this information came from as it is not recorded anywhere nor , at this point in time, had either parent been spoken to about any matters under review. It would be wrong to say that DD had been misleading in that Strategy Meeting but it would be fair to say that, as a result of what in fact was either DD&#8217;s willingness to speculate or her failure to ensure she provided accurate information, there was significant confusion and consequent misdirection.</p>

When challenged during the final hearing about the pro-active stance she had been taking up to that point as well as her inaccurate comments within the Strategy Meeting DD was clear that she had not overstepped the boundary between a professional concern and a personal investment in a particular theory of what was actually happening in the family home.  Whilst I do not doubt that DD believed that she was acting in what she thought was a protective mode towards the child consistent with her safeguarding role in the school, she appeared to have formed a view which, on more considered reflection, may not have been congruent with the evidence then available.  This, in my judgement, is exemplified by the following entry from CPOMS timed and dated at 12:02 on 19 October, therefore immediately after the Strategy Meeting, where it is recorded that &#8216;[DD] shared concerns from School POV [point of view] Boys current unwillingness to disclose.&#8217;</p>

Insofar as there was any discussion about how matters would be managed it appeared to focus upon the sensitivity which would be required in addressing this issue with a teenage girl.  Whilst DCS was aware of the issue of physical chastisement she saw the purpose of the visit as being simply to get to know the child and so better understand her.  There was no criminal investigation at the time and therefore, as she explained, DCS was present but not in order to lead any questioning of the children. DCS was  participating as more than a mere observer but, as the key allegation had been one of physical assault as opposed to sexual abuse, this was not a matter where the police would take control.</p>

Once CD and AB arrived DD came to see them all but there was no separate conversation between DD and DCS until close to the conclusion of the visit. According to DCS the social workers arrived at 15:30 but Penny was not brought to where the three of them had been put until 15:50.  What was said and done in those twenty minutes of shared company and the start of discussions with Penny is wholly unclear.  AB recalled in her evidence there being a &#8216;brief chat&#8217; before Penny was brought in but could give no details as to what was said or by whom.  From what has been recorded it seems clear that the discussions which took place did not involve any planning as to how the discussions with the children would be structured, what issues were to be discussed and who would take responsibility for what.  In her evidence to the court DCS was clear that AB took the lead in questioning each of the children, CD asked the odd question whilst DCS herself &#8216;filled in the blanks.&#8217;  In contrast, AB&#8217;s evidence was that CD took the lead in asking the questions of each child whilst AB made handwritten but not verbatim notes of what was being said and DCS did not ask many questions at all.  CD however had a third explanation for what had happened as her evidence was that AB did not take the lead in questioning the children but that it was a shared affair with both social workers asking questions on an alternating basis whilst DCS asked questions about the allegation that the children had been hit.</p>

When challenged on this point at the final hearing both witnesses were very clear that neither had copied the other but that the core VOC material had been created from their joint endeavours that afternoon and they had jointly entered it onto the social services records.  As such when each was directed to file a statement as to what had taken place each immediately accessed that record to ensure that they provided the most accurate information. The statements were dated 15 and 16 November 2023, nearly a month after the events in question, which is significant when it is remembered that this type of exercise was a common aspect of each social worker&#8217;s responsibilities and which they were required to do on numerous occasions. The opportunity for accurate recall would obviously diminish as each new similar exercise was undertaken and details of different &#8216;interviews&#8217; began to overlay each other.</p>

It was apparently the policy of the local authority to be paperless and written material was regularly destroyed in pursuit of that aim. Unlike the school it was not part of the policy operated by the social services to defer destruction until after any paper notes had been scanned into the system and so preserved.  As a result the only record of any direct information given by a child was lost and in its place a mediated record was created, not intended at distorting what had been said but not being able to be claimed as a contemporaneous note either. Whilst being paperless is a laudable aim in these environmentally conscious times, destroying notes without first uploading them may not necessarily be the most helpful way forward in terms of the preservation of best evidence.</p>

Notwithstanding her extensive involvement to date with regard to Penny and the views she was forming about what she believed had happened and was really going on with regard to all three children it seems clear that DD was a presence throughout Penny&#8217;s interview, if not the others.  At the outset it appeared that Penny was asked about the presence of DD but no one appears to have given any thought as to whether a child was likely to opt for the exclusion of a senior member of the school staff, particularly when that staff member was in the room at the time.  The proper course of action would have been to ask in a neutral fashion whether the child would like to have that person to join them. This was not done.</p>

F uses either a belt or a stick whilst M uses a hangar or just screams at them.  The belt, if applied, is one F would be wearing and if a stick is used it will be thrown away afterwards.  The children are only hit on the palms of their hands but on each hand.  This most recent occurrence of the administration of physical chastisement had happened to Penny in September when the children were with F but he walked off and they then could not find him.  F telephoned them to locate them, collected them and took them home where he proceeded to hit them each on their hands with his belt.  M witnessed this episode but did not interfere.  Penny stated that no child leaves the room when another is being hit as this would only get the departing child into more trouble.  Penny confirmed that she had never had injuries as a result of this treatment.  In addition it was recorded that Penny referred to being called fat by her parents who then forbade her from eating.  Penny would then not eat for days, instead only drinking coffee and as a result would then be unable to sleep and would worry about school and her future exams.  Penny was very concerned about her parents or her brothers discovering that she had raised these matters and felt so concerned as to want to sit in a separate room away from her brothers after she had spoken to the professionals.</p>

This happened probably every two weeks and stemmed from misbehaviour or an infringement at school.  All three children would be beaten.  Whilst such punishments would hurt Penny said that she had no injuries.  Each parent had observed the other hitting the children and raised no objection.  In addition to the belts and sticks M had used a hangar which she would use anywhere on the body.  Penny said that the school had seen bruises to one of her brothers as he was wearing shorts but the children would be hit on the hands.  When her brothers were being beaten Penny would leave to go and get a shower.  Penny said that the most recent incident had occurred approximately a week prior when the boys had been hit by F following their being told to leave a gym they were attending. Penny did not watch the whole thing once they were home as she went to get a shower. One final point was that Penny was worried about school tests.</p>

David did say that he could on occasions act aggressively by hitting or kicking a wall in school but when this happened F would only ever speak with him.

F signed a Contract of Expectations which stipulated no physical chastisement and agreed to allow home visits when these concerns would be discussed with social services.

Upon being made aware of the allegations which had been raised she, like F, had denied any physical chastisement and had restated their agreed parenting policy of confiscating electronic devices as their preferred sanction.  M also consented to an agreement prohibiting physical chastisement and committed to working with social services.  She then travelled home.</p>

According to Penny F, who was at home with the children whilst M was still in work, had then thrown away Penny&#8217;s sim card, removed her phone, told her she should go to live with E or her cousins, said that he would claim that she has &#8216;depression/mental illness&#8217;, alleged that Penny had made it all up &#8211; which she refuted doing within the email - was banging on tables and threatening never to forgive her for this, was swearing at her, removed her laptop (which she then took back later that night) and &#8216;showed documentaries of people being abused in foster homes and adoption centres&#8217; and would not allow her to speak with anyone or come near her.</p>

His evidence was that upon M returning home they had spoken with Penny alone who had told them that Chris had made the allegations of chastisement.  F denied reacting as described by Penny but confirmed that he had removed her phone as it had messages from Chris on it and had replaced it with a phone which allowed telephone calls but not access to social media.  He never removed her laptop nor told her to leave the family or that he would never forgive her.  His evidence was that he was not angry but disappointed in what she had caused to happen.  In respect of the allegation about Penny  seeing videos concerning children in foster homes he denied making her watch anything but did say that he had used his own laptop to research the effect upon being fostered on children&#8217;s life chances and that some of that research involved YouTube videos.  Whilst he had watched those videos he had not made Penny view them, albeit she may have seen them from an adjoining room.</p>

The response from Careline was to agree that there had been a breach of the Contract of Expectations due to emotional harm having been displayed the previous evening.  It should be noted that the agreement at that point was only in relation to physical chastisement, there was no mention of emotional harm.  DD was clear that she was unhappy at the prospect of Penny being allowed to go home from school that evening and as a result an Out of Hours&#8217; (OOH) visit was to be set up for that evening in order to check upon Penny&#8217;s welfare and allow the possibility of an organised departure from the family at that point if considered necessary.  On that basis Penny was allowed to leave the school for the weekend.</p>

At that time Penny was with her brothers at their F&#8217;s office feeling somewhat isolated and upset with her situation but not otherwise in any harm. The failed attempt at a visit on the Friday evening lead to a further OOH visit on the Saturday evening when the children were at home, along with F, and were separately spoken with by AB, who happened to be on duty and had attended the school a couple of days earlier.  The record of that evening paints a picture of two monosyllabic boys who, insofar as they said very little, again gave no indication of anything untoward happening within the family.  Penny&#8217;s position was different in that whilst she indicated that no chastisement had taken place she re-affirmed what she said had happened on Thursday evening.  Thereafter Penny&#8217;s only response was to say that she was fine whilst her body language, as noted by AB, suggested she was anxious, wary and distinctly unhappy being at home.</p>

The gulf between her and her brothers and her and her parents was showing no signs of narrowing but the email did not indicate a child who felt in fear of retribution as opposed to one who felt thoroughly miserable with how everything was now panning out.</p>

In addition, DD identified that there had been attempts by the school to secure the parents&#8217; permission for David to be assessed for SEN, including a letter from the Headteacher sent on 22 September which had apparently been ignored.  DD went on to describe the parents in unflattering terms. F, she said, spoke disparagingly of his children and could be verbally aggressive whilst M had been requested by the Headteacher to apologise to a Receptionist for how she had spoken to that individual.  Whilst there was no requirement on DD to substantiate those matters at that point in time it is only right to say that no evidence in support of any of them has been adduced in these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">Penny was then spoken to by PR.  In her oral evidence PR, like AB and CD, was clear that in speaking with Penny she was engaged in an interview in any formal sense. PR was clear that  she had not prepared for this engagement as such and was, to some extent, playing catch-up as she had been appointed as the allocated social worker only that morning and even on arrival at the school was receiving additional emails from DD.  The purpose of this meeting was simply to introduce herself to Penny and to get to know her.  That may have been the basis upon which PR expected matters to be proceed but it would appear that Penny had a different view.  According to PR&#8217;s case note immediately upon sitting down with PR Penny began to describe an event on 8 October when her brothers had been excluded from the gym and taken home by the father, whereupon he had gone to an unidentified part of the house where sticks were apparently kept, procured one and returned with it and proceeded to hit each of the boys on the palms of their hands an unknown number of times.  Penny recalled that these actions left no marks on the boys&#8217; hands but caused them to cry.  No other specific allegations were highlighted within that conversation but it was made clear that this behaviour, primarily but not exclusively the province of F, had been on-going since Penny was &#8216;little&#8217;.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in">The following day at 15:00 PR returned to school accompanied by another social worker, FH.  Prior to going to the school the two social workers had already visited F at his office for the purpose of securing his consent to Penny&#8217;s accommodation in foster care.  That decision had apparently been taken following a Legal Meeting held by the Local Authority in the morning and communicated to the school by PR around 13:00.  The purpose of coming to the school was to speak to the children.  Other than to communicate with Penny the decision to remove her to foster care if parental consent was obtained, it is not immediately apparent why a further meeting with Penny was required.  Since 13 October Penny had spoken about her situation at home with four different members of staff at school and three different social workers  and in AB&#8217;s case on two occasions, once in school and once at home.  According to his written evidence prepared for these proceedings, FH&#8217;s role was to see each child separately in order to &#8216;ascertain their wishes and feelings and gain an understanding of their lived experiences at home.&#8217;  That is a surprising statement.  Like Penny, Alan and David had been spoken to several times by different individuals without deviating from their initial position of being happy at home, not harbouring marks on their bodies and being unconcerned about any question of physical chastisement.  Penny had made clear her position, had added some details at some points but had been singular in expressing a recurring desire for people to speak as little as possible to her brothers and even less to her parents.  </p>

Again, the decision to add not just a further occasion of conversation but a new person to do so is one which was never sufficiently reasoned in either social worker&#8217;s evidence.  Like all those who had preceded him FH was clear that this was not an interview and no focused preparation had been undertaken for this task.  In his evidence FH thought that there might have been a conversation between himself and PR if he was correct in his recollection that they had travelled together from F&#8217;s office to school.  Vague as he was about any preparation, FH was at least aware that allegations had been made and he also appeared to have some knowledge of what they concerned although he was admirably candid in confirming that he had spoken with neither AB nor CD prior to undertaking this task.  It should be added here that PR had similarly not spoken to her colleagues prior to her own conversation with Penny the day before, not least because of the shortness of time between allocation of role and the undertaking of work.</p>

For the purpose of this judgment it is unnecessary to repeat verbatim what FH wrote down.  It is fair to record that there are words used which suggest that these are the words used by each child but FH himself was clear in his evidence that this was not intended as a verbatim record nor was one.</p>

Both parents had sought either legal or community advice and each has in their oral evidence on this point accused the Local Authority of effectively telling them at the time that they needed to give their consent, irrespective of any contrary views they held.  It must follow that the Local Authority have been equally robust in refuting any suggestion of seeking to strong arm either parent and that all steps were taken properly and with due respect to parental rights.</p>

This arrangement may have maintained the family&#8217;s partial unity but has come at a very high cost to the parents&#8217; reserves of patience and goodwill and has created significant pressure upon them.  It is right to describe both parents as reserved and private people, M especially so, and living with strangers who were constantly monitoring your movements, questioning where you are going and being an unwelcome presence as they tried to care for the children has been a feat of endurance for them.

For the purpose of this judgment I have reviewed the interview more than once.  In it Penny references the use of being hit with a belt on multiple occasions and one of her brothers being hit with a stick on one occasion.  Penny describes an occasion when a hangar was used to hit her on the hands by her mother on a Thursday in June in 2021.  She also describes a specific occasion when F hit her with a belt for asking him if he would turn off the music he was playing very loudly. This had occurred at some unspecified point but prior to 2022.  In addition Penny gave a further date of 3 September as an occasion when all three children had been hit by F with a belt following their becoming separated from him whilst out in the city centre.  Finally there was a reference to an occasion when the boys were hit following a visit to a gym and how they had been made to assume a kneeling position with their hands in the air.  This was a position that Penny too had been required to adopt in times past and on more occasions than she had in fact been hit.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Firstly, there is a significant degree of inconsistency between what was said in the ABE interview and earlier accounts given to school staff or social workers.  The Gym incident, apparently dated by Penny as having occurred on 8 October 2023 provides a good example.  The Gym incident is not referred to in the account given to SJ, instead what Penny recalls is David being hit on his birthday (28 September) even though Penny was speaking with SJ only 5 days after the date later given.  The Gym incident is referred to on 19 October but is only noted by DCS as it does not feature at all in the note prepared by AB and CD.  DCS has noted it being described as the most recent incident of assault but involving only the boys and Penny not staying to fully witness what occurred as she left to get a shower.  On the same occasion the note prepared by AB and CD reports Penny as having said that no one leaves when another child is being hit as this would only make matters worse.  On that day the boys were hit with a belt several times according to DCS.  When the same incident is recounted to PR on 23 October both boys were hit with a stick which F had retrieved from another part of the house, where he keeps sticks, however in the same interview only Penny is hit by a stick which is taken from the garden but not on that occasion whilst the boys are hit with belts except that a stick has been used on one occasion for one of the boys.  The stress position is not referred to at all until 24 October when it is noted by FH but in her interview it is now deployed as part of the Gym incident, having never previously been included when that episode has been described, and Penny recalls seeing the boys adopting that position on that occasion, either before or after being a belt, not a stick, is not made clear save that previously they were hit, cried and were sent to their rooms so the extended use of the stress position may not fit with that earlier narrative.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Of equal importance as a caveat is how Penny gave her evidence.  This is not an issue about demeanour and whether veracity can be inferred from how she sat, spoke or moved.  I draw no inferences from the physicality of Penny in the interview suit.  What was clear from the interview was how hard the interviewer had to work to extract from Penny the information which she did.  During submissions counsel for the father highlighted a number of occasions when the interviewer, clearly an experienced and trained individual according to her qualifications and experience set out in the report filed, appeared to be deploying suggestive questioning.  It is perfectly proper to make that submission given the importance of adherence to the ABE guidelines, of which see below, but having reviewed the interview on more than one occasion it is clear to me that what the interviewer was seeking to do was not to lead the witness but to attempt to coax from her any information at all.  The interview is a painful watch of a young person either deeply reluctant to say anything or feeling highly unsure of what she was going to say.  The stress position reference above is a good example.  But for the prompting provided by the interviewer I am reasonably confident that this detail would not have been mentioned. The interview was over halfway through and had proceeded at a very slow pace as Penny was frequently confusing both herself and the interviewer with what she meant.  It was the interviewer, as noted in the report, who said that Penny had referenced being made to kneel by both of her parents before then adding it to her description of the Gym Incident.  </p>

However given that it was Penny has raised these matters and Penny who has been consistent that these were frequent, regularly occurring punishments which caused hurt it is not unreasonable to expect that they would be matters she felt able to explain without what appeared to be significant hesitation, confusion and reluctance.  This view is only underlined by the numerous previous accounts given and is not affected by the quality of how those occasions were recorded.  If Penny has had multiple opportunities to explain these matters and has done so on several occasions, sometimes to individuals with whom she was wholly unfamiliar, it is surprising the degree of reticence and unfamiliarity she demonstrated in her ABE interview.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">These proceedings are care proceedings and so ultimately governed by the operation of the Children Act 1989 with its focus upon the welfare of the subject child/ren.  However in order to establish that welfare jurisdiction it must first be proved that the threshold for state intervention has been crossed.  That threshold is set out in s.31 of the Children Act and is that a child either has suffered or is likely to suffer, without such intervention, significant harm which is attributable to parental care (whether by commission or omission).  Therefore the primary issue is an evidential one and the question is whether the Local Authority, who must establish the necessary evidential foundation, can prove on the balance of probabilities that the children (or any of them) have suffered significant harm because of what their parents have done or failed to do. It follows that initially any focus on the law must be upon the legal principles involved in the determination of factual matters.  Fortunately there is considerable assistance available from settled and familiar authorities which allows for a succinct summary in respect of general principles.</p>

SJ deserves commendation in several respects: for her conspicuous attention to following the proper process in ensuring that Penny and Chris could give her their information; how she set herself to receive it; her notation of the same, how she ensured that she played as little a role in the mediation of the information as possible; her record-keeping in immediately uploading it to CPOMS and  the separate but swift uploading of her notes. In addition, having properly discharged her safeguarding responsibilities she resisted the temptation to involve herself further but maintained a professional but appropriate manner towards a clearly unhappy child.  Penny could not have had a better foundation for the matters she wished to raise.</p>

Although it could be said that Penny &#8216;owned&#8217; the record which was produced through her continuous presence, her active participation in the conversation and her apparent willingness to guide or even correct Chris in her own comments, some blurring of the lines was an inevitable consequence of Chris&#8217; participation.  Had Chris simply been present for &#8216;moral support&#8217; as (mistakenly) stated by DD then this would not have been the case.  However if the alternative option of silencing Chris would have resulted in either no record of occurrence or a very limited one if Penny, without Chris&#8217; assistance would have been unlikely to say anything, then SJ undoubtedly made the right choice in deciding that something is better than nothing, even if that something then comes with blurred lines.  In my judgement SJ was right to allow the girls collectively to talk and she is not to be faulted in how she coped with that situation.</p>

Given that SJ had spoken only with Penny (and Chris) and a detailed record taken of all that had been said two matters should have been immediately apparent.  First it was clear that nothing had been said by Alan and David so it should have been obvious to CK later in the afternoon that she needed to ensure that nothing was said to Alan and David until a situation could be arranged where a planned and prepared conversation could take place.   Secondly, Penny having spoken at length it should have been a headline thought for CK that any further conversation with Penny should be avoided if at all possible and certainly nothing should be allowed to happen whilst Penny was in the company of either of her brothers. In fact in each case the converse happened when CK together with LB spoke with the children together that very afternoon.  That error was then magnified in two respects. Not only did CK raise the wholly inappropriate issue of whether any child had evidence of injury on their body but having done so she failed to make any note of the subsequent conversation, let alone a full one, on the unacceptable ground that she had nothing to hand with which to write.   These were fundamental errors.  Having listened to her evidence I must be fair to CK and add that she undoubtedly approached matters from a pastoral point of view and in the belief that she was following appropriate instructions provided to her from Careline via DD regarding the possible presence of injuries.  Given the importance of pastoral care to CK her errors have some mitigation.  Unfortunately CK&#8217;s actions were far from the worst example of information mismanagement in the case given what was to follow.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">A strong contender in what regrettably must be regarded as a keenly contested competition for that dubious honour was DD who made a multiplicity of errors from the outset.  DD spoke with Penny in relation to the information which she had provided when there was both no need to do so and every reason not to.  The information had been harvested appropriately by SJ and DD had no reason to traverse that ground again.   The obvious steps for DD to take in order to assert control over the process would have been to introduce herself to Penny, to emphasise that what Penny had said was being acted upon and to invite her not to discuss these matters further with anyone else but to come only to her if there were further developments or if she needed to say anything else.  It was similarly obvious that clear record-keeping of any subsequent conversation which had to take place was essential and swift preservation of any information provided was equally necessary to ensure a full and reliable record could be created for any future action which was required by any relevant agency.  In fact DD&#8217;s record-keeping was poor, not only by allowing there to be unaccountable delays in putting information on the system but in the making of inaccurate and limited records which offered confusion where there should have been clarity  Furthermore it is important during the process of information gathering to retain objectivity even whilst offering sympathy and during cross-examination of this witness it was suggested to her that she had come to take not just a professional but also a personal interest in the allegations Penny was making in that she appeared to not only acknowledge them but also to accept them and even seek to champion Penny&#8217;s cause as a child who had been physically and emotionally abused. DD strongly refuted straying beyond her professional responsibilities and in my judgement this never became a personal issue for her.  However what is also clear to me is that DD lost objectivity in how she viewed Penny&#8217;s situation which caused her to go far beyond what was known and understood.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The clearest example of this was on 19 October when DD attended the Strategy Meeting convened by social services and thereafter recorded the following comment on CPOMS &#8216;[DD] shared concerns from School POV Boys current unwillingness to disclose.&#8217; In my judgement this entry encompasses a number of problems.  Firstly, DD had clearly formed a view about the veracity of Penny&#8217;s allegations at a point when there was insufficient information for any settled view to fairly be formed.  All that had occurred by that point was that Penny had raised allegations and Alan and David had not. Secondly, DD appears to have felt able to speak for &#8216;the School&#8217; which may have caused other professionals now involved to assume, wrongly, that DD&#8217;s particular view reflected the agreed view of all professionals within that school when that was not the case. Thirdly, phrasing a view that Alan and David were &#8216;unwilling to disclose&#8217; is indicative of an understanding that (a) something had occurred. (b) which was known, understood and accepted by Alan and David but (c) were reluctant to speak about what they knew.  At that point in time (and in fact as it turned out at any point in time) there was no evidence upon which to form such a view.  It is not clear when or even if DD had any interaction with Alan and / or David and therefore to suggest that she knew their minds was simply wrong.</p>

This had two consequences in that not only did it overbuild a very unclear situation into a clear case of multiple physical abuse but by so doing it accelerated a response which should have been more measured and which then created even further problems.</p>

By doing so DD not only made poor judgments about what might be happening as opposed to what the available information allowed her to conclude but presented an inaccurate and therefore inadvertently misleading position to others whose statutory responsibilities meant that they were likely to act upon the information she was providing.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">It is not unfair, in my judgement, to consider that in this case that cardinal principle was ignored completely.  From the beginning discussions with Penny about her allegations were commonplace as opposed to rare, barely a working day went by between 13 October and 24 October when these matters were not merely the subject of conversation but in fact of interrogation.  That this was so was because of the fact that it appeared to be &#8216;standard practice&#8217; (to quote from AB and CD) by social services to focus upon obtaining either &#8216;the voice of the child&#8217; or &#8216;the child&#8217;s lived experience&#8217; in successive waves as a matter of routine frequency.</p>

I have no difficulty in holding that each social worker was undoubtedly honest in their self-assessment that she did not view her actions as being part of an interview process when they went together to meet with the children on 19 October.  That honesty is matched only by their ignorance of what the proper process in fact was and, as a consequence, the magnitude of their errors.  The evidence of both was that they were undertaking what CD referred to as a &#8220;47&#8221; and it was clear to me in listening to each of them that they regarded a &#8220;47&#8221; as a routine aspect of social work practice which could be undertaken without planning, preparation or thought.  I was left with the clear impression that it never crossed either of their minds to query whether it was appropriate to obtain the voice of a child in a situation where that child had already of their own volition made serious allegations of physical abuse.  Over ground which should have had a large forensic &#8216;Keep Off&#8217; sign firmly planted on it they, like DD before them, immediately trod all over it and on that first occasion were joined in their actions by DCS.  </p>

If that had been the decision then what should have occurred would be a thorough and planned exploration of matters in appropriate detail which would be sensitively undertaken in circumstances where it could be properly and fully recorded and so preserved as a record of value.  This was far from what happened.  In fact there is no evidence that any thought was given to how this exercise would impact upon what had already been done.  The response was almost a kneejerk reaction, perhaps due to the pressure coming from the school in the form of DD, that something needed to happen.  Sending AB and CD on a routine &#8220;47&#8221; was the least helpful step which could have been taken in the circumstances.  It should have been obvious that in making the decision to talk to Penny again the odds of a problem occurring were quite short as all Penny had to do was to not the same thing as she had had SJ write down the previous week.  By opting for a VOC / &#8220;47&#8221; response Penny was inadvertently given the opportunity to sow confusion in what had been a relatively well-ordered landscape.  Unfortunately for Penny she not only took that chance, albeit no one understood that this is what had happened at the time, but did so quite significantly.</p>

That incident was not recorded by SJ and although DD referred to &#8216;new disclosures&#8217; in her follow-on conversation on 16 October she provided no detail as to what they might have referred.  On 19 October DCS noted down an occasion within the preceding eleven days when Alan and David had gone to the gym and had been excluded after fighting with each other, that F was screaming at them and when they got home was angry with them. As a result they were both hit several times on their hands with a belt, although Penny did not see it all as she went to get a shower. That was undoubtedly the Gym Incident.</p>

Even had DCS had the opportunity to read in advance all that Penny (and/or Chris) had previously said to SJ, which she was clear had not happened, that incident had not been mentioned.  It was new information.  However being new was not necessarily a problem provided it could be confirmed that this was a supplemental detail and not a developed add-on as a reaction to any mistaken but perceived need for further information.  Unfortunately this did not happen.   In order to achieve any sort of cogency with what had already been provided the person exploring the content now being provided would have had to have been aware that it was new and then to be able to tease out why it had not been referenced before when it would have been even more fresh in Penny&#8217;s memory on 13 October when she spoke with SJ, just five days after its alleged occurrence.</p>

This new information clearly contradicted that and some attempt at clarification was needed.  However DCS, AB and CD were all approaching this without that essential knowledge and, if they were not entirely blind then they were certainly acting on very limited information, and so had no possibility of recognising this issue let alone being able to explain its previous absence but now sudden presence.</p>

This was also important in the context that this was not just the second occasion when they offered this identical narrative but it was a further occasion when it could not be suggested that they were acting in self-interest or out of fear.  There was no suggestion that anyone had been alerted to the possibility that there was a problem and therefore Alan and David could not be assumed to have taken a particular line on the instructions of a parent or because of fear that they would be punished.  Unless it could be suggested that the parents had already been drilling into the children that they must never speak about matters going on at home, which was not an allegation that Penny had made, then the absence of evidence of chastisement was far more likely to be regarded as the evidence of absence of chastisement.  It was clear, again appreciated more so with hindsight, that in maintaining their stance the boys attained a double consistency in that they were in agreement not only with their previous evidence but also with each other.  The further discussion on 19 October resulted in Alan and David presenting what has to be accepted was a solid united front.</p>

This was not what occurred, in fact the opposite was true. AB, CD and DCS met for the first time in relation to <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span> at 15:30 and within 20 minutes had started to speak with <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span>.  There is no record of agreement as to their purpose, no delineation of responsibilities and no creation of a working hierarchy.  Such evidence as is available suggests that it was actually something approaching, if not a free-for-all, then a fogged operation lacking any vision or direction.  In their evidence at the final hearing all three individuals confirmed who they considered to be taking the lead and they gave three different answers. DCS said it was AB, AB said it was CD and CD said it was all three of them.  Three different approaches were simultaneously deployed in the same time and space.  In fact, no one was leading but everyone appears to have believed that either someone else had shouldered that responsibility or that they were all working together. A more confused picture is difficult to imagine and one which is unable to inspire any confidence in what was produced.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Fourthly and separately from the lack of clear leadership was the quality of notetaking. As is now clear no one complete note was taken by any individual.  Unfortunately this did not mean that between the three of them the whole ground was covered but only that key details were missed as the absence of an organised structure rendered that possible. The details captured by DCS on the one hand and by AB and CD on the other are different in material respects. One clear example, as noted above, is DCS&#8217;s noting of what I have referred to as the Gym Incident but it&#8217;s complete absence from what was finally produced by AB and CD.  That absence creates two problems.  Firstly, it renders suspect the accuracy of the entirety of the social workers&#8217; note because they missed an entire episode of chastisement and raises questions about their focus and what they were trying to achieve.  Secondly when, as later occurred, there is a significant variation in the same account &#8211; by the substitution of a stick for a belt and the introduction of the use of the stress position &#8211; it raises questions about the accuracy of each account provided and which one is meant to be correct.  Had it been the case that two accounts given on the same day were correctly noted it might have offered an answer to the question of how competing accounts could do other than cancel each other out.</p>

To continue the gardening analogy a little further.  The ground which had been so properly treated on 13 October by SJ had then been roughed up on the ensuing days before being thoroughly trampled all over on 19 October by AB and CD was finally wrecked on 23 and 24 October when <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span> re-described the Gym Incident and how it had resulted in F hitting both boys with a stick which he had retrieved from a different part of the house. On this occasion <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span> described the stick&#8217;s length and thickness and described how the boys had had to stand to be hit.

As already referenced above in my judgement this was not the failing of the interviewer being casual about the proper limitations of her role and being unaware of the importance of working at all times to enable the interviewee to give their own evidence through their own voice.  Insofar as there were criticisms levelled at the process during the trial I do not align myself with them.  This was a difficult interview to conduct because the interviewee was attempting to distance herself from what was expected of her.  The result was that <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span> appeared confused, unsure and even at times perplexed.

In that tradition children are taught a particular way of participating in reception of a sacrament which mirrored what was being demonstrated by <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span>. It struck me as being unexpected that parents who are undoubtedly devout in their faith would, were they so minded to assault their children, have them adopt a posture associated not just associated with their faith which is of particular significance to be point of being sacral.  It does not follow, of course, that this cannot be the case but in my view it renders it less rather than more likely.</p>

However in my judgement factual findings depend upon more than a superficially well-crafted tale frequently told.  It cannot be assumed that simple repetition of an account is itself evidence of veracity.  The mere fact that someone tells the same tale on more than one occasion or even on every occasion does not of itself automatically equate to a reason why they should be believed.  Similarly, the inclusion of details such as a particular location, the presence of a specific individual or of chronological details such as a day or even a date cannot of themselves amount to evidence that it must have happened that way.  Concocted stories require some detail in order to give them any form of credibility and a lie once told must be repeated on each occasion thereafter if the original purpose of the lie is to be sustained.  The provision of detail can only be regarded as a factor in determining credibility if at least some of those details can thereafter be corroborated.  For example, I have no issue in basing a view as to veracity upon matters asserted which are then shown to be true, such as the presence of an individual in the place where s/he was alleged to have been at the time or the occurrence of an event on a date claimed which turns out to be true but mere expression of a detail alone is not of particular assistance, certainly in this case.  </p>

Evidence which includes experiential detail may well incline a questioning mind towards a finding that it occurred.  I was unable in <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span>&#8217;s interview to discern any evidence of that nature but instead saw all of the difficulties identified above.</p>

Insofar as the multiple failings in the recording and reporting of <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span>&#8217;s evidence may account for its variability the same flawed process applied, albeit with less frequency, to Alan and David&#8217;s too and contradictions and confusions were not the result. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The boys&#8217; evidence was consistent as to the absence of assaults and contained many positives about their parents.  But it is not the case that the boys have only made positive comments about their parents or about life generally. Each made their own complaints about life at home, getting punished, what they did not like and what happened when things went wrong.  Neither made any allegation of physical assault.  As stated at the outset of this judgment this is a case as much about Alan and David as about <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Penny</span>.  Courts make decisions based upon the relevance and cogency of the evidence, not according to its quantities. A judge does not weigh evidence the way a teller counts votes and decides that there is more of it in favour of an outcome rather than against.  Courts are not democratic institutions whereby simple majorities are the basis for a decision.  Simply because I have two children who have steadfastly refused to join in the allegations made by their older sibling no more means that Penny cannot be correct as it does that she must be disbelieved because she is outnumbered. It is not a 2 v 1 situation. What is relevant here is not that there are two children who are not agreeing with a third but that those two children have had several opportunities to break their code of silence and also complain about the treatment which they have allegedly been receiving for an extended time and thereby put a stop to the assaults.  They have never taken it.</p>

I can only assume that they are not disclosing saying anything because they have nothing to speak about. Their monosyllabic exchanges in mid-October were being interpreted as them being guarded or wary about what was happening.  There is another explanation.  Little was being said by them not just because that is their style but also because they were unable to comment on matters about which they knew nothing.  Neither child took any opportunity to disclose body marks, to indicate some unhappiness or give any professional any reason to believe that there was something which they needed to say.  Either two senior school age children successfully stonewalled a series of professionals or the position they have maintained over now several months that they have never been assaulted is the only truth that they can say.  On their own evidence alone I am inclined towards that conclusion.</p>

That is not unexpected.  It is also right to say that M, in particular, did not assist herself by demonstrating just how reserved, private and fixed she is in relation to what she considers to be matters beyond the proper remit of the court.  This was most neatly demonstrated not in answers to questions but in relation to the necessity for her to have to return to court to conclude her evidence when time simply ran out on the day earmarked for her evidence.  M was clear that she could not return to court by reason of her work commitments and even stated that she would miss a family funeral rather than rearrange her professional commitments. M appeared to be demonstrating either an apparent unwillingness or ability to accept that sometimes despite best efforts plans do not hold up and changes have to be made.  It appeared to demonstrate remarkable inflexibility and to some of the advocates this was also taken as a clear indication of a lack of respect to the court.  </p>

The issue arose in the context of M having indicated that her children did not engage in sleepovers unless she (and presumably F) not only knew with whom the child was staying, where the child would be staying, neither of which are unreasonable, but also what were the morals, characters and values of the family in question.  Unless it was the case that other children were raised in families which shared the parents&#8217; views and values then a sleepover would not happen, either at another house or with those other children coming to their house.

The undisputed evidence of the children&#8217;s excellent educational records, including faultless attendance, which brings with it significant opportunities for professional scrutiny of the children and the care being afforded to them.

In refuting what their daughter was saying neither parent sought to portray themselves as perfect and M, in particular, acknowledged the issues she had been having with her teenaged daughter who was seeking autonomy in difficult, potentially high conflict areas such as the use of make-up and the interest in boys.

In my judgement it sets out a situation of a very bemused but angry father who was trying to understand what had been going on and why he was suddenly finding himself having to deal with social services concerned about physical chastisement which he knew was not happening.  Without wishing to descend into colloquialisms the impression that I received from reading both this email and the one Penny sent on Saturday 21 October at 18:13 was of a father who had gone &#8216;ballistic&#8217; when he had sat his daughter to understand what had happened.  It was not helped by the fact that Alan and David had probably without concern or care simply told their father on the way home what had been happening in school and the conversations they had had with the social workers.  Whilst I must accept that I am speculating it seems clear to me that it was not difficult for F to quickly understand that his sons knew nothing about anything which left Penny as the oldest and most articulate in the best position to clear up what he assumed had been a big misunderstanding.  When he found out that the source was Penny he was initially a very angry and unhappy father who initially having difficulty in coming to terms with a very serious matter which his daughter had generated without any thought as to the consequences.  </p>

Had matters been as Penny described it is difficult to understand why such inflammatory behaviour failed to trigger the otherwise standard reaction of several years.  The fear of being accused of hitting your child was not one the parents needed to trouble themselves with because they were already accused of it.</p>

Not unlike multiple families in this day and age.  I do not doubt that Penny&#8217;s phone was confiscated, probably on the spot.  More perplexing until F gave his evidence was the reference to watching videos about foster children&#8217;s negative experiences.  F explained that he did some research on the evening of 19 October to properly understand the consequences of being in foster care.  I have no doubt that he did that but I am equally sure that having identified some unattractive information about some children&#8217;s experiences he was only too willing to share that with (in his eyes) wayward daughter who at that point in time was far from the apple of his eye.  Neither parent was seeking to intimidate or threaten Penny but they wanted to show her just what sort of a hornets&#8217; nest she had managed to stumble into and to do so in a way which would encourage her to shut this matter down as soon as possible.  The email of 21 October records that view as part of the conversation F was now having with Penny.</p>

Whilst there is no definition of &#8216;significant&#8217; in the Children Act 1989 there is ample authority that it must be more than harm and be a matter which justifiably allows intervention by the state into private family rights.  What has happened in this case is that parents have reacted to discovering a tale that their teenage daughter had told, whether all of her own invention or with assistance, for reasons which would require too much speculation and when faced with the reality of professional involvement and significant concern being expressed have reacted badly but neither disproportionately nor in any way which threatened </span>Penny<span style="color:#000000"> or made her objectively unsafe.  That is clear from how she concludes her second email sent on the Saturday night.

In her final statement it was no more than hinted at when M asserted that &#8216;They seem to think that as we are an African family the allegations of child abuse must be true.&#8217;  However in her oral evidence M was far more direct.  The family as a whole had been treated differently by this local authority because they were black (M&#8217;s own description) and by different M was clear that she meant unfairly.  The basis for this assertion is that M claimed to be aware that different local authorities have acted differently in terms of either not removing a child or not imposing the stringent supervision they had had to accept.  Furthermore M felt that the level of supervision which had been posed and the closeness with which it had been applied were directly as a result of negative racial overtones.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">I have no doubt that all members of this family have experienced differential treatment in their lives. Their lived experience in a range of day-to-day activities, whether at work, in school, in some social gatherings or simply in fulfilling the requirements of daily life, will have been mediated through the colour of their skin and the perceptions, whether arising from prejudice, ignorance, falsehood or simply lack of appreciation, which flow from that obvious visual difference. To assume otherwise is to ignore the reality of life even in times now removed from decades where racism was both more public, more popular and more tolerated.  However despite accepting the fact that racial discrimination, however subtle a form it may take, is regrettably and unacceptably alive and kicking in twenty first century England I have no doubt that this Local Authority has not been practicing it in this case.  Although I am highly critical of much of what this Local Authority has done by way of evidence-gathering, I am in no doubt that no social worker has added racial discrimination to the list of failings already demonstrated.  M&#8217;s allegations are wholly unevidenced and baseless.  It is no surprise that someone who has had to deal with prejudice on a recurring basis will see it in unfavourable actions of an emanation of the state to which they are subject.  Goethe&#8217;s famous phrase &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">One only sees what one looks for. One only looks for what one knows&#8221; </span>is as applicable when considering the consequences of racism as it is about the limitations of familiarity.  In this case, despite my innate sympathy stemming from an acceptance of the reality of unfairness which this family will undoubtedly have experienced in their lives, it is not right that this charge should be allowed to stand.</p>

These parents are not just people of West African heritage but devout in their faith and its precepts.  The values which they imbue from their religious convictions not only form the bedrock of their lives but also inform and infuse their actions with regard to how they choose to bring up their children.  There can be a tendency to assume (erroneously) that because some cultures, especially those of Afro-Caribbean origin, have traditionally placed a premium upon respect, obedience and authority and so sanctioned corporal punishment as a means by which to ensure compliance with those values, that all those of such heritage will follow in that fashion. Similarly, it can be all too easy for some to assume that for those for whom Biblical teaching is important then the full remit of such teaching is equally valued and accepted without question, irrespective of any unpalatability it may present.  Put simply, just as being of West African heritage does not make a person likely to inflict corporal punishment upon a child so being a devout Christian does not mean that one without question follows every point of biblical teaching. At one point during the final hearing counsel on behalf of the child, demonstrating either a commendable knowledge of Scripture or a facility with an appropriate search engine, queried whether M was familiar with the Book of Proverbs Chapter 23, verse 14 wherein it is written: <span style="font-style:italic">Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish them with the rod, they will not die.

In contrast to use the word &#8216;allegation&#8217; makes it clear that what has been said is not to be assumed as being correct but must still be proved.  Given that a prerequisite of legal proceedings is reliance upon the maxim &#8216;he who asserts must prove&#8217; it follows that the word &#8216;allegation&#8217; is preferred because it reflects that importance in proving an assertion as opposed to disproving a statement.

However sitting listening to these exchanges it became clear to me that for those professionals in the school at the material time that they were engaged with the child their clear need was to focus upon enabling the child to say whatever it was that she wanted to say to them.  At the point of origin of the information which may, in due course, come to be used as evidence at a trial, whether in the criminal or family jurisdiction the undoubted focus of any professional is and should be simply capturing what is being said.  In the case of SJ by focusing simply upon letting the two girls speak she did an admirable job in ensuring there was material about which a debate could later take place in the appropriate venue as to the reliance to be placed upon it. It was clear that each teacher who gave evidence before me considered it to be their responsibility to simply capture what was said as opposed to attempting to sift it or score it as being truth or less.  </span></p>

The use of the word &#8216;disclosure&#8217; by these several teaching professionals did not indicate that there was an automatic assumption of truth, it was merely a term with which they were familiar.  In my judgement a distinction can properly be drawn between those operating at an early stage of a process of information collection process where the sole responsibility is to simply capture what is being sent and allow the child to say it and those attempting to decipher whether information is capable of being evidence to be considered in an adjudicatory process and therefore engaged in a process of evaluation of veracity.  Teacher after teacher was taken to task for not using the word &#8216;allegation&#8217; when in fact it was never the school&#8217;s role to decide or even take a position on what Penny was saying.  The school was in the business of information collection, it would fall to others in due course to scrutinise such material with a view to establishing the truth of it.  I can see far greater difficulties if schools are required to take a sceptical view of the problems and issues their pupils want to talk about, often for the first time, and to approach matters on the basis that all pupils can only ever allege. The consequent chilling effect which would be the result of adopting a critical attitude would have clear repercussions on the likelihood of schools being safe spaces where children feel able to say what they wish.  </span></p>

It was pleasing to be informed that a successful contact had taken place which offered the possibility of a route home being plotted for Penny and it providing a way back for her in due course.  However the parents were accepting of the fact that such a route would not be travelled quickly, if at all, and that patience and acceptance were the surest means by which to aspire to a full and successful reunification.</span></p>

The standard of proof may be different, but the roles of the social workers and the prosecutors are similar. They bring to court those cases where there is a good case to answer. It is for the court to decide whether the case is made out. If every child protection case were to result in an order, it would mean either that local authorities were not bringing enough cases to court or that the courts were not subjecting those cases to a sufficiently rigorous scrutiny.&#8221;</span></p>
