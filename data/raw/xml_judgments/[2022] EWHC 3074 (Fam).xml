	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">It was during this period that the Court was alerted to difficulties with regard to X&#8217;s placement.   The Guardian was aware of these because she visited the placement herself, as indicated in a position statement filed on her behalf today.    I read that Miss Jones travelled to the South East of England on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July to see X.   The position statement describes quite clearly the difficult circumstances which related to that placement.   X was anxious to leave there as speedily as possible.  She obviously was not content with her circumstances.  She expressed a wish to return to her previous placement in Scotland, and the placement itself apparently had expressed to the Guardian views which were critical of the local authority&#8217;s performance in their care of X (as a looked after child).   In terms, in paragraph 9 of the position statement the Guardian indicated that the placement in the South East of England stated that a local authority social worker had not been to visit X at the placement.  They were concerned at the lack of information being shared by the local authority and the lack of proper care planning in respect of X.    </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">Consequently, when the Guardian became aware of the breakdown in X&#8217;s placement at the residential facility in the South East of England on or about 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022 when X allegedly assaulted a member of staff there, the Guardian indicated in her position statement that she was not altogether surprised by the development (she having visited the placement as I said a few days before then). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">The breakdown of the placement on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July left the local authority in a difficult position.   Initially X had been arrested by police in the South East of England and she remained in police custody.  She was interviewed by police officers on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July and I read that no further action was to be taken in respect of the alleged assault. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">However the residential placement, hardly surprisingly, were not prepared to allow X to return to the placement.  They gave immediate notification of termination of that placement, which left the police in the position that they had to accommodate X at a police station, using a foamy sofa bed in a room within the police station, under a police protection order which was made by them. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">A social worker from the local authority then travelled, or had to travel to the South East of England to retrieve X and bring her back to this local authority area.   That led to an overnight stay in the Staffordshire area because of the distance involved and upon her return, X was accommodated in a training flat available to the local authority that being staffed and overseen by two female members of staff and this arrangement has endured thereafter. </p>

	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">There have been other placements. Apparently three different bed and breakfast accommodations have been used. Council housing stock is not available.   Apparently demand for that stock is presently under strain for the reasons indicated in paragraph 3.10 of Miss Williams (the local authority social worker&#8217;s) recent statement, and an external agency has now been engaged to provide staffing to oversee the current placement on a &#8220;two to one&#8221; basis, effectively carers overseeing the placement on a rota basis.  It follows from all of this, and it is conceded by the local authority and specifically mentioned by X&#8217;s Guardian, that the current placements are entirely unregistered and the local authority needs to provide suitable accommodation for X as swiftly as possible.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">Initially, once the Court was alerted to the present difficulties, it was indicated that the local authority was contemplating making an application for a secure accommodation order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (if that placement was in England), or under section 119 of the Social Services and Wellbeing (Wales) Act 2014 (if the secure accommodation was located in Wales). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">Presently it appears to be the position that X&#8217;s behaviour has stabilised since her return to this area.  She is having familial contact and the situation is not as difficult as it appeared to be when she was accommodated residentially out of area.  It is presently accepted by the local authority that the criteria for the making of a secure accommodation order would not be met and consequently no application of that kind is presently before the Court.    </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.05in">So far as X&#8217;s status is concerned, she remains subject to the final care order made in 2019.   She is a looked after child.   The local authority therefore are free to make arrangements in respect of her placement (be that a foster care placement, residential placement, or indeed familial placement), provided that there is no deprivation of liberty involved, where the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court has to be engaged to authorise a placement of that kind.    </p>

They are gatekept there.   Arrangements are thereafter made either for the hearing to be conducted in London or for the application to be remitted to the local court.   The local District Registries of the High Court no longer have jurisdiction to issue the application and the local authorities generally are aware of these revised arrangements by notification of the President of the Family Division. </p>

In England this is a scandal.  It has been a scandal for some time.   The President of the Family Division has drawn attention to it.   High Court Judges regularly send their judgments to the Department for Education in London urging them to take appropriate action.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

Local authorities in Wales are getting away with a situation which does not apply in England.  That is a situation which should be altered.   The Children&#8217;s Commissioner in Wales needs to be far more actively engaged.   Cafcass Cymru (as an independent agency) within  Welsh Government framework needs to &#8220;rattle the cage&#8221; of Welsh Government far more than it is doing to bring this situation speedily to a resolution.    </p>

Thankfully in North Wales we are not talking about huge numbers of children who require orders of this kind, but this would save (I would imagine) local taxpayers and general tax payers&#8217; money because it is well known that these residential placements out of area are extremely expensive.   They dwarf the expense of public school education so far as the weekly costs of the facilities are concerned; and, accordingly, it seems to me that it would be an appropriate measure of economy.   It would mean that children could be accommodated closer to their home area (allowing family members to have contact with them) if urgent action was taken on an all-Wales basis to form a network of residential placements of this kind which could be available to children. </p>

As a consequence, this County Council may be publicly identified as an authority which is not able to make arrangements for children in the customary way.   This County Council is not the only Local Authority in that position, but I regret to say that many members of the public at present are unaware of how serious the situation is. </p>
