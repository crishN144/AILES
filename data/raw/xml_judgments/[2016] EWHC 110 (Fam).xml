I mean no criticism of her at all.  She was faced, as so often occurs since the almost wholesale abolition of Legal Aid, with two unrepresented litigants in person.  The first language of neither of them is English, and, as will emerge, the wife in particular has difficulties with that language.  In those difficult circumstances the deputy district judge clearly did her best, but after a careful review of the verbatim transcript of the whole proceedings I have had regretfully to conclude that her decision on certain essential aspects of the case is not reliable and that, in certain respects, the hearing was objectively unfair to the wife.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The essential factual background in short summary, for the purposes only of this appeal and judgment, is as follows.  Both parties were born and brought up in Iran.  The husband is now aged 49.  The wife is now aged 48.  In 1991 the husband came to live in England and has, I believe, lived here ever since.  In 2000 these parties met, and in or about November 2000 the wife travelled to England, where they started living together.  In July 2001 they went through a ceremony of marriage at an established register office in Hackney in London.  In March 2003 the wife gave birth to their only child, a son.  He is now aged about 12 and three-quarters.  Apparently he has a degree of autism and associated disability.</span></p>

There is a considerable dispute between the parties as to the extent, if any, to which there were subsequent reconciliations and separations, although it is common ground that they have been permanently separated since 2011 at the latest.  If there was final separation even in 2007, this was a marriage and relationship of about seven years, which cannot be characterised as especially short.  In any event, it is a marriage from which a child was born.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">During the course of the marriage a house was bought in Dartford in Kent.  It is right to say that the husband has always serviced the mortgage on that property.  Initially it was purchased in his sole name, but in 2006 it was transferred into the joint names of the parties.  The parties continue to own that property, but neither of them has actually lived there for several years and it is currently rented out.  It is said that the equity in that property is around &#163;48,000.  Clearly that property is the former matrimonial home of these parties and is, as I say, currently in the joint names of the parties.  There does not seem to be any other asset of significance here in England.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The husband contended, and continues strongly to contend, that additionally a flat was purchased in Tehran in Iran.  He says that although the flat is currently owned by the wife, the purchase money was provided by him.  It is a curious feature of this case that, as I understand it, the wife resolutely denies the existence of that property as an asset of either of these parties, or in any way connected with these parties, at all.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In summary, the decision of the deputy district judge was that the house in Dartford should be transferred from the joint names of the parties into the sole name of the husband; and that the flat which is allegedly owned by the wife in Tehran should be transferred as to 75 per&#160;cent to the husband and 25&#160;per&#160;cent to herself.  Having regard to that brief description of the facts, that was a somewhat striking decision and conclusion by the deputy district judge.  Where the matrimonial home is in the joint names of the parties, some justification is normally required before it is transferred into the name of one party solely.  That justification may often, of course, lie in needs.  For instance, a property may be transferred from joint names into the sole name of one of the parties if that party is living in the property as his or her home with the child, or children, of the family. </span></p>

Currently it is, to all intents and purposes, an "investment" property.  The wife has said at this hearing through her counsel that she would very much like to return to live in that property as the home of herself and the son, albeit perhaps with what is known as a Mesher charge.  It is also somewhat striking that the bulk of the flat in Iran should also be transferred from the wife to the husband, especially in circumstances in which the very existence of that flat as an asset of these parties is so strongly contested.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">An additional surprising feature of the decision and outcome of the financial remedies hearing is that neither in her judgment nor in her order did the deputy district judge give any consideration to, or make any reference to, maintenance, despite the fact that the wife is wholly dependent on forms of state benefits, whereas the husband has some income said to be of the order of &#163;28,000 or &#163;29,000 per annum.  </span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The reason why the deputy district judge reached this somewhat striking outcome is frankly clear from her judgment.  A fact which I have deliberately not yet mentioned, is that in February 2000, prior to meeting this husband, the wife had undergone a ceremony of marriage with a man in Denmark.  She says of that marriage that it was a forced marriage and was never consummated, but it is not in issue that she went through the ceremony.  It is now clearly established and accepted by both of these parties that, by the time of the marriage between these parties in the register officer in Hackney in July 2001, that first Danish marriage had not been dissolved by any process and was still subsisting.  It therefore follows, as both these parties agree, that the marriage between them is null and void on the ground that, at the date of their marriage, one of the parties, namely the wife, was lawfully married to another person.</span></p>

The proceedings currently before this court are proceedings for divorce based on two years&#8217; separation and consent, and a petition issued by the husband in the Principal Registry of the Family Division on 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2012.  [I here mention parenthetically that the original of that petition on the court file bears a rubber stamp date, stamped by the court, of "09 Feb 2011".  That, frankly, was a truly lamentable error by the court on issue, for it is quite clear from numerous other dates on the petition, and indeed from the number of these proceedings (namely FD12D ...) that the petition was issued in February 2012, not February 2011.]</span></p>

It is not at all in issue that, although English is not his original language of birth and upbringing, he has a very good command of English and does not appear to suffer any linguistic disadvantage in these proceedings.

She certainly speaks sufficient English to have been able to ask for the assistance of an interpreter if she required one.  I put it to her counsel that, as she did not even ask the deputy district judge at the hearing for an interpreter, it is difficult now to sustain the submission that nevertheless the proceedings were unfair, or the resulting order fatally affected, by the absence of an interpreter.  Part of the answer to that is, as I was told on instructions, that only shortly before the hearing the wife had asked the court if there would be an interpreter, and had received the answer that I have already recorded.

In the first place, she was pursuing a line of reasoning that may seem crystal clear to an experienced matrimonial lawyer, but may have been thoroughly confusing to the lay parties.  Her line of reasoning was that if the marriage was in truth void and a nullity, what was the point or purpose in presenting a petition for divorce?  This led her to what was clearly a provisional conclusion in one of her questions that, "So I am bound to say the fact that he filed a petition for divorce suggests that he did not know."  It may, of course, suggest that to the experienced deputy district judge, but it does not at all follow that that conclusion follows from the fact that the husband presented a petition for divorce rather than a petition for nullity.</span></p>

Further, the line of questioning by the deputy district judge was later shown to have been completely fallacious.  The assumption behind her line of questioning was, and is, that on the date that the husband filed a petition for divorce-- namely in February 2012-- he did not know anything about the previous Danish marriage, for otherwise he would have presented a petition for nullity.  The husband himself was later to say that it was in 2010, i.e. some two years earlier, that he first learned about the Danish marriage.  </span></p>

I have already quoted from paragraphs 6 and 16 in which she recorded her conclusion that the wife had committed the crime of bigamy and had lied until forced to admit it.

	      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"The husband started divorce proceedings in 2012 and the decree nisi was pronounced in 2013.  The husband discovered in the course of a telephone conversation with a relative of the wife in Denmark in 2010 that, at the time he went through a marriage ceremony, she was still married to a man in Denmark.  Ms. Azizi denied this until documentary proof was obtained from Danish authorities at which stage she admitted it.  In court giving evidence to me she agreed that she had lied.  She asserts that the husband knew this all the time.  He denies this and says he was first told of the marriage in 2010.  Curiously he did not tell his solicitor about this previous marriage until after he had started divorce proceedings.  He said that he did not know that it was a "big deal."  As a result of the wife's refusal to admit bigamy, he had to spend &#163;200 to pay a Danish lawyer to obtain evidence from Danish records."</span></p>

Nowhere in the evidence, or in the earlier history, had the wife "denied" that she had been married in Denmark.  The highest it can be put is the letter that her then solicitors wrote on 18</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2015 which, as I have already stressed, is essentially interrogative in form.  In any event, it is far from clear that that letter was actually written on the instructions of the client.  It seems to me that the deputy district judge appears to have been significantly mistaken when she took the view that the wife had "denied" the existence of the previous marriage, or its subsistence at the date of the ceremony of this marriage.</span></p>

We have pored over the verbatim transcript of the hearing before the deputy district judge and nowhere can I find any passage in which she "agreed that she had lied."  It is in answer to that that the husband asserts that there are omissions from the verbatim transcript.  But, short of listening to the whole of the taperecording of a day and a half of proceedings in court, I am bound to treat the official verbatim transcript as accurate and reliable.</span></p>

But as Ms. Tyler points out, there is a further very significant area of concern about this judgment.  The deputy district judge clearly considered and concluded that the wife had committed the crime of bigamy.  She says as much in paragraphs 6 and again 16 of her judgment.  It is, however, essential to appreciate that there is, or may be, a world of difference between being a party to a marriage which is objectively null and void because one of the parties is still married to another living person, and actually committing the crime of bigamy.</span></p>

Since those conclusions were obviously fundamental to the discretionary decision of the deputy district judge in this case, it follows without more that, in my view, her judgment is not reliable or soundly based and must be set aside.</span></p>

It is quite apparent from passages which I&#160;have already quoted from the judgment, and from the judgment as a whole, that the deputy district judge regarded the husband as a truthful and reliable witness, and the wife as a dishonest and lying witness.  In support of her appeal the wife has produced her own mobile telephone, upon which there remains texts or electronic messages passing between her mobile phone and that of the husband on 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2015, namely just over a week after the decision and judgment.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The husband has had an opportunity in the courtroom to examine these texts or messages actually upon the wife's mobile telephone itself, and is forced to accept that the photocopies of the messages-- now in the Appeal Bundle at p.C1 to p.C13-- are true photocopies of what appears upon the mobile telephone.  He further accepts that these are messages passing as a conversation between her telephone, on the one hand, and his mobile phone, on the other hand.  He says, however, that he believes that on the night in question-- namely 28</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2015-- the wife was actually present in his own home and that she obtained access to his mobile phone and deliberately concocted messages between the two of them.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It seems to me, however, that at an Appeal Hearing such as this I have to take the messages at face value, and it is common ground that they are messages passing between her and his phone respectively.  Provisionally, it strikes me that it would require a lot of ingenuity and inventiveness on the part of the wife, acting solely with these two phones, to have concocted the whole telephone messaging conversation that now appears between p.C1 to p.C13.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The conversation is clearly bitter and vituperative between both of them.  It made many allegations, to which it is not necessary to refer.  It does include, at transcript p.C4, her saying to him, "... you lied to court but I&#160;will show you," and he replying a few moments later, "We saw already in court I will destroy you."  Further on at p.C13 she said to him, "Do U think you are a king in UK?  You lied a lot in court but there is God."  To which he answers, "I lied but court give me everything ...".  Ms Tyler submits that that evidence, which by its nature could not have been adduced at the hearing since it only arose about a week later, contains a clear admission by the husband that, far from being the witness of truth that the deputy district judge considered him to be, he had in fact lied to the court.</span></p>

She transferred the bulk of the disputed flat in Iran from the wife to the husband, and she gave no consideration at all to maintenance.  It seems to me that in view of the errors of the deputy district judge, to which I have referred, those striking outcomes require further consideration.  </span></p>

I am deeply conscious, too, that objectively the amounts in issue in this case are small-- as I have said, the equity in the Dartford property is said to be around &#163;48,000-- but for people who are not possessed of much wealth even small sums are very important.  Justice requires that I set aside this order and remit the whole question for rehearing by a fresh and, in my view, full-time district judge.</span></p>

It is all very well for a deputy district judge to say in a short sentence that the husband, "is entitled to a decree of nullity," but that does not represent or amount to a decree of nullity.  Further, even today in January 2016, there remains the petition on file for divorce and the decree nisi</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt"/><span style="font-size:14pt">of divorce, which was pronounced on 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2013, to which I have referred.  </span></p>

I could have permitted the husband to present a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">pro forma</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> fresh petition for nullity without reservice.  I could have rescinded the existing decree nisi divorce.  I could have dispensed with all other procedural formalities.  I could have heard very brief oral evidence, lasting about two minutes, in support of his petition for a decree of nullity, and I could have pronounced such a decree on the next day upon which I am sitting and it had been listed for pronouncement in open court.  Unfortunately, in this computer dominated era it is no longer practicable or wise for judges to adopt these procedural shortcuts.  If I were to do that, the computer would probably not recognise the existence of the petition for nullity.  It would have difficulty in coping with the rescission of the decree nisi of divorce, and, frankly, I would perpetuate the present procedural mess.</span></p>

But as well as remitting to a full-time district judge sitting in the Central Family Court the redetermination of the parties' cross claims for financial remedies, I also remit this case to a district judge in order that he or she may make appropriate orders to rescind the decree&#160;nisi of divorce and to substitute a petition for nullity, and for a formal decree of nullity in accordance with the procedural rules.  That concludes my judgment.</span></p>
