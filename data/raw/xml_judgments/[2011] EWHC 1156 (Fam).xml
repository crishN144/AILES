It says that before it can plan properly for N, it must know that happened to MY. It therefore seeks a discrete hearing in order that I should decide whether MY died as a result of an accident (his parents&#8217; case) or whether he was the victim of non-accidental head injury (NAHI).</p>

His mother was charged with his murder, but the case against her was not pursued, and she was formally acquitted on 4 January 2011. The reason for this was simple. The doctors were divided. Some thought the parents&#8217; case plausible (that his injuries were caused accidentally by a fall from a bed), others thought MY had been the victim of NAHI. The resulting doubt was sufficient to make it inappropriate to continue with a criminal prosecution.</p>

That course is resisted by N&#8217;s parents. On balance, and in default of any agreement between the parents and the local authority, N&#8217;s guardian supports the local authority. I will rehearse the arguments later in this judgment.</p>

I have reserved judgment and taken time to read the papers (which, in addition to the written position statements of the advocates,  comprised two arch lever files, one containing  459 pages and the other 374). The reading alone took me more than a working day, and even then I did not have time to read every word.</p>

As a result of a pre-birth assessment, the local authority social worker assigned to the case recommended that the parents undertake a post-birth residential assessment. They agreed, with the result that since 15 December 2010, N and his parents have been resident at  units  run by the R Homes (the Home). It is right to say that the parents  have throughout cooperated with the local authority, and this was the reason why, initially, the Family Proceedings Court (the FPC) declined to make an interim care order. </p>

It alleges the risk of future significant harm to N on two bases. Either the parents (or one of them) caused MY&#8217;s injuries and were (was)  thus guilty of NAHI; alternatively there was &#8220;a clear failure&#8221; of appropriate supervision. However, in the findings which it seeks, the local authority in terms invites the court to reject the parents&#8217; account of what occurred, and says that &#8220;no accidental cause of sufficient severity&#8221; is likely to have caused the injuries suffered by MY. If one parent was responsible, the local authority suggests, then the other knows what occurred and is covering up.</p>

I made an interim care order on the basis that the parents would continue to live with  N within what had by then become &#8220;the stand alone accommodation&#8221; provided by the Home. I took the view that the threshold  criteria under section 38 of the Children Act were met. I stressed that I did not regard the interim care order as giving the local authority any form of &#8220;advantage&#8221; in the proceedings, but that I regarded it as essentially a neutral measure which reflected the seriousness of the case and enabled the local authority to share parental responsibility for N. I made a number of other directions (including giving the mother  permission to instruct a clinical psychologist to undertake a cognitive assessment of her). I adjourned the case to 20 April, and reserved it to myself. At that point, I had not read any of the medical evidence. </p>

In this context, I remind myself, and will do so again later in this judgment,  that the issue I am being asked to decide discretely concerns the death of a non-ambulant child, and is thus a matter of the utmost seriousness. This is a factor which I need to bear in mind throughout.</p>

The risks in his case are amongst the most serious that come before this court. It must be a function of this court to determine where those risks lie and whether an accidental explanation is the likely explanation of the tragic circumstances of MY&#8217;s death. To proceed without a fact finding in this case is either to expose N to an unacceptable risk in his parents&#8217; care or to allow the parents to face the potential injustice of continuing to live under a cloud of suspicion until this issue is resolved.&#8221;</p>

Ms Patricia McCarthy admits &#8220;a failure of momentary adequate supervision&#8221; but insists that the medical evidence is in conflict and that a discrete finding of fact hearing is justified neither by likely outcome not by its length and cost. The case can properly be decided without such a hearing. She points to the number of assessments which the parents have undergone, and to both the psychiatric and psychological evidence about the mother. Her client, she submits, has already demonstrated a positive engagement with all the professionals in the case together with an understanding of the concerns of the local authority. </p>

There are a range of factors that can interfere with parenting ability and are therefore considered to be risk factors and similarly a range of factors that can minimise difficulties and these are considered to be protective factors. Risk factors include low IQ, social isolation, poor housing, mental health difficulties, substance misuse difficulties and poor financial situation. Protective factors include good social support, a good domestic relationship, absence of mental health or substance, issue difficulties in the parents and absence of difficulties (learning or behavioural) in the child. (the mother) appears to be in a supportive relationship with good familial support available. She is not presenting with any overt mental health difficulties. However she does present as rather disconnected from her experiences at times and she appears sometimes to come across as rather immature.

This strategy seems to be reflected in some of her responses on the projective assessment, and whilst in the short term she may experience greater difficulties as it becomes more difficult to disconnect from her experiences. At this point in time she does not see herself as needing psychological support, but she is at risk of experiencing psychological difficulties in the future so it will be important that both she and her husband know how to access professional support (for example through her GP) should any psychological difficulties become more apparent.&#8221;</p>

In particular, I take the view that a fact finding hearing &#8211; however set up - would not be a proportionate way of dealing with the case.

The parents would be unlikely to  accept the experts&#8217; conclusion. I would, I think, be duty bound to allow them to challenge the fresh evidence and, if necessary to call additional expert evidence in rebuttal. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s care plan is, if possible, to keep N and his parents together. This, in my judgment, is right. N and his parents  have not been separated since his birth, and N is now some 5 months old. A final decision must not be unduly delayed, and even if there were a hearing in the autumn, N would be then be in the order of 10 months old. I accept that that the priority must be to protect him from the risk of significant harm. However, in my judgement, the time-table for N is important, and would be adversely affected by a fact finding hearing.  . </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I must. I think,  bear in mind that not only is there an acute medical dispute about the causation of MY&#8217;s injuries, but that the causation of such injuries is, itself,  the subject of medial controversy. Were the issue critical to my conclusions about N, this would not, of course, be a reason for not embarking on  a fact-finding hearing. It remains my view, however, that it is not the function of the judge to become involved in medical controversy except in the very rare case where such a controversy is itself an issue in the case and a judicial assessment of it becomes necessary for the proper resolution of the proceedings. This, in my judgment, is not such a case.</p>

As it is, however, I have to bear in mind the passage of time and the fixing of attitudes.</p>

She believes firmly that MY&#8217;s death was accidental, and I have no doubt that she would tell me so in the witness box. I would almost certainly have to take her evidence through an interpreter &#8211; interpreters  having been used at each of the hearings before me &#8211; and the scope for judicial assessment is thereby diminished. She will, inevitably, take refuge both in her own account and the corroborating expert opinion.</p>

But as I have already said, I do not think I do.  I think it perfectly possible to decide N&#8217;s case, and to protect him, on our current state of knowledge. This is that MY died at the age of 7 months in circumstances which his parents are convinced were accidental, but which has divided medical opinion, and thus required the local authority; (a) to become involved; and (b) to ensure, so far as it could, that N is protected from potential risk.</p>

A finding of fact on the balance of probabilities that MY  was not a victim of NAHI could be an injustice to N. A finding one way or the other should only be made, in my judgment, if it is  necessary to protect N.  As I hope I have made clear, I do not think it is.</p>
