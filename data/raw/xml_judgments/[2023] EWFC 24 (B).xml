It was hypothetical because it took place in the UK rather than the US, and so </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[PA1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;s home environment could not be assessed, and because an overseas adoption is the only means by which C&#8217;s place could be secured with her family in America, it is not the form of assessment that is required for that process. The local authority had taken advice from leading counsel in respect of possible placement of C in America in the previous proceedings and was given permission to obtain updated advice within these proceedings.  Further to that advice, the local authority said that it would pay for and facilitate a &#8216;home study&#8217; assessment of either </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[PA1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> or </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[PA2]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.  This assessment is the first step on the path to adoption. There is a cost to this, and the local authority invited one or other of the sisters to put themselves forward to limit the expense. There was a meeting and it was decided that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[PA2] </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">should be the one to be assessed as she is an American citizen.</span></p>

They may arise for a number of reasons. One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

The outgoing and return flights confirmed.  Nobody could have predicted the pandemic and its consequences, particularly the closing of international borders, the lockdowns, nor how long these extraordinary measures would go on for.  However, even allowing for that, and being careful to avoid the benefit of hindsight, I agree with the evidence of Ms Woodhouse that in the circumstances, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;s decision to try and rush C out of the country before the borders were closed is peculiar.  It remains without good explanation.  C&#8217;s mother had died only six months earlier, she needed stability, the pandemic was a great unknown.  If </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> genuinely believed that sending C earlier would mean that she had more chance of coming back sooner, I find that belief to have been misplaced, and based on assumptions without any rational basis.  If there was any risk at all of C having to stay longer than expected in America as a result of border restrictions, it would have been ill-advised to send her.  In fact, the WhatsApp messages show that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> actually contemplated that from the outset: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;Hey there, is there any possibility of [C] coming to you sooner?  I&#8217;m just worried that Trump is going to stop flights from the UK and then she won&#8217;t be able to visit.  If Trump stops flights to UK whilst she is there with you then she will have to stay with u longer.  What do you think?&#8217;</span></p>

I agree with Ms Woodhouse that their decision not to share information with professionals about the kind of pressures they were under at home raises a concern.  Firstly that they feel justified in telling lies to professionals and to the Court if they consider the situation warrants it.  C&#8217;s carers need to be open and honest.  Secondly, there is a worry as to how they might manage a situation in the future where they felt conflicted by other pressures in their ability to care for C.  As a matter of fact, C was fine about remaining in the USA while in the care of her paternal family.  But by asking for her to stay longer, delaying her return to school, creating potential issues around her visa, and uncertainty, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1 and SG2]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> demonstrated an inability to put her needs first.  </span></p>

The liver condition could make her tired and feel sick a lot of the time.  The painkillers she was taking for fibromyalgia caused difficulties with tiredness and concentration, and the condition is made worse when she is under stress.  Stress also adversely affects her symptoms of fibromyalgia and the liver condition.  Again, having medical conditions does not on its own rule out a prospective carer, but in the particular circumstances of this case, where C is prone to take a caring role and to worry about her carers, this is a risk factor.

One had anxiety such that a referral to CAMHS was made (although she was still on the waiting list when she turned eighteen and then discharged from the service, by which time things had improved with the support of family).  The other daughter&#8217;s mental health issues were said to have been building since the age of fifteen and in 2020 there was concern that she had wanted to end her life.  This was evidently an extremely concerning and frightening situation for the family and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> was extremely distressed to have to recall it at all when giving evidence.  She and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG2]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> regard it as an invasion of their daughter&#8217;s privacy to have to share information about it, but their reluctance to do so does have relevance to the question of their ability to meet C&#8217;s needs.  Firstly, they chose to hide this information from professionals and created a lie about the holiday to Croatia.  Secondly, if the situation had been building for years, then one might expect there to have been some reference to this, and to the challenges with their other daughter, in the initial special guardianship report in 2019, but there was no mention of it.

They did not feel the need to prepare C for the trip.  At the same time they have maintained that they always felt unhappy about the contact order and did not consider it to be in C&#8217;s best interests.  If they genuinely had concerns about her spending time in America, then it would seem that the impending pandemic would have constituted a very good reason not to send C.  But the reverse was true, they sought to send her sooner, notwithstanding that they acknowledged this might mean a longer stay.  To Ms Woodhouse they just said that it seemed like a good idea at the time.  I do not agree.  C&#8217;s mother had died less than six months before, she needed stability and certainty, this trip reunited her with her paternal family who she loved, but otherwise brought with it a lot of unknowns as to how long she would be away or how her schooling would be managed. That </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1 and SG2]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> did not apparently identify these as issues and did not see a need to prepare her for the trip is an example of poor decision making for C.</span></p>

The decision was made in haste, C was given no helpful preparation before she left.  No attempts were made to put her in touch with her paternal family, with whom she had only one telephone contact throughout the whole year.  She was told to keep the trip a secret which made her feel worried.  She had no idea how long she was going to be away and was confused and anxious about this.  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> knew that within a week of C arriving in America, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[PA1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> was due to be having surgery, but she did not make any enquiries about who would be looking after C.   Given that she had sent a text message saying that she did not trust </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[PA2]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, or their mother, one might expect she would have wanted to reassure herself about the arrangements so that she could let C know the plan.  On the day of departure, she did not come into the airport to check that all was ok with the flights.  There is some suggestion that she was not allowed in because of covid, but </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> told Ms Woodhouse that she never came into the airport because she found it emotionally challenging to drop off C and did not want to show C her distress.  Contrary to what she told the school, there was absolutely no pressure at all from the paternal family for this trip to happen, it was instigated by </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.  She has still not provided any credible explanation for why she did this.  Again, the decision making was poor, and the preparation for C was poor.  </span></p>

I agree with Ms Woodhouse that it was wrong for him to appear to be blaming her and punishing her for something that was causing her confusion and distress.  He said he thought it would help to settle her, to &#8216;level her&#8217;, but she did not want to do it. She struggles with literacy and writing, and he says it took about an hour.  This can only have been received as a punishment by her.  On another occasion, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> said that she saw on the CCTV they have that C had pulled one of the dogs&#8217; ears.

She has described </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Ms J</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;a witch&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">  When hearing of Ms Woodhouse&#8217;s final recommendations she was not able to contain her emotions and said that Ms Woodhouse would have </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;blood on her hands&#8217;.  Ms M</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> said that at one point </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> tended to find loopholes to avoid direct communication with her, cancelling contact via the foster carer when she should have spoken to the social worker, not being responsive in terms of getting back to her with paperwork.  It should be noted that this relationship has improved and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Ms M</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> has done well to support </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> to feel more able to participate in the proceedings and to get her views across the way she would want them to be heard.  Nonetheless, this is something that a number of people have experienced from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.  Ms Woodhouse found her to be &#8216;elusive&#8217; and selective of how and when information was shared.  Like others, she never felt that she achieved a full understanding of the events leading up to the trip in October 2021, because </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1 and SG2]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> never told her the full story about it.  Similarly, in relation to the &#8216;troubles&#8217; in the family that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1 and SG2]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> have acknowledged to exist but felt they could not share.  Further, there was no acknowledgment when information had been subtly avoided or withheld.  Ms Woodhouse concluded that it was difficult to ensure that a full understanding had been reached where there had been &#8216;such obvious avoidance of open sharing in our discussions&#8217;.  This is consistent with the weight of the evidence.  I regard it as a continuing risk factor for C. </span></p>

The Court could not have directed the local authority to compel the American authorities to carry out the assessment, and that is why it is on the recital, not an order.  But this was driven by the local authority, and it was also recorded that the local authority would restore the matter to Court if there was an issue with the assessment.  Pursuant to the assurances given in Court, the local authority had contacted the relevant agency in the USA, obtained quotes, held the meeting to identify which aunt would be able to be assessed.

They cannot promote her relationship with her birth family but have given inconsistent, harmful and damaging messages about them, which have left her confused and distressed.  They have not given a satisfactory explanation to me or to professionals about the poor decision making in 2020 and 2021 that meant C&#8217;s needs were not prioritised.  It would appear that at moments of stress for </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1] and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG2]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, they have a tendency to make impulsive or ill-thought through decisions which have either caused or put C at risk of significant harm.  They have not fully acknowledged responsibility for their actions or been able to reflect on their impact on C.  In the circumstances the Court cannot have confidence that things would be different in the future.

The implication is that the local authority was not pursuing the same course in these proceedings.  I do not accept this.  On 20 May 2022 within these proceedings, I gave permission for the same legal expert, Deidre Fottrell KC, to be instructed to give updated advice, and my understanding is that was obtained, confirming that the same process would apply now.  The same order provided that the legal advice from Irene Steffas from the previous proceedings was to stand as an expert report in the proceedings.  It was noted that she had been approached and confirmed the contents of her advice remained good law.  </span></p>

I have heard further submissions about contact, but maintain my view that the level of direct contact proposed by the local authority is likely to be destabilising for C and could undermine her placement with her foster family.  My own view is that six times a year for direct contact is still about right as the baseline, but I appreciate that reducing from weekly contact abruptly would not be in C&#8217;s interests, and I can foresee that a higher level of contact, say monthly, could work well.  I would prioritise less frequent but more high-quality outings, with other members of the family joining in, and including in due course overnight stays.  I do consider the plan of once a week too much, although video calls or phone calls at that level would I think be a good idea.  I agree that flexibility and responsiveness to C&#8217;s needs is required. There needs to be careful analysis of how both C and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[SG1]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> are managing, and the impact on C.
