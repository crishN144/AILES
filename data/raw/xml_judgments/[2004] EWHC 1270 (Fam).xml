I have gone into open court because this case raises a number of matters which I think should be in the public domain. It involves the death of a child said to be the result of shaken baby syndrome. It involves a degree of disagreement between eminent and highly responsible medical experts. The man at the centre of this has already been tried for and acquitted of both murder and manslaughter yet the family court is apparently retrying the same issue with the inevitable possibility of arriving at a different view. This seems to me a good case in which the workings of the family court should be made public so that proper public discussion can take place on the basis of known rather than speculative procedures.</span></p>

They decided that they were not sure: no more than that can be read into the verdict. They may have decided that he was in fact innocent or they may have decided that he was very probably guilty but that they could not be sure of it. We do not know. Their verdict does not give us the answer nor could it.</span></p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">In family proceedings, however, the judge&#8217;s task is quite different. In the end I will have to decide whether the surviving child T can be safely returned to one or both of her parents. In order to decide that, I need to reach views about why X died and the question I have to ask is this: what was the most probable cause of her death? That is very different to the question faced by the jury both in terms of its emphasis (they were primarily concerned with W as the defendant whilst I am primarily concerned with the child) and in terms of the standard of proof. They had to be sure of guilt; I have to determine the probabilities and give detailed reasons for my view. Moreover I have heard a much wider range of evidence than would have been admissible in the criminal trial.</span></p>

Truth is an absolute but elusive concept and the law, in recognising that, deals with it in terms of what can be proved. The fact that something cannot be proved does not mean it did not happen but only that it cannot be proved to the requisite standard that it did. That is the price society has to pay for human fallibility in the quest for truth.</span></p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">I start then with this question of proof. Although very serious issues are raised in family proceedings, they remain nevertheless civil proceedings. They are subject to civil and not criminal rules of evidence and the civil law relating to proof. That said, the court can only make findings of fact where the evidence justifies these findings: anxiety or concern as to risk to the child, however great, cannot justify a finding in the absence of evidence. Thus in care proceedings the local authority as applicant must prove facts (known as threshold criteria) which justify the State&#8217;s intervention in family life pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 31(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">The classical statement of the law on these points is to be found in the speech of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the House of Lords case known as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Re H and R (Child Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 1 FLR 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 1 FLR 80</ref>.</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt"> In that speech Lord Nicholls lays down the approach outlined above.

Generally, although there are exceptions, a plaintiff or applicant must establish the existence of all the preconditions and other facts entitling him to the order he seeks.

When assessing the probabilities the court will have in mind as a factor, to whatever extent is appropriate in the particular case, that the more serious the allegation the less likely it is that the event occurred and, hence, the stronger should be the evidence before the court concludes that the allegation is established on the balance of probability. Fraud is usually less likely than negligence. Deliberate physical injury is usually less likely than accidental physical injury. A step-father is usually less likely to have repeatedly raped and had non-consensual oral sex with his under age stepdaughter than on some occasion to have lost his temper and slapped her. Built into the preponderance of probability standard is a generous degree of flexibility in respect of the seriousness of the allegation. </span></p>
	    <p class="NormalWeb"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">Although the result is much the same, this does not mean that where a serious allegation is in issue the standard of proof required is higher. It means only that the inherent probability or improbability of an event is itself a matter to be taken into account when weighing the probabilities and deciding whether, on balance, the event occurred. The more improbable the event, the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur before, on the balance of probability, its occurrence will be established. Ungoed-Thomas J. expressed this neatly in In re Dellow's Will Trusts <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1964] 1 WLR 451" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1964">[1964] 1 W.L.R. 451</ref>, 455: "The more serious the allegation the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood of what is alleged and thus to prove it.""</span></p>

The range of facts which may properly be taken into account is infinite. Facts include the history of members of the family, the state of relationships within a family, proposed changes within the membership of a family, parental attitudes, and omissions which might not reasonably have been expected, just as much as actual physical assaults. They include threats, and abnormal behaviour by a child, and unsatisfactory parental responses to complaints or allegations. And facts, which are minor or even trivial if considered in isolation, when taken together may suffice to satisfy the court of the likelihood of future harm. The court will attach to all the relevant facts the appropriate weight when coming to an overall conclusion on the crucial issue."</span></p>

It is also recognised that understanding in this area continues to develop and certainly that some of the old certainties have now been strongly questioned.

A positive finding against a parent or both parents does not in itself preclude the possibility of rehabilitation. All depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.

I am fully satisfied that the evidence she gave me was an essentially accurate account by a witness who wanted to assist the court but who was clearly sympathetic to the mother and W.

Again there was agreement that these injuries typically occur in children in the first year of life and that, not only was it most unusual to find such an injury in a child of the age of X, but it would require greater force because of the greater comparable strength of her neck muscles.</span></p>

	    <p class="NormalWeb" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt">There were two other features in this case that cloud the issue of force. First, the damage itself will not necessarily be a guide to the force used. It had once been thought that the brain damage (which is the fatal component) was brought about by shearing injuries caused by different sections of the brain of different density being forcibly moved in relation to each other. That remains a possible mechanism but now it is recognised that much damage may in fact be caused by hypoxic/ischaemic changes which may themselves be caused by heart failure which deprives the brain of oxygenated blood. In this case X had been in cardiac arrest for 45 minutes and undoubtedly hypoxic/ischaemic damage would have been caused thereby. Secondly there was an issue as to whether retinal haemorrhages were present on admission at hospital. It is accepted that they were found later in the day on transfer to the second hospital.</span></p>

She says that she examined X through an ophthalmoscope and saw no haemorrhages. She was not specifically looking for them and acknowledges that she may have missed them. However, she would not have expected to do so because they were flame red haemorrhages, easy to see had they been present. I accept that view and therefore conclude that I cannot be satisfied that retinal haemorrhages were present of the time of admission to the first hospital. In my view they were more probably caused by raised inter-cranial pressure due to the brain swelling itself.</span></p>

Some say that their absence tells you nothing about the forces applied to the head. Others assert their relevance. Dr AS thought that their absence may speak of lesser forces being applied to the head. Professor L, a paediatric ophthalmic pathologist, thought that if they were not there earlier they had in fact been caused by raised inter-cranial pressure. Dr RS thought that their absence "slightly enlarges the question mark against shaking". In my view I should adopt a cautious approach in this case and recognise that the absence of retinal haemorrhages may signify lesser forces having been employed and that is a factor against rather than in support of a shaking injury. Nevertheless I must also remind myself that Dr RS said both that shaking remained more probable than accident and further that in the absence of a reliable explanation "the overwhelming probability is a non-accidental head injury".</span></p>

He said that that was the first thing he thought of in his panic and stuck with it even when pressed by the doctor at hospital. My view is that the chaotic circumstances of X&#8217;s collapse are unlikely to produce a conscious fabrication but rather the truth with omissions. In his evidence to me he said that even when interviewed by the police he told lies as to what he had done (i.e. that the child was sick and he was wanting an ambulance) as well as leaving out the impact with the door which he believed to be the fatal injury. Once again I am more inclined to think that that was truth with omissions rather than conscious fabrications. Then he produced an explanation for the criminal trial. Even on his own account his explanations were until then designed to disguise what he believed to be the cause of fatal injury. That had been on any view a reason for his lie.</span></p>

I have no doubt that he was frantic with remorse though whether that was for careless or deliberate conduct one could not tell. I accept that that will have impeded his ability to explain what had happened which is why I think that what he said was more likely to be truth with omissions than outright manufacture. It follows that I think it much more probable that the child was indeed sick if not very much and that the child did indeed travel from bed to floor and thus the child suffered an acceleration/deceleration injury with rotation. I think it very probable that W knew that something very serious had happened and that W was going upstairs to seek help to get an ambulance. I think it likely that the child did strike her head accidentally on the door. I am quite unable to treat W&#8217;s present account as reliable having regard to the history of accounts given and the wholly implausible reasons (where he actually gave them since many were &#8216;I don&#8217;t know&#8217;) that he gave for lying other than to conceal what he thought was the fatal act. I do not, however, discount all his evidence as untrue. In particular I accept that he had behaved as a loving father to X during the time he was with her. He had cared for her if somewhat over-indulgently. In particular I accept that his evidence is motivated less by a fear for his own skin than by losing S and T as I accept that he had been genuine in thinking that S and X were the best thing that had happened to him.</span></p>

Professor R and Dr J both believed that this would have required the sort of force associated with a punch or kick. Dr RS believed that it was explicable in terms of a resuscitation injury (something he had seen in his experience) and indeed that was his impression on first seeing it. He added that he would expect a kick or punch to cause damage to underlying organs (there was none) but disagreement over that opinion remained. Given what I have heard about CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation), it must be more than a real possibility that significant forces were accidentally applied to the abdomen. In those circumstances I must conclude that Dr RS&#8217;s views must be regarded as a reasonable (but not the only) explanation for the damage to the Mesentery. I find that it is not proved that damage to the Mesentery was caused by any aggressive act on the part of either parent and further that the evidence does not warrant any finding that the risk of future harm to any child at the hand of either parent is affected by this injury.</span></p>

That concern was echoed by Dr H, a well recognised expert in this field, though he would not go so far as a positive diagnosis. Dr M, a consultant paediatric gastroentorologist was not concerned by the findings and believed them capable of a natural explanation.

These findings should not be used as any indicator that any child may be at risk of sexual abuse from either parent. I regard the explanation by Dr RS as at least as reasonable a possibility as any other as is that of Dr M.</span></p>

I should also remind myself that a shaking type injury is very unusual in a child of this age.

All I can do is to try to reconstruct events so far as I can taking account both of what I have found proved and the probabilities that flow from that. The essential framework is this. W genuinely loved X and cared for her. W was as a general rule gentle and competent in his care of her. W was utterly distraught as a consequence of what happened and in those circumstances was far more likely to tell the truth with crucial omissions than he was actively to concoct a fabricated story. Hence my conclusions set out above that the child was sick, that the child travelled from bed to floor with some force and that in its immediate aftermath W knew that something very serious had happened.

I think the probabilities are that he pushed the child away from himself with such force that she rose above the height of the bed before falling in such a way, probably a V shape, as to produce the acceleration/deceleration injury with rotational forces which has been described in the medical evidence. I think the force used might well have caused the bystander to describe a throw but I am satisfied that that was not W&#8217;s intent. I am quite satisfied that his action was culpable in that it was an action performed by him that he should have realised was potentially dangerous. It may be that this finding is technically inconsistent with the Jury&#8217;s acquittal of manslaughter but I am sympathetic to a reluctance to expose him to criminal punishment in the circumstances of this case. This was an uncharacteristic reaction, albeit a serious and culpable over-reaction, to a situation. Whether that situation was more than a child being or threatening to be sick, I have no way of knowing.</span></p>
