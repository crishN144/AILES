First, the husband&#8217;s two sisters, who are the second and third respondents. Secondly, the wife&#8217;s sister and brother-in-law are respectively the fourth and fifth respondents.  All those people have been excused from attending this hearing.  The issues relating to them will no doubt return but are not centrally relevant to my decisions in this hearing and therefore it has not been thought necessary for them to be in attendance or represented at this hearing.</p>

Apart from a period when it was rented out and another period when it was substantially knocked down and rebuilt in the early days, the parties have lived at that family home and that is the case right up to date and so, at present, despite the divorce proceedings going on, the parties with their two children all live in that home together.</p>

My impression is that the marriage had some difficulties for a number of years but sadly, broke down in 2022.  The wife issued divorce proceedings in Spring 2022.  I have not seen reference in the papers to a decree nisi or conditional order, but I do not think it is suggested that there is any opposition to the progress of the divorce itself.  It may be there is a decree nisi to which I have not been referred.</p>

It is not entirely surprising, therefore, that significant amounts of legal fees have accrued in trying to deal with this difficult case.</p>

The statute enables the court to make such an order for MPS if the court thinks reasonable and the same applies to interim PPs after pronouncement of decree absolute. In TL v ML, Nicholas Mostyn QC stated that the sole criteria is reasonableness which is synonymous with fairness.  That formulation was approved by the Court of Appeal in Rattan v Kuwad.  I reject the submission made on behalf of the husband that the wife should be confined to emergency immediate relief.  That is not consistent with the overriding approach to reasonableness which the authorities endorse.&#8221;</span></p>

The apportionment of the shares of the parties&#8217; proceeds of sale may be dependent on a large number of factors which may only be fully appreciated on a full review of the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.

Well, at the heart of the dispute which exists both in this hearing and also, it seems likely to be the ongoing argument at the heart of the ongoing dispute, is the question of what a court should make of the husband&#8217;s presentation of his financial circumstances.</p>

The ES2 says about &#163;60,000 but that, I do not think, includes the outstanding costs obligations which I have just mentioned and if I take that off, he is in a negative position on his presentation.</p>

If this presentation turns out to be correct or if I was to be compelled to assume that it was correct today, then it is obvious that he would be unable to afford very much of what the wife is asking him to pay; but the question really arising is whether this is a case in which I should be drawing robust adverse inferences following the principles set out in the Nicholas Mostyn judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">TL v ML </span>(see above).</p>

Obviously there would be some costs of realising those assets but it is a substantial sum and if those were really the husband&#8217;s assets or he had access to them, as the wife suspects, then the presentation that he has given would be severely deficient.</p>

The conversation that the wife records with the employee of the corporate trustee in July 2023, and I have no reason at the moment to doubt that, that was not a subject which Mr Wagstaffe cross-examined the wife on yesterday but as it stands, subject to further cross-examination, points firmly to the conclusion, it seems to me, that it is the husband who is blocking the disclosure.  If he stopped blocking it, there would be a lot of information disclosed which may be of interest.</p>

I am afraid I have not been impressed, at this stage certainly, by Mr Wagstaffe&#8217;s argument that the opposition to the disclosure in Country D is motivated by a pure desire to protect the integrity of the trust from the wife&#8217;s principal application and in fact that she is confusing her role as trustee and potential attacker of the trust. This argument seems to me to be uncompelling, at least at this stage.  If this trust is valid and if he is not able to benefit from these assets as he asserts, then my view is that the husband would be strongly in favour of supporting the disclosure of information of the documents from Country D to England.  The fact that he is not is for me, at this stage certainly, highly suspicious that those documents will reveal a rather different picture to the one he has so far wished to portray to this court.</p>

He is said to have been the settlor of the trust and placed significant amounts of assets in it.  His affidavit, if it be correct and reliable, says that this is absolutely not true.  It is an issue which needs to be resolved but at the moment, with the level of disclosure we have had so far, that it is seriously troubling as a picture of the reliability of what the husband says about the trust.</p>

At this stage, my broad impression is that he has been able to take what he wished at any stage at will and has regularly done so.  It is not the whole picture but the photographs of the cash in the house and his explanation for going to Country D, asking for some cash which was here, large amounts of cash, tens of thousands of pounds worth of cash in a bag, are indicative of that situation and that the presentation is not all that it seems.</p>

Absent a convincing explanation to this event, which has not yet come, it seems to point both to a willingness to be dishonest in the presentation of the document and also, a willingness to hide personal assets and present them as inaccessible trust assets or corporate assets.  Both of those indicators are pertinent to today&#8217;s application; (c) likewise, the email that he sent to his siblings on 14 December 2021 in which he both promised substantial cash gifts to his various nieces and nephews but reserved the right to recall them by way of documents which he would retain which would be loan documents, seem to me to throw some light on the manipulative way that the husband is prone to present his situation.</p>
