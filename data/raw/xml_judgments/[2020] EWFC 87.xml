This is my Judgment following the listed final hearing on 24 June 2020. I apologise for the delay in sending this judgment to the parties, I can only attribute this to the volume of work during the current CV19 pandemic. In this Judgment I will concentrate on those parts of the evidence and submissions which have assisted me to make decisions about D, it is by no means a full account of all that I have read in the bundle nor heard in submissions. I can assure the parties that I have taken account of all of the written and oral material made available to me. I will indicate where matters are in dispute.  </p>

She still has some family there, and moved back to Z in 2008 where she had been living and working in Z independently for two years by the time the parties met in 2010. They met and began to live together in Z, leaving together in 2013 when the M was pregnant with D, and they moved to London. They married in June 2013. They separated in March 2015, but continued to live together until March 2016 when the F returned to Z. It was agreed that D remain living with the M in London.  </p>

The dates of the F&#8217;s agreed holidays with D to Z (which took place in addition to holiday contact in other jurisdictions) are 21-28 October 2017 and 10-20 August 2018. M and D travelled to Z together, F collected and returned them to the airport on both occasions, the M stayed with her sister. No difficulties ever arose in respect of such trips, and there was never any issue (perceived or alleged) of the F failing to return D at the end of an agreed holiday. </p>

She said that D did not want to go to Z if she did not &#8216;come along&#8217;, and that she has received advice.

M asked to borrow F&#8217;s credit card while she was away as she had forgotten hers, and she incurred &#163;1,000 of expenses in W without asking him. When she returned to see him to collect D, she asked F to change the flights again (at a further expense, having already spent more than $2,000 in replacement flights in addition to the &#163;3,500 lost on the booked flights for the holiday due to start on 10 August) and when F refused, M accused him of holding D &#8216;hostage&#8217;.

The court gave the M an extension to 27 May 2020 to file her first statement (with a penal notice attached) and extended time for the second statement to be filed to 9 June 2020. The court further directed that the Children Act application should proceed on 24 June on the basis of oral submissions only, unless otherwise decided by the trial judge before the hearing. The order I made on 12 May 2020 records that F&#8217;s solicitors contacted M on nine separate occasions between 24 February 2020 and 11 May 2020 without receiving any response.

By then the mother had not joined the hearing. A SFB invitation had been sent to her along with the other participants. It is to the F&#8217;s credit that he was not simply saying, the M had failed to comply with any orders to file evidence, is not here now, so his orders should be granted. His Counsel began to outline his case and take me through the written documents (which had been sent to the M).  At 11.40h, I could see that M was in the &#8216;virtual waiting room&#8217; and I admitted her to the hearing. The M told me that she had been ill, that both her mobile phones were broken, and when I asked about her landline she said that she did not know the number. Clearly though she has email and internet access as she was accessing the hearing from her home. Also her landline rang during the hearing, so it is clearly working.  </p>

It is inconceivable that she had no mobile telephone for a &#8216;couple of months&#8217; as she asserts in her email on the day before the hearing. Her email sent to my clerk at 16.17h on the day before the hearing indicates she had tried to contact the Judge, the court and Ms Blake my clerk. No emails had been received by my clerk or myself, and M had Ms Blake&#8217;s email address in the order  and used it on the day before the hearing. The M had email access, yet did not reply to the F&#8217;s solicitors countless [justified] communications.

The GP letter contains information that she had had symptoms of a viral illness. The assertion that she could not respond to court proceedings as a result is likely to have come from the mother. The letter does not say when the mother saw the GP for this illness, when the symptoms arose nor when it was diagnosed, the letter is merely dated 2 days prior to the court hearing. The mother was able to talk animatedly almost without stopping for an hour before me, she appeared very able to set out her case and arguments. It is not necessary to adjourn the final hearing. The M has had ample opportunity to read the papers, and put her case prior to the listed final hearing and has chosen not to. In any event I heard from her in detail and at length when she eventually arrived in the hearing on 24 June.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.25in"> &#8216;The overriding consideration for the Court in deciding whether to allow a parent to take a child to a non-Hague Convention country is whether the making of that order would be in the best interests of the child. Where (as in most cases) there is some risk of abduction and an obvious detriment to the child if that risk were to materialise, the Court has to be positively satisfied that the advantages to the child of her visiting that country outweigh the risks to her welfare which the visit will entail. This will therefore routinely involve the Court in investigating what safeguards can be put in place to minimise the risk of retention and to secure the child&#8217;s return if that transpires. Those safeguards should be capable of having a real and tangible effect in the jurisdiction in which they are to operate and be capable of being easily accessed by the UK-based parent. Although, in common with Black LJ in Re M, we do not say that no application of this category can proceed in the absence of expert evidence, we consider that there is a need in most cases for the effectiveness of any suggested safeguard to be established by competent and complete expert evidence which deals specifically and in detail with that issue. If in doubt the Court should err on the side of caution and refuse to make the order. If the judge decides to proceed in the absence of expert evidence, then very clear reasons are required to justify such a course.&#8217; </p>

I note in his statement that when the F wanted to engage with her about D&#8217;s settled status post Brexit, he and his solicitor shad to send many emails on the topic to her.
