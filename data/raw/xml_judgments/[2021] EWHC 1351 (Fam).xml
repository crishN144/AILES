	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The appeal from the learned District Judge was listed before me pursuant to the provisions of FPR PD30A para 2.1 on the grounds that the appeal raises an important point of principle or practice, namely the meaning of the term &#8220;associated person&#8221; in of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/62/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 62(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>.  The appellant is represented by Mr Simon Crabtree of counsel, who did not appear below.  In circumstances that I will come to, the application to the learned District Judge for injunctive relief was made without notice to the respondent to that application.  Accordingly, the respondent has not been given notice of this appeal against the dismissal of that without notice application. </p>

On 27 April 2021 the Attorney General&#8217;s Office indicated that the Attorney General did not wish to intervene nor to instruct an advocate on behalf of the Ministry of Justice.  </p>

I am particularly indebted to Mr Crabtree for the assiduously fair manner in which he has conducted the appeal, assisting the court not only by making all the submissions that could reasonably be advanced in support of his client&#8217;s appeal but, in circumstances where the respondent does not have notice of these proceedings, pointing up for the court the contrary points that might have been taken by the respondent had he been given notice.  In addition, I have had the benefit of reading the appeal bundle, which bundle includes a transcript of the judgment given by the learned District Judge on 17 December 2020.  Having heard Mr Crabtree&#8217; submissions, I reserved judgment on the appeal and now proceed to set out my decision and the reasons for it. </p>

Within this context, Mr Crabtree submits that the section <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> therefore include a step-nephew or a nephew-inlaw who, Mr Crabtree submits, is by definition a nephew acquired as a result of a marriage, namely the second marriage of an applicant&#8217;s sibling to a person who already has a son.  Accordingly, Mr Crabtree submits that although properly directing himself to the importance <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63(1)</ref>(a) and (b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>, the learned District Judge erred in that he failed to acknowledge that a nephew could be acquired by marriage and, had he done so, he could and should have proceeded to a merits-based analysis of the application. </p>

Within this context, Mr Crabtree submits that there was ample interpretative scope for the learned District Judge to have concluded that the respondent was an &#8220;associated person&#8221; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> and erred in not so concluding. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr Crabtree further submits that the death of the respondent&#8217;s father did not act to change the position contended for above.  Whilst acknowledging that the dissolution of a marriage from which a familial relationship is derived might end that relationship unless statute provides otherwise (for example, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/10/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.10(5)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>) the court should look to the law of probate to determine whether the death of the respondent&#8217;s father meant the respondent ceased to be the step-nephew of the appellant.  In this regard, Mr Crabtree submits that the primary legislation in that area, namely the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Estates Act 1925</ref>, is geared to the preservations of familial relationships following death.  Whilst Mr Crabtree concedes that the there is no statutory recognition of relationships such as that of &#8220;step-nephew&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1925 Act</ref>, he further submits that this is not surprising given the rarity of divorces when <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1925 Act</ref> was under consideration and the prevalent views at that time with regard to re-marriage.  Within this context, Mr Crabtree submits that if the respondent was a &#8220;relative&#8221; of the appellant before the death of his father, he remains so after it and, further, that as the </p>

That proposal was enacted in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/42/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 42(2)</ref>, 62(3) and 63(1) (above). Although in the present case the brothers and their families do not live together, it is clear that they continued to be deeply involved in the family dispute, at least during 1998. It follows that the dispute between the brothers and the nephews is not only technically but genuinely within the ambit of Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>, and if that jurisdiction is not to be exercised, it must be for reasons other than the first reason advanced by the judge.&#8221; </p>

This case is, after all, about jurisdiction; it is not about the merits. If on a full enquiry the applicant is not entitled on the merits to the relief she seeks, she will not get it.&#8221; </p>

There seems no doubt at all that the strict and proper meaning of the word &#8220;nephew&#8221; is &#8220;son of a brother or sister&#8221;; and, similarly, &#8220;niece&#8221; means, in the strict sense, &#8220;daughter of a brother or sister&#8221;. But the meaning of each of these words is, in my judgment, susceptible of extension, having regard to the context and circumstance of the case, in two directions. First of all, the word may describe the child of a brother-in-law or of a sister-in-law; and, in the second place, I think that &#8220;nephew&#8221; is often used to indicate a niece&#8217;s husband and &#8220;niece&#8221; is often used to describe the wife of a nephew.&#8221; </p>

In respect to the question of the range of persons against whom an applicant may seek injunctive relief, the Law Commission Report (Law Com No. 207) on Family Law Domestic Violence and Occupation of the Family Home, published in 1992, concluded that a broader approach to providing protection from domestic abuse by means of a non-molestation order was merited.  At paragraph 3.8 of its report, the Law Commission concluded that:  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;We originally suggested in the working paper that non-molestation orders should be available to protect spouses, former spouses, cohabitants, former cohabitants and perhaps parents or those with parental responsibility,&#8217; and certain children.&#8221; But although domestic violence tends to be thought of as taking place in a &#8220;husband and wife&#8221; context, there is no doubt that harassment and violence can occur in many types of relationship. For example, abuse of the elderly by members of the family with whom they are living is coming increasingly to be recognised as a social problem&#8217; and significant numbers of women find it difficult or impossible to obtain protection from their violent teenage or adult sons.&#8221; The Council of Her Majesty&#8217;s Circuit Judges has stressed to us that instances of family violence by adolescent sons and against elderly people by members of their family have become quite common. In the light of the representations we have received, we now consider that there is a case for extending the range of applicants eligible for this protection. There is an argument for having no limitations at all, on the basis that it is difficult to see why there should be any restrictions on the ground of relationship or residence if the main aim of the legislation is to provide protection from violence or molestation for people who need it. Why should applicants have to prove the existence of facts which do not relate directly to their need for protection if orders are only available on the ground that they are necessary for this purpose? On the other hand, to remove all restrictions would involve the creation of something approaching a new tort of harassment or molestation.&#8221; And at paragraph 17:  </p>

When problems arise in close family relationships, the strength of emotions involved can cause unique reactions which may at times be irrational or obsessive. Whilst these reactions may most commonly arise between spouses and cohabitants, they can also occur in many other close relationships which give rise to similar stresses and strains and in which the people concerned will often continue to be involved with one another. The object of the law should be to provide a framework to enable people in this situation to continue their relationship in a civilised fashion.&#8221; </p>

We have not found this to be an easy task, but have eventually settled upon six types of relationship in addition to spouses, cohabitants, former spouses and former cohabitants&#8230; The second category includes immediate relatives, whether blood relatives or relatives by affinity, including in the case of cohabitants, people who would have been relative had the parties been married.

That definition controls the type of relationships, which are eligible for protection through non-molestation and occupation orders. It already, as the noble Baroness rightly says, includes a wide range of family members, including aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces, but, as she says, not cousins.  We would like to consider further whether cousins without a more precise definition may cover too wide a category of relative. For instance, should it cover first and second cousins? I believe that in some cultures "cousin" can be used to describe almost any blood relative. In our House, that may have some very interesting ramifications. It is important that we make any additions to the relevant person category of the Family Law Act consistent with what is already included. If the Committee is content, I would like to consider this matter further.

Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> is designed to provide swift and accessible protective remedies to persons of both sexes who are the victims of domestic violence, provided they fall within the criteria laid down by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/62" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 62</ref>.

This case is, after all, about jurisdiction; it is not about the merits. If on a full enquiry the applicant is not entitled on the merits to the relief she seeks, she will not get it.&#8221; </p>

Within this context, I further I accept Mr Crabtree&#8217;s submission that the context for the purposive interpretation of the statute is the still evolving recognition of the pernicious nature and damaging consequences of domestic abuse.  Further, and within that context, also relevant to my mind is the continued increase in the prevalence of so called &#8216;blended&#8217; families, as the result of divorce followed by re-marriage, in which it is very often the case that a range of step-relatives will be integral members of the new family.   </p>

Second, in my judgment there is a difficulty in using, as Mr Crabtree seeks to do, the list of persons set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/61/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.61(3)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> as an aid to interpreting the list of persons set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/61/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.61(3)</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, as the respective lists deal with different degrees of family relationship.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 63(1)</ref>(a) deals with relationships of lineal descent.  By contrast, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63(1)</ref>(b) deals with collateral relationships.  Thus, Mr Crabtree&#8217;s argument becomes one that contends that the fact that Parliament decided to include certain step-relationships with respect to family relationships of lineal descent must indicate that Parliament also have intended to do so in respect of certain collateral relationships, including that of nephews and nieces.  In my judgment, the structure of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> is apt to indicate the opposite, namely that Parliament was prepared to include certain step-relationships with respect to family relationships of lineal descent but decided not to include step-relationships in respect of any of the collateral family relationships stated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 63(1)</ref>(b) as falling within the definition of &#8220;relative&#8221; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am reinforced in these conclusion by consideration of the Parliamentary materials that I have summarised above, which materials make that Parliament was expressly concerned with the degree of genealogical proximity that would allow a person to fall into the category of &#8220;associated persons&#8221; who could obtain injunctive relief under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and, importantly, the need for that category to be confined to &#8220;close&#8221; or &#8220;immediate&#8221; relatives (a point reinforced in my judgment by the ultimate conclusion to specify &#8220;first cousins&#8221; rather than merely &#8220;cousins&#8221; in the amending statute during the passage of the Bill that became the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/28" uk:canonical="2004 c. 28" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004</ref>).  Families are, by genealogical reality, extended.  Indeed, if one is so minded, it is possible to continue almost <span style="font-style:italic">ad infinitum</span> to identify relatives of a given applicant for relief under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>.  If it was not to risk creating a new tort of molestation, in crafting a statute to protect members of a family from domestic abuse Parliament had to draw a line somewhere (see Law Commission Report (1992), <span style="font-style:italic">Domestic Violence and Occupation of the Family Home</span>, Law Com. No. 207, p. 20, paragraph 3.8).  With respect to relatives of the applicant, Parliament drew that line with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>.   Within this context, the Parliamentary material to which I have referred that speaks of &#8220;close&#8221; or &#8220;immediate&#8221; relatives, in my judgment supports the conclusion that Parliament intended the step-relationships covered by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref> to be confined to those <span style="font-style:italic">expressly</span> provided for in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and that had Parliament intended to include &#8220;step-nephews&#8221; as a category it would have said so in terms in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63(1)</ref>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In the alternative, Mr Crabtree invites the court to construe the phrase &#8220;nephew&#8230; by marriage&#8221; as encompassing a person in the position of the respondent.  However, in addition to the points I have set out above dealing with the difficulty in construing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> as encompassing a &#8220;step-nephew&#8221;, there are in any event additional difficulties with this submission.  Whilst I accept that there are decisions within the context of the law of probate stating that a &#8220;nephew&#8221; can be the son of a person&#8217;s brother-in-law or sisterin-law as well as the son of a person&#8217;s brother or sister, as was made clear by Vaisey J in <span style="font-style:italic">In Re Dauost</span>, the question of inheritance rights is a very different one to the question of protection from domestic abuse.  Within the context of family relationships, in so far as a formal category of nephew or niece by marriage recognised, such a relationship is ordinarily understood to be the spouse of one&#8217;s niece or nephew.  Within this context, and having regard to my conclusion that had Parliament intended to include &#8220;stepnephews&#8221; as a category it would have said so in terms in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/63/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63(1)</ref>, I am satisfied that the </p>
