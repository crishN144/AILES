He was born on 4 April 1913 and died on 28 July 2002. His last will dated 13 December 2000 was admitted to probate on 17 January 2003. His estate was sworn for probate at&#163;8,360,467 gross and &#163;8,356,400 net.</p>

By his first marriage, to Mary England Ella Myers, who was born on 15 March 1916, he had two children: a daughter, Beryl Anne Myers, born on 5 April 1944, and a son, Gordon Myers, born on 17 September 1946. The deceased separated from his first wife in the early 1950s. By his second marriage, to Eileen Myers, who was born on 14 October 1926, he had three children: a son, Frederick Hugh Myers, born on 21 June 1954, a daughter, Heather Rosemary Jane Turley, born on 6 December 1955, and a son, Holt William Myers, born on 31 March 1958.</p>

He made no testamentary provision at all either for his first wife, or for the children of his first marriage. The present proceedings are brought by his daughter by his first marriage, Beryl Anne Myers. Her Part 8 claim form was issued on 2 July 2003. She is, of course, qualified to bring the claim by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref>(c) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

Ms Miranda Allardice appeared for the claimant and Mr Thomas Brudenell for the estate. In addition to reading written statements from a number of witnesses, I heard oral evidence from the deceased&#8217;s first wife (the claimant&#8217;s mother), from the claimant and from the deceased&#8217;s youngest son.</p>

		    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.07in;margin-right:1.07in">&#8220;in regarding the circumstances and in applying the guide lines set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref>, it always has to be borne in mind that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, so far as it relates to applicants other than spouses, is an Act whose purpose is limited to the provision of reasonable maintenance. It is not the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to provide legacies or rewards for meritorious conduct. Subject to the court&#8217;s powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and to fiscal demands, an Englishman still remains at liberty at his death to dispose of his own property in whatever way he pleases or, if he chooses to do so, to leave that disposition to be regulated by the laws of intestate succession. In order to enable the court to interfere with and reform those dispositions it must, in my judgment, be shown, not that the deceased acted unreasonably, but that, looked at objectively, his disposition or lack of disposition produces an unreasonable result in that it does not make any or any greater provision for the applicant &#8211; and that means, in the case of an applicant other than a spouse for that applicant&#8217;s maintenance. It clearly cannot be enough to say that the circumstances are such that if the deceased had made a particular provision for the applicant, that would not have been an unreasonable thing for him to do and therefore it now ought to be done. The court has no carte blanche to reform the deceased&#8217;s dispositions or those which statute makes of his estate to accord with what the court itself might have thought would be sensible if it had been in the deceased&#8217;s position.&#8221;</p>

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.07in;margin-right:1.07in">&#8220;Sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section (1</ref>)(d) refers to &#8216;any obligations and responsibilities&#8217;. Plainly those obligations and responsibilities extend beyond legal obligations and that is why, in my view, the word &#8216;moral&#8217; has been used to underline and explain that the deceased&#8217;s obligations and responsibilities are not to be narrowly construed as legal obligations but to be taken into account in a broad sense of obligation and responsibility. Any other meaning of &#8216;moral&#8217; (such as the distinction between right and wrong, see Concise Oxford Dictionary) would more appropriately be considered under (g). There may have been some confusion in the minds of trial judges that the appellate court was placing a gloss upon the words of the section, and putting some special emphasis upon the requirements of subs (1)(d) so as to elevate moral obligation or special circumstance to some threshold requirement. From the judgments of this court in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re Coventry </span>to the present day, it should be clear that no gloss has been put upon subs (1)(d). An adult child is, consequently, in no different position from any other applicant who has to prove his case. The court has to have regard to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(1)</ref>(a)&#8211;(g) and assess the relevance and the weight to be given to each factor in the list. If the applicant is of working age, with a job or capable of obtaining a job which would be available, the factors in favour of his claim for financial provision may not be of much weight in the scales. As Oliver J pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re Coventry</span>, necessitous circumstances cannot be in themselves the reason to alter the testator&#8217;s dispositions. The passage from the judgment of Sir John Knox in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re Hancock </span>(above) is, in my respectful view, particularly helpful to remind us of the right way to approach this class of case under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.07in;margin-right:1.07in">&#8220;In the great majority of contested applications the court is involved in a balancing exercise among the many factors to which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1975 Act</ref> requires the court to have regard. Some factors may be neutral but many will go into the scales either in favour of or against the proposition that there has been a failure to make reasonable financial provision for the applicant. In <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re Coventry </span>&#8230; there was placed in the scales a factor of major weight against the proposition that there had been a failure to make reasonable financial provision and that was that the plaintiff was capable of earning, and was earning, his living. This meant that for the scales to be turned and for the court to find that there had been a failure to make reasonable financial provision for the plaintiff a factor of great weight would be needed in the opposite scale. Typically, the weightiest factor in favour of an applicant seeking to show that there has been a failure to make reasonable financial provision for him or her, is present when there is found to have been a moral obligation on the deceased to make financial provision for the applicant. But that factor was held by Oliver J not to be present in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re Coventry </span>&#8230;</p>

		    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.07in;margin-right:1.07in">[The] argument that an adult child cannot make a successful application, unless he or she can establish a moral obligation by the deceased or some other special reason to show that there was a failure to make reasonable provision, is only correct to the extent that it means that there must be some reason for the court to decide that the scales fall in favour of the conclusion that there has been a failure to make reasonable provision. So limited, the submission is a truism which does not advance the argument. What is not permissible is to use <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Re Coventry</span>, or indeed any other authority, to establish that any particular factor has to be placed on one side or the other of the scales. Of course there has to be a reason justifying a court&#8217;s conclusion that there has been a failure to make reasonable financial provision but the use of the phrase &#8220;special circumstance&#8221; does not advance the argument. The word &#8220;special&#8221; means no more than what is needed to overcome the factors in the opposite scale.&#8221;</p>

A good reason to exclude a member of the family has to be a relevant consideration. However, in my view, the recognition by the testator of the status of members of his family and his goodwill towards them and in this case towards the plaintiff are factors which it is proper to take into account under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(1)</ref>(g) and it is for the court to give such weight to those factors as may in the individual case be appropriate.&#8221;</p>

It is one of the functions of the Court of Appeal, in appropriate cases, to lay down general guidelines on the relative weights to be given to various factors in different circumstances. <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">M v B (Ancillary Proceedings: Lump Sum) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 1 FLR 53" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 1 FLR 53</ref>, emphasising the importance of providing the father of small children in the care of his divorced wife with accommodation in which he can receive them, is a good example of such a case. These guidelines, not expressly stated by Parliament, are derived by the courts from values about family life which it considers would be widely accepted in the community. But there are many cases which involve value judgments on which there are no such generally held views. The present case is a good example. Which should be given priority? The wife&#8217;s desire to continue to live in the matrimonial home where she can conveniently carry on her business and accommodate her sons, or the husband&#8217;s desire to return to England and establish himself here securely with his new family? In answering that question, what weight should be given to the history of the marriage and the respective contributions of the parties to the family assets? These are value judgments on which reasonable people may differ. Since judges are also people, this means that some degree of diversity in their application of values is inevitable and, within limits, an acceptable price to pay for the flexibility of the discretion conferred by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1973.

But in my judgment the word &#8216;maintenance&#8217; connotes only payments which, directly or indirectly, enable the applicant in the future to discharge the cost of his daily living at whatever standard of living is appropriate to him. The provision that is to be made is to meet recurring expenses, being expenses of living of an income nature. This does not mean that the provision need be by way of income payments. The provision can be by way of a lump sum, for example, to buy a house in which the applicant can be housed, thereby relieving him pro tanto of income expenditure.&#8221;</p>

Having obtained three O-level passes the claimant left Felixstowe College in 1960 when she was sixteen, preferring to study for her A-levels in London at an establishment known as Davies Laing &amp; Dick. But after only one term there the deceased wrote on 21 December 1960 withdrawing the claimant from the establishment. It was only under threat of legal action that the deceased agreed that she could resume her studies there, which she did on 3 May 1961. In the result the claimant obtained a further two O-levels and one A-level (in English). She was unable to study for a second A-level (in French), as recommended by the school, because the deceased refused to fund it. (I take these details from letters dated 31 October 1986 and 4 February 1987 the relevant passages in which I set out below.) According to the claimant, the deceased was unwilling to pay the fees for Davies Laing &amp; Dick because, as he told her, he considered an educated woman a &#8220;danger to society&#8221; (or words to that effect). She says that the only thing he was willing to pay for was a cookery course &#8211; an offer she declined. Be that as it may, the claimant accepts that the deceased in fact paid for her to attend Purley School of Commerce and Languages for a year after she had left Davies Laing &amp; Dick. Her working life &#8211; initially as a librarian &#8211; began in November 1962 when she was eighteen.</p>

She compares her limited employment opportunities, as a result, with Gordon&#8217;s. He has made a secure and successful career in the civil service. The claimant, in contrast, seems to have had a succession of jobs during the 1960s, some of which, she says, she disliked. At times, she says, she was on the dole. Her recollection &#8211; and we are talking of course about the events of some forty years ago, many of which, I suspect, are now seen by her through the distorting lens of disappointment and some bitterness &#8211; is of a period of what she calls &#8220;constant financial worries&#8221; and, indeed, &#8220;financial destitution both of myself, mother and Gordon&#8221;. Much of the time she lived at home. Apart from her earnings, her only income was &#163;5 a week from her grandfather&#8217;s estate, supplemented from about 1971 by a modest income she received from a small trust fund set up by her grandmother, the deceased&#8217;s mother.

That, I suspect, is a significant exaggeration, but her breakdown was real enough. Her GP&#8217;s notes in July 1970 record her as having a history of &#8220;anxiety state&#8221; and she was, she says, off work for more than six weeks. She went to stay with the deceased for about two and a half weeks. In one of her written statements prepared for the proceedings she says that the deceased was &#8220;cruel and harsh in his response to what had happened&#8221; and that she had to leave &#8220;since I was clearly not safe there&#8221;. That is unwarranted. Indeed, in her oral evidence the claimant accepted that the deceased had treated her kindly. I have no doubt, however, that what the claimant saw as the contrast between the lifestyle of the deceased&#8217;s second family and the lifestyle that she, her mother and Gordon were reduced to rankled with her.</p>

Her GP&#8217;s notes record on 14 February 2003 &#8220;a long history of depression and anxiety since her youth.&#8221; In 1973 she attempted suicide. In about 1974 she met a man to whom she seems to have taken a shine, but the relationship petered out. It is the only romantic episode to which she makes any reference in her evidence. By the early to middle 1970s the claimant was turning to what in the event became her career: teaching English to foreigners. In 1974 she obtained a certificate, but found that employment opportunities were limited because she did not have a degree. She says that she wanted to train as a teacher, but the deceased refused to fund it. She continued to have what she calls a succession of different jobs.</p>

But the account she received from Gordon of his visit persuaded her not to go, as arranged, to see her father on 10 January 1976. She told him that she would not be going to see him. In fact by a deed of appropriation dated 6 February 1976 and a deed of appointment dated 9 February 1976 the deceased nonetheless arranged for 3,500 Unilever shares to be put in trust for benefit of the claimant, the trusts, as I understand it, entitling her to receive the dividends but without giving her power to sell any of the shares.</p>

She went off to Spain for about ten weeks and returned to England in July 1976 with, as she puts it, her general health and sense of well-being considerably restored. Her evidence, both written and oral, is far from clear, but the impression I have is that she continued for the next four years with a succession of unmemorable jobs.</p>

Be that as it may, it seems that until about 1979 or 1980 she continued to see the deceased from time to time on the occasions when she went to see her grandmother. Those visits ended, when her grandmother moved to Devon, in about 1979 or 1980 (the grandmother died in 1984).

Without seeking to emulate the status of her half-brothers and half-sister, Miss Myers feels it to be reasonable that she should al least be put in the same position as her brother Gordon: indeed, since the latter has a stable Government job with an index-linked pension, her need is considerably greater than his and we would expect a Judge to recognize this.</p>

In the light of Mr Geoffrey Myers&#8217; wealth, that is a very modest sum, but he and his family would gain the assurance that no steps would be taken after his death that could lead to unseemly publicity. Furthermore, it has been Miss Myers&#8217; refusal to sign any waiver previously that had lead to the present estrangement between her and her Father and, if some financial settlement can now be achieved, Miss Myers hopes that that unhappy period in her life can be ended.&#8221;</p>

It was a present from a father to a daughter and a very nice one too, but I think it would be wrong to assume that it was designed necessarily to provide full maintenance although I suppose the capital has produced quite a pleasant income. In this particular case father has never maintained daughter since she finished with education and further education and was due to enter the world and do some work.</p>

I am therefore instructed to suggest that if your client would make over cash or marketable investments of a present value sufficient with the present value of the Unilever shares to give Beryl a capital sum worth somewhat more than the present value of the investments which Gordon has received from his Father, then he would obtain the necessary protection from Beryl against any litigation against his estate after his death.&#8221;</p>

I am enclosing an Estate Agent description of the type of house that I have been looking at in the Lewes area, illustrating only too well the difference. Indeed, one of the reasons I have been looking at houses in the Lewes area is that property prices there are <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">still </span>only approximately half what they would be for similar properties in London, even if, to you, they seem double by current Lincolnshire standards.</p>

However, Beryl&#8217;s assertion, made in her second Witness Statement, that my father &#8220;hoped that [she] would marry which meant that he would then be able to bestow a final provision on [her] and [her husband to be] as his blessing upon [their] marriage&#8221;, is conjecture.

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.08in">As I have said, in 1976 when the deceased settled the Unilever shares on the claimant there were 3,500 25p ordinary shares, but by the time the trustees came to execute the Deed of appointment in 1989 those shares had been split, five for one, so there were by then 17,500 5p ordinary shares. They were at that time worth, as I have said, &#163;93,800. On 13 October 1997, those shares were in turn split, four for one, so that had the claimant kept her portfolio intact she would have had a total of 70,000 1.25p ordinary shares. In fact by 1999 the claimant, as a result of sales she had made, had only 44,030 shares: I have no details of the dates or amounts of the sales, save that in March 1990 her financial situation was such that she was obliged to sell 300 shares. On 10 May 1999 the shares were consolidated, 100 new 1.4p shares replacing 112 old 1.25p shares. Thus the claimant&#8217;s 44,030 old shares were replaced with 39,312 new shares. On 19 September 2001 the claimant sold a further 4,500 shares, raising &#163;25,467.55 but leaving her with only 34,812 shares.</p>

When the deceased made his will on 13 December 2000 the portfolio, if it had remained intact, would have been worth &#163;325,000 (closing price on 13 December 2000 &#163;5.20). Just before the deceased&#8217;s death &#8211; he died on a Sunday &#8211; the market had closed at &#163;4.97 (closing price on 26 July 2002). The claimant&#8217;s portfolio was therefore worth &#163;173,015; had it been retained intact it would have been worth &#163;310,625. (These figures, of course, are a snapshot on a particular day and again make no allowance for the incidence of capital gains tax. On 29 July 2002, the day after the deceased&#8217;s death, the closing price had risen to &#163;5.14, making the claimant&#8217;s portfolio worth &#163;178,933.) Since the deceased&#8217;s death the claimant has sold more shares: 1,700 on 11 October 2002 for &#163;9,922.07; 950 on 30 May 2003 for &#163;5,296.83; 1,500 on 9 September 2003 for &#163;7,885.20; 2,000 on 12 February 2004 for&#163;10,427; and 1,500 on 23 April 2004 for &#163;7,938 &#8211; a total, since the deceased&#8217;s death, of 7,650 shares raising &#163;41,469.10. The result is that the claimant now has 27,162 shares which, at a closing price of &#163;5.25 as at the date of the hearing (11 June 2004), are worth a total of &#163;142,600.50; had her portfolio been maintained intact she would have had 62,500 shares worth a total of &#163;328,125.</p>

It was purchased with money provided by the deceased, albeit, as we have seen, it was at her insistence vested in his first wife rather than in his children as he had wished (see the deceased&#8217;s letter dated 15 February 1984 set out above). I am told that the claimant and Gordon each have a charge on the property as security for the sum of&#163;1,600. The claimant&#8217;s mother has made a will leaving the property jointly to her two children. The claimant&#8217;s expectations however must inevitably be tempered by her knowledge that the property has been Gordon&#8217;s home for over 40 years and that her ability to realise her share of the property may accordingly be restricted.</p>

The claimant is the only applicant, so I can ignore paragraph (b). The defendant children defend the claim explicitly on the basis that, although they each have significant financial obligations and responsibilities towards their respective families &#8211; all three are married and have children &#8211;, they are all financially secure and are able to meet any reasonable award made in the claimant&#8217;s favour. They have in fact, by a Deed of Agreement dated 8 April 2003, agreed to share equally the burden of meeting any award made in favour of the claimant. So they put forward no case under paragraph (c). The only relevance of paragraph (c) therefore &#8211; but this is an important point &#8211; is that there is no need here to balance the claimant&#8217;s needs against the defendants&#8217; needs: this is an estate where there is more than enough to meet the needs of all parties.

Her debts, apart from unpaid legal costs, comprise the outstanding balances on various credit cards amounting to some &#163;32,777. I do not know what her credit card debts were when the deceased died, but two months later, in September 2002, they amounted to &#163;5,547, so since then she has spent some &#163;27,230. Some &#163;6,000 of this represents payment of her legal costs, the remaining &#163;21,230, as I understand it, has gone on general living expenses. Of the total of &#163;41,469.10 which the claimant has realised from the sale of her shares since the deceased&#8217;s death, something of the order of &#163;23,900 has gone in payment of legal costs and the remaining &#163;17,500 or so in general living expenses. In other words, in the period since the deceased&#8217;s death &#8211; a little short of two years &#8211; the claimant appears to have got through some &#163;38,730 in general living expenses.</p>

She has been living on the income of the Unilever shares, supplemented, as I have said, by selling some of the shares and running up substantial credit card debts. Following her sixtieth birthday on 4 April 2004, the claimant has qualified for the state pension, &#163;71.54 per week.

Mr Brudenell says that it should be in this country. The claimant argues convincingly, and with the support of evidence from an English friend of hers in Paris, that Paris is her <span style="font-style:italic">pays de coeur</span>. I accept that. Although her long-term plan is to buy a property in England she wants to retain a <span style="font-style:italic">pied &#225; terre </span>in Paris for the foreseeable future and as long as her health holds out. There is a question as to whether she will be able to remain in her existing flat: there is some dispute with her landlord. Large numbers of property particulars have been produced by each side showing the cost of purchasing the kinds of flat in Surrey and in Paris that might be suitable for the claimant. Mr Brudenell says that the claimant could be reasonably rehoused in Surrey at a figure in the range of &#163;180,000 - &#163;220,000; Ms Allardice says that it would be more like &#163;250,000 - &#163;275,000. Mr Brudenell says that the reasonable cost of rehousing in Paris would be some &#163;230,000 - &#163;250,000; Ms Allardice says it would be more like &#163;275,000 - &#163;330,000 or even more. She puts the claim at &#163;335,000, inclusive of the costs of acquisition. Mr Brudenell says a reasonable figure is &#163;200,000.</p>

In relation to this latter budget Mr Brudenell draws attention to three items in particular: service charges for a new flat estimated at&#163;2,134 per annum; professional fees for the financial management of a &#8216;Duxbury&#8217; fund in the sum of &#163;3,660 per annum; and medical insurance in the annual sum of &#163;2,231. He suggests that more realistic figures for these three items would be &#163;1,400, &#163;1,000 and &#163;1,500 respectively. In relation to the last item he points out that in September 2003 the claimant obtained quotations from three companies, one at an annual payment of &#163;876, one at an annual payment of &#163;1,534 and the other at an annual payment of &#163;2,231, and that for no very apparent reason the claimant has simply selected the most expensive. Overall, he said, a proper figure is &#163;20,000 per annum. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Future care</span>: A BUPA quotation dated 26 January 2004 quotes a single premium of &#163;24,744 to provide future care help at the rate of &#163;1,666 per month.</p>

She also suffers from back problems &#8211; though they are not as serious as she would have it &#8211; and will also need a total left hip replacement at some time in the future. A medical report dated 31 March 2004 prepared by a jointly instructed expert &#8211; Mr Jonathan Jones, a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon &#8211; shows that her back problems date back for over 20 years. But he is clear that the claimant does <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">not </span>require permanent and regular treatment. She will require intermittent conservative treatment for the symptoms of her mechanical back problems as and when they occur. She will <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">not </span>require surgical treatment, but physiotherapy, chiropractic treatment or acupuncture. He says that the claimant will be able to undertake sedentary work without any difficulty, and that neither her back nor her hip problems would preclude this.</p>

He was able to show that the deceased had made substantial financial provision for the claimant during his lifetime by giving her shares which, if she had retained them, would have been worth no less than &#163;310,000 when he died. It is equally the fact, as I find, that the claimant has made much less of her life than she might have done. Many unmarried women entering the job market in 1962 with qualifications no better than the claimant&#8217;s have been able to achieve much more than she has ever done and, more to the point, been able to make much better provision for their retirement and old age than the claimant has been able to achieve. Moreover, the claimant has not simply been the victim of fate and misfortune. Some at least &#8211; I suspect many &#8211; of her wounds have been self-inflicted. After all, in January 1976 she threw up her position as an established civil servant.</p>

The fact is that her only capital consisted of shares worth about &#163;200,000. She was living in a miserably small rented flat and had few personal possessions beyond the clothes she stood up in. She had no private pension. For the future all she had to look forward to was surviving on the state pension and the income from her shares.</p>

On the basis of the evidence, and applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Re Coventry </span>principle that the claimant is entitled to a decent and comfortable though not a luxurious standard of living, I conclude that she will need &#163;275,000 to acquire a suitable flat in Paris.</p>

In principle, in my judgment, it should be the latter, for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> is not to award legacies or to make capital provision for claimants, however deserving, but simply to make provision for their maintenance. The sum of &#163;275,000 will, accordingly, be settled on trust for the claimant for life, with remainder to the deceased. There will be two trustees: one to be appointed by the claimant and the other by the executors of the deceased&#8217;s estate. The claimant will be entitled to require the trustees to invest the fund in a property, either in France or in this country, to be occupied by her rent free as long as she wishes; and she will also be entitled to require the trustees to sell the property and buy a substitute property to be occupied by her on the same terms. If a time comes when she is unable to go on living in her own home the income of the fund will be available to meet the costs of supported housing or residential care. The claimant is concerned that with her heredity &#8211; she told me of members of her family who lived into their nineties and in one case well past one hundred &#8211; she may be left financially insecure in her extreme old age, particularly if she is not able to have recourse to the capital of this fund to meet the costs of her accommodation. I propose to meet this concern in two ways. First, the trustees of the fund will have power at any time in their absolute discretion to apply any part of the capital of the fund in such manner as they think fit to or for the benefit of the claimant. Secondly, and I here adopt a suggestion made by Mr Brudenell, the trustees will be required to pay the entire capital of the trust fund to the claimant if she outlives her current expectation of life, that is, rounding up the life expectancy tables shown in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">At a Glance 2004-2005</span>, on her 88<span style="font-size:8pt">th </span>birthday if she lives that long.</p>

Recognising that I am driven to little more than plucking a figure out of the air &#8211; though neither party was really able to suggest any more scientific approach &#8211; I propose to award the claimant the sum of &#163;20,000, being the sum which in my judgment is reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>

I note in this connection, as I have already pointed out, that the claimant&#8217;s living expenses in the period since the deceased&#8217;s death &#8211; a little short of two years &#8211; seem to have amounted to some &#163;38,730. So all in all it seems to me that a figure of&#163;20,000 per annum is reasonable. The claimant&#8217;s shares generate an annual income of about &#163;4,000, so her net requirement is for a sum of &#163;16,000 per annum. That sum obviously requires to be capitalised. (I put it this way because it seems to me, notwithstanding Mr Brudenell&#8217;s submissions to the contrary, that the claimant should be credited with the income of her shares as against her annual budget rather than, as he would prefer, because it will cost the estate less,<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.08in">The preceding paragraphs are the judgment in the form in which it was handed down (without the need for attendance by the parties and in fact without the parties being present) on 3 August 2004. Subsequently Mr Brudenell wrote to me suggesting that I might have misunderstood the suggestion he had made and which is recorded in the final sentence of paragraph [90] above. Mr Brudenell and Ms Allardice are agreed that the only concession he made was that the trustees should have a discretion &#8211; a <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">power </span>&#8211; to advance capital to the claimant (but without being under any <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">duty </span>to do so) in the event that she outlives her current life expectancy, that is, if she attains the age of 88. Paragraph [90], it will be appreciated, goes beyond Mr Brudenell&#8217;s concession in two respects: first, because it provides that the trustees are to have power to apply<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:10pt"/>capital <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">at any time</span>; secondly, because it provides that the trustees are to be under a <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">duty </span>to pay the entire capital to the claimant if she is still alive on her 88<span style="font-size:8pt">th </span>birthday. I readily accept that I did indeed either misunderstand or misrecord Mr Brudenell&#8217;s concession &#8211; it matters not which &#8211; and I accordingly invited counsel to make any further submissions they might wish in relation to the latter part of paragraph [90]. I am not, of course, confined by Mr Brudenell&#8217;s concession. The question is what my decision on the point should be, given Mr Brudenell&#8217;s concession, but having regard to all the circumstances and to the further submissions on the point that I have now received from both counsel.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.07in">Mr Brudenell submits, consistently with the scheme of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and, indeed, with the general approach I have adopted in paragraph [90], that the fund should only be applied for the claimant&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">maintenance </span>and not more generally for her <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">benefit </span>(cf the well established contrast between maintenance and benefit in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/31/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 31(1)</ref>(i) and 32(1) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trustee Act 1925</ref>). He points out that the &#8216;Duxbury&#8217; fund I have awarded the claimant ought in principle to satisfy her income needs until she is 88, so that there are unlikely to be circumstances in which it will be appropriate to make further provision for her prior to then, but he is nonetheless content to accept that the trustees should have the power to apply capital for the claimant&#8217;s maintenance at any time. But he submits that it is quite inappropriate for the trustees to be required to pay her the entire capital if and when she attains the age of 88. That, he says, will simply give the claimant what may turn out to be a very large windfall of which she may very well have no need and which she might end up giving to charity. All in all, he submits, it is enough that the trustees have a <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">power </span>to apply capital where appropriate in meeting the claimant&#8217;s maintenance requirements.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.07in">Ms Allardice in effect turns Mr Brudenell&#8217;s argument against him, pointing out that the &#8216;Duxbury&#8217; fund will have exhausted itself by the time the claimant reaches the age of 88 and asserting that it is inappropriate to condemn someone of the claimant&#8217;s hereditary longevity to reliance thereafter upon nothing more than the exercise of the trustees&#8217; discretion in her favour. She submits that I ought to require the trustees to make the whole of the capital available. The outright release of the capital to the claimant in this way would enable her, for example, to enter into an equity release scheme, or to &#8216;downsize&#8217; and apply the surplus funds for living and care expenses, or to go into supported housing or residential care without being confined to what Ms Allardice suggests might be the unsatisfactory kind of provision that would be inevitable if the claimant were to have access to no more than the income of the fund rather than being able to access the capital as well.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.07in">With the benefit of these additional submissions I recognise the need, though only in two respects, to vary the terms of the trust as I had originally envisaged them. In my judgment Mr Brudenell is correct in asserting that the application of the fund should be confined to the claimant&#8217;s maintenance and in his submission that it is inappropriate &#8211; in fact wrong in principle &#8211; to give the claimant what may well turn out to be a windfall. On the other hand, I agree with Ms Allardice that the matter should not simply be left to the exercise of the trustees&#8217; discretion. Accordingly, and in substitution for the provisions set out in the last two sentences of paragraph [90] above, the trust will contain the following provisions. First, the trustees of the fund will have power at any time in their absolute discretion to apply any part of the capital of the fund in such manner as they think fit for or towards the <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">maintenance </span>of the claimant. Secondly, from and after the claimant&#8217;s 88<span style="font-size:8pt">th </span>birthday, if she lives that long, the trustees will be <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">required </span>from time to time, if so requested by the claimant, to apply such part of the capital of the fund as may in all the circumstances, and having regard to the claimant&#8217;s other resources, reasonably be required for her maintenance (including the ongoing costs of her housing or other accommodation).</p>
