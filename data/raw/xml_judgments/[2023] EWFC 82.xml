	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W&#8217;s background was in journalism but after the birth of the elder child her work outside the home dried up and she increasingly became a full-time mother and homemaker. H was a financial journalist until about the time that cohabitation began, when he became an equities analyst. After several career moves he joined a start-up hedge fund in 2007 as a founding partner and resigned in 2014 to consider his options. It was during this career break that he decided to set up his own hedge fund business, which I shall call SC, and he used his leave to make the necessary plans. </p>

The amount put in was &#163;3.855m by way of founding capital from 2015-2016 followed by a total of another &#163;9m invested in his name from January 2018 onwards. In addition, at the outset he invested with the business his SIPP with a current value of &#163;2.6m and a bond now worth net of CGT &#163;1.754m. I shall refer to this in greater detail later in this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In early 2017 H commenced a short-lived affair. He ended it after about six weeks and told W. That commenced a period of acute stress for the family because H&#8217;s former girlfriend began a campaign of public and private harassment and stalking of both H and W. Its effect was difficult for H, but it was acutely traumatic for W. It was deeply unpleasant in its character and even now has left a residue of deep distress. </p>

W contends that it was a gift to her expressly to use as she wished and made by way of partial amends for H&#8217;s misbehaviour and that it would be inequitable if she should be required now to share it with H. H says that I should treat it as one of the resources available to W and that it should be shared along with the other matrimonial assets. </p>

Its investments are a combination of long positions (where the fund gains from an increase in the relevant share price) and which are held for 1-4 years and short positions (where the decline in the share price produces a gain for the fund) and which are held for a shorter period of 12-18 months in general.</p>

To put it another way, the AUM has declined.

As a result, the fund value which at the end of 2022 was approaching 30% below the high-water mark figure required to make payable a performance fee is now only 10% down.  H believes that the assets in which he has invested the investors&#8217; funds are significantly undervalued.

As I have mentioned, the former have somewhat exceeded the latter over the lifetime of the business. In only one year have the performance fees exceeded the management fees but in that year the performance fees (for the business as a whole rather than just H&#8217;s 62.5% interest) were some &#163;13.2m against management fees of &#163;4.7m. Thus it is simply shown that H has the capacity in favourable market conditions to earn very large sums. Over the last five years he has received in total &#163;30.68m gross, the highest figure being his profit share in 2021 (based on the calendar year 2020) when he received &#163;10.336m gross as his profit share.</p>

Both agree that the business is unsellable at the moment and only in their oral evidence did it become clear that the figures that they were estimating were simply their best calculation as to the value of the business to H, rather than the value to any third party. In other words, it was a form of capitalisation of a predicted profit share. Dr Bateson assumed a figure of &#163;12m in the event that H were to plan his retirement over a period of five years but that was on the basis of a 100% interest (when H owns only 62.5%), it was pre-tax and assumed minimal running costs of the business. Mr Taylor was more pessimistic but both experts readily recognised that their calculations were theoretical and could be a long way out depending on external events. </p>

W has spent a large sum of money on the matrimonial home since separation. She has said that she intends to spend a further &#163;110k to complete its renovation.

The fact that I have declined to accede to any Wells sharing of the hypothetical future value of the Group does not mean that the income which it generates for the husband is irrelevant in terms of the consideration of the fairness of any award which I make in this case. I am satisfied that, for so long as the structure exists and for so long as the Fund continues to perform in the way it has done, this husband will continue to receive a very substantial personal income as a result of his ownership of the structure, directly or indirectly. Whether or not he chooses to give that income, or part of it, away is entirely a matter for him.

I accept that the wife was on risk in relation to further losses in the Fund. The fact that I am not drawing any valuation line other than as at the date of the hearing means that her entitlement to benefit from the subsequent uplift and share in the Fund&#8217;s recovery (reflected in the husband&#8217;s personal holding of units) will be reflected in the share she will receive from those funds which represent both marital acquest and post-separation accrual. Whilst I shall come on to the precise figures once I have considered the issue of overall computation and special contribution, it is not my intention that this wife should receive no share of the assets which fall outside the marital acquest in this case. She will receive a share and that share will form part and parcel of the overall award which I will make on the basis of fairness to both parties. There is no question of her entitlement to any element of post-separation accrual being triggered by a &#8216;needs&#8217; argument but I take the view that, notwithstanding the exponential increase in the growth of the Fund post-separation, its genesis as a matrimonial asset is a factor of considerable significance. That factor must, in my view, find its reflection in the overall quantum of the financial award she will receive at the conclusion of these proceedings. It goes to the heart of what I consider to be fair in the overall context of the case.</span></p>

Whilst it is true that they reflect a significant amount of post-separation endeavour and new investments represented by the husband&#8217;s unmatched contribution, they are nevertheless likely to fall in (in whatever sums eventually become payable) as a significant accretion to the substantial income he generates through receipt of his share of the management fees. In that sense they are, in my view, more properly categorised as a quasi-income receipt rather than a capital receipt. Because of the impossibility of drawing an accurate &#8216;bright line&#8217; in determining what value should properly be attributed to the &#8216;marital&#8217; element of this category of receipts, I have decided that the fairer way of dealing with this aspect of the case is to reflect the husband&#8217;s far greater future income as one aspect of my determination in respect of the overall fairness of the percentage division which the wife will receive.</span></p>

To do so he would need to inform his investors of what he was doing and why. Now that the parties know the sum that the Court is ordering H to pay and the extent to which W receives a <span style="font-style:italic">Wells </span>order, H will need to consider the period over which he asks that the payment should be made.</p>

Whatever the feelings about the breakdown of the marriage, it is clear that W trusts H in terms of his management of the business because otherwise she would not have been content for the investments to be made in 2021 and 2022. I hope that they will be able to agree the issue of security and that they will not need to enter into complex legal arrangements to cover this issue. I too thought that H&#8217;s word in relation to the business was likely to be trustworthy but, if they need to, the parties can revert to Court for directions as to implementation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The touchstone in the division of assets between divorcing spouses is always that of fairness. If the parties agreed what was fair, then the matter would not have come before me. I regard it as fair that the division that I have imposed gives W marginally more of the assets than H will retain. This division properly reflects the assets they have built up together, adjusted for the monetary gift in the circumstances that it was made. Over the years to come that difference is very likely to be reversed as H continues to work in the business. That too is a fair and proper reflection of future endeavour. </p>
