	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am asked to decide whether this court has jurisdiction in relation to R.  R is the child of HL (the mother) and SF (the father).  The parents are separated.  The mother is a South Korean national.  When present in the United Kingdom her immigration status is governed by a spousal visa which expires on 1 December 2015.  The father is British and resides in England.  R holds joint South Korean and British nationality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents met in the United Kingdom in the autumn of 2010 when the mother was in this country on a holiday visa.  They commenced a romance.  By the time the mother returned to South Korea she was pregnant with R.  The father travelled to South Korea for R&#8217;s birth in October 2011.  The father made a further three trips to South Korea during the course of 2012.  The parties married in the British Consulate in South Korea in 2012.  In March 2013 the mother was granted a spousal visa for the United Kingdom.</p>

A mere two weeks later the mother returned to South Korea without notifying the father.  As set out below, the mother contends that her short period in England with R in 2013 was characterised by the father being domestically violent towards her.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following the mother&#8217;s departure, the father instructed lawyers in South Korea with regard to obtaining orders in South Korea to facilitate access to R.  He also instructed his lawyers to issue divorce proceedings in South Korea.  Those applications are ongoing in South Korea and have yet to be determined.   Following the mother returning to South Korea in March 2013 the father did not see R for a period of two years.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In December 2014 the mother states that she contacted the father with a view to restoring the father&#8217;s relationship with R.  In April 2015 the mother agreed to the father travelling to South Korea to see R.  The father remained in South Korea between April 2015 and August 2015.  At some point during this period of time the mother agreed to come and live in the United Kingdom with R.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother and R arrived in England on 7 August 2015.  On 23 August 2015 the father alleges that he was subjected to an incident of domestic abuse by the mother.  Whatever the exact circumstances of this incident, the father makes clear in the papers he has filed with the court that R witnessed this incident of domestic violence, which incident the father alleges involved the mother attacking the father by punching and kicking him when drunk and banging on the door when he shut himself and R into a room.  The mother was arrested but later released without charge (the mother says she was released after the police saw bruises on her, the father says she was released after he declined to press charges).  For her part the mother contends that the father had inflicted bruises on her through domestic violence over the days prior to the incident on 23 August 2015.  The mother alleges that the father took her phone and her bank card.  I note again that when the mother was in England for a brief period in 2013 the father was arrested following an incident of domestic violence between the parties and was thereafter released without charge.</p>

On 26 August 2015, a little under three weeks after R arrived in this jurisdiction, the father made without notice applications for wardship and a passport order, which orders were granted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents dispute many of the facts concerning the circumstances of their relationship between 2010 and 2015.  However, they appear to agree that both parents came to the view earlier this year that they should spend a significant period of time in England.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father suggests that the mother and R returned with him to England so that they could &#8220;live as a family&#8221;.  His evidence is that the parties intended to move permanently to England. In the past the father has travelled to South Korea and appears to have intended at one point to emigrate to that country.  The mother suggests that the father had arrived in South Korea in April 2015 with multiple ideas for starting a business in that country but that none of the ideas were sufficiently fully formed.  Within this context the mother says that part of the motivation for the parents agreeing to return to England for a period of time was to allow greater preparations to be made for an ultimate return to South Korea.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother further states that when he was visiting South Korea earlier this year the father had the idea that the mother and R should come to England for two years to enable R to learn English, during which time, as I have said, the family could make plans for an eventual return to Korea to pursue the business ideas that were at that stage not fully developed by the father.  The mother states she had thought previously about whether she should spend some time with R in an English speaking jurisdiction.  She did not necessarily plan to take R to England to learn English and contemplated taking her to Australia.  It would appear that the plan to take her to England crystallised when it became apparent that there might be a chance to salvage her relationship with the father.  The mother states that at no point was it her intention to leave South Korea with R permanently.  Before arriving in England the mother agrees that she paid the father a substantial sum of money with a view to him renting a property for the family to live in together.</p>

In such circumstances, he contends that this court has jurisdiction in respect of R by virtue of the provisions of Art 8 of Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 (the Regulation).  In the alternative, Dr George submits that if R is not habitually resident in England then she is not habitually resident in any Member State of the European Union and Art 14 of the Regulation applies such that jurisdiction is determined by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(1)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> and this court has jurisdiction by virtue of R&#8217;s presence in England at the time proceedings were issued.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, as to the issue of forum, Dr George submits that if the English court has jurisdiction in respect of R then, applying the principles set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Consulex </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] AC 460" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] AC 460</ref>, the appropriate forum for determining the welfare issues in respect of R is the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  Within this context, Dr George points out that it is for the mother in this case to demonstrate that England is not the appropriate forum and to apply for these proceedings to be stayed. Whilst Dr George concedes that the mother will more easily achieve this end if any jurisdiction of the English court is based on presence as opposed to habitual residence, Dr George nonetheless submits that even were jurisdiction to be founded on the presence of R the mother is not able to demonstrate that England is the not appropriate forum.  Specifically, he relies on the fact that neither parent speaks the other&#8217;s language (and hence neither England nor South Korea has an advantage as a venue in terms of language) and that the mother is already in England.  In respect of the mother&#8217;s immigration difficulties, having regard to the fact that R has British nationality and the decision of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">ZH(Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/4" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 4</ref>, Dr George submits that the mother would likely be permitted to remain in the United Kingdom upon the expiration of her spousal visa.</p>

Beyond the provision of schooling and medical care for R, Mr Squire points to the fact that the plans were not well formed in relation to the idea that the parents would pursue a business together in this jurisdiction.  In particular, Mr Squire points to the fact that the only mention in the father&#8217;s statement of any type of business is the father&#8217;s allegation (vehemently denied by the mother) that the mother wished to set up a brothel in England when she was in this jurisdiction in 2013.</p>

It is not necessary for me to descend to detail. The legal structure for these issues in an international private family case is plain. The court first determines whether or not the court in England and Wales has jurisdiction. It does so, depending on the countries involved, with or without reference to various international provisions. In a case such as this, which is not one between Member States of the EU, the approach is straightforward. The court decides jurisdiction and decides it with regard to the habitual residence of the child at the relevant time. That determination in this case has been made and is not open to review or challenge and was not open to review or challenge at the hearing before Newton J.</p>

As noted, in total R has spent a little under five weeks in England over the course of her life.  In my judgment it is particularly significant that those five weeks have not, on the evidence before the court, comprised a very stable social and family environment for R.  As noted above, on 23 August 2015 the father alleges that he was subjected to an incident of domestic abuse by the mother.  The mother alleges that the father was the perpetrator on that day and on days prior to 23 August.  Whatever the exact nature of the incident or incidents, the father makes clear in the papers he has filed with the court that R witnessed an incident of domestic violence.  When the mother was in England for a brief period in 2013 the father was arrested following an incident of domestic violence between the parties and was thereafter released without charge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In determining the question of whether a child has attained a degree of integration in a social and family environment, the stability of the child&#8217;s life within the contended for social and family environment will be relevant, particularly in cases where the period of alleged integration is short.  In my judgment, where the child&#8217;s situation is unsettled, whether physically or emotionally, it will be harder to establish that the child has a degree of integration in a social and family environment, particularly in cases where the child has been in the social and family environment in question for only a very short period of time.  In this case the unsettled and chaotic nature of the parents&#8217; relationship is in my judgment a fact which tends to militate against a conclusion that, during the very short period that R was in the jurisdiction before proceedings were commenced, R attained the requisite degree of integration into a social and family environment in England such as to change her habitual residence.  The fact that the mother&#8217;s immigration status is now insecure by reason of the divorce proceedings issued by the father in South Korea further undermines the stability of R&#8217;s family environment in this jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In assessing whether R attained the requisite degree of integration in a social and family environment over the little under three weeks she was in this jurisdiction before proceedings commenced, I must also have regard to the fact R&#8217;s family environment in England is one in which she and her father do not speak the same language and had a very limited relationship by virtue of the fact they had not seen each other for some two years.  In my judgment, these facts also further militate against a conclusion that R was integrated into a social and family environment in England to a degree sufficient to result in a change of habitual residence.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the practical steps taken to implement the plans made by the parents, I have already accepted that the parents took the tangible steps of obtaining a lease on a residence, or enrolling R in nursery and registering R with a general practitioner.  However, as submitted by Mr Squire, it is in my judgment significant that those tangible steps went no further.  R never attended nursery because the parents&#8217; reconciliation broke down within days.  For the same reason, R never attended her general practitioner.  The mother and R left the property the parents had rented following what, on any analysis, was an extremely unpleasant period in the parents already sporadic and difficult relationship.  The father provides no details whatsoever the alleged business that he contends the parents planned to set up in England.  In these circumstances, I accept Mr Squire&#8217;s submission that the parents&#8217; plans had not been the subject of the implementation and subsequent re-affirmation that would speak to the integration of R in a social and family environment.  By the time proceedings were issued a little under three weeks after the arrival of R in the jurisdiction she had neither attended nursery nor used the services of the general practitioner and had left the &#8216;family&#8217; home rented by the parents. </p>

Whilst I accept that in some cases it is possible for habitual residence to change over a very short space of time, indeed within one day, this is not such a case.  It simply cannot be said in my judgment, having regard to the matters of fact set out above, that over the period of a little under three weeks between R&#8217;s arrival in this jurisdiction and the issue of proceedings that she achieved a degree of integration in social and family environment sufficient to result in a change of habitual residence.  Rather, for the reasons I have already given, in my judgment it is plain that in all the circumstances of this case R is habitually resident in South Korea.</p>

This in my judgment constitutes a real and substantial connection to the jurisdiction of South Korea.  In my judgment, having regard to her best interests as an important consideration in my determination of the issue of forum, it is in R&#8217;s best interests for her welfare to be determined by the courts of the country in which she is habitually resident.  It is those courts which are best placed to determine what is in R&#8217;s welfare interests having regard to the context provided by her life and needs in South Korea.  In addition to the important (but not determinative) factor of R&#8217;s habitual residence, there are also in my judgment further connecting factors which point to South Korea being the appropriate forum.   </p>

The mother is a national of South Korea.  She is able to reside in that jurisdiction legally.  By contrast to the ability of the father to travel lawfully to South Korea and the ability of the mother to reside lawfully in South Korea, the mother&#8217;s position in this jurisdiction is now precarious by reason of the divorce proceedings issued by the father in South Korea.  The mother&#8217;s spousal visa will expire on 1 December 2015.  Whilst both Dr George and Mr Squire engaged in a degree of speculation as to the mother&#8217;s position after this deadline, the court must proceed on the basis that from the 1 December 2015 the mother, who is the primary carer for R, will not be entitled to remain in this jurisdiction, with all of the difficulties attendant on that position.</p>

Having regard to the evidence before me, I further find no other circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused.  Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I conclude not only that England is not the natural and appropriate forum but that South Korea is clearly and distinctly more the appropriate forum in this case.</p>
