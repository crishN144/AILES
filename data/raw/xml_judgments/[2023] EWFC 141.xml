The December 2022 order set the amount of maintenance for the parties child (A) at &#163;2,684 per month (see para.[5]) and thereafter the maintenance would be calculated as follows:</p>

The father&#8217;s case in summary is that he agreed the formula for maintenance set out at para.[4] of the order (see &#167;2 above) because this had been expressly promoted by Mostyn J as the proper approach to the computation of maintenance above the Child Maintenance Service (&#8216;CMS&#8217;) level at that earlier hearing, and repeated in his judgment: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2022/118" uk:canonical="[2022] EWFC 118" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWFC 118</ref> at [44] (see &#167;9 below).

This would give a total award of &#163;63,804 per annum in this case.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Two weeks later, the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Collardeau-Fuchs</span> was published; in that judgment, Mostyn J was dealing with a claim under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (&#8216;MCA 1973&#8217;) which focused to some degree on financial provision for the children of the family.  He qualified (at [32]) his views about the general application of the CMS<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>formula (from <span style="font-style:italic">CB v KB</span>), indicating that it would not be appropriate where the court was considering a &#8216;HECSA&#8217; (a <span style="color:#000000">Household Expenditure Child Support Award).  </span>He referenced a number of differences between a claim for unsecured child periodical payments mounted under Schedule 1 <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref> and a claim mounted under the MCA 1973 or the <span style="color:#000000">MFPA 1984.

Along with the claim for a home for the child it will be the centrepiece of the litigation. In contrast, a claim for unsecured child payments mounted under the 1973 or 1984 Acts will be distinctly subsidiary to the primary claim made by the parent as a spouse. A child periodical payments claim made as part of a routine financial remedy claim by a spouse following a divorce will generally be dealt with perfunctorily. Indeed, the court will have no jurisdiction in the majority of cases to deal with child support unless there has been an agreement between the parties under the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref>.

It will be a rare case where the court in a financial remedy claim between divorcing spouses will spend much time and forensic energy analysing a child maintenance budget. In contrast, in a case under Schedule 1 the child maintenance budget is the principal litigation battleground</span>.&#8221; (Emphasis by underlining added).</p>

This leads to the per capita <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">anomalies</span> identified by Moor J. The amount that would be payable under the formula where the father&#8217;s income is &#163;650,000 (and there is no shared care, and no other child living with him) is (when rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000) &#163;60,000 for a single child, &#163;40,000 for each of two children, and &#163;33,000 for each of three children. While it is true that there will be economies of scale where there is more than one child in a family unit, it is obvious, at least to me, that a single child does not cost anything like 50% more to rear than each of a pair of children, let alone 80% more than each of a trio of children.</p>

It is true that the figures would be reduced if there was a degree of shared care but that mitigation does not alter the fact that the headline figures produced by an extension of the formula to incomes in the range &#163;156,001 - &#163;650,000 are <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">unrealistically high and are in my opinion unhelpful as starting points</span>.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There can be little doubt that Mostyn J at [44] of his judgment delivered on 19 October 2022 (see again &#167;9 above) had steered the parties towards adopting the &#8216;useful guideline&#8217; of the CMS formula to the father&#8217;s gross annual income disclosed in the tax return to the surplus up to &#163;650,000; this had become a well-known approach over many years deriving most recently from <span style="font-style:italic">CB v KB</span>, and adopted in other reported cases subsequently.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There can also be little doubt that the &#8216;guideline&#8217; earlier promoted by Mostyn J has effectively been abandoned by his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">James v Seymour</span>.  This happened within a relatively short time (less than 4 months) of the consent order, and the father has acted reasonably promptly in making this application (see <span style="font-style:italic">Barder v Barder &amp; Caluori </span>above).  The seed of doubt about this methodology had almost certainly been sown by Moor J&#8217;s comments in <span style="font-style:italic">CMX v EJX, </span>where he referred to the &#8216;significant disadvantages&#8217; of the <span style="font-style:italic">CB v KB</span> approach to topping up child maintenance.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a most unusual situation.  I have considered carefully whether it can be said that the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">James v Seymour</span>, in which the judge effectively rescinded the guidance which he himself had first formulated more than 20 years ago in <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">GW v RW&#160;</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2003/611" uk:canonical="[2003] EWHC 611 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWHC 611 (Fam)</ref><span style="color:#000000">&#160;and expanded in 2020 in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">CB v KB</span>, and which he had explicitly proposed to these parties, and which &#8211; crucially &#8211; had in my assessment led to settlement of the claim in the precise terms set out at [4] of the order, can truly be said to have &#8220;invalidated&#8221; the &#8220;fundamental assumption&#8221; on which the consent order was made.  Having reviewed the material, I am satisfied that this development does indeed &#8220;invalidate&#8221; that &#8220;assumption&#8221;; in my judgment this father can be absolved from the mother&#8217;s accusation that he is attempting a second bite at the cherry (see &#167;22(ii) above). There are not likely to be many litigants in a financial remedy case who would have felt comfortable in ignoring the clearest of steers from this most distinguished and pre-eminent of financial remedy judges; this litigant accepted the advice, adopted the &#8216;useful guideline&#8217;, and the subsequent consent order was founded upon it. The subsequent <span style="font-style:italic">James v Seymour </span>judgment has steered the court&#8217;s approach in a different direction; this change of direction was plainly unforeseen and unforeseeable at the time of the consent order. </p>
