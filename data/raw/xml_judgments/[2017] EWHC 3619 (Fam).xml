	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The little girl whose future I am asked to consider is L, who was born on [a date in] 2015.  This is, on any level, a tragic case.  L, it is accepted, suffers from a condition, a syndrome, which is a fatal condition, death usually occurring between two and six years of age.  It is extremely rare.  As if that was not enough of a nightmare for L and her family, her older sister, also has a terminal condition.  She is four.  The parents are both devoted to the girls and have provided outstanding parenting; they are dedicated to them both.  Now L is hospitalised, they take turns at hospital and at home, assisted by their wider family, to provide the very best they can for them.  Given this court is usually concerned with parents whose behaviour towards their children has fallen short of that to be expected, it is rare that this court has to consider questions in respect of a child who is receiving parenting of the very highest order.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The reason why I am called upon to consider L&#8217;s best interests is because her treating doctors and her parents no longer agree on the treatment plan for her.  Her doctors consider she is in the terminal phases of her condition and is approaching death.  They do not believe that there is any benefit to L in receiving invasive life-sustaining treatment in the form of mechanical ventilation or cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), indeed that it would be more harmful than beneficial to her and that as she deteriorates further she should be provided only with palliative care to ease her suffering as she nears death and as her life ends.  Her parent&#8217;s belief is that L has not yet reached the terminal phase of her condition and that, aside from specific deteriorations caused by identifiable causes such as aspirating medicine or food, the underlying condition is not yet as serious as the doctors conclude.  That being so, they believe that if she suffers a crisis which required mechanical ventilation or CPR she should be given the chance to get through it and to lead a little more of the life with her family that she benefits from.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The position of the Trust in response is that even if L is not currently as bad as they have concluded, that the occurrence of a crisis of the sort that required mechanical ventilation or CPR, would be either as a result of further deterioration or would lead to further deterioration, such that using CPR or mechanical ventilation would, in effect, put L into the very terminal phases where she could derive no actual benefit from their being used.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">These are appallingly difficult decisions for all concerned, although for the parents and the family the difficulty is of a quite different order of magnitude to that faced by the doctors, lawyers and judges for whom this is part of their work, not their family.  This is, for the parents and family, perhaps the most difficult decision and the most difficult situation they will confront in their lives.  I saw and heard from L&#8217;s mother yesterday as well as from the mother&#8217;s brother.  Their dignity and their measured approach was extraordinarily impressive.  L is fortunate indeed to have them as her parents and family.  They have done as much and more than anyone could expect of a parent.  They continue to do everything they can to make L&#8217;s life as long and as happy as it can be.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Ultimately, the responsibility for taking a decision now comes down to me to determine what objectively, and on the evidence before me, I consider to be in L&#8217;s best interests.  To the extent that that is not in line with what her parents assess is best, I will understand if they cannot agree with me.  They have their own perfectly proper views and I respect them.  To the extent that the Trust doctors do not agree with me, they have their own oaths and ethical code to comply with.  I have to act according to the law, doing right without fear or favour, affection or ill will.  I have, in reaching my decision, tried to fairly and objectively evaluate the evidence, to take into account and weigh the competing arguments and to reach my own independent assessment of what is now in L&#8217;s best interests according to the law.  </p>

	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Up until around 7 November of this year, the Trust and the parents have been largely in agreement as to L&#8217;s treatment.  Over the course of last weekend and Monday and Tuesday this week, it emerged that there was not an agreement by the parents to the course of action that the Trust proposed in respect of L.  As a result, the NHS Trust felt that they needed to apply for a declaration that it was lawful and in L&#8217;s best interests, not to escalate her treatment to invasive therapy, such as mechanical ventilation or CPR.  I do not consider it necessary to explore how that situation arose and what the parents and doctors said or decided in earlier meetings.  These most stressful and emotional situations are not ones in which there is any purpose in seeking to ascribe responsibility, still less blame.  It is perfectly legitimate and understandable if a parent and clinicians have different views.  In many cases such as this they do not, and an agreed plan is put in place, but that does not mean in those few cases where there is not an agreement that someone is wrong.</p>

At the hearing yesterday, I heard oral evidence from Dr K and from Ms S.

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The issue that lies before me is whether certain forms of medical treatment are in L&#8217;s best interests or not and thus whether it is lawful, because it is in her best interests, to withhold treatment.  The question of withdrawing treatment does not actually arise because the NHS Trust has said they will maintain the current treatment pending final hearing, so to that extent the specific issue order which I just outlined has been superseded by the position taken by Dr K yesterday.  The forms of medical treatment in particular have focused on mechanical ventilation and CPR.  The parties have all agreed that the application should be listed for final determination on 27 and 28 November, by which time the parents will have had the opportunity to instruct their own independent expert, the parents&#8217; legal team will have had the opportunity to consider in detail the medical evidence and notes and the guardian will have been able to see L and her parents and have spoken with the treating team, in particular the nursing staff.  Therefore, the issue today is what declarations should I make to cover the interim position. Should I make declarations broadly in the form sought by the NHS Trust; no invasive treatment and just palliative care or should I make the opposite, that it is in L&#8217;s best interests to have invasive treatment if it is required to sustain her life.  I note that Miss Cavanagh&#8217;s draft declaration requires this but in her submissions she accepted that, as a fall-back, the last sentence which refers to life-sustaining treatment can be deleted.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As I observed in the course of the hearing, the issue of escalation of treatment is not straightforward because escalation could arise in a number of contexts and not necessarily the same considerations would apply in each.  It is not a binary choice in that sense and so the best interests decision I have to make will inevitably require some flexibility.  I am also acutely conscious that, on the facts of L&#8217;s case, the order I make in the interim may in fact have the effect of being a final order.  If Dr K is correct that L is in the terminal phase and, on balance, likely to face a deterioration crisis in the next week or so, then the decision on invasive treatment will arise before the next hearing.  If it does arise, and I accede to the Trust&#8217;s application then she may not be alive on 27 November.  On the other hand, if L is not at that stage, as her parents believe, or if, against Dr K&#8217; assessment of the balance of probabilities, and of course that could amount to up to a 49% chance, L may not face such a crisis  she may continue much as she is now and has been for the last few weeks.  </p>

	  <num style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I note that Dr K has made clear that the Trust will continue to administer the form of treatment they are currently administering, including, for instance increasing her percentage of oxygen upwards from the current 40% if that will assist, administering antibiotics, and continuing with suction.  The issue is over escalation to invasive treatment.  I also note that Dr K has said that at present he and his colleagues would consider it unethical to provide the invasive treatments which the parents would wish to be carried out.  I have been referred to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidelines on withholding and withdrawing life-saving treatment in children.  Thus, even if I make the declarations as to best interests, which the parents seek, because the court cannot compel a doctor to carry out treatment against his ethical judgment, L will not be subject to invasive treatment by CPR or mechanical ventilation unless something in this judgment causes the NHS Trust to reassess their own judgement.</p>

She emphasises that the decision is potentially a once and for all decision and that there is a danger at this stage in treating the evidence of the treating doctors as being conclusive, when parents have not been able to challenge it and where there may be an alternative explanation.  She in particular pointed out that Dr K had interpreted evidence of L&#8217;s deterioration over the night of 8/ 9 November as being part of the pattern, but it might, in fact, have been a single event linked to aspiration of food or medicine through a misplaced nasogastric tube.  He accepted that was a possibility.  He also, she says, said there was no active infection but yesterday said that antibiotics were being administered for therapeutic not prophylactic purposes.  Miss Cavanagh said the evidence overall is not such that I could say that there is no benefit to L in undergoing those invasive therapies or that it was futile because if she had not reached the end stage of life then they could support her life and allow her to resume a life close to that which she currently experiences.  Miss Cavanagh said that if one applies a truly global approach to best interests, that should incorporate the opportunity for L to see if the Trust&#8217;s approach is truly the very best option for her.  </p>

Ms S told me that when she was born her eyes were closed for around six weeks and when they opened they found she had cataracts.  She had operations at an early stage and had her lenses changed every month.  She said they realised after a while that L did not respond to noise and it was then discovered that she was profoundly deaf and that, because of concerns about the shape of her head, scans were carried out and it was discovered that she had cerebellar hyperplasia.  This poor young girl also was discovered to have a dislocated hip and had an operation for that.  Despite all of this, L was a very smiley baby who, Ms S told me, hardly ever cried.  She describes her now as still smiley, that she responds to them, &#8216;She sees us speaking and responds.  She puts her hands up and waves in excitement.  She plays a game with me and puts her head to the side and smiles&#8217;.  She said she always does that.  She told me that she plays with her Dad&#8217;s beard.  With her grandmother, she likes touching her hands.  She plays with her grandad and she particularly likes a game where she laughs if you move your hand suddenly close to her face and away.  She told me how she picks up lights and moves them about and when excited she makes noise and laughs.  </p>

She is an adorable little girl; she clearly experiences pleasure from her interactions with those around her and, no doubt, particularly her mum and dad.  She also, though, clearly suffers discomfort, distress and pain.  She tries to take her oxygen mask off.  She is said to be distressed by the suction which is used to clear mucus and secretions from the back of her throat.  She can only now tolerate a maximum of 15 minutes without her oxygen mask before it has to be replaced.  She cannot lift her head or clear her throat by coughing nor can she swallow.  She is fed by a nasogastric tube.  Although she has clearly since birth had a degree of disability and neurological deficit and has suffered distress and discomfort, she has also obviously experienced much enjoyment from her life.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Turning to her medical history and building on what I have already said in relation to her mother&#8217;s description of her, by 6 July 2016 the clinical genetics service of the trust diagnosed a probable  syndrome.  This is associated with a problem in copper metabolization.  Children affected have congenital cataracts, hearing loss, developmental delay and cerebellar hyperplasia, all which the mother told me L had.  Her life expectancy was said to be between 22 months and six years and the cause of death is usually through pneumonia, kidney failure and multi-organ failure, all, I think, arising out of neurological deterioration.  Subsequent genetic testing at the Merseyside and Cheshire regional molecular genetics laboratory confirmed L had the genetic variant consistent with this syndrome.  Subsequent testing of both parents confirmed that they were both carriers.  Following the receipt of those genetic tests, the diagnosis of very likely syndrome was confirmed.  Ms S told me that she had had discussions with Dr R ( one of the doctors after whom the syndrome is named) himself and although he had not seen notes relating to L and could not be specific, he did say that she had features which were consistent with the syndrome, albeit noted that she had some which were not.  Ms S told me that, although the syndrome was proved by genetics, it would give peace of mind for her to know from another doctor that it was because she is fed by nasogastric tube and has the particular problem with secretions and the dislocated hip which were not standard features of the syndrome.  She did say that Dr R had told her that he did not think copper treatment would be appropriate.  </p>

From what Ms S told me, I believe she was at home with her family.  The timeline which seems to be drawn from L&#8217;s notes picks up the chronology at the beginning of September 2017 when she was admitted to  hospital with increased secretions and poor feeding, seizures and fevers.  She was discharged with antibiotics but readmitted almost straight away.  X-rays confirmed a problem in her lungs and she was started on antibiotics and had suction and physiotherapy.  She stabilised for a period but by 29 September had worsened with additional patches in her lungs and increasing oxygen requirements.  The administration of oxygen varied but by 2 November she was needing 15 litres per minute overnight.  She was struggling to clear secretions and over October the timeline shows periods where the oxygen was reduced and then increased and cardiac issues appearing. She moved on to intravenous antibiotics.  On 24 October she had further respiratory worsening and an arrest call was put out.  Over the next week there was increasing oxygen requirements and she was struggling to breathe.  On 4 November she was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit and non-invasive ventilation by oxygen mask was commenced.  She has been on that since.  </p>

What might have been possible on 4 October when there were extensive discussions about possible options  for L, including whether she might benefit from a gastrostomy or tracheotomy were not now feasible.

Dr K said that they had upped the level of treatment to non-invasive ventilation by oxygen/air delivered under pressure by mask, which he described as a halfway house, and that she had improved with this but also that there was not much further one could go because 100% oxygen delivery is damaging in more than small amounts.

The secretions are causing swelling in the lungs and that is what is the cause of her decreasing ability to breathe which will get progressively worse.

She said that she thought she had increased secretion which was part of a long-term problem.  She says that she does not think that L is in the last stages of life and that maybe she is half-way and she felt she should be resuscitated if necessary.  She described how there are improvements where she gets better and picks up again and then deteriorations.  She said she wants her to have a chance in life.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although the focus of the hearing and the evidence has been primarily on her breathing issues, her cardiac issues have also featured in the evidence.  The evidence derives mainly from Dr K.  He said that there could be cardiac arrest resulting from two possible areas.  Firstly, oxygen reduction as a result of the breathing difficulties, but secondly from other causes.  He described how there were the unexplained slowing of her heartrate.  His evidence was that he could not precisely ascribe a cause to that but thought that probably it was linked in some way to her neurological deterioration.  He thought that, in the context of L&#8217;s case, the most likely cause of a cardiac arrest and thus the need for CPR would be linked to low oxygen.  He said if she arrested in those circumstances, the chances of restarting her heart would be maybe 5% and that you would have to ventilate her afterwards.  Although he said it  would be completely pointless to let her get to the stage of cardiac arrest through low oxygen and not to have intervened earlier by ventilating to arrest that decline in oxygen levels.  In respect of the other cardiac instability he said that it could happen very suddenly.  He said he could not put a chance on restarting her heart after such an event yesterday, although on Wednesday I think he said it was somewhere between 5 and 10%.  He did say that in this event she would have a high chance of having sustained some brain damage after a cardiac arrest.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The process of applying ventilation would require the insertion of needles for the administration of drugs, for sedation and paralysis and some heavy sedation.  She might still feel some discomfort and pain, in particular during the process of suction when a suction tube would be inserted down the breathing tube in order to clear her lungs.  That would aggravate the lung tissue causing her to cough.  Dr K said that she may still get some comfort, not from smell, sight or hearing but possibly from touch.  He said that sedated patients are sedated to the extent that they may sense the presence of somebody.  He described it as being in a deep sleep and perhaps feeling somebody touch you but it was transient.  He said that in the process of mechanical ventilation the respiratory muscles detrain and so whilst he said a very short period of ventilation to support an operation, or something similar, is not harmful in that way and could be appropriate, as was considered when they were talking about gastrostomy and tracheotomy, prolonged ventilation would actually make L less able to breathe on her own if she were ever to come off ventilation. Because her condition would be deteriorating during the time on ventilation, she would actually be less able to breathe when she came off than before she went on.  Ventilation would not be supporting some recovery in another area but merely keeping her alive.  </p>

If not ventilated and placed on palliative care, she would continue to be able to experience that for a longer period than if she were ventilated.  If she were ventilated, she would lose 90% of her current consciousness and even if removed from ventilation would not recover sufficiently before she would die, for her to experience much if any comfort from her parents because if she comes off, she will not be able to breathe unaided.  She could be given an oxygen mask but she is likely to die fairly swiftly.  He thought there was a 5% chance she could come off successfully but if she did she would be back on again within a couple of days.  For him, the fundamental issue was that at the moment she can be conscious but with invasive ventilation she could not be.  If she was thus maintained on a palliative regime and non-invasive intervention she would be conscious and experience to the most that she can interaction with her parents and her family.  She could be given sedation and pain relief to ease any distress or fear she might experience from the difficulties she will experience as she nears death.</p>

She would have medical staff compressing her chest at 100-120 compressions a minute over a half to third of her chest.  She might suffer bruising or rib fractures.  At the same time, there would be a team dealing with her airway with an airbag and mask.  She would be given drugs including adrenaline, the side effects of which Dr K described as horrendous.  He said the process would be crowded, noisy, there would be no way her parents or relatives could get anywhere near her, she would not be sedated, she might be unconscious or not.  He said the brain can be conscious for one to two minutes after the cessation of blood flow.  If her heart slowed more gradually and went to a low cardiac output state, she might lose consciousness more quickly.

As I said earlier, although the primary area of concern over L&#8217;s treatment relates to the assessment that the need for ventilation or CPR would arise in the context of the terminal phase of her  syndrome, the evidence as it emerged introduced some other possibilities which were not necessarily or clearly linked to the syndrome, for instance a cardiac event not arising from lowered oxygen.  That might be due to neurological deterioration but ultimately the cause was not identifiable.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">I understand entirely the parents&#8217; view that her deterioration is linked to individual gaps in her care which have led to her aspirating food or medicine.  Whilst such events may have contributed to some observed deteriorations, it does not explain the generally downward pattern which can only be attributed to an underlying and progressive worsening of her neurological function which would be consistent with the syndrome.  There is not an observed pattern of her suffering an identifiable event, deteriorating and then making a significant recovery.  It is a generally downward pattern, albeit with some fluctuation.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In respect of ventilation being required in the context of something linked to the end phase, then the evidence established that if she goes onto ventilation then she will not come off it and be more conscious or aware than when she went in.  If she went onto ventilation and it was then withdrawn she would probably die without regaining consciousness.  On ventilation she would experience some discomfort.  She would have very little awareness.  She could receive almost no benefit from interaction with her family.  The only benefit for her might be that she would leave this life unaware of that occurring and feeling no distress.  On the other hand, if she does not go on ventilation, she will clearly continue to experience the benefits of interacting with her family for longer.  It is absolutely clear that she enjoys that interaction.  She can be provided with pain relief and sedation to ease pain and distress whilst not rendering her unconscious.  Whether that might occur at the very end of life i.e. unconsciousness through sedation I am not clear.  In any event she will experience the benefit of consciousness and thus life and family for longer.  This in my view promotes both her individual emotional wellbeing but it is also consistent with promoting life.  A life which is unconscious or nearly so, being little more than functioning of organs, is of far less value to L than conscious time with her family.  Not placing her on mechanical ventilation is therefore better for her overall welfare than placing her on it.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In respect of CPR, if she suffers a cardiac arrest linked to end phase issues then the chances of resuscitating her are very low, in the region of 5%.  In order to attempt to achieve that 5%, chance she would have to undergo the most intrusive, distressing process.  Her parents could play no part; she would likely die surrounded by medical staff and equipment.  If she survived, she would likely have suffered brain damage and further deterioration of her neurological functioning and so, even if resuscitated, might not regain a level of consciousness where she could obtain any emotional benefit.  It would be merely her organs functioning and she would die fairly soon in any event.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In contrast, in particular if the event were linked to decreasing oxygen levels but also possibly if  linked to neurological functioning there may be some warning.  The parents would be able to be present with her.  She will experience their presence and their reassurance.  It will be a better way for her to pass from this life than under CPR or dying after CPR but with little if any conscious awareness.  It is therefore my conclusion that not carrying out CPR is therefore better for her overall welfare than carrying it out in the context of end phase issues.  In respect of the other possibilities where invasive ventilation or CPR might be considered, the balance is different.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">If L experienced an infection which could be treated with antibiotics and where she might be ventilated for only a short period of time and might then resume a life not substantially diminished from now then the benefits are clearly worthwhile and Dr K essentially said that, albeit he put it in the context of ventilation support and operation.  I believe Dr K&#8217; view is that this scenario is improbable but the evidence about lung infections and how they might develop or be treated was, I found, less clear than the evidence in other respects.  On balance, I conclude that there may be scenarios where ventilation might be of benefit and so I would not rule out its use completely via a blanket declaration that it was not in L&#8217;s best interests under any circumstances to escalate to mechanical ventilation.  The resumption of a level of consciousness and interaction with her family that that scenario provides reverses the balance in respect of ventilation in these circumstances.  </p>

It must depend on the context.  If it is not thought to be part of the end phase but some other cause then CPR might resuscitate her and she might be able to resume some quality of life until the end comes through the progression of the end phase.  </p>

It means that for L and her parents, all avenues to sustain and prolong life, by which I mean a life which is more than simple functioning of organs, but a life which contains interaction and emotional benefit for her will have been tried.  It will mean L will have the benefits of her parents and family and their comfort while being largely insulated from pain and distress because palliative care and medication will address that.  </p>

As will be clear from my judgment my conclusion envisaged that the balance of probabilities was that the final hearing would not take place because the likelihood as I found was that L was entering the terminal phase of her condition and was as a result more likely than not to face a medical crisis which would result in her death. </p>

I note from the Declarations I am now asked to make and the detailed Guidelines which have been agreed that there has been re-appraisal and movement on both sides. It is so very easy in such highly charged cases for positions to polarise and for views to harden. It is a tribute to all involved that the reverse has happened in this case. </p>
