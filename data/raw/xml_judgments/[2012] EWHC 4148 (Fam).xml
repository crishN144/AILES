A Child Protection Conference was held on 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Garamond">nd</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> July 1999 and the names of all six children were placed on the Child Protection Register under the category of sexual abuse.

K can be a demanding child, liking one-to-one attention, but is also very rewarding to care for. She therefore needs carers who can give him (sic) the attention and boundaries she requires and can help channel her energies into constructive pastimes. She is a child who craves &#8216;normality&#8217; and although she would have achieved this with her current foster carers, it would be detrimental to her welfare, given her age, to leave her in long-term foster care if an adoptive family can be found.&#8217;</span></p>

Twenty years ago Ward J (as he then was) memorably made the point that &#8216;judges are not forensic ferrets&#8217; (B-T v B-T <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 2 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 2 FLR 1</ref> at p.17). The pressure under which modern family judges are required to work is such that they simply do not have the time to be &#8216;forensic ferrets&#8217; searching through inadequately prepared and disorganised hearing bundles in order to identify key information.</span></p>

Within this family she has a lifestyle and some of her own expectations which are better than her birth family; K can with some support manage to access this lifestyle and as she matures she will hopefully be better able to self monitor. In the mean time we need to help the family manage K as a much younger child something which they find very stressful. Her stealing and running away also cause considerable difficulty both at home and with peers.&#8217;</span></p>

During Year 7, we experienced no issues with K&#8217;s behaviour&#8230;K&#8217;s behaviour slowly deteriorated through Year 8. It started off with her being cheeky to staff and stiring (sic) trouble between friendship groups. She then started truanting, stealing from school, and local shops. It got to the point towards the end of year 8 where K was truanting more lessons than she arrived at. The lessons she was attending, she was seriously disrupting the teaching&#8230;She was leaving the school site and then running away from home. She was very rude to staff and making some very rude and upsetting comments to her peers. K got in with a bad crowd of girls who were the ones orchestrating disobedience, disruption and defiance, but then would set K up to be the fall guy and get her into trouble. All the while this was going on, K believed these people were her friends&#8230;K refuses to deal with the consequences of her actions. She always removes herself from the blame and it is always somebody else&#8217;s fault. She cannot join up the dots when it comes to actions and consequences and feels that if something happened yesterday then it is forgotten and it is unreasonable of us to punish her for that&#8230;At school we have used many strategies to try and combat K&#8217;s behaviour&#8230;We are at the stage now where K has been working in our Referral unit&#8230;As the reintegration progressed it became clear that there had been no change in K&#8217;s behaviour over the summer break and she spent another week in the Referral centre due to her difficult behaviour. As we are such a large school, it is extremely difficult to keep tabs on K if she wants to abscond or not be found then it is very easy for her to do this. She does not have the skills required to make the right choices and is very easily led. She would benefit from being in a smaller environment where it is easier to keep an eye on her and guide her in the right direction.&#8217;</span></p>

K has mentioned this in all of her recent letters. The parents threw the medals away shortly after K&#8217;s admission to Greendale. They say they were then at a very low point and were upset to be told they couldn&#8217;t send Christmas presents to K. They accept that they shouldn&#8217;t have disposed of them but say that this is a reflection of the state to which all of this had driven them. Although they say that the medals and trophies can be replaced, they have not yet been replaced. </span></p>

But the behavioural criteria are not met with the severity that that is described, although her difficulty in close relationships, her indiscriminate approach to strangers, etc. has been seen, but not with the frequency or severity that is usually seen as necessary for the diagnosis. Interestingly her mother has wondered whether she shows features of autism and this question frequently arises with deeply insecure children with her history, as can be read above, because of the difficulty the children have with showing empathy, remorse and the like. She is not autistic. All this merely illustrates the inadequacy of conventional psychiatric diagnoses to map the real world behaviour in a useful way. At best the diagnostic categories imprecisely point to some features of behaviour which may be useful in understanding a child&#8217;s problems, and in K&#8217;s case the diagnosis of RAD does usefully point to her insecurity and its aetiology and some of the puzzling behaviours she has shown, but it falls short of being a precise description.&#8217;</span></p>

They show false positive affect, including sexual desire, to little known people, and protect themselves from rejection by engaging with many people superficially and not getting deeply involved with anyone. This strategy develops in adolescence when past intimate relationships have been treacherous and strangers appear to offer the only hope of closeness and sexual satisfaction. It may be displayed in a socially promiscuous manner (that does not involve sexuality) or, in more serious cases, as sexual promiscuity.</span></p>

In other words the very strength of their values probably meant that the escalation went further than it might otherwise have done.&#8217;</span></p>

This sense of being valued and understood is established in most children very early in life and was not established in K, so when she came to this family, that need was buried beneath her strong avoidant strategies which had enabled her to survive.  As she became more secure with them that need surfaced more. However it clashed with the family&#8217;s focus on achievement and excellence morally, socially and educationally.  Such a focus is fine for secure children like Rachel and Chloe, they know they are valued.  But K had no such basic knowledge because of her terrible first four years. So the impact of these proper and normally successful values would have been different in K than in most children and lead K to the feelings, which she had, of not being trusted and feeling a failure and, by extension was not a part of the family.&#8217;</span></p>

The trouble with the legal process surrounding Orders etc. is that they are predicated on events being someone&#8217;s fault: either the parents&#8217; failed or K was too bad.  This is unhelpful to the therapeutic process.  Since the legal process exists, the challenge would be to explain it to K in a way which is helpful to her.  I have tried to do that in my report, emphasising, in paragraph 50, the absence of blame.  So the impact on K is determined by how well the decisions, whatever they are, are explained to her.  It would be an uphill task since it risks leaving her with a sense that it was her fault that she left her home, and so by implication she is no good, or that it is all her parents&#8217; fault, a conclusion which will be equally damaging in the longer term.</span></p>

Life story work could have been undertaken during those years. Though not in force at the time K was placed, it is interesting to note that Schedule 5 to the Adoption Agencies Regulations 2005 requires that an Adoption Placement Plan should state (paragraph 8) &#8216;The dates on which the child&#8217;s life story book and later life letter are to be passed by the adoption agency to the prospective adopter&#8217;.

It is an expression that appeared in earlier child protection legislation. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/54/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(2)</ref>(d) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/54" uk:canonical="1969 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children and Young Persons Act 1969</ref> provided that proof that a child &#8216;is beyond the control of his parent or guardian&#8217; was sufficient of itself to empower the court to make a care order. The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> makes two important changes to that wording.

Second, proof of &#8216;the child&#8217;s being beyond parental control&#8217; is not of itself sufficient to empower the court to make a care order. The court must be satisfied that the child &#8216;is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm&#8230;attributable&#8230;to the child&#8217;s being beyond parental control&#8217;.</span></p>

It is essential that adoption agencies make available to adoptive parents all material facts about children to be placed in their care. It is unacceptable for adoption agencies to withhold information about a child to the extent that the picture of a child provided to prospective adopters is so lacking in substance as to as to bear little relation to reality. Supplying information to adoptive parents is a legal requirement. It should include details about a child&#8217;s background history in care, including number and duration of placements, educational progress and special medical conditions. Such information is a vital tool for prospective adopters if they are to be able to understand and deal effectively with the particular needs of a child. One source of helpful information for this purpose is the material collected by local authorities as part of the &#8220;looked after&#8221; review of the child.&#8217;</span></p>

Referring to the events that have taken placed in the period since K has been at Greendale, Miss McGrath submitted that the parents had utterly failed to understand the impact of their behaviour on K. She said &#8216;I don&#8217;t know how any local authority could be expected to work with parents who show those attitudes&#8217;. She described the mother&#8217;s evidence as &#8216;chilling for its lack of sensitivity and understanding&#8217;. She urged me not to reinforce the parents&#8217; views that the problems are all other people&#8217;s fault and not theirs. She submitted that the parents are concerned about their reputation in the community and the impact that a care order may have upon the way they earn their living. Having urged me to avoid rhetoric and proceed only on fact, she asked me, rhetorically, why it is that stones have been thrown at a local authority that has put K&#8217;s interests at the forefront of its mind. Why is it, she asked, again rhetorically, that the parents are not able to agree that K is beyond parental control? The answer, she submits, is that these parents are entirely adult focussed. How any reasonable person could fail to accept that K is beyond parental control is, she said, &#8216;something the local authority struggles to grasp&#8217;. Where, she asked, again rhetorically, is the love that goes with the understanding of attachment disorder?</span></p>

They accept that. Having successfully parented Chloe and Rachel they have struggled to adapt their parenting style to address the challenges that K has presented. They have struggled to accept and follow advice. They have behaved inappropriately in some of the things they have said, done and written. Some of the things they have said, done and written have undoubtedly caused K distress. Miss McGrath challenged the mother that some of her responses to K had been motivated by spite. Looked at in isolation, I accept that that is how it may appear. But the parents&#8217; responses to K should not be looked at in isolation. They have to be looked at in the context of the fact that K suffers from reactive attachment disorder of childhood. </span></p>

The parents have said that had they known in 2003 what they know now they would not have proceeded with the adoption. But they did not know. And they did adopt K. There is no going back. Adoption is final, both for the child and for her adopters. It is to the immense credit of these parents that despite the challenges K has presented, and despite the difficulties they have had to contend with in engaging with the local authority, they still care about her, they still love her and they still want what is best for her.</span></p>

Firstly, the local authority&#8217;s case for a care order is in large measure reliant upon the conviction of professionals that that is what K wants. Yet it is not clear that any professional involved in her care has stood back and assessed what K is saying against the backdrop of her acknowledged emotional immaturity and her propensity for using her behaviour as a means of controlling those around her.</span></p>

It would make both the local authority and the parents accountable to the court. It would enable the court to oblige the local authority to keep the court and the parents informed about its progress in arranging therapy and about the progress of therapy once begun. It would enable the court to ensure that the parents receive the information proposed under the care plan. Were it necessary to do so, it would enable the court to regulate the parents contact with K, with Greendale and with K&#8217;s school. Were it not for s.100(2)(b) I would have no hesitation in making K a ward of court. </span></p>
