He and M met in 2017 and married in Algeria in 2018. M joined F in this country on a spousal visa in 2019. On 30 November 2021, F left Z and M stranded (the word used by Moor J in a written judgment after a contested hearing in July 2022) in Algeria at the end of a visit there while he returned to England. He retained the passports of Z and M. He issued divorce proceedings in Algeria. M, with the assistance of the British Embassy in Algeria, returned to this country on 1 February 2022, but was unable to bring Z with her. It appears that ever since, Z has been looked after in Algeria by F&#8217;s family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 9 May 2022, Z was made a ward of this court by Sir Jonathan Cohen. On 6 July 2022, after a contested two day hearing which F attended, and at which he was represented, Moor J made an order for F to return Z to this jurisdiction by 15 July 2022. That order was not appealed. F did not comply. Further return orders were made by judges of the Division on 15 July 2022 (Moor J), 28 July 2022 (Ms R Henke QC as she then was), 12 August 2022 (Theis J) and 13 October 2022 (Hayden J).

Francis J concluded at the committal hearing on 2 December 2022 that F had probably obtained alternative travel documents under a different name.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In due course, M applied for the committal of F. The application  was heard by Francis J in the absence of F on 2 December 2022. The judge was satisfied that F had been properly served with the application and was aware of the hearing date. He decided not to adjourn to give F a further opportunity to participate (the application having already been adjourned on one previous occasion). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for F before me at this hearing submits that Francis J was wrong to find that F had notice of the committal hearing but it seems to me that (i) the judge made express findings to that effect in his judgment, as incorporated in his order and it is not for me to act as an appellate court, (ii) F was indeed notified of the hearing as an email thread between 24 November 2022 and 1 December 2022 shown to me at court demonstrates, (iii) F was served with the committal order, and (iv) F did not appeal or apply to set aside the committal order of 2 December 2022. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for F further submits that Francis J did not consider whether F had the power to compel the return of Z to this country given that he was living in Algeria with his paternal grandparents. As far as I am aware, at no time in the proceedings which started as long ago as May 2022, has F suggested he could not (as opposed to would not) effect a return until it was raised before me today. Moor J, after a two day final hearing in May 2022, must have concluded that F could do so, because he went on to make a return order against which F did not pursue an appeal. There is nothing in his judgment to suggest that F argued he could not return Z, for whatever reason. Likewise, Francis J made a committal order and must have been amply satisfied that F had wantonly disobeyed orders which he was able to comply with. In any event, F did not appeal the committal order. I do not accept F&#8217;s submission on this point.</p>

A later order of Mr Alex Verdan KC, sitting as a s9 judge on 20 January 2023, records at para 3 that &#8220;The mother&#8217;s solicitors confirmed that the father has accessed the documents for the purposes of this hearing as well as the orders from the committal hearing but has not contacted them or filed any further evidence&#8221;. I have been provided with a service bundle which demonstrates to my satisfaction that on 16 December 2022 F accessed an email from M&#8217;s solicitors and downloaded the attached documents which included the committal order of 2 December 2022. Further, they sent to F by email a copy of the judge&#8217;s judgment on 9 February 2023 which was accessed that day and the document downloaded, and to his solicitors (who were at the time on the record) on 10 January 2024. Moreover, although F was represented at a subsequent hearing before Francis J on 8 March 2024, his legal team did not dispute service of the committal order. I am satisfied that F was served with, and aware of, the committal order. </p>

It is apparent that F, despite being legally represented, did not provide the Master with the relevant history, including (i) the fact that Z was a ward of court, (ii) the existence of the various return orders and (iii) the committal order. Nor was the Master informed that Algeria was not a signatory to the 2005 Hague Convention and that the said Convention does not apply to family law matters. M was not made aware of these events until 5 January 2024. In the circumstances it is unsurprising that the Master&#8217;s order was set aside by Francis J on 8 March 2024 at a hearing at which F was legally represented. Francis J described F&#8217;s behaviour as &#8220;astonishing&#8221;. </p>

Nor does the order say what the terms of suspension are during those 24 months. The reference at para 12 to F having permission to apply to purge his contempt does not seem to me to clarify matters; if anything, it adds to the confusion. Similarly, the judge&#8217;s judgment at para 47 says that if F returns the child <span style="font-style:italic"/>&#8220;it is possible that I might decide not to trigger the sentence&#8221; which suggests the judge intended to retain a discretion whether to activate the sentence or not, whereas the order itself at para 11 is couched in mandatory terms, namely that it &#8220;&#8230;will not be put into force&#8230;&#8221; if F returns the child. </p>

Para 13 of the order of Francis J dated 8 March 2024 provides that if the child is not returned under para 12 (i.e by 29 March 2024), then F remains under a continued obligation to return him to England and Wales. Para 11 of the order of Moor J dated 9 May 2024 provides that the return order of Francis J dated 8 March 2024 shall remain in force. Para 7 of the order of Poole J dated 23 September 2024 provides that if F does not return the child as stipulated under para 6 (i.e by 30 September 2024), he remains under a continued obligation to do so.</p>

There are three identified alleged breaches with specific deadlines which are properly brought. I am not convinced that the additional &#8220;continued obligations&#8221; breaches add much, if anything, and it seems to me that they lack the clarity and certainty required to warrant a committal. Essentially, the continued obligations do not state a date by when the child must be returned which in my view is an essential ingredient for a contempt application of this nature. I am fortified in this conclusion by the dicta of Sir James Munby P who <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">said at para 21 of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Solicitor General v.

It is of relevance that F replied directly from his email address to M&#8217;s solicitors on 21 March 2024 in response to an email sent by them that day.

It is abundantly clear that he has no intention to return Z, as opposed to no ability to do so. He has never made any effort to do so. The judges who made the return orders must have been satisfied that F could comply. Insofar as it was suggested by counsel that F does not, and did not at the relevant times, have the financial wherewithal to comply, I note that he paid for lawyers privately in 2024 to represent him in the Registration of Order proceedings and was able to pay for his own flight to this country on 21 September 2024. Further, F has not suggested at any time before today that he cannot procure Z&#8217;s return. He has not put in (as is his right) any evidence setting out his case as to inability to comply (whether for financial or other reasons), and I do not consider that submissions made by counsel on his behalf constitute evidence which assists him.</p>

There may be other reasons for making a &#8220;continued obligation&#8221; return order, but applicants should consider carefully whether such an order is of utility.</p>
