She is described in an attendance note (<span style="font-weight:bold">exhibit NDM11 to third statement of Neil Morris</span>) as &#8220;happy to give the flat to [PBC]&#8221; but was advised that &#8220;It would be better from a tax point of view to put the flat into trust so that there could be a hold over for capital gains tax purposes&#8230;. The intention would be to break the trust after a reasonable period of time and hold over the gain on transferring the flat to [PBC.]&#8221; </p>

The only mention of post-death tax planning appears to be incidental to that focus. The attendance note of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> November 2010 records that &#8220;transferring the flat to [PBC] would start the seven years running for inheritance tax purposes.&#8221; In his second statement Mr. Morris states that JMA &#8220;expressed her satisfaction&#8221; that if she survived seven years from the gifts of the properties to PBC &#8220;that would avoid inheritance tax&#8221; but the contemporaneous attendance note is silent as to JMA&#8217;s view of the impact on post-death taxes.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in">Addressing the question posed in District Judge Eldergill&#8217;s order, Mr. Rees submits that &#8220;it is not surprising that [JMA] did not embark on IHT planning&#8221; in the light of her relative youth when she lost capacity but &#8220;within those constraints, she did seek tax advice and took steps to deal with her estate in a tax efficient manner.&#8221; He submits that &#8220;in the absence of evidence that P is going to act in a manner which does <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> mitigate tax, the default position should be that most people are motivated by a desire to save tax if that benefits their relatives.&#8221; He distinguished the taking of &#8220;aggressive steps&#8221; from the proposals currently under consideration, which he characterised as &#8220;plain vanilla&#8221; tax planning, &#8220;such as any High Street Solicitor would recommend to any client.&#8221; The absence of any such steps taken by JMA herself whilst she had capacity does not, Mr Rees says, take the matter out of his &#8216;default&#8217; approach because of the fundamental change in her circumstances: what is possible now, was not possible when she had an expensive lifestyle and was concerned about meeting her needs. Instead, the matter falls squarely within the &#8216;default&#8217; approach because of the evidence that JMA was motivated to save lifetime tax where she could, even to the extent of a &#8220;slightly esoteric&#8221; trust arrangement. Mr Rees accepted that &#8220;there are limits&#8221; to this default approach, emphasising that the gifts under consideration will still leave JMA with &#8220;ten times more than what she needs.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in">In respect of the benefit to the recipient of the gifts, Mr Rees submitted that such benefit is a relevant consideration, because benefitting her son, the charities and JAA was something that JMA herself wanted to do. She selected them all for benefit under her will. Her best interests now include consideration of her capacitous wish to benefit these people and bodies. The change of circumstances means that she can accelerate and maximise the benefits she can bestow. In so far as any concern may arise from the magnitude of the proposed gifts, Mr. Rees submitted that &#8220;the quantum does not affect the principle.&#8221;</p>

The future needs of the protected person must be considered on a cautious basis, and the level of gifting not such as may put in doubt the donor&#8217;s ability to meet those needs. I am satisfied that, even though the gifts proposed in this case are very large, they are amply affordable for JMA. If the parties&#8217; agreement is given effect, she will still have at her disposal funds which are more than sufficient to meet her conceivable needs. That in itself is not however sufficient basis to conclude that making the proposed gifts would be in her best interests. There is no expectation on people who retain capacity to make gifts of their surplus wealth during their lifetime, and nor should there be any expectation that it is in the best interests of persons who lack capacity so to do.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in">JMA herself presently has no discernible wishes in respect of the gifts being proposed or the mitigation of inheritance tax. However, there is clear evidence that she wished in the past to make gifts to her son and charities relevant to her life within the means then available to her; and evidence in the drawing up of her will that she wished to benefit them and her grandson further in due course. Moreover, from the steps she took in respect of the properties which now belong to her son, even if she did not actively turn her mind to post-death tax planning, it is clear that JMA was open to such measures. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in">On one occasion JMA expressed to her professional adviser a wish that her son should know that financial support from her had reached an end. I do not consider that this implies a decision never to benefit her son again during her lifetime. I prefer the interpretation which Mr. Morris gives, on the basis of an established professional relationship with JMA and also RA. I further accept that JMA&#8217;s circumstances have now changed significantly; and that the gifts under consideration are not in the nature of &#8216;financial support.&#8217;  In the balancing exercise, what JMA actually did when she had capacity carries greater weight as a guide to her wishes and feelings than what she is recorded as saying in a single attendance note. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in">When JMA felt able to make gifts to PBC and favoured charities without jeopardising her ability to meet her own needs, she did so. When opportunities arose, she opted to follow professional advice and minimise her lifetime tax payments.  The occasions of both gifting and tax mitigation may have been quite few in number and over a relatively short period of time but I am satisfied that this reflects JMA&#8217;s circumstances at the time and, sadly, the early onset of her dementia. The gifts now proposed, in the current circumstances of her life, are in my judgment consistent with the beliefs and values JMA demonstrated when she was able to manage her financial affairs for herself. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.3in">RA&#8217;s wishes expressed in the Residuary Provisions of his will are a factor which JMA would be likely to consider if she were able to do so. I am satisfied that she has already considered them and made a capacitous decision to make gifts to charities but not (other than by consenting to the release of funds from the inter vivos trust) to any of the individuals. Mr. Morris has given an explanation of JMA&#8217;s approach to the individuals, and I find no basis to draw any different conclusion now. I accept the parties&#8217; assertion that JMA&#8217;s own capacitous decisions are the best guide to how the Court should consider RA&#8217;s wishes in the context of this application. I am satisfied that the proposals reflect JMA&#8217;s own considered position in this respect.</p>

Of course it may be said that, since he is the recipient of the largest part of the proposed gifting, the application is self-serving but I am satisfied that it has not been improperly brought. JMA appointed PBC as her sole attorney, indicating a significant degree of trust and faith in him and the decisions he is thereby empowered to make. The proposal he now makes is beyond the scope of his powers as attorney but he makes it with Mr. Morris, JMA&#8217;s long-standing adviser, fully in support;</p>
