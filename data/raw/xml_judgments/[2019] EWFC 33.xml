	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In the late afternoon of 11 April 2018, a four month old baby boy, T, collapsed and stopped breathing whilst in the care of his parents.  He was taken to Hospital by the emergency services who had been summoned by the parents.  His life threatening condition was such that he was later transferred to Intensive Care at Addenbrooke&#8217;s Hospital where he was intubated. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">On full examination T was found to be suffering from bilateral subdural collections; a haemorrhage on the brain; a lower spinal haematoma; and bilateral retinal haemorrhages.  Neither of the parents could give any account as to what might have led to those injuries.  There was no history of accidental trauma, or apparent predisposing medical condition; the inevitable corollary was that it was most likely that T had sustained some form of abusive trauma. </p>

Since 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, an older child, P, went to live with his maternal grandparents, until 31/8/18 when the court approved a return to live with his parents, supervised at all times by other adults, under an Interim Care Order.  When T was discharged from hospital he went to live with an uncle in Oxford where he remains.  Both parents have continued to be significantly involved in their children&#8217;s&#8217; care. They have devoted the last year to spending all their time between them, half the week at home and the other half in Oxford. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.03in"><span style="font-family:Arial"/>In determining the issues at this fact finding hearing I apply the following well established legal principles. These are helpfully summarised by Baker J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v M and F and L and M</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(Children) (Fact Finding: NonAccidental Injury)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/1569" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 1569 (Fam)</ref>. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.03in">The burden of proof lies with the Local Authority. It is the Local Authority which brings the proceedings and identifies the findings that they invite the Court to make. The burden of proving the assertions rests with them.  I bear in mind at all times that the burden is fairly and squarely placed on the Local Authority, and not on either parent. Recent case law (such as <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S (Children) </span>2013 EWCA 1146) reinforces the importance of proper findings based on proper facts; the principles are the same for whatever the proposed outcome. Here there is, as in many cases, a risk of a shift in the burden to the parents to explain occasions when injuries might have occurred. Whilst that can be an important component for the medical experts, it is not for the parents to explain but for the local authority to establish. There is no pseudo burden as Mostyn J put in <span style="font-style:italic">Lancashire</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">County Council v R</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/3064" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 3064 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 3064 (Fam)</ref>.

If the Local Authority proves on the balance of probabilities that baby A was killed by the mother or sustained inflicted injuries at her hands the Court treats that facts as established and all future decision concerning the future welfare of B, based on that finding. Equally if the Local Authority fails to prove those facts the Courts disregards the allegations completely.  </p>

I pay appropriate attention to the opinion of the medical experts, which need to be considered in the context of all other evidence. The roles of the Court and the experts are of course entirely distinct. Only the Court is in a position to weigh up the evidence against all the other evidence (see <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v K, D and L</span> [2005] EWHC 1444, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 851" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 851</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">A County Council v M, F and XYZ</span> [2005] EWHC 31, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 129" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 129</ref>). There may well be instances where the medical opinion is that there is nothing diagnostic of a non-accidental injury but where a judge, having considered all the evidence, reaches the conclusion that is at variance from that reached by the medical experts, that is on the balance of probability, there has been nonaccidental injury or human agency established.  </p>

In other words, there has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of probabilities&#8230; a conclusion of unknown aetiology in respect of an infant represents neither a professional or forensic failure. It simply recognises that we still have much to learn and &#8230; it is dangerous and wrong to infer non-accidental injury merely from the absence of any other understood mechanism.&#8221; </p>

Neurological investigation identified fresh subdural bleeding in all intracranial components and the spine and changes within the brain substance comparable with hypoxic/ischaemic change.  There was also a small volume of fluid over both cerebral hemispheres, likely to be acute traumatic effusion.  Ophthalmological examination revealed multi-layered retinal haemorrhages. </p>

His presentation was therefore compatible with a forceful shaking during a momentary loss of control.  The question is whether that occurred whilst in the father&#8217;s care, or once the mother had taken T from the father and during her attempts to resuscitate him as she stated at an early stage.  Mr Richards spoke to the Semmekrot Dutch findings, that more than a third of parents shook their children when they had become profoundly unwell.  He made clear, as he put it, whichever alternative, it was at the lower end of the scale (no other impact, fractures, or bruising being evident).  Peter Richards was a powerful witness, the Court has heard evidence from him very many times.  His evidence was compelling not just because of his experience, but also because of his care, attention to detail and moderation in every aspect.  He was prepared to contemplate and question different possibilities.  Ultimately, he said as in all such cases an assessment of the parents&#8217; evidence is necessary to reach any conclusions, since a number of hypotheses may be capable of explaining the medical findings. </p>

He was subject to firm cross-examination, not just in relation to his findings, but his extrapolated conclusions, not least in part because, whilst the extent of the deficit is not clear, T&#8217;s progress appears at the moment to far exceed medical expectation, (he was tested as recently as 19 March 2019).  Of more immediate concern to me were his very different conclusions as to mechanism and force.  Mr Richards thought a single movement, whereas Mr Elston maintained acceleration and deceleration, and with force.  There is a stark difference in perspective between the neurologist and the ophthalmic specialist, a difference which the court has encountered before.  I do, with respect, ally myself to the former, partly because the neurological findings are more numerous in terms affecting different parts of the neuro system but mostly because there was a greater capacity to be more open minded to other possibilities.  Having spent very much of my professional career examining such cases, the one thing which can be learned is that this is still a comparably new area of science, where, as for example Dr Saggar so amply demonstrates, we know really very little.  So, whereas Mr Elston may be right, I prefer to align myself with the more open minded, contemplative perspective that other factors or explanations might have some bearing here before coming to a conclusion that inflicted injury is established, or in any event, I prefer the evidence in relation to mechanism and force as being, with respect, more measured and less dogmatic.   </p>

Dr Cartlidge confirmed his clear conclusions that most likely the head injury was sustained at the moment of collapse, i.e. prior to when he was handed over from his father to his mother, limp and lifeless. He did not consider that either CPR or artificial breathing would have caused the injuries. A frightened parent reacting by vigorous shaking, if the shaking was in an uncontrolled manner could cause further injury (i.e. in addition to whatever it was that had caused the initial collapse). That further shaking could be characterised by an innocent bystander thinking &#8220;that looks dangerous to me&#8221;.  He also helpfully spoke (in relation to the firm handling by the mother) that T was already very unwell, and required sustained resuscitation, a lot more than could be caused by gastro oesophageal reflux.   </p>

It is perfectly understandable that what occurred might be described as a &#8220;shake&#8221;, although I&#8217;m not sure in truth if that&#8217;s what it was.  With the benefit of hindsight the mother believing that she might have caused or contributed to T&#8217;s injuries told me that whilst she would still turn him, she would not &#8220;jiggle&#8221; him again, at least in the same way.  She of course was asked about the degree of force she used (not least because of the desperateness of the situation and fuelled no doubt by the previous 2 episodes in March).  Whilst of course it is possible to misremember, and I well understand the mother&#8217;s evidence of feeling strangely calm, as if it were a parallel experience, having regard overall to the mother as an individual, and as a narrator I think, that whilst she acknowledges the possibility that she may have contributed to T&#8217;s condition (even possibly caused it) I do not consider on the evidence that that fear and hypothesis is really tenable.  I am sure she is a ferociously protective mother, in the best sense, nothing in her background, personality or the background suggests the Court should do other than rely on her evidence, it is as I say, of the highest quality, reflecting in every sense the mother herself.  I do not consider on the evidence that her unexpected and isolated panic attack in December has anything to do with my evaluation of the facts.

He was palpably extremely anxious and nervous.  Like the mother though, he too is an articulate and sophisticated man.  Sensitive, quite reserved, private, a proud man.  I have concluded however that he is emotionally quite vulnerable; it should not be thought however that I consider him to be anything other than a thoroughly decent, respectable and impressive man.  The conundrum for the Court is reconciling two very different and apparently contradictory aspects of his personality.  One foreshadowed so presciently by the mother.  The father is able to carry out and supervise industrial rope access at a very high level &#8211; 3.  The sort of activity just the thought of which would discomfort most individuals.  The father is able to climb up a rockface or a tree without, it seems, a moment&#8217;s hesitation or doubt.  Yet that resolve and strong sense of &#8220;holding things together&#8221; is not reflected in his emotional responses.  Since the events of 11 April, the father has suffered something of a breakdown.  He told me in an increasingly intense way of the events of 11 April.  An important question is whether those descriptions were a genuine reflection of his state and conduct on 11 April or a performance for the benefit of the Court.  The mother had already to an extent, painted a picture of the father&#8217;s serious resulting anxiety and treatment, e.g. lying awake worrying night after night.  He quickly became suicidal, wanting to end it.  But the evidence suggests that that neurosis was well established long before 11 April.  T was very focused, fixated even, on the mother, he was by no means a straightforward child. That is not uncommon. But the father&#8217;s anxiety in relation to their relationship was remarkable.  The father was paranoid, that T did not like, even love, him; he found it hard to accept, he felt like he was failing.  All really rather extreme, and surprising.  He is a pessimistic person, glass &#189; empty, and self critical.  &#8220;I feel a bit irrational, a bit erratic&#8221;.   </p>

Everything thus far would suggest the father&#8217;s behaviour was under control, as his employment might underscore.  Yet something caused this man to lose control.  I have reviewed the father&#8217;s evidence many times, and not without hesitation have ultimately decided that there is a significant vulnerability in his personality.  Something which his high functioning, stressful occupation would not suggest.  He would not be the first high functioning individual who had apparent gaps in his emotional foundation.  The factors which convince me finally, taking account of the powerful and persuasive points made by Ms Pine, are, inter alia, his reaction to P&#8217;s labour, the 999 call on that day, his inability to navigate to the Hospital that day, and his almost complete collapse in his proper functioning since.  If, as he says, he is now in a much better place, the father&#8217;s desperate earlier anxious state can only be guessed at.  He is still off work, and I think likely to remain so for a while.  In his evidence he frequently forgot the question, and from time to time became really quite distressed; on occasion, to be frank, appearing to &#8220;lose the plot&#8221; completely.  Also, watching the mother closely during the father&#8217;s evidence, it seemed to me that whilst she loves the father very much, that love does not outweigh her fiercely protective and realistic instincts as a mother, and individual.  Much of the father&#8217;s evidence was, I confess, for the Court, rather unexpected.   The mother watched the father intently, but importantly gave no indication that the content and bearing of the father, was, to her surprising, that it was in any way exaggerated or staged.  Of course, she could be blind to such things, it would not be the first time, but I did not get any such sense that the mother was sentimental or had misplaced priorities. </p>

It is an aspect which troubles me going forward, the lack of understanding as to what it is that underpins this deficit and how best to predict and protect T and his brother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The Court has benefitted greatly from hearing the evidence of the experts instructed in this matter. Just as it is vital to be able to consider the manner and quality of the evidence of the parents from the witness box rather than only from their written statements so is it imperative to judge any disagreement or challenge to the expert evidence after having heard that evidence tested in cross examination. Without that crucial tool the Court would be left with an incomplete understanding of how the views are formed, how they compare with each other, and how they fit into the evidence as a whole. The Court has the ability to disagree with part or whole of the expert evidence but would be denying itself that important part of the jigsaw if it did not hear the experts give that evidence and be tested. There is sometimes, as here a difference in emphasis between experts, how they deliver that evidence and how they respond to cross examination, all can inform the Court as to the conclusions that can be drawn.</p>

He was clear, as was Mr Richards &#8211; who reflects his approach, his expertise from a different perspective, that there are far greater medical difficulties in the way of a conclusion that the medical findings are the result of a wholly, or in part, of an unknown condition(s).  Most of the witnesses were prepared to acknowledge the possibility but were nonetheless clear in their ultimate conclusions.  All were agreed that a catastrophic collapse such as occurred here was in effect difficult to envisage.  The issue of birth related injuries was not fully investigated, but was some months away and none thought it worthy of inclusion or active consideration.  All agreed that such injuries did not occur as a result of normal handling.   </p>

It is rare for counsel to be able to do so.  In this instance he felt, justly, able to do make firm assertions about her.  The mother was, as I have described, a quite outstanding witness, accurately portraying the person she is, an intelligent, sophisticated, enquiring woman, and a ferociously protective mother.  She of course was not there when T collapsed, but it is possible to pin point almost to the second when that collapse occurred, sometime between when she heard T screaming, outside the house and coming up the stairs, to him being handed by the father into the mother&#8217;s arms, either limp and lifeless and having made as the mother describes T making an awful noise, the like of which she had never heard before and which in all likelihood signified his cardiorespiratory arrest. It is somewhat melodramatic but quite likely, the moment that T&#8217;s life was literally leaving him.  Having thought carefully about what the mother then did up until the emergency services quickly arrived, I am unable to identify anything which would suggest that she either caused or contributed to his condition, because a) the collapse had already occurred and b) because she acted with great presence of mind and focus; even when she felt compelled to invert T and jiggled or shook him (taking into account the fact he was floppy, supporting him firmly whilst holding his jaw), she had it seemed to be an accurate focussed recall.  Taking into account Mr Richards&#8217; fair appraisal of the possibilities, and Dr Cartlidge&#8217;s assessment, there is nothing in the mother&#8217;s evidence (or the father&#8217;s), notwithstanding that she says she would not do it again, to suggest that the mother&#8217;s actions were either causative or contributory at all.  But for the actions of the mother, T would not be with us today. </p>

I have in mind Ms Pine&#8217;s pertinent submissions that there is nothing in the father&#8217;s police interview or statement that would suggest his more newly stated avowed vulnerabilities, sensitivities and panic.  It would be wrong to say other than this aspect has troubled me, as too have the history and descriptions of the previous episodes on 15 and 18 March, both occurring in the father&#8217;s care.  Against that I record that there have been other serious incidents before and since which are nothing to do with the father at all.  The mother knows the father very well.  I am confident that the mother herself would have sensed, and acted appropriately if she concluded or even suspected that the father was lying.  In particular, in terms of reliability, that notwithstanding the mother&#8217;s love for the father, that that would have to also suborn her strongly protective maternal instincts.  The mother has been far from unquestioning either previously or now.  She is well placed to describe and assess the father&#8217;s character, but she does not doubt him. I am entitled to take that into account.  I am satisfied finally that the injuries were not caused as a result of some &#8220;intentional but momentary state of anger or frustration&#8221;.   </p>

There are other examples, the mother&#8217;s first labour, his inability to bring to mind the emergency services&#8217; telephone number, and the mother&#8217;s own appraisal of the father, all might suggest that he would not be able to operate at the high level that he in fact so evidently has.  These are surprising but not unique emotional or personality vulnerabilities.  Many people at the top of their profession are driven by other, often unacknowledged, deficiencies.  The odd thing to me is his ability to compartmentalise, either to shut out, or not shut out, what is at a given moment, the ability to focus on the mountain top but not focus rationally on dealing with a comparatively normal domestic event.   </p>

His perspective was I thought as unrealistic as it was bizarre, and which I find hard to reconcile or put into context.  What occurred that day is very worrying; the mother went out for just a few minutes, she was just a few houses away, but the father&#8217;s state quickly deteriorated into something like a cornered animal, he said himself that he was like a caged animal, incapable of reason or moderation.  T was just a tiny baby, it is by no means unusual for such a small child to be so dependant and focussed on their mother.  What is totally remarkable is the father&#8217;s apparent sense of rejection and helplessness, which was of course not just inapposite but ultimately in view of what occurred very troubling. </p>

I must consider whether he has simply blocked out what happened, through panic fear or distress. His recall of some of the salient events was poor. The father is not given to temper, quite the reverse.  I am entitled also to rely on the mother&#8217;s assessment of him, she knows him best.  If as I say she suspected he was lying she would I am confident say so.  Not without hesitation therefore, I conclude that there is no evidence (other than the injuries themselves) to suggest that they were occasioned by some momentary loss of temper or control.   </p>
