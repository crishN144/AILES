They were heard in private, in accordance with the Rules, at a hearing at which members of the press were in attendance.  Two questions now arise: should the press be allowed to report the hearing, and should there be a public judgment naming the parties?  Submissions have been made by the parties and by David Barrett and Mario Ledwith, journalists representing the Telegraph Media Group and Associated Newspapers respectively.</span></p>

They say that it was issued on the instructions of Mr Siddiqi and that the quotes from Stephen are not genuine but were invented by Mr Siddiqi to convey Stephen&#8217;s views.  They say that they did not know what Mr Siddiqi had done until the hearing was under way.</span></p>

Even if Mr Siddiqi did not tell them what he was doing, he knows them well enough to know that he was doing what they wanted.  Indeed, Linda made all the points that appear in the media alert when giving evidence.</span></p>

The applicant opposes the hearing being reported and asks for the judgment to be anonymised and reporting restriction to be imposed.  The Official Solicitor does not oppose reporting of the hearing along the lines proposed by the press as a fallback position, or the naming of the parties in the judgment.</span></p>

Once a hearing has taken place in private, even in the presence of the press, an application of the present type seeks to convert it into a public hearing retrospectively.  This is in my view problematic.   Parties and witnesses should normally know where they stand at the time that they are participating in a hearing.  While the court should maintain full flexibility in the operation of Rules 90 to 93, and there may be special cases in which a decision cannot be taken until after the event, I would be cautious before following that course in any normal circumstances.   In this case, I do not find a good  reason for departing from the rule that the hearing itself remains private.  </span></p>

I appreciate that journalists are experts in selecting material for public consumption and that judges are not, but having seen the extracts that the press wishes to publish against the background of my decision on publication of this judgment and the contents of the judgment itself, I do not find a good reason to endorse selective reporting from the hearing itself.</span></p>

Having thought about matters the Official Solicitor puts forward as an ideal solution that the parties should declare a truce; Mrs Aidiniantz should return to 1 Parkgate Road with a new care package funded by Mr Aidiniantz; that Ms AH is replaced by external carers who have both care and medical qualification such as to be approved by the responsible doctors, the local authority and the Official Solicitor; that Mr Aidiniantz and his wife and child should be allowed to visit at specified times and that he should hold off any threat to exclude Ms Mackertich and Mr Stephen Riley.  That proposal was specifically discussed by the parties in a break in the proceedings and got nowhere.  I am not aware of any significant movement by either side and perhaps that was not to be expected.  From my point of view and I expect the Official Solicitor&#8217;s also, there would have been some advantages to Mrs Aidiniantz returning to a familiar address, to her having high quality certified care and medical treatment, but above all to her being returned to arrangements that her children had agreed to.  </span></p>

It comes to this; that Mrs Aidiniantz should return to 1 Parkgate Road, but under effectively the existing arrangements that applied before she was taken to America on 4 April; or that she should go to a care and nursing home in Islington proposed by Mr Aidiniantz; or she should go to [a nursing home in the vicinity of Parkgate Road] &#8230; It is a home that Mrs Aidiniantz was in for about six weeks after she broke her hip in 2011.  </span></p>

The care package that is currently available is not adequate to meet this elderly and unwell lady&#8217;s needs and it is further confounded because there is such dispute about the main carer.  I reach no conclusions, still less adverse ones about Ms AH, but the fact of the matter is that she has become irrevocably bound up in the respondents&#8217; positions which are so very much antagonistic to the applicant&#8217;s.</span></p>

If Mrs Aidiniantz is in 1 Parkgate Road under current circumstances, then Mr Aidiniantz would be entering the property for limited periods under sufferance of a court order.  I accept that for somebody with Mrs Aidiniantz&#8217;s current difficulties there may be some comfort from familiarity of a home that she has occupied for some 18 years, but it has not been in recent times a happy home.  It has very much been a situation in which Mrs Aidiniantz has been under the support and guidance of the respondents.  I see no reason to differentiate between the applicant and the respondent in terms of overall responsibility, but I observe that the solution that the respondents are arguing for at the moment proved to be a total failure when it was last in place.  So Mrs Aidiniantz&#8217;s discharge, which I hope will be imminent, will on full consideration not be to 1 Parkgate Road.</span></p>

The immediate advantage of somewhere else is that it will be a home which will be professionally staffed, both in terms of care and medical treatment, but will be neutral ground so that neither part of the family can claim possession and that it will provide a period in which I hope Mrs Aidiniantz will be able to build up her reserves so that she can participate more effectively on her own behalf.</span></p>

He has not even bothered to visit the address.  So it seems to me that the only theoretical attraction of the Islington home is that it is a good way away from Parkgate Road.  That in my view can only be a theoretical attraction.  If Mrs Aidiniantz is going to be unsettled by going into a care home, then she will be even more unsettled by going into a care home that she has never visited before in an area that means, so far as I am aware, nothing to her.  A suggestion of that kind so glibly made and lightly researched is very much in keeping with the quality of this litigation generally and I reject it.</span></p>

It is in the vicinity of 1 Parkgate Road and that brings with it, as far as I can tell, two potential problems.  One is that if she is well enough Mrs Aidiniantz may pine or be induced to pine for her home.  As to that little can be done, particularly if anyone is disposed to unsettle her.  The other disadvantage is that it is not far from the respondents.  There are advantages to that.  I refer here to the disadvantages, namely that Mrs Aidiniantz might be incorporated back into the household at Parkgate Road without there being any oversight or control, though that can be prevented by court orders.</span></p>

At that point all realistic options will be considered.  </span></p>

Neither side sees how important the other is to their mother.  None of them reflects on their own behaviour.  Instead, every action is dictated by the wish to get the better of the other.  I have referred to John&#8217;s aggressive efforts to get Stephen and Ruth out of 1 Parkgate Road and his willingness to put his mother in a home he knows nothing about.  I have referred to the respondents&#8217; blatant attempts to obstruct John&#8217;s contact.  As soon as Mrs Aidiniantz&#8217;s voice was heard by outsiders, however faintly, they physically removed her; in 2014 it was to Linda&#8217;s home, and a year later to the day it was to Florida.  That trip was a blatant defiance of the court&#8217;s intentions and it is a measure of their lack of insight that the respondents imagine that it would be seen in any other way. </span></p>

In the first place, I accept the evidence of Ms G that she needs the care package that is on offer at the nursing home.  Two medically qualified staff are needed at all times.  Ms AH and those she enlists to help her are unqualified and unsuited to demonstrating the necessary professional standards.  Secondly, and more decisively, it is impossible to approve an arrangement that returns Mrs Aidiniantz to her home when her children have turned it into a warzone.  If John took over 1 Parkgate Road, things would be no better.  Mrs Aidiniantz needs a safe haven from her children&#8217;s activities, and that is what she has found in the nursing home.  She would not have this respite in a setting that was controlled by either camp.  </span></p>

He expresses concern about the role played by Ms AH and Mr Siddiqi.  There is in fact no sign of any harm having come from their few visits to date and, given the way in which the family members themselves behave, I cannot share the view that the exclusion of other partisans would allow Mrs Aidiniantz to feel </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">&#8220;free of influence&#8221;.  </span><span style="font-size:12pt">The management of the home should be left to manage these issues.</span></p>

I  agree with the Official Solicitor that any financial abuse of the elderly is a serious matter, but that here a third party investigation would be complicated, expensive and unlikely to be of benefit to Mrs Aidiniantz, whose needs are currently being met.  I will make the appropriate orders for the reception of her modest pensions.  Other disputes about money, property and shares can be pursued by her children elsewhere if that is their choice.</span></p>

I make no such assumption but nevertheless reach the conclusion that there is little to choose between these parties in regard to their litigation conduct and their conduct towards their mother.  While the respondents&#8217; conduct during these proceedings has been even worse than the applicant&#8217;s, it would be unrealistic to separate these matters from the overall history.  Any departure from the &#8216;no order&#8217; principle would probably be in the form of an order that each side should pay the other side&#8217;s costs as a mark of the court&#8217;s indignation.</span></p>
