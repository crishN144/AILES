In fact, their relationship, as I understand it, really had come to an end before M was born, although the father was present during M's birth.  Initially, his contact time with M was sporadic and limited.  There were earlier proceedings arising out of allegations by the father that the mother had abducted the child or was attempting to abduct the child to her home country, Poland, and then subsequently court proceedings under the Children Act because the parties were unable to agree about the division of time that M should spend with her two parents.  </span></p>

There was a hearing in August 2016 at which evidence was given, the parties at that stage being represented by very experienced counsel.  There was some agreement about issues but also some disagreement.  Arguments were put before the judge by email containing written submissions, and she gave a preliminary ruling in a document of 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October.

Those detailed orders provide that, save for times as detailed in the order, the child would live with the mother.  For the times detailed, she would live with the father and those times were, from August 2016, with the father every Saturday morning to Sunday evening with some interim variation and then, from November 2016, she would live with the father every other weekend from 5.00&#160;p.m. on Friday until 6.00&#160;p.m. on Sunday.  In addition, to the alternate weekend contact, M will spend one twenty-four-hour period every week in the care of her father.</span></p>

Here there is quite a detailed provision about holiday contact.  I am not going to read it all out because it would make this judgment too long, but it is a long provision and, again, it indicates both the complexities of the arrangements here, but also the capacity of the parents to agree matters, despite their mutual antagonism.  The order recites arrangements about the times the father would have with M on holiday, the times the mother would have on holidays and also about provision of the mother taking M to Poland.  The mother is Polish, M is half-Polish and M's Polish heritage is a crucial component of her background and identity and needs to be sustained so, understandably, this features in the order.</span></p>

Mother has been assisted, if I may say so, very professionally and competently by Mr.&#160;Botterrill, acting as Mackenzie Friend.  When I saw the papers, I was immediately concerned about one aspect of the order and therefore, decided to list the matter for an oral hearing of the application of permission to appeal, with appeal to follow if permission was granted.  As a result, both parents have attended before me today in person and, as I indicated at the outset of the hearing, my approach was to focus on the issues in dispute and try to get a resolution, practically, if at all possible.  I do so in the context of this application which is for permission to appeal.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As I reminded the parties at the outset, my powers are limited.  This is not a rehearing of the whole issue.  An appeal court can only interfere with a judge's decision at first instance if the appellant satisfies the court that the judge was wrong or that the order or process was unjust or unfair because of some procedural or other irregularity.  Before we get to that stage, the mother needs to obtain permission to appeal and permission can only be granted if there is a real prospect of the appeal succeeding or some other compelling reason why the appeal should proceed.  As the mother recognised, this is a fairly high hurdle for her to overcome.</span></p>

One of these concerns the initial recital to which I referred earlier and the others all relate to the three points of holiday contact which I have highlighted when going through the draft order a moment ago.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The first point is the mother objects strongly to the inclusion of the phrase "live with" in the order as far as the father's time is concerned.  She says she has never agreed to the child "living with the father".  She would rather the order said that the child lives with her and spends time with or has contact with the father.  This, of course, goes to the provisions of s.8 of the Children Act, the definition of a child arrangements order being an order regulating arrangements relating to any of the following (a) with whom a child is to live, spend time or otherwise have contact, (b) when a child is to live, spend time or otherwise have contact with any other person. Parents in these circumstances often get extremely anxious or concerned about the language used and Parliament has had more than one go at trying to sort that out to avoid the impression of any parent having any particular benefit through the use of language.  That is why &#8220;custody&#8221; and &#8220;access&#8221; gave way to &#8220;residence&#8221; and &#8220;contact&#8221; and now under the new law, the &#8220;child arrangements order&#8221;.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">On one view, where a child is to spend substantial amounts of time with one parent or both parents, then it does not really matter what terms are being used.  The important thing is what is actually happening on the ground - what is actually happening in terms of the time and where is the child going to be.  Importantly, however, the way an order is phrased says a great deal to the child herself that both parents are committed to the child - that both parents love her and that she has two parents in her life who, sadly, can no longer get on with each other but both love her and are 100% committed to her.  For that reason, courts increasingly favour using language which is non-discriminating between the parents. Consequently, the use of the phrase "lived with" is frequently used and encouraged by the courts in circumstances where there is, if not an equal division of time, a substantial amount of time spent with both parents.</span></p>

If you added up the number of days in the year, you will find, I am sure, that the child will spend more than one-hundred days with the father.  I have not added it exactly up but it must be over one hundred, bearing in mind the holidays. That is a substantial amount of time.</span></p>

The key point is that the child is living with the mother and the father in substantial proportions &#8211; a greater amount of time with the mother, as is right, given her age and all the circumstances, but a substantial amount with the father.  The judge decided that this was the right way to express the order and, having listened to the mother's arguments, I do not think it could possibly be said that the judge was wrong.</span></p>

She described the father as being quite controlling and was concerned that he would continue to make allegations against her, as she says he has in the past.  She rightly says that the Cafcass officer did not recommend the order which the judge made or, indeed, really address the issues which have been canvassed before me today.  She complains that the father's attitude towards her continues to be overly aggressive and challenging in his skeleton argument filed for this application today.  She is concerned about the possible psychological and emotional harm to the child if she does not have a secure base with one parent which she could call home.</span></p>

The judge is a very experienced family judge, and I am satisfied that she had the issues firmly in mind.  Consequently, I do not accept that the judge's order was wrong in saying that the child should live with one parent and with the other parent.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">However, there is no doubt that, at the time when she finally made the order (in November, although it is dated August in the unusual circumstances I have described), the judge was wrong to record the mother as agreeing to it.  The father points out that, in earlier iterations of the draft order, it was recorded that the parties agreed the phrase, "lived with" and that may well be right.  That clearly was in the judge's thinking, looking at the transcript, when the time came to make the final order.  On any view, however, having read the transcript of that hearing and heard the mother's arguments today, she does not consent and did not consent at the time in November to the order being expressed in those terms.  To that extent and on that point, I think this appeal is well-founded, so I will shortly, at the conclusion of this hearing, take steps to address that issue.  In other respects, on that point, I do not accept the mother has satisfied me that the judge was wrong to make the order.</span></p>

On this point, I have some sympathies with the parties as they have sought to grapple with what the judge was actually intending to say, although, having said that, having studied it carefully I have concluded that it is ultimately pretty clear what the judge had in mind. As I have indicated, the judge divided the question of trips to Poland into two &#8211; first, from summer 2016 onwards, twenty-one days once a year visiting her family and secondly, other short trips to Poland or elsewhere, provided they do not intrude into the father's time with M.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The mother's concern is around that last clause.  She has submitted in her written document that the phrase "provided it does not intrude into the father's time with M" effectively emasculates (my word not hers) the order because, as drafted, she says it would be impossible for any meaningful time to be spent in Poland without intruding into the father's contact time.  That is because the father is having contact as I have described on a regular basis every other weekend and once a week, at the moment, every Tuesday night.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Of course, that would enable the mother to take the child to Poland between Wednesday night or Thursday morning and the following Tuesday morning over the weekends when the father did not have contact but at all other times, on a strict interpretation, the mother would be hamstrung.  However, in my view, that is not what the judge intended.  By "intrude into the father's time", I do not read the judge as indicating that there should be complete inflexibility into the father's time.  Rather, she meant that, provided the father had time with the child and did not lose time with the child as a result of contact, it would, of course, be possible and, indeed, in the child's interest to be taken to Poland for shorter trips.  </span></p>

I also suspect that, if the parties had enough time &#8211; and, if I can be frank, were sensible about it &#8211; they could probably agree for arrangements to be made for the mother to spend rather longer, maybe twelve days, maybe even a fortnight in Poland, provided the father is compensated with contact at other times.  </span></p>

It will be recalled that the judge provided that the parents should decide the holiday dates by 30 January each Easter to Summer and by 30&#160;May for October to Easter.  The mother says that is requiring her to fix things far too far in advance.  She needs more flexibility. Life changes, obligations change, commitments change, and it is not fair to expect her to fix the date so far in advance.  The father, on the other hand, says that, because of his work commitments, it is essential he should have as much time as possible.  It seems to me that the judge's solution takes a halfway house between the two positions of the parties and is entirely sensible. I see no reason for interfering with the judge's decision.  The mother has not persuaded me that there is any possibility of concluding that the judge was wrong in the approach that she took.</span></p>

The summer holiday contact for father &#8211; and I use the word "contact" as short-hand &#8211; would be that it is proposed that he should have two periods of seven days in summer 2017 and, thereafter, a period of fourteen days and a second period of seven days in the summer holidays 2018.  This arrangement shall last until the child goes to school.</span></p>

Secondly, she asserts that it is too long for M to be away from her mother at this stage - later perhaps when she is a bit older, but not now.  Thirdly, she argues that, as the father himself has only limited holiday-time, twenty-five days a year plus a few additional days, he simply cannot accommodate that whole holiday contact arrangement which totals twenty-nine days, so that other arrangements will have to be made for the care of the child when she is with him.  The father in response concedes that he might not be able to take the time as holiday, but points out the child would be able to spend time with his paternal grandmother and also with others.  </span></p>

M is now two and she will be over 3&#189; before she spends the fourteen-day period with her father in the summer of 2018.  I do not consider that that is too young for her to spend time away from her mother, particularly with her father who knows her well and  loves her. Plainly, there are no significant concerns in terms of his capacity to care for the child, otherwise there would not be the enormous measure of agreement about contact to which I have already referred. It will be recalled that the parties agreed that during holiday-time there will be a provision for Skype, Facetime or telephone calls at least once a week whilst on holiday and other arrangements which I have read out in the recitals at the start of this judgment.</span></p>
