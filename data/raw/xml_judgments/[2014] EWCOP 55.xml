	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Hillingdon has no connection with PS as it provides no care services to him, it does not manage his money or income, it has no historical connection to PS and has already determined that there are no safeguarding issues.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The only reason for the application is because Hillingdon feels that restrictions on contact should be imposed by the court. CS says that this is using the court as an insurance policy to reinforce its own decision that there should be no contact and if Hillingdon really felt that the court should be involved, it should have made its application in September 2013 when the issue first fell for determination.</p>

	  <num>26.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is also no benefit to PS from this application because before September 2013, contact was stopped on the advice of PS&#8217; doctor and in September 2013, the decision was made on a more formal basis to stop contact. Future contact decisions can be made without the court&#8217;s intervention by CS, the attorneys and those caring for PS on a daily basis. Counsel for CS made the point that decisions about incapacitated adults are made every day of the week in care homes and &#8220;where special privacy arrangements are central to residents&#8217; needs&#8221;. None of this requires a court decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final argument is that the whole court process in the context of this particular dispute is disproportionate and costly such that it is not in PS&#8217; best interests to allow this litigation to proceed especially as M has made no application and the effect of it could seriously deplete PS&#8217; finances and impact the staff at his residential home.</p>

A permission hearing is a preliminary first step in a case and my view (fortified by the language of rule 56) is that there can be no expectation that the court will hear from every person. Who should attend depends on the facts and the needs of a case in the context of the permission application.</p>

M would not be prejudiced in any way as M herself had not sought to involve the court. If unsuccessful, the case would proceed and at that beginning stage, the court would have to consider M&#8217;s position and involvement in the proceedings. In circumstances where M had made no contact application herself and had observed Hillingdon&#8217;s directive that she not contact PS, it was decided that the most proportionate and cost-effective way of dealing with this preliminary stage was to hear CS&#8217; objections only at a hearing. </p>

CS recognised and allowed this local authority involvement concerning PS and he cannot now say they have nothing to do with this dispute. Hillingdon rightly in my view identified that there was an issue important to PS that required their input. To say that Hillingdon therefore has no connection with PS is to ignore reality.</p>

There is a conflict over whether M should have contact with PS with whom she was associated for a number of years. M wants to see him; CS and the attorneys object. Given the failure of mediation and best interests processes, Hillingdon is right to ask the court to intervene in circumstances where they have been involved in this issue. It is immaterial that M has not herself made an application. I also reject the suggestion that Hillingdon is merely trying to enforce its decision; its application goes beyond that. </p>
