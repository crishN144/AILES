		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The Hague Convention of 1980 is arguably the most successful ever international treaty and it has over 90 subscribers to it, over half the countries in the world.  The underlying and central foundation of the Convention is that, where a child has been unilaterally removed from the land of her habitual residence in breach of someone&#8217;s rights of custody, then she should be swiftly returned to that country for the courts of that country to decide on her long-term future.  </span></p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">There are very few exceptions to this and the exceptions that do exist have to be interpreted very narrowly in order that the central premise of the Convention is not fatally undermined.  It is important to understand what the Convention does not do.  The Convention does not order a child who has been removed in the circumstances I have described to live with anybody.  The Convention does not provide that the parent who is left behind should, on the return of the child, have contact or access in any particular way.  The Convention does not provide that, when an order for return to the child&#8217;s homeland is made, the child should stay there indefinitely.  All the Convention provides is that the child should be returned for the specific purpose and limited period to enable the court of her homeland to decide on her long-term future.  That is all it decides. </span></p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Where exceptions come into play, such as for example the exception mentioned in Article 13 of the Convention, which is that the child objects to being returned and has attained a degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take her account her views, the type and nature of the exception has to be examined in the context of the limited objectives of the Convention.  It must be a sound, reasoned and mature objection to being returned to her homeland for the sole limited purpose of enabling the court of that country to determine her long-term future.  Equally, if the exception that is relied on is that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation, that again has to be seen through the lens of the objective of the Convention.  We are not talking here about long-term risks.   We are not talking here about long-term harm.  We are talking about risks and harm that would eventuate only in the period that it takes for the court of the child&#8217;s homeland to determine her long-term future and to impose the necessary safeguards, if necessary, in the interim.&#8221;</span></p>

The expressions I will use for the purposes of this judgment are &#8220;the home country&#8221; as the country from which the child was taken, and &#8220;the away country&#8221; as the country to which the child has been taken.  If the home country and the away country are both members of the European Union, alternatively both are subscribers to the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, then those principles which I have mentioned are modified  substantially. </span></p>

The courts of the Member State to or in which the child has been wrongfully removed or retained should be able to oppose his or her return in specific, duly justified cases.  However, such a decision could be replaced by a subsequent decision by the court of the Member State of habitual residence of the child prior to the wrongful removal or retention. Should that judgment entail the return of the child, the return should take place without any special procedure being required for recognition and enforcement of that judgment in the Member State to or in which the child has been removed or retained.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">That Recital seems to me to represent an uneasy compromise between two opposing factions involved in the framing of Brussels II Revised.  As my previous judgment demonstrates, there was a faction - it may have even been the view of the Commission - that the time had come to adopt a system of mutual recognition of orders which would obviate the need for the existence of the Hague Convention at all  within the European Union.  A scheme of mutual recognition of orders would mean that if a child was wrongfully removed from one European state to another, the home state would make an order for the return of the child and, subject to very limited defences, the child would be returned by the away state pursuant to an order for reciprocal enforcement.   One can see that in such circumstances the need for advancing a claim for summary return in the away court under the 1980 Convention, or to allow any kind of expansive defences, would dissolve.   That scheme of Brussels II Revised in fact mirrored the 1996 Convention which again provides for a scheme of reciprocal recognition of orders.   It is equally clear that another faction wished to retain, possibly having regard to its iconic significance, the 1980 Convention, and so Recital (17) seems to me to represent a rather uneasy compromise between the two factions. </span></p>

For these purposes there are two aspects of Article 11 that are highly relevant.   Firstly Article 11.4 states:</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As is known Article 13(b) is probably the most commonly advanced defence in proceedings under the Hague Convention.  That provides that if the defendant can establish that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm, or would otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation, then there is a discretion which, if those facts were proved, would almost invariably be exercised against a return.  When looking at Article 13 I observe that underneath 13(b) one finds the defence of child objections which states:</span></p>

However, it was, at least to my knowledge, not common place - in fact almost unknown - for protective measures which would satisfy the terms of Article 11.4 to be made under Article 20.  However, since the arrival on the scene of the 1996 Convention it has become common, as least in this court, for this court to make orders under Article 11 of the 1996 Convention which then have the effect of satisfying the terms of Article 11.4 of Brussels II Revised. </span></p>
