Her own and L&#8217;s passports each have visas entitling them to live in Australia until March 2016. If the holiday to England in early June had ended in the mother&#8217;s and children&#8217;s return to Australia, it is fair to assume they would have re-entered on those visas. By her own actions in contacting the Immigration Department the mother has sought to erect barriers to return. But, in the different circumstances which now apply, the mother could apply for visitors&#8217; or other visas. Australia is, of course, a Commonwealth country; it makes no sense at all to suggest there will be insuperable immigration problems. There is also the potential for assistance from the Australian Network Judge, should it be needed, so as to establish whether, in the event of a return order, immigration problems might be avoided and if so how.</p>

According to the father, broadly accepted by the mother, throughout L&#8217;s life there has been regular staying contact. This father has always been committed to and involved in his son&#8217;s life.

But considering the factual background as to how L&#8217;s relationship with his father has been promoted throughout his life and the positives noted by Mr McGavin, it is really quite impossible to conclude that a return into the father&#8217;s household would fulfil the criteria for the establishment of an Article 13B exception.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr McGavin told L at the end of the interview that although he would faithfully report his wishes to the court, he &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">was not able to assure him that they amount to an &#8216;objection&#8217; in Hague Convention terms</span>.&#8221; In evidence, Mr McGavin added that he is always interested to see what a child&#8217;s reaction is to news of that kind. Sometimes there is a dramatic response. L did not say anything or otherwise react. Mr McGavin ended that section of his report, I should add, by saying it would be for the court to determine whether L&#8217;s wishes amount to a preference or an objection. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am in no doubt. L has expressed wishes and feelings but they fall a long way short of an objection in Convention terms. Neither from the contents of L&#8217;s letter nor from the interview with Mr McGavin could I conclude there was a strength, conviction and a rationality which could be said to amount to an objection.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should add, for the avoidance of doubt, that had I been persuaded in relation to the first of the gateway questions, I would have gone on to find that L has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views. Clearly, he is an articulate, intelligent young person who was well able to present his thoughts in a mature and balanced way. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The last matter for comment in relation to &#8216;child&#8217;s objections&#8217; relates to the way in which I would have exercised my discretion had I been satisfied in relation to the two gateway questions. Pursuant to Lady Hale&#8217;s  guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Abduction: Zimbabwe) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2007/55" uk:canonical="[2007] UKHL 55" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] UKHL 55</ref>, &#8220;(O)nce the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child&#8217;s objections, the extent to which they are &#8220;authentically (his) own&#8221; or the product of influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to &#8230; welfare, as well as general Convention considerations &#8230;. The older the child, the greater the weight that (his) objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child&#8217;s objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.</span>&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this instance, had there been an established &#8216;objection,&#8217; I should nonetheless have exercised my discretion so as to make an order for summary return. My reasons would have been these. Inevitably, L will have absorbed his mother&#8217;s strong desire to remain here and make a new life in this country. As to that, as emerges from the written evidence and L&#8217;s letter to me, my sense is that the mother is robustly supported by the maternal grandmother and her partner. L says, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">My nanny and granddad have really helped us so much and we really needed them</span>.&#8221; L has been influenced, quite obviously, by the attitudes and feelings within the maternal family home.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is also relevant that the mother&#8217;s actions in bringing and retaining L here amount to flagrant abduction. There can be no real question about the father&#8217;s complete lack of knowledge as to what was about to happen at the beginning of June. On any fair reading of his own and his wife&#8217;s statements, when they last saw L (between 22 and 26 May) they had no reason to believe they would not see him again in a few weeks time.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother came here for a supposed holiday which turned into a plan to remain within days of their arrival. The mother told the father on 22 June she had &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not made this decision in haste</span>.&#8221; The emails between her and the father can lead to only one conclusion as to the mother&#8217;s motivation. She had decided what she wanted for herself and what was in L&#8217;s welfare interests and was determined to secure her objectives irrespective of the father&#8217;s reaction. The father&#8217;s emails tell their own story of shock, distress, even incredulity in relation to the events of June.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The underlying assumption of the Hague Convention is that the best interests of children will be served by a swift return to the country of habitual residence. It must be the case that the courts of Australia are better placed than those here to decide welfare issues in relation to L. I remind myself that the Convention is there, not only to secure the prompt return of abducted children but also to deter abduction in the first place. The message, said Lady Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (supra), </span>&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">should go out that there are no safe havens among the Contracting States.</span>&#8221;</p>

But I am in no doubt about her failure to establish an exception to mandatory return.  Had I been required to exercise my discretion then I reiterate I should have done so not to permit L to remain here but so as to ensure his return. </p>
