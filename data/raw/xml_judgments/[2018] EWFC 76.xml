	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I am concerned with two children, BT and GT who are twins who were born in 2010. It is almost impossible to imagine the circumstances in which it would be considered appropriate to separate twins and place them for adoption by different prospective adopters. This is, however, what occurred in this case and I have before me an application by a couple, whom I shall refer to as A and B, to adopt BT and an application by a single carer whom I shall refer to as C, to adopt GT. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As I shall set out in some detail, I am satisfied and find that the court is in the position of considering applications to adopt the twins in two separate homes because of the incompetence and serial failings of the local authority, Herefordshire Council, and the egregious behaviour of some of its former staff. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The mother of BT and GT is BM. She has played no part in this hearing of the adoption applications and failed to file an application for permission to oppose the making of orders for the adoption of the children. She has attended only one directions hearing on 18 July 2018 in Worcester. The mother had been made an intervenor in these proceedings but because of her failure to engage with the same, I discharged her as an intervenor. The father of BT and GT is BF. He has played no role in these proceedings. </p>

These admitted failings are supplemented by further admissions of failings by the local authority, together with notes of the actions taken by or to be taken by the local authority to prevent, or at least, ameliorate the future risk of such failures of the system and of social work practice occurring. This schedule was prepared by Liz Elgar, the assistant director of children&#8217;s services and is set out in Annexe 2 to this judgment. </p>

The social worker was not called to give evidence before me nor has she been given the opportunity to give an explanation. Therefore, I will not name her in this judgment. The prospects of this being an innocent omission are unlikely in the extreme. It is not an opening or concluding sentence that has been missed. It is a passage in the middle of the quoted passage from the report and the deliberate omission of some words was marked by three dots. Given also that the omitted section of Dr Mair Edwards&#8217; report sets out an opinion wholly contrary to the ultimate recommendation of the sibling assessment, the only credible explanation for this omission is a deliberate act to mislead a reader of the assessment to conclude that the recommendation of separate placements for adoption was consistent with the opinion of Dr Mair Edwards.

Despite the clinically significant emotional (regulation), social and behavioural difficulties she presents with, there is not convincing evidence at this stage to support a diagnosis of any major psychiatric condition; her symptoms are best understood in the context of both specific and general developmental trauma (including neglect) and a global developmental delay. The disconnected way she relates to herself and associated relational problems serve to protect her from the impact of overwhelming feelings, at the cost of impaired functioning and development. Her early history, combined with her current presentation, place her at a very high risk for developing a major psychiatric condition in the future without significant and prolonged intervention (described elsewhere in this report). </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.3in;margin-right:1in">There are several protective factors in GT&#8217;s life &#8211; she can be a warm, enthusiastic and playful girl with a quirky sense of humour. She appears to have made significant progress in her current placement and can now sometimes use others to help her understand her own internal experiences. The increasingly secure relationship we observed with her prospective adopter is, itself a protective factor. However, as we saw during the course of the assessment, the progress GT has made is very fragile and she can quickly resort to primitive defence mechanisms such as disassociation to segregate intolerable mental states when she is in touch with difficult feelings or memories. It is likely that such defence mechanisms helped her to survive her early trauma. However, their continued use had led to significant disturbance in the development of a coherent self-construct, as she appears to have an only just emerging sense of self. Lack of a coherent sense of self is a significant risk factor in difficulties in the development of personality. </p>

Given the availability of benign but clear boundaries in a context of love in her primary carer relationship, an continued assessment and intensive therapeutic input (described elsewhere in this report), this delay might be expected to reduce over time. Our understanding is that there had already been significant developmental catch up since GT came to her present care setting. However, it is impossible to say at this stage to what extent this is likely to occur, and in our view, it is quite likely that GT will retain some level of learning difficulty. At this stage we hypothesise that the autistic type behaviours observed during the assessment are primarily associated with GT&#8217;s disconnected states of mind and mistrust in the world/others. However, we recommend further assessment in the future.&#8221; </p>

There is some evidence that BT works to distance himself from that in the current contact and there is a history and complex and at times negative dynamics in their relationship with one another. It is likely that his would make living together and sharing resources very difficult for BT and GT and would set up the adults charged with this responsibility, with an extremely difficult task. GT and BT need to be able to regulate their experiences of connection with one another and with their early memories, which would be almost impossible if they were living as part of one family. </p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1.3in;margin-right:1in">&#8220;In our opinion, BT and GT remain very vulnerable and each child&#8217;s emerging sense of safety remains fragile. Direct contact with members of their birth family who they haven&#8217;t seen since before they moved into their current homes would likely undermine this progress and of the tentative sense of safety that they are each developing.&#8221; </p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1.3in;margin-right:1in">&#8220;While it may be that incidents of direct abuse were largely perpetrated by their birth father, the evidence in both children (of their current emotional functioning) suggests that neither parent was able to provide a consistent sense of safety. In addition, it is likely that BT and GT&#8217;s memories of their early years are of a bodily/sensory type and perhaps audio/visual but are unlikely to be coherent or autobiographical in nature. As such, there may be things that they would notice about their birth mother (such as the sound of her voice/the way that she smells) that triggers responses related to traumatic experiences, even if these actually belong more firmly to their memories of their birth father. </p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1.3in;margin-right:1in">On this basis, we can speculate that direct contact would likely be a frightening experience. Further, the trust that they are building in their carers to keep them safe and help them to regulate overwhelming negative affect would likely be profoundly undermined by this experience. </p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1.3in;margin-right:1in">We do not recommend that direct contact with the birth mother should be considered until the children are old enough to explore this possibility for themselves (probably in adolescence) and even then, this should be approached with caution. In the meantime, we recommend that annual letterbox contact is appropriate to maintain a link for the purposes of BT and GT&#8217;s developing identity.&#8221; </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.3in;margin-right:1in">&#8220;However, our assessment leads us to speculate that GT and BT might be more able to manage direct contact with their older siblings once their primary attachment relationships (with their adoptive parents) and their relationship with one another are more firmly established. This leads us to recommend that twice a year letterbox contact should be set up at this time (to include photographs if this is safely possible) and that the possibility of direct contact should be revisited in 2 years&#8217; time. This contact reassessment should include a review of the quality of letterbox contact in the intervening period; an update on how settled GT and BT has each become in their adoptive families (for example frequency of emotional dysregulation, how they have managed minor difficult experiences or transitions, how they have been able to make and manage new relationship); an update on the circumstances of whichever birth sibling has requested contact (how settled they are in their own relationships, their emotional wellbeing, how close their relationships are with other birth family members and how well they would be able to maintain a level of safe confidentiality for example about the whereabouts of each twin&#8217;s adoptive family).&#8221; </p>

Living apart but coming together at regular contact visits offers them the best opportunity to enable them to build a positive and enduring relationship with each other. The recommendation was that contact should occur at a minimum of six times per year with indirect contact by Skype, Facetime and/or letters and cards taking place on a more frequent basis. Ongoing direct and indirect contact is so vital for BT and GT that Dr Morris advised that the court should make a contact order. This is required to make very clear the importance of contact for the twins and not because of any lack of commitment on the part of the prospective adopters. All three of them recognise and accept the children&#8217;s need for regular and indirect contact and are fully committed to ensure the same occurs. </p>

They had not previously taken into account that the fact that by being adopted separately BT and GT would lose their legal status as brother and sister (I mention this not as a point of criticism but as a matter of fact). They both reflected. They then gave a very powerful reason for preferring an adoption order. BT and GT will be likely to remain vulnerable into early adulthood. They will need a legal family to provide for and to look after them beyond attaining the age of 18. An adoption would provide this forever family. A SGO, of course, would cease to have effect when they attain their majority. The carers would then have no relationship or connection with BT or GT in law. The only people who would have a legal relationship with would be their mother and their father: the very people who had harmed and abused them and caused them profound emotional, psychological and developmental damage. </p>

Mr Noble had noted that some of the documents disclosed in the hearing related to events some months or even up to two years before but had only appeared on the local authority&#8217;s computer system within days of each other in February or March 2018. When asked why this was, Ms Leader said that the previous social worker, D, had got seriously behind with her administration and had thus spent the last few days of her employment uploading two years worth of notes, records and other documents onto the system. When asked how this could have been allowed to happen, she could give no answer other than to say it was not good practice. This ranks as a masterful understatement and was a completely inadequate response. For the last seven or eight months of the social worker&#8217;s employment in children&#8217;s services, Ms Leader had been her line manager and had taken no effective steps to remedy this extraordinary state of affairs. </p>

He is happy and relaxed with us. We spend many days happily doing normal things that families do. Sometimes we just play and potter around at home together. Other days we might go out riding on our bikes or visiting family and friends. Sometimes, the court proceedings and conversations with the local authority, make it seem like our family life is constantly strained by BT&#8217;s behaviour and our ability to cope with it. In fact, this is far from accurate. Whilst BT&#8217;s behaviour has of course been very challenging, especially in the first months, we have in more recent months actually found most of our time with BT to be the family we wanted and expected it to be when we adopted. We feel that BT is also happy and feels like he is part of a family, living a positive family life. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.8in;margin-right:1in;text-indent:0.5in">We think that BT needs and deserves a family life with the permanency and security that only adoption can provide. Over the last year we have developed trust and family life with BT and worked consistently to increase his sense and understanding that his new family with us is forever, and that we will always look after him. BT refers to us as a family, wants family hugs and draws pictures of us all together. He is bonding with, and embracing of, our wider families. He is excited and is starting to understand that they are now his family. BT loves playing with his cousins and chatting with aunts, uncles and grandparents. For example, one of his favourite things to do is to sing along to the radio, especially with his grandmother who he refers to as &#8216;nan&#8217;.&#8221; But he does present challenging behaviour at times: </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.3in;margin-right:1in">&#8220;The level of BT&#8217;s violence was a shock to us and it was not something we were prepared for. It certainly took us a while to learn the most effective ways to respond to it (and we are still learning each day). We have tried to understand BT&#8217;s behaviours and it causes, appreciating that due to his early years and his unprocessed trauma, that BT is a child who can easily be triggered into a fight or flight response. We have and continue to work hard to make BT feel safe and to distract him and reassure him as needed to reduce the times he triggers. We understand that once in the &#8216;fight or flight&#8217; response that BT is no longer using his rational/thinking part of his brain and is lashing out to protect himself, the most basic of instincts. </p>

Where possible we do this with a cuddle and when necessary we wrap our arms around BT in a safe hold that keep BT and us safe. BT had always received from us the robust message that violence is not acceptable and he must not hit. He is very aware that it is not acceptable, the days when he has not hit, he will often at bedtime say &#8216;no hitting today&#8217; and seem genuinely proud of himself.&#8221; </p>

We have been a family for a year now and our closeness and sense of family increases with each day. We want and have always wanted to adopt BT. Quite simply, he fits perfectly with us. We want to give him that permanent security for the rest of his life. For the first time in his life he has parents who will love and look after him forever. We are clear that only adoption will enable BT to have that. We don&#8217;t want BT to miss out on being adopted and having a forever family because of the flaws in other people&#8217;s actions.

The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> imposes duties on the local authority in respect of the care of children. If the local authority receives information that a child has been subjected to or is likely to be subjected to serious harm it has a duty to investigate the report and, where there are reasonable grounds for believing that it may be well founded, to instigate care proceedings. In this respect the role of a local authority has much in common with the role of a prosecuting authority in criminal proceedings. It is for the court, and not the local authority, to decide whether the allegations are well founded. It is a serious misfortune to be the subject of unjustified allegations in relation to misconduct to a child, but where it is reasonable that these should be investigated by a court, justice does not demand that the local authority responsible for placing the allegations before the court should ultimately be responsible for the legal costs of the person against whom the allegations are made.  </p>

Wilson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">In re J </span>at para 19 disclaimed any suggestion that it was appropriate "in the vast run of these cases to make an order for costs in whole or in part by reference to the court's determination of issues of historical fact". But, as I have indicated, there is no valid basis for restricting his approach in that case to findings in a split hearing. The principle that he applied would open the door to successful costs applications against local authorities in respect of many determinations of issues of historical fact. The effect on the resources of local authorities, and the uses to which those resources are put would be significant.  </p>

Judge Dowse's costs order was founded on this practice. It was sound in principle and should not have been reversed by the Court of Appeal.&#8221; </p>

Paragraph 10.7 and 12.3-12.15 of the statement of 30 Jan 2018 is unintentionally misleading. The statement of 8 March 2018 inaccurately asserted the sibling assessment had been completed in April 2016 prior to the LAC review (CB523 and CB526 pa 5.6 main bundle). These statements quote from the assessment, which is dated July 2016. In March 2018 the LA asserted its decision making had been appropriately made [CB529 main bundle pa 7.00]. These errors were corrected in the 6 April 2018 statement of Chris Baird [CB611 main bundle].  </p>
