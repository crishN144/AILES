The supplementary code of practice provides at paragraph 4.71 that the assessor must set out reasons for the period selected and that this will be based on the information obtained during the consultation process but should also reflect information from the person&#8217;s care plan about how long any treatment or care will be required in circumstances that amount to a deprivation of liberty.  It should also take into account any available indication of how likely it is that the relevant person&#8217;s circumstances will change including the expected progression of the illness or disability.  The underlying principle is that deprivation of liberty should be for the minimum period necessary so for the maximum twelve month period to apply the assessor will need to be confident that there is unlikely to be a change in a person&#8217;s circumstances that would affect the authorisation within that timescale.  The best interests assessment may include recommendations about conditions to which the standard authorisation is or is not to be subject in accordance with paragraph 53.  The supervisory body must have regard to any such recommendation when granting an authorisation.  The BIA may not specify conditions that do not directly relate to the issue of the DOL.  Insofar as the use of medication is relevant to the DOL then conditions around reviewing the use of medication and its impact on the person and the DOL with a view to reducing any restrictions are appropriate.  </span></p>

The guidelines published by NICE (National Institution for Healthcare and Excellence) provide that medication should not be administered covertly until after a best interest meeting has been held, unless in urgent circumstances.  Care homes are to ensure that if a decision is taken to covertly administer medicine to an adult care home resident, then a management plan should also be agreed and recorded after a best interest meeting.  The meeting should be between healthcare professionals and family members.  The decision to covertly administer diazepam as compared to promethazine, was not communicated to the supervisory body.  The care home as managing authority has a duty to keep a patient&#8217;s case under review and if any of the qualifying requirements appear to be reviewable then it must request a review.  The supervisory body in this case BMBC may be almost entirely dependent upon the managing authority (the care home) to notify it of any change or proposed change to care/treatment.  </span></p>

This should include notification of the need for safeguarding and internal reviews, independent of the Schedule A1 process.  While each case will be fact specific I would suggest that where the use of covert medication is known at the time of the best interests assessment it would be inappropriate for the standard authorisation to be for the maximum period without either conditions being attached for review or preferably for there to be a shorter period of authorisation.  On the facts of this particular case a six month period would have been more appropriate.  The duration of the authorisation is of course linked to the internal reviews that the managing authority should  carry out.  The more regular these reviews the more likely the justification for a longer period of authorisation.</span></p>

A clear omission of information relating to additional restrictions or interference with autonomy is a relevant change in the circumstances known to the best interest assessor that should trigger an immediate review under part 8.  This would also apply to new circumstances arising after the DOL is granted and that were not known about or did not exist at the time.  </span></p>

It was of course carried out against the background of the requested part 8 review and Section 21A challenge.  It is a more comprehensive assessment by the BIA of the issues surrounding AG, has clearly involved consultation with family and healthcare professionals and has flagged up not only the significant issues that arise from covert medication policy but also the need to review the care plan given the consensus that AG requires a high level of care for a variety of reasons.  </span></p>
