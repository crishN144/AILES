	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns a 74-year-old man (&#8220;EM&#8221;) who was unfortunately diagnosed with malignant melanoma in October 2021 and brain metastases in April 2022. By an application dated 1 July 2022, NHS Coventry and Warwickshire Integrated Care Board (&#8220;the ICB&#8221;) applied for an order to remove EM from his home to an acute hospital setting (University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire) because of serious concerns about the safety of his environment and his refusal of care. Those concerns were initially raised by Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust (&#8220;the Trust&#8221;), which has also participated in this application.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At an urgent out of hours hearing on 1 July 2022 before Keehan J, it was declared on an interim basis that there was reason to believe that EM lacks capacity to conduct these proceedings and make decisions about his medical treatment, care and residence. It was also ordered on an interim basis that it was in EM&#8217;s best interests: (i) to be taken from his house to University Hospital, Coventry and Warwickshire; (ii) for force to be used to gain access to his house if necessary; (iii) to stay at the hospital until further order of this court and to be prevented from leaving or self-discharging from hospital should he seek to do so; and (iv) to receive care there according to the clinical judgment of staff. EM was not represented, nor did he participate by any other means, at that hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A return date was listed for 7 July 2022. At that hearing, I was asked to make an order declaring that it was in EM&#8217;s best interests to be further moved, this time to a nursing home, on the basis that EM was fit for discharge and a nursing home would be preferable to remaining in a ward in an acute hospital. While I granted that order, I required some convincing to do so in circumstances where I was being asked to order a second move for EM in the space of a week, again without any representation of EM. There was no &#8220;participation&#8221; by EM in these highly intrusive proceedings. No direction to that end had been made under r1.2(2) of the Court of Protection Rules 2017 (&#8220;COPR&#8221;). There was the following written evidence about his wishes and feelings viz:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the hearing, I indicated to Mr Lawson that I was minded to give a short judgment on the minimum degree of participation that must be afforded to an individual such as EM on an application which asks the court to authorise his deprivation of liberty. Obviously, such an application is extremely serious and directly engages Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (&#8220;ECHR&#8221;). I also observed, as regards the transparency order made by Keehan J, that there may be an issue to be grappled with as to whether such an order is technically sound.</p>

The fullest right to participation in proceedings is that which is enjoyed by the parties, but the streamlined procedure envisaged by the President contemplates that there will be cases in which a person lacking capacity will not be made a party because someone considers that it is unnecessary for that step to be taken. I agree with Black L.J. for the reasons she gives that a procedure under which such a person need not be made a party in order to ensure that the proceedings are properly to constituted (even though he may be joined as a party at his request) is not consistent with fundamental principles of domestic law and does not provide the degree of protection required by the Convention and the Strasbourg jurisprudence.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Throughout these judgments, rules and practice directions runs a golden thread pronouncing that the parties and the court must ensure that the participation of P is given careful consideration and promoted as far as possible. While the exigencies of a given situation may dictate the making of interim orders in the absence of representation for P, this power is to be exercised with especial caution. The court must review the &#8220;completeness&#8221; of the information transmitted to it with &#8220;a healthy scepticism&#8221;, since such information will be provided by those seeking authorisation for P&#8217;s deprivation of liberty, and therefore comes with the risk of confirmatory bias.</p>

The existence of a power to appoint an informal representative (r.1.2(2)(c)), or to allow P to address the court ( r.1.2(2)(d)), or to do nothing because P&#8217;s interests and position are &#8216;properly secured&#8217; (r.1.2(2)(e)), does not signify in the slightest that such measures would be appropriate where a court is considering the extremely serious step of depriving P of his liberty. Such powers  may be, and probably will be, appropriate where a lesser measure (such as how money is to be spent) is the subject matter of the application. But there is nothing in that rule, or in the practice direction, that suggests that anything short of party status (or appointment of an accredited legal representative) can be considered in a deprivation of liberty application. The case law establishes the standards where Article 5 is in play and nothing in the rules attenuates  those standards. </p>

She provided a witness statement dated 1 July 2022 and gave some oral evidence. I am informed, though this is not apparent from the face of the resulting order, that the hearing was also attended by a nurse and by his general practitioner, and that  two of EM&#8217;s children attended and spoke about his wishes and feelings.  Having read the witness statement of the Palliative Care Registrar I can understand why the order was made. It set out the significant risks to EM were he to remain in his own home even for a short period of time. I consider, however, that while EM&#8217;s voice was heard in the sense that his wishes and feelings were conveyed to the court he was, as I have stated above, not facilitated to participate meaningfully in the process in the manner envisaged by r1.2 COPR. Moreover, how that deficiency might be remedied for future hearings was not addressed. Of course, I make no criticism of my colleague who was dealing with an emergency out-of-hours application over the telephone. I accept that the applicant did explain that the exigencies of the situation meant that the application had to be made ex parte and that EM&#8217;s representation could not be facilitated.

There is absolutely no reason for this, although for some mysterious reason, which I cannot work out, it has become standard practice. Not only is it very confusing to any reader but it dehumanises the participants. I cannot locate in the Court of Protection Rules a rule equivalent to FPR 2010 rule 29.10 which prohibits the inspection or copying of any document on the court file by a stranger to the proceedings. However by Court of Protection Rules 90 - 91 the general rule is that proceedings shall be heard in private. This means that the court file is, absent an order of the court, similarly closed to strangers. Proceedings in the Family Division and other family courts are equivalently designated as private business but all court documents bear the parties' actual names. So should court documents in proceedings in the Court of Protection. Of course, a judgment such as this, which is going to be published, will be anonymised, just as is the (usual) case with Family Division judgments.

But it would be a false inference to conclude that that judgment tacitly said that all court documents should be anonymised also.
