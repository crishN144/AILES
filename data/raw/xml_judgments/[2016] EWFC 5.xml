Both of those judgments were concerned with the difficulties the applicant father was having in obtaining public funding. Those difficulties were finally resolved on 27 July 2015, a little under a year after my second judgment, when the Legal Aid Agency granted the father&#8217;s application for exceptional funding, accepting eventually that funding was required to avoid a breach of his Convention rights. This judgment follows the substantive hearing of the proceedings in October / November 2015.</p>

In February 2009 the father was arrested for sexual activity with a child &#8211; the victim was his own 12 year old nephew &#8211; contrary to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/9/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9(1)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sexual Offences Act 2003</ref>. Almost immediately the parties separated. The father has had no contact with M since then. In June 2009 the father pleaded guilty at the Crown Court, admitting that he had pulled his nephew&#8217;s trousers down and masturbated over him until he (the father) ejaculated. In August 2009 he was sentenced to a community order for three years with supervision. He had been in custody throughout since his arrest the previous February. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother petitioned for divorce in June 2010. The following month, the father applied for a contact order and an order for disclosure of M&#8217;s whereabouts. In January 2011, a District Judge directed that the father could obtain a report from RWA Child Protection Services to assess the risk he might pose to his son. A few days later the mother applied for a residence order. The RWA report was prepared by Dennis Smith and is dated 28 March 2011. On 23 June 2011 the Cafcass officer, IK, reported. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 2011, the District Judge granted the parties permission to obtain a report from Jo Duncombe of RWA Child Protection Services, who was to advise on &#8220;the risks inherent to [either indirect or direct] contact and the matters which the court will have to determine if it is to take place.&#8221; She met the mother but not the father. Her report is dated 3 February 2012. Shortly afterwards, another District Judge determined that a fact finding hearing in respect of the mother&#8217;s allegations against the father of violence or abuse was <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>necessary. The final hearing was listed for October 2012.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Early in August 2012 the father&#8217;s community rehabilitation order expired.

The final hearing was vacated. In October 2012 the father pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 24 weeks imprisonment, later reduced on appeal to 12 weeks. It is interesting to note that in a statement filed in these proceedings dated 28 September 2012, the father had indicated that he was pleading &#8216;not guilty&#8217;.</p>

In March 2013 a Deputy District Judge gave directions for a final hearing in October 2013. That hearing had to be vacated because of delays resulting from the suspension between April and August 2013 of the father&#8217;s public funding. The Circuit Judge gave directions adjourning the final hearing until March 2014. Mr Smith&#8217;s addendum report is dated 15 January 2014; Ms Duncombe&#8217;s addendum report is dated 27 January 2014. The final hearing had to be adjourned again by the Circuit Judge, this time until May 2014, following the decision (upheld by the independent adjudicator) to withdraw the father&#8217;s public funding. On 1 May 2014 the Circuit Judge transferred the case for hearing by me. It came before me on 21 May 2014: <span style="font-style:italic">Q v Q (Funding of Representation and Expert Attendance) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2014/7" uk:canonical="[2014] EWFC 7" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWFC 7</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 FLR 318" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 FLR 318</ref>.

On 23 February 2015 I made an order re-fixing the final hearing for 10 August 2015. On 14 July 2015 I had to vacate that hearing because the issue of the father&#8217;s public funding was still not resolved. The hearing was re-listed for 28 October 2015 with a time estimate of three days. As I have already mentioned, on 27 July 2015 the Legal Aid Agency granted public funding. At a final directions hearing on 9 October 2015, the father, by now represented by both solicitors and counsel, confirmed that he did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>wish to cross-examine either Mr Smith or Ms Duncombe. I reduced the time estimate for the hearing to two days, starting on 29 October 2015.</p>

Through PSR stage arid initial interviews has suggested he masturbates frequently and was sexually frustrated around the time of the index offence. His claims he was &#8220;just very horny&#8221; on night of index offence are worrying, and statements that he had no sexual attraction to the victim, leading to the suggestion that he was just overcome and &#8216;had&#8217; to masturbate even in the presence, of the victim. This is indicative of risk to future possible victims and is not currently showing a willingness to explore the reasons for the offence.</p>

Therefore, [he] would need to locate a private agency that would be willing to offer such a service. Again there may be restrictions due to his status as a convicted child abuser.

Likewise, as she points out, we are completely dependent upon the mother&#8217;s account of the likely impact on her and her family were there to be contact. What is clear, she says, and this, she submits, may expose M to future emotional harm, is that the mother has given M only very limited information about his father and not all of it, she suggests, entirely truthful. Without an order for contact of some kind, M, she says, will complete his childhood and experience adolescence without any sense of paternal identity. There are therefore, she submits, good grounds for ordering some indirect contact &#8211; cards and presents &#8211; as suggested by the father, whatever the mother&#8217;s reaction to them may be. She suggests that the local authority &#8211; which has some residual involvement with the mother &#8211; can act as the intermediary.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s evidence unsurprisingly places much weight on the views of Mr Smith and Ms Duncombe. She is fearful of the father, both for M and on her own account, not least because of the potential for contact to lead to the father&#8217;s discovering where they live. &#8220;I do not trust [him]. I believe that he will do everything in his power to gain access to his son and he will encourage family members to assist him &#8230; I am in terrible fear that [he] will persist in his determination to cause trouble for me and to see his son and will not stop to consider anyone else but himself.&#8221; For that and other reasons she would oppose the use as intermediaries of any of the father&#8217;s family or friends. She says that, because of the risk the father poses to M, any form of contact, even if supervised or monitored, would have to be subject to close involvement by a trained professional with specialist knowledge of the potential for &#8216;grooming&#8217;. Her fears are only increased, she says, because of M&#8217;s recent diagnosis of autism which, she believes, will make him particularly vulnerable to the risks posed by the father. She is candid in admitting that, given what has happened in the past, she would find even indirect contact very difficult to cope with. &#8220;How can I trust [him] when he said he would not commit a further offence and then he did. I can never trust him or forget that he has ruined my nephew&#8217;s life.&#8221; On the other hand she recognises, as was emphasised in her oral evidence, that M knows nothing of his father, beyond what little he may remember, and apart from having asked why his father does not live with them &#8211; &#8216; because he fights with us&#8217; &#8211; does not ask about him and, she says, has not expressed any wish to see him. She knows that, as he grows older, M will become more curious, but said that she would not tell him anything about what had happened.</p>

She repeated her objections to and the reasons why she opposed any form of contact. The fact is, to adopt Ms Potter&#8217;s words, that the mother has strongly negative feelings about the father, reflecting a visceral revulsion about what he did. Who can blame her for that?</p>

Given that there has been no effective challenge to their evidence or their conclusions, their reports, she says, represent an indisputable basis upon which the court can, indeed must, rely. In the light of their expert opinions, and having regard to the totality of the evidence, both expert and lay, the only order that meets M&#8217;s needs is, she submits, one which precludes any form of contact.   </p>

They were recently and conveniently summarised in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Q (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/991" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 991" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 991</ref>, paras 19-20. Plainly the order the mother seeks is most<span style="font-style:italic"/>unusual; indeed, it lies at the very extremities of the court&#8217;s powers. Almost always there should be some contact between child and parent. It will only be in a rare and exceptional case that the court will agree that there should be none. This, in my judgment, is such a case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I accept the expert evidence of Ms Duncombe and Mr Smith. Specifically, I accept the expert evidence of Ms Duncombe (see paragraphs 21, 26-27 above) and Mr Smith (paragraph 24) as to the risks involved in either direct or indirect contact and as to the kind of professionally-assisted steps that would require to be taken to manage those risks. It is, in my judgment, wholly unrealistic to expect the mother to supervise contact &#8211; she would not be able to cope and in any event she lacks the necessary skills to do so &#8211; just as it would be wholly inappropriate for that task to be undertaken by any of the father&#8217;s family or friends. In my judgment, any form of contact, direct or indirect, will require &#8211; now and well into the future &#8211; to be supervised or monitored by appropriately skilled professionals, alert to the kind of dangers that a convicted sex offender like the father may pose even to his own son.</p>

Apart from a passing reference to the local authority, which has no current <span style="font-style:italic">locus</span> in the proceedings, neither the father nor Ms Potter has been able to identify any practical and safe mechanism by which indirect contact could be facilitated or, more generally, any appropriate form of professional input that might be available to facilitate and monitor contact, whether indirect or direct. Indeed, that has been the reality throughout these proceedings. So far as concerns the local authority, I have little information about its current role, but there is nothing in anything I have read or heard to suggest a willingness on its part to embark upon any ongoing role in relation to even indirect contact. Indeed, it appears that whatever residual role it is currently playing is unlikely to extend much beyond the handing down of judgment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to the mother&#8217;s application for a prohibited steps order. Ms Sprinz has no complaint as to the ambit or language of the undertakings which the father gave on 9 October 2015. Her point is simply that the mother will be better protected, she says, if the undertakings are replaced by injunctions. Counsel are agreed that there is no power to attach a power of arrest to an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, so the arguments have focused on two points: first, that the police may, it is suggested, be quicker and more willing to act if shown an order containing injunctions rather than an order containing undertakings; secondly, that it may be easier to obtain a &#8216;port alert&#8217; if there is an injunction. Neither proposition, in my judgment, is convincing. I have helpfully been taken to paras 4.3 and 4.7(f)(ii) of FPR PD12F. Neither suggests the need for an injunctive order; quite the contrary.</p>
