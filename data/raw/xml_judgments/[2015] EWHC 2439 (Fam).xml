The case concerns two little boys, X who was born on the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2010 and is rising five, and Y who was born on the 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2012 and is two years and 7 months old who are the subjects of care proceedings brought by West Sussex County Council (the local authority). The proceedings were initiated after Y was taken to hospital by ambulance in the middle of the night on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015; he was unconscious required immediate surgery to relieve the life-threatening head injury seen on the CT scan taken shortly after he arrived at hospital. </p>

The long term effects of his injury are not known and his health will continue to be monitored.</p>

His brother X and their older cousin were asleep on a sofa in the living room of the house. The conclusion of the experts in this case is that the cause of the injury was am impact to the head and that in the absence of a plausible explanation it is most likely that the injury was inflicted. It is the local authority&#8217;s case that all of the evidence taken together supports a finding that Y was injured by a single impact to his head on the night of the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015 and that the injury was caused by either Y&#8217;s mother (M) or W or both. Both M and Y deny causing any injury to Y. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These care proceedings were issued by the local authority in the Family Court at Sussex &#8211; Brighton on the 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015. This judgment will not set out a full chronology of these proceedings and the case management hearings, however there were difficulties in ensuring that M had the support she needed in court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case was before me for case management on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2015 and following the orders made on that day it was listed to be heard in July 2015. In addition to the complexity of the medical evidence there were concerns about the ability of M to fully participate in, and understand the proceedings because of a report by Dr Nigel North (a psychologist) dated the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2015 which recommended the use of an intermediary. The solicitors for M had applied for public funding for an intermediary assessment which was refused by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA). There followed attempts by the solicitors to appeal against this decision which were unsuccessful.  By the time the solicitors approached the court for approval for funding an intermediary without a further assessment to support M during the trial in July there were none available to come to court.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given her history, which was never in dispute, it is not clear to me why it was considered necessary to have a further assessment by qualified intermediary except that Dr North is not an intermediary himself; the stance of the LAA did not assist when coupled with the insistence by Communicourt that they carry out an assessment separately from supporting Y at court. This led to the refusal of funding for that initial assessment. There is undoubtedly a pressing need for clear guidance and rules similar to those in criminal proceedings when it comes to the treatment of vulnerable witnesses. It is to be hoped that the proposed addition to the Family Procedure rules will come in to force sooner rather than later.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the first day of the fact finding trial I heard a ground rules hearing to decide how the case could progress without the assistance of an intermediary taking into account the recommendations which had been made by Dr North. It was agreed that the trial could go ahead with frequent breaks to allow M to have time to consider the evidence broken up into shorter more manageable sections. There were to be breaks every 30 minutes or more often if needed. M&#8217;s evidence was to be similarly divided; she was to be asked short questions and cross-examined by one counsel only, who would agree the area of questioning with other counsel. Counsel for the local authority undertook this task with the assistance of the guidance provide by the ATC in their toolkit for family proceedings. As there were seven files of evidence the documents that M was to be referred to during her evidence were placed in one file; in addition it was agreed that she would be supported by someone she knew from her solicitor&#8217;s firm to find pages or if she needed any other assistance. </p>

She was able to offer M additional support throughout the hearing.</p>

Appropriately the local authority remind me that the court should not place special status on the expert evidence and I am asked to consider all of the evidence and whether an overview of that evidence leads to the conclusion that the case put on behalf of the local authority has been made out to the requisite standard of proof.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court had ordered a report from Dr Andrew Will a consultant in Paediatric Haematology but as his evidence was not challenged the court did not hear from Dr Will. He, as did all the experts instructed, looked very carefully at the differential explanations for Y&#8217;s brain injury. He concludes that was no defect in Y&#8217;s blood or coagulation system and no genetic or medical cause that explained his presentation at hospital. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case is one in which the principal findings of facts in dispute and which the court is being asked to decide are cause of the brain injury and the identity of the perpetrator of that injury to Y. The parties have agreed that there are only 2 possible perpetrators despite the presence of another adult in the house on the night of the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February.  The medical evidence is unanimous in concluding that the mechanism or cause of the brain injury was an impact to Y&#8217;s head, which, in the absence of any other explanation, is most likely to have been inflicted. The medical opinion on the part of the treating clinicians was that there may have been an earlier injury some days before, followed by a further impact on the 14/15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February. The experts instructed in these proceedings have broadly concluded that there is more likely to have been one impact shortly before the child was taken to hospital. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I shall return to the medical evidence in detail below. The medical evidence and opinion is only one part of the evidence; the reports of Y&#8217;s presentation in the days leading up to the hospital admission are crucial and form part of the whole. There is no challenge to description of the injuries found on CT scan, however there has been some disagreement over the significance of the findings and what they may or may not mean in respect of the cause of the injuries. The law which forms the framework of my decision, which is not in dispute, is summarised below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The burden of proof lies with the Local Authority.&#160; It is the Local Authority that brings the case and they have identified the findings they invite the court to make.&#160; The burden of proving the allegations rests with them. Much of what they seek to prove, namely that the injuries to the brain and consequent brain damage the possible long term compromise to Y&#8217;s development is not challenged. Nor is the causal mechanism challenged in that it is accepted that it was caused by an impact; there has been no medical, metabolic or haematological cause for the brain injuries identified. The pool of perpetrators is agreed to be M and the intervener, W. Where there is a factual dispute it remains for the local authority to discharge their burden of proof. </p>

Although both M and S have made cross allegations and sought injunctive relief against each other in the private law proceedings the records raise greater concerns about the behaviour of S than they do of M. It was the view of her mother L that M was at risk of domestic violence from S as she is recorded as phoning to police to say so in August 2014. In the proceedings the issue of paternity was raised and DNA tests directed by the court. The court also directed drug and alcohol testing of both parents; given the history of S this is unsurprising but there is nothing whatsoever to indicate that such testing of M was necessary or proportionate.

M told me in her oral evidence that while she found the sessions of some help what she had really been hoping for was support and work with Y himself.  It was said that the staff at the centre were concerned that M had not taken on any of the learning from the parenting course and there were concerns about her cognitive ability to understand the course; that is likely to be the case and as M&#8217;s difficulties were known it is to be wondered why she was told to participate in a course that was not tailored to parents with learning difficulties. M is not to be criticised for any perceived &#8220;failure&#8221; on her part.

W has a part-time job and goes to the gym very regularly; he is a devotee of Mixed Marshall Arts, a combination of kick-boxing and karate.

In particular if there were two incidents when he was struck on the head and injured in the ten days preceding his admission to hospital. I shall set out the medical evidence below but the presentation of the child itself forms an important part of any opinion of the experts and ultimately I can only decide on the basis of all the evidence as taken as a whole. I have taken the descriptions of how Y was from the evidence of M, W, L and G all of who spent time with him in the days preceding his collapse.</p>

She was pushing X on a swing (they were at a playground near M&#8217;s home). M saw Y near the swing and then on the ground crying. M comforted Y and checked his head; he was wearing a woolly hat. She believed that he may have been hit by the swing or by X&#8217;s shod foot. No-one was aware of or directly saw Y being hit by X&#8217;s shoe or the swing. M said that he ran into the swing when X was being pushed in it. Although Y cried quite hard, M said that he cried for longer than usual, there was no mark or bump on his head and they went home for a roast dinner. Y ate his dinner and seemed fine.

He could no longer do this but the band was to play something especially for him. G had agreed to babysit. X and his older boy cousin like to sleep downstairs on the sofa together; partly because the cousin is disturbed by Y at night. G is well used to caring for the two little boys who are fond of him and like it when he and their cousins are there. G arrived at about half past six. Before he arrived M went to get ready for the evening out and W made the boys their tea. In his statement he says that M had put their tea on to cook, but in his oral evidence he said that he did. M says that when she was upstairs in the bath she heard Y crying and trying to get to her. In his oral evidence W said that he did not remember Y trying to get to M upstairs before.

M asked that I watch a very short clip of video that her niece took of W holding Y and swinging him while M was upstairs. In evidence he said that he would have done if she had been in the room. It is a very short clip and is capable of more than one interpretation as is clear in the written submissions of counsel for both M and W.  I very much doubt that M would have allowed the play to continue and as W is, by his own admission aware, that M thought that some boisterous play was too rough it is very unlikely that he would have played Y in the way he did if she had, indeed, been in the same room. It would be wrong to read too much into this snippet of video and I do not.</p>

He had had a text from his friend J at 23:34 but did not see it until later. It is now obvious, and W accepted in his oral evidence that what he told the police was wrong,  that they all left the venue at around 23:30 as a taxi had been arranged for M&#8217;s grandfather (to take a wheel chair) at that time and it had just left with M in it. There had been talk of M going into town with W but she changed her mind and went home with her grandfather because he wanted her to come with him. W then made his way and he too changed his mind and went to M&#8217;s home. He told the court that he went to Tesco&#8217;s to get something to eat and called a cab from their free-phone. He says that he got to her house at about 00:30 and she arrived 15 minutes later. M says that she arrived home at about 00:54 as she texted her sister at that time as soon as she got home. The timings have significance because of the time that W would have been alone with the children in the house. If it is over half an hour based on the evidence of M and G then W was there for longer than the 10 to 15 minutes he claims. When asked about what he did he was very vague and said that he watched the TV which was still on but cannot remember what was on; he thought he had only be waiting for 10 or 15 minutes before M came home.</p>

During surgery it was identified that one side of brain showed signs of oxygen starvation similar to a stroke. No evidence of trauma or skull fracture was seen during surgery. There was no bruising seen on his scalp or head. His eyes were examined at Southampton General Hospital twice on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015. The examinations showed retinal haemorrhages in Y&#8217;s right eye; Multiple and unilateral multilayer haemorrhages in the right eye involving more than one layer of the retina, including ocular nerve fibre or &#8216;&#8221;flame&#8221; haemorrhages; so called because of their appearance. </p>

The low density material was under the dura while the high density material was closely applied to the brain. The low density fluid was yellow in colour and could either be chronic subdural blood or an acute effusion of production of fluid. This xanthochromic fluid has been the subject of discussion and some disagreement between two of the experts Dr Cartlidge and Mr Jayamohan; Dr Cartlidge was most keen to emphasise that yellowing was an indication that the blood had broken down well before the evening of the 14/15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of February 2015. Along with the reference to a trance like state he was very concerned to point out that there could have been two impacts with the second precipitating the injury leading to the need for surgical intervention.   I keep in mind the fact that both agree that that history of Y&#8217;s presentation in the preceding week or ten days is a key element of any decision that the court may reach.</p>

As I said above it is the case that Dr Cartlidge, the consultant paediatrician who gave his opinion to the court was concerned that the there had been more than one impact, however he is not a neurosurgeon used to looking at and interpreting the collections of blood and fluid seen in the brain as the result of trauma accidental or other wise. Mr Jayaratnam Jayamohan is a consultant paediatric neurosurgeon who reported to the court at some length and with considerable knowledge and care; he then had a telephone conference with Mr Chakraborty, the neurosurgeon who actually carried out the operation on Y. Mr Jayamohan then prepared an agreed note of their discussion and reported again to the court. </p>

This fits, in my opinion, much better than the idea that the majority of his collection was chronic, of the order of weeks old. The reason for this is if this is the case, the mass effect would also have been present for weeks. I find it highly unlikely that a child who would have had such significant mass effect for several weeks was apparently remaining reasonably well, active and behaving normally according to his mother&#8217;s statement&#8230;if the majority of this mass effect was present, I would expect the child to be at least drowsy, vomiting and off feed, with a decreased response and in activity and probably with a decreased conscious level or in a coma. The contribution of the acute blood on the scan is relatively minor and by itself would not be responsible for all of the mass effect and midline shift, as seen by the measurements in my interpretation. Therefore I think that unless there is confirmed evidence that this child had altered neurological status for days beforehand, I believe that it is more likely that all the changes on the imaging are acute and not chronic.&#8221;</span></p>

In oral his evidence Mr Jayamohan did not change his opinion and told me that Y&#8217;s CT scan had shown a collection in the subdural space on the right side at the front and side measuring a maximum of 1.4 cm in depth;  there were two components to it closer to the brain was high density material which represents fresh blood less than 10 days old and further out was low density material in keeping with older blood or an effusion and it is not always possible to distinguish between the two on scans.  There were clear signs of significant pressure on the brain and there was evidence of a slight lack of oxygen in the right hemisphere.  The midline struts were seen to be pushed across to the left and the shift was approximately the same as the maximum thickness of the subdural haemorrhage, that is to say 1.4cm.  There were worrying signs of pressure on the important structures of the brain, associated with brain dysfunction.  There was no evidence of skull fracture.</p>

They discussed the issue of xanthochromic fluid; the problem was that the fluid had been analysed and compared to subarachnoid cerebro-spinal fluid which is usually taken after trauma in adults and as a result there was a large data base of such fluid.  There were completely different conditions to this case, where the fluid was both in a different location and was a different fluid.  Bilirubin can be found in sub-arachnoid blood within 12 hours, but Mr J could not say the same for subdural haemorrhages such as was seen in Y. He and Mr Chakraborty agreed that clinical signs which they would have expected to see on examination had the collection been chronic (or older) were absent; there was no swelling of the optic discs, the brain would not have been so lacking in pulsatility and membranes would have been seen in the subdural space if there was an established haematoma. </p>

He had been struck by the amount of pressure on the brain, the clear signs of herniation and the clinical condition of the child. He referred to the fixed dilated pupil; the child would be drowsy, vomiting, complaining of headaches, but the most likely scenario was that the child would be unconscious, with abnormal limb posture, abnormal pupil findings, and breathing problems both in the pattern and rate of his breathing.  He would not expect the child to be eating. Mr Jayamohan did not consider that Y had this injury when he was seen interacting, playing, feeding and being alert.  </p>

He also considered that it unlikely that it had for built up over time. There would have been a deteriorating child who may have been not as sick but still obviously unwell to any carer interacting with him,  with such significant symptoms for if the child had not lost consciousness, he would have been distressed and clearly upset. If the event had occurred close to his neurological deterioration, Y may not have had a window of time in which to be upset. Mr Jayamohan said it was his view that would be unusual for Y to have reached the stage of breathing difficulties and decorticate posturing five minutes after being carried upstairs apparently normally by W but accepted it could have been as much as15 minutes later.</p>

He said that such an occurrence was rare and is associated with a period in which the child is unwell but not as unwell as they eventually become. The time gaps can be up to a couple of days but that the longer ones tend to be associated with direct brain injury when the trauma and tearing to the brain leads to delayed swelling, and not to subdural haemorrhages.  In this case, which would have involved a lucid interval of 6 &#189; days seemed a long time and radiologically the findings were right.  Moreover the history, albeit there was the vomiting over the night of the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and that Y he was clingy was essentially of normal behaviour during these days.

Having measured the collection (of blood and fluid) and the midline shift by which the brain had been pushed across by the same distance as the collection, if it was being said that some of the collection had been there for several days there would have had to have been pressure on the brain for those days and the history given about Y&#8217;s presentation is not what would be expected with that pressure on his brain.</p>

The likely mechanism would have been a hard fall on a hard, unyielding surface or a much harder inflicted impact against a soft and unyielding surface such as a bed or sofa.  He could not exclude shaking as a possible mechanism but thought it is less likely than impact because of the unilateral nature of the injuries and the more developed neck structure in a child of Y&#8217;s age. There are many differences between the recognized second impact syndrome as described in the literature and Y&#8217;s presentation so that it was an exceptionally unlikely scenario.

In the case of Y it had come about because of the bleeding and the shifting of his brain.  He said if there had been an impact head injury there would be damage to the retinal blood vessels and retinal haemorrhages consistent with rupturing and bleeding. He told the court that while there is reference in the textbooks to raised ICP causing retinal haemorrhages it is extremely rare, occurs in particular circumstances and if there is an acute rise in ICP.  It could be argued by experts that some retinal haemorrhages were made worse raised ICP but he was <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> saying that raised ICP had caused the retinal haemorrhages. He rejected as unrealistic any suggestion that the blot haemorrhages also seen in Y&#8217;s eye were older and the flame haemorrhages were caused by raised ICP.  The flame haemorrhages are not the type one would typically see from raised ICP; you get blot, dot or vitreous retinal haemorrhages from raised ICP.

With the unilateral retinal haemorrhages already there from the impact the threshold for further haemorrhages may have been modified. It was more likely that the retinal haemorrhages were caused by an impact than by a shake in his opinion because of the neurosurgical report, age of child, unilateral haemorrhage pattern which were all more consistent with a fall or impact.</p>

The radiological findings of a large amount of black fluid with a small amount of acute blood were unusual, as was Y&#8217;s age for such a head injury. Y would have had clinical symptoms as a result of this level of mass effect and the swelling of the brain. Dr Sprigg said that based on his interpretation of the radiology he would have expected a longer history rather than a sudden deterioration which was why he considered the possibility of an earlier incident having taken place, but that he understood that the other clinicians had excluded that as a possibility.

Dr Cartlidge believed that this undermined the hypothesis that there was an acute event that evening and he felt that he was struggling to explain the medical evidence in a single hypothesis, but he was not strongly in one camp or another. Dr Cartlidge did indeed appear to struggle to explain the medical evidence; this may be because he is a paediatrician and not a neurosurgeon with years of experience in explaining and interpreting the features seen during neurosurgery. </p>

I accept that Dr Cartlidge was uneasy with this fluid being only 6 hours old, but it seems that Dr Cartlidge was himself confusing between the old subdural blood in described by Mr Jayamohan as taking more than four weeks to turn yellow and an effusion or acute production of fluid and is produced within a matter of hours from the lining of the brain. While Dr Cartlidge said he deferred to Mr Jayamohan, he clearly remained unhappy about what the neurosurgeon&#8217;s opinion about the fluid. Dr Cartlidge should have deferred to Mr Jayamohan on matters of neurosurgical interpretation and I prefer the evidence of Dr Jayamohan on this interpretation; not only as it is his area of expertise and experience but because it fits with the description of Y&#8217;s presentation as set out above. </p>

He said that Y had become unwell for reasons different to most cases involving babies and that there could have been an acute or a slower event and something that tipped him over, but Dr Cartlidge did not identify what those events were from the evidence before the court and at time seemed to venture into speculation for he agreed that the level of interaction described in Y would be very unusual if he had been injured but then said that it was also unusual for these clinical findings in a child of two.

The fact that he recovered from the vomiting episode was consistent with it being a virus. This evidence, he said tends to suggest against a significant event before he vomited on the balance of probabilities. If there was acute event Y would have been very distressed unless rendered unconscious.  Dr Cartlidge said that to become decorticate would take minutes at least and probably even hours; anyone present would know that Y had been seriously harmed.

There is no explanation offered by either M or W as to how Y sustained such an injury. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When I consider carefully the evidence of both M and W the following factors come to bear, their evidence and the gaps in that evidence. I find the evidence of W most troubling. There are numerous gaps and inconsistencies in his evidence which started with his telling the police that he had left the party venue half an hour later than he in fact done. He then attempted to explain that he would still have arrived later than G said he did giving a long account of his journey to M&#8217;s home which he had not given the police; they had assumed it was &#8220;gone twelve&#8221; by the time he got to Tesco&#8217;s. The explanation for his evidence is more likely than not to reduce the time at which he was alone with the children, Y included. He was then inconsistent in evidence about when events took place in M&#8217;s home; even allowing for the difficulty anyone has in remembering events the fact that he continued to contradict himself in his oral evidence about when M came upstairs, for instance, gives rise for concern about the reliability of his evidence.</p>

It was his evidence that his while his mother often left him in charge it was usually for a short time when she went to the shops or run an errand. He helps out at home and although he is more used to young children than many young adults his experience is limited to assisting his mother</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were troubling gaps and  inconsistencies in W&#8217;s evidence and that of M about what had happened when he was giving the children their tea. W said that Y had never tried to get to his mother upstairs like that before; M says that Y was crying and that W said he would not eat his tea; W denies this and says he was not aware of M feeding Y and getting him to eat a fish finger. There is something missing from this narrative which W must have known, why was Y crying and why did he want to get to his mother in a way he had not done before. I do not accept that W was unaware that M had come down stairs and fed Y, at the very least she must have gone into the kitchen where he was to get the food.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is a gap in W&#8217;s evidence about what happened between G leaving at ten past twelve and M arriving home half an hour later. By itself that may not have been of concern but when coupled with what is most likely to be an attempt to mislead the police about the timing both of his movements and the time he was alone in M&#8217;s home there is a striking lack of any evidence or explanation for what went on at this time. There is some evidence before the court that W did not approve of M&#8217;s indulgence of her children and that she had been concerned that he had handled the children in a rough way, particularly Y who was only two. I accept the evidence of M that she had remonstrated with W when he had been playing boisterously with Y and that he stopped what he was doing. Although none of this comes close to evidence that he hurt or mistreated the children there is a disconnect which when coupled with his lack of candour and explanation for what happened during the half hour or more that he was alone with the children leads me to question his reliability and credibility as a witness. For this reason, something that led to Y&#8217;s collapse had  to have happened but it is W&#8217;s evidence that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I do not think that M could have hurt him&#8230;nothing happened;  I don&#8217;t know what happened.&#8221;</span></p>

W said to the police that when he carried Y up to bed he was still snoring but in his oral evidence he said that Y was not snoring. He said Y was not stiff when he carried him upstairs. Later after his mother found him very ill in bed he said that he did not notice that Y was stiff, although he must have heard M say that on the phone to the ambulance service. In answer to questions put on behalf of Y, W said that it was obvious to him that there was a lot wrong with Y&#8217;s breathing and that he was breathing funny, but despite holding the child in his arms he said that he could not remember and did not know if Y appeared to be lifeless. </p>

She told me that her children came first but that no-one likes to think someone could hurt their child. She tried her hardest to answer every question that was put to her. There is no evidence that she has, in the past, withheld  information or evidence. The evidence is that she was pursuing an answer and begging W for any information that he had; W on the other had was not forthcoming and has remained so. There is no evidence to suggest that M is capable of manufacturing a situation where she continually searches for an answer in order to cover up something that she is to blame for herself. Such a prolonged facsimile of investigation would require a level of sophistication that she does not possess.  </p>

His injury was unusual and unexplained and must have be caused as his own counsel has said by one acute event on the night or early hours of the morning on the 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>/15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February. The event and injury are of themselves improbable but the evidence leads me to conclude that the child was subjected to an  impact to his head that night.

It is also a tautology: the true distinction is between an accident which is unexpected and unintentional and an injury which involves an element of wrong.  That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and / or intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction.  While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from, say, negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref>.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">[20] The court's function is to make the findings of fact that it is able on the evidence and then analyse those findings against the statutory formulation.  The gloss imported by the use of unexplained legal, clinical or colloquial terms is not helpful to that exercise nor is it necessary for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(2)</ref> to characterise the fact of what happened as negligence, recklessness or in any other way.  Just as non-accidental injury is a tautology, 'accidental injury' is an oxymoron that is unhelpful as a description.  If the term was used during the discussion after the judgment had been given as a description of one of the possibilities of how the harm had been caused, then it should not have been; it being a contradiction in terms.  If, as is often the case when a clinical expert describes harm as being a &#8216;non-accidental injury&#8217;, there is a range of factual possibilities, those possibilities should be explored with the expert and the witnesses so that the court can understand which, if any, described mechanism is compatible with the presentation of harm.   </span></p>

The judge is not limited to the way the case is put by the local authority but if options are not adequately explored a judge may find a vital piece of the jigsaw missing when s/he comes to look at all the evidence in the round.  </span></p>

Of the two adults present that night it is the evidence of W that has for the reasons set out above been both inconsistent and lacking in candour. The time that he was alone with Y while the two other children slept is not accounted for while M has accounted for the whole time that she was present. M&#8217;s conduct since that night has been congruent with a parent seeking an answer to what has happened to her child and has not been self-serving or defensive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the balance of probabilities I find that W is responsible for the child&#8217;s head injury by an action or actions that cannot be identified. I do not consider that there is evidence to support any suggestion that the impact was deliberately inflicted and consider it more likely that it was a reckless and foolish action taken by a young man who has no experience as a parent, primary or main carer of a child who is still very young.  I have considered all the evidence as set out above and conclude that although it is not possible to define the mechanism which caused the head injury to Y on the balance of probabilities the injuries were was caused by W.</p>
