	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">NR is a remarkable young boy. He was born with severe brain malformation and has suffered from significant medical challenges throughout his life. In October 2023, aged 3 and having already been treated as an in-patient for several months, he had two cardiac arrests requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (&#8220;CPR&#8221;) followed by mechanical ventilation and total parental nutrition (&#8220;TPN&#8221;) on a paediatric critical care unit to sustain his life. In April this year, after six months of such treatment and with clear evidence that there was no prospect of any recovery, I authorised the withdrawal of life sustaining invasive ventilation in the expectation, shared by all the medical witnesses who gave evidence, including an expert instructed by NR&#8217;s parents, that he would die shortly thereafter. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over four months after extubation, not only is NR still alive but he is now living at home. He is breathing for himself. He is fully enterally fed. He is urinating normally having previously had an indwelling urinary catheter. He has confounded all medical expectations and his case underlines the maxim that &#8220;medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.&#8221; (Sir William Osler, 1849-1919). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst NR&#8217;s survival and progress are an unexpected gift to his parents, they feel &#8220;completely traumatised by everything that has happened.&#8221; They have shown unconditional love and devotion to NR. They opposed the Trust&#8217;s application to withdraw invasive ventilation because they believed that it was wrong to take a step that would bring about the end of his life. They have deep religious faith and they felt that NR had a subjective experience of life that was valuable to him as well as to those who love him. They believe that their views about NR were vindicated and they continue to believe that the Trust does not truly value NR&#8217;s life. In the light of my decision in April 2024, Mr and Mrs R had to plan for their son&#8217;s death. They feel confused about the advice they were then given and how NR has managed to defy all medical expectations. They are grateful to the NHS but they have lost their trust in the First Respondent. They  now apply for the removal of the permitted ceilings of treatment which I authorised in January 2024. The Guardian supports that application. The Trust agrees to some changes to NR&#8217;s care plan but not the discharge of all the authorisations.</p>

The burdens both of NR's conditions and symptoms, and of the invasive treatments, are many and they are heavy. They include the insertion of the endotracheal tube and invasive ventilation, frequent suctioning, total parental nutrition, blood samples being taken, repeated sepsis and episodes of septic shock, osteopenia leading to a femoral fracture and vulnerability to further fractures, and seizures (albeit currently relatively well controlled). Even now that he is relatively stable, and has very limited awareness, he still sometimes becomes visibly distressed or in pain. NR cannot enjoy any of the pleasures of being a four year old child save for being able to be soothed when in distress by his parents. Previously he was able, subject to his severe disabilities, to live at home with his parents, to go out of the house, to smile when cuddled. Now his life is grossly diminished and full of burdens.&#8221;</p>

Although there were some differences in the degree of confidence with which prognoses were expressed, there was a consensus that after extubation, NR would be likely to die within a short time. Dr Nadel, the expert relied upon by NR&#8217;s parents, expressed this in terms of days to weeks, but he was the most optimistic. I have checked my notes of the oral evidence of Dr F who had provided an independent second opinion to the Trust. When asked how long NR would survive after extubation, he replied: &#8220;Probably hours, sometimes children survive for days.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The evidence before me is that it is unlikely that NR will reach the point where he could be successfully extubated without the need for re-intubation to sustain life. Dr F and Dr C concurred that caring for NR with non-invasive ventilation at home was not feasible. Dr Nadel has written that it is unlikely that NR could tolerate non-invasive ventilation for a prolonged period. Furthermore, NR is not a child who could be managed on TPN at home. Hence, the medical evidence is that there is no realistic prospect of NR being able to return home for care over weeks or months. If he remains in his current, relatively stable, state without intervening sepsis or other complications then the evidence of Dr D, supported by Dr C and Dr F, is that it would be feasible to transfer him home for the purpose of extubation at home, whereupon he would be expected to survive only for a few hours or at most for a few days. Otherwise, he will die in a critical care unit in hospital, on invasive ventilation, probably within the next six months. His underlying conditions are not going to improve with treatment.&#8221;</p>

It was a burdensome treatment without which, as is now known, he would survive for months at least and be able to live a better life. I decided that continuation of invasive ventilation was not justified even though I expected that NR would die shortly after such ventilation was withdrawn. As it has transpired, NR has been relieved of the burdens of invasive ventilation and has not only survived but has made progress and enjoyed relief from other interventions such as TPN and an indwelling catheter. If anything, extubation may have unlocked a number of beneficial consequences for him. </p>

NR&#8217;s survival and progress have shown that the withdrawal of invasive ventilation was indeed in his best interests. At the time, based on the prognoses provided to the Court, I decided that ventilation should cease despite, not because of, the strong expectation that NR would die soon afterwards. I do not wish to minimise the emotional turmoil suffered by Mr and Mrs R and the continuing burdens that NR suffers because of his conditions, but it seems to me to be a wonderful surprise that NR has confounded expectations, that he no longer requires continuing invasive interventions and, in  particular, that he has been able to return home to the loving care of his devoted parents.</p>

He was nevertheless transferred to a hospice, still on invasive ventilation and TPN. NR was extubated at the hospice on 8 May 2024. The palliative care team under Dr D gave full support. NR was able to breathe for himself. He required two courses of antibiotics when at the hospice for signs of a urinary infection but he was able to be transferred home, on enteral feeding (and no TPN), in early June 2024. </p>

Ceilings of treatment which might have been considered appropriate when NR was in a critical care unit, dependent on invasive ventilation, are not appropriate when he is living at home unventilated. Secondly, the parents&#8217; perception is that the overall effect of the declarations leads healthcare professionals not to treat NR as actively as they might otherwise. Thirdly, there are so many possible changes and challenges ahead for NR, and so many uncertainties, that it is not possible to craft workable declarations.

She submitted that nevertheless there is a benefit to NR from keeping the current declarations in place to protect his best interests. Ms Dolan KC called Dr J who gave oral evidence. His view was that in the absence of any declarations permitting, for example, CPR to be withheld from NR, clinicians, particularly more junior professionals who might not have an intimate knowledge of NR's case would be likely to feel bound to take every possible step in active treatment thereby risking acting contrary to his best interests. He accepted that given that there was agreement amongst all parties that it would not be in NR&#8217;s best interests to undergo ECMO or haemofiltration (Group 1 (iii) and (iv) of the January declaration of ceilings of treatment) there was no requirement for that declaration to remain in place. In those respects there was an understanding between parents and clinicians such that the Court&#8217;s continuing declarations were not required.  However, he did think that it would be helpful to clinicians for the Court expressly to permit the withholding of CPR, otherwise they would feel obliged to give it regardless of the consequences for NR. His view was, it seemed to me, strongly influenced by his own view that intensive care was contrary to NR&#8217;s best interests. Dr J&#8217;s view was that even knowing now that NR has been able to return home without ventilation or TPN, it would still have been in his best interests not to have been resuscitated in October 2023 because, to date, on balance he has suffered too many burdens. However, he accepted that if NR were to remain settled at home for another few months, that assessment might change.</p>

Ms Butler-Cole KC for the Guardian submitted that in a case such as this where NR&#8217;s circumstances are not fully predictable and where the Trust accepts that new medical evidence at the relevant time may mean that any declaration  granted is not in fact followed, the Court should exercise caution before making or continuing any declarations. Baroness Hale endorsed such caution in <span style="font-style:italic">Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation  Trust v James</span> [2013] UKSC 67. In <span style="font-style:italic">Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust v Wyatt</span> [2005] 1 WLR 3995, the Court of Appeal said:</p>

In the same way that this court said in R (Burke) v General Medical Council (Official Solicitor intervening) [2005] 3 WLR 1132 that it is not the function of the court to be used as a general advice centre (see para 21 of this court's judgment), it is, in our view, not the function of the court to oversee the treatment plan for a gravely ill child. That function is for the doctors in consultation with the child's parents. Judges take decisions on the basis of particular factual substrata. The court's function is to make a particular decision on a particular issue. </p>

But the circumstances have materially changed since the declarations made in January and April 2024. NR continues to suffer the burdens of his condition and of some of the treatment and interventions he has to undergo. However, the burdens of his treatment are significantly reduced compared with those he suffered prior to extubation. There is also evidence that he is now able to derive pleasure from his life at home with his parents. There is evidence that he sometimes smiles. Previously, when the initial declarations were made in January 2024, he was suffering many more burdens from invasive treatment, he showed signs of distress, there was little to no evidence that he could derive pleasure from life, other than the consoling touch of his parents, and there was thought to be virtually no prospect of him enjoying any improvements. He was trapped in a critical care unit. Now he can be taken outside, for example to the park. He can enjoy the sun on his face and the feel of the wind in his hair. He is living in a loving home environment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It remains unexplained how NR has managed to confound the expectations of all medical professionals who assessed him and treated him prior to his extubation on 8 May 2024. The opinions expressed to the Court that he would never be able to be cared for at home, would never be free from TPN, and would survive only a short time after extubation were, I accept, soundly based on the evidence available and the considerable experience of the witnesses giving those opinions. I have not seen anything to suggest that the opinions expressed were ill-founded, that relevant evidence was disregarded, or that investigations and clinical indicators were misinterpreted. It is simply the case that medicine is a &#8220;science of uncertainty&#8221;. Medical predictions are an &#8220;art of probability&#8221; and sometimes the unexpected happens. It does not diminish the value of opinion evidence including prognoses, that they are based on probabilities and that unexpected outcomes may occur, but that possibility must be accounted for when making best interest decisions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">NR has defied the odds, but having done so the Court must consider the current evidence and determine whether continued or varied declarations permitting ceilings of treatment or the withholding of CPR are in NR&#8217;s best interests.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The declaration regarding CPR made in April 2024 was linked to the decision to permit the withdrawal of invasive ventilation and the strong expectation that NR would die shortly after extubation. Had CPR been given after extubation NR would have required re-intubation. Thus, having found that continued invasive ventilation was not in NR&#8217;s best interests, it followed that neither was CPR. Now, however, NR has undergone extubation and can now breathe unassisted. Hence, a key justification for making the best interests declaration about CPR in April 2024 no longer applies.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The best interests decision to withdraw invasive ventilation was based on the evidence as to NR&#8217;s condition and prognosis at that time. In January and again in April 2024 the evidence before the Court was that NR was highly unlikely ever to cease requiring a series of invasive treatments including invasive ventilation and TPN. CPR would not therefore lead to any better outcome for him. The best that could be hoped for was that CPR would allow him to return to the same, parlous state, requiring the same interventions. The benefits of CPR were therefore very difficult to identify. The position now is different. It would be wrong to gloss over the many adverse features of NR&#8217;s underlying conditions as set out in the previous judgments, and the invasive treatments he still requires such as deep suctioning, but he is at home, not on TPN, without a catheter, and does not require ventilation. Whilst his underlying conditions have not changed, the need for invasive treatment has changed quite significantly. Whilst Dr J told the Court, and I accept, that following any administration of CPR in the future it is very likely NR would require invasive ventilation, it cannot be said that NR could not then ultimately recover to his present baseline state. He has done that once already. NR has recovered after his previous cardiac arrests in October 2023, CPR, and invasive ventilation to his current state which, Dr J suggested, might even be a better state than he was in prior to the cardiac arrests when, as will be recalled, he was an in-patient. Hence, the balance of benefits and burdens associated with a decision to administer CPR has changed significantly since April 2024.</p>

In January and April 2024 the evidence was clear that any CPR would have to be given when NR was an in-patient, already on invasive ventilation. Now, a decision might have to be made whether to give CPR tomorrow, in six months&#8217; time, or never. It might have to be made when he is in the community or in hospital. His state at the time of requiring any CPR cannot be predicted with any certainty. The prognosis for him at the time of any such decision will depend on a number of factors which cannot be known to the Court now. In the circumstances, the Court cannot provide a detailed decision-making flow chart for clinicians to follow when deciding whether to administer CPR, because there are too many variables. In January and April 2024 there were many fewer variables and a clear declaration could be made with much more confidence as to the circumstances in which it would apply.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Dr J expressed concern that if CPR were given in the future, then NR might find himself back on long term invasive ventilation on a PICU or critical care unit. That is a possibility but, without wishing to sound glib, decision making by clinicians and parents about continuing such life sustaining treatment would have to be made at that time in full knowledge of the circumstances and evidence at that time. Ultimately, the Court would stand ready to make determinations about the withdrawal of treatment if required to do so but it would proceed on the basis of the known factors and prognoses available at that time. It is quite a different matter to make an advance decision without knowing the circumstances in which NR may find himself and to declare it lawful not to give CPR.</p>

It has proposed including clarification that any declarations by the Court &#8220;do not prevent any doctor or healthcare professional from providing CPR or inotropes to NR if in the view of the attending clinicians at the material time [it] would be reasonable to do so.&#8221; It seems to me that if there may be circumstances in which a clinician could consider it to be in NR&#8217;s best interests to administer CPR &#8211; and therefore reasonable to do so - then it would be inappropriate for the court now to permit the withholding of CPR without identifying those circumstances in which it might be against his best interests to withhold it. Yet, as a matter of practicality, I cannot identify those circumstances in advance because there are too many uncertainties and variables.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">The Trust suggests that discharging the extant declarations, or at least those made in January 2024, leaving no declarations in place, will be likely to lead to uncertainty on the part of clinicians and, as Dr J suggested in his evidence, a tendency by clinicians to over-treat for fear of legal repercussions if they were to withhold treatment. The Trust&#8217;s concern is that the very fact that the Court has discharged the declarations may signal that all possible care ought to be given. I believe this to overstate the case. Many clinicians making decisions about NR&#8217;s care in the future will not have read all three judgments in this case or be aware of the changes in declarations. Those who have done so will know that by discharging the declarations the Court is not directing clinicians to give all active care whatever their view of NR&#8217;s best interests. I acknowledge the difficult decisions that clinicians have to make in relation to seriously ill children, and the particular difficulties when relations with the parents of those children have become strained or there are wide differences in core beliefs between parents and clinicians. However, as the Court of Appeal said in <span style="font-style:italic">Wyatt </span>(above) relying on <span style="font-style:italic">R(Burke) v GMC</span> [2005] 3 WLR 1132, &#8220;it is not the function of the court to be used as a general advice centre.&#8221; In my judgement, declarations about ceilings of treatment should only be made when they protect or enhance a child&#8217;s best interests. They should be worded so as to provide clarity for clinicians but that is not their purpose.</p>

Whilst the January 2024 declarations may be permissive rather than directive, they set a tone, say the parents, which should no longer apply given the progress he has made. Dr J&#8217;s evidence rather underlined that parental concern as does the fact that Dr H felt it necessary to add a note in clarification within NR&#8217;s records (see paragraph 20 above).</p>
