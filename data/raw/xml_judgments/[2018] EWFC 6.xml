On that day I made an order in which I recorded that I treated the mother&#8217;s email as an application under FPR 27.5 for a set-aside in circumstances where she had not attended the hearing before me. I ordered that I would hear her application on 22 November 2017. I allowed, as a concession, the mother to attend the hearing via video-link or by telephone. </p>

I had also received emails from the mother dated 21 and 22 November to the same effect and asking that she be granted legal aid.</p>

A detailed skeleton argument was lodged on behalf of the mother. There was insufficient time to deal with the application, and I was of the view that the father should be given the opportunity to consult counsel. I therefore directed that the mother&#8217;s set-aside application be adjourned to 22 January 2018, when the mother was represented by Ms Hopper and the father by Mr Jarman. I am grateful for their meticulously careful advocacy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Pursuant to directions given by me on 29 November 2017 the mother made her formal set-aside application on 4 December 2017. She did not confine her application to FPR 27.5. She also sought a set-aside under FPR 4.1(6) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>F(6) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>. As this case is proceeding in the family court there is no question but that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>F(6) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> is available to set aside my order. I do not therefore have to engage further in the debate as to whether rule 4.1(6) allows a set-aside of a final order made in children proceedings in the High Court. I will only say, almost in passing, that I do not agree with Macdonald J&#8217;s view in para 74(iii) of <span style="font-style:italic">N v J (Power to Set Aside Return Order)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/2752" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 2752 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 2752 (Fam)</ref> that the power under rule 4.1(6) is confined to procedural and interlocutory orders. Powerful dicta from the Court of Appeal in both the civil and family spheres have made it clear that the rule (and its CPR counterpart) is not confined to such orders but extends to final orders (see, respectively, <span style="font-style:italic">Norman v Norman</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/120" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 120" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 120</ref> at [49] and <span style="font-style:italic">Roult v North West Strategic Health Authority </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/444" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 444" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 444</ref> at [15]). Above all, I take the realistic, as opposed to formalistic, view that it would be the height of absurdity if the family court, an inferior court, had the power to set aside a final order, but the High Court did not. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute if, in order to set aside a final order, the High Court had to transfer a case down to the family court.</p>

Although it relies the father&#8217;s alleged agreement to live in Poland at some point in June 2016 it is completely unclear from the judgment when it was found that habitual residence had been established in Poland. All one can tell from the passage in the court bundle at E78 is that the judge was satisfied that by 30 July 2016 when the mother took the children unilaterally to Poland by train, habitual residence had been established, somehow, in Poland.</p>

Although originally, on 14/7/16 the District Court [in Lodz] dismissed the application on the grounds of no jurisdiction, but once the complaint was filed by the mother it was accepted pursuant to article 395(2) of Civil Procedure Code followed by a judgment on security for claims on 5/8/16 it was within these proceedings (which cannot be considered as new proceedings once a complaint was filed accepted by the court).

At the end of the day, my decision was no more than to declare that the English court had become first seised by 14 July 2016 at the latest and that it therefore had jurisdiction over these children who were habitually resident here when the proceedings were begun on 4 July 2016.

Plainly the best interests of these children is that they are in the place of their prior habitual residence and having regular contact with both of their parents.
