In one sense, this fact is entirely neutral.  The Wife wants to proceed in the jurisdiction that she considers will favour her.  The Husband likewise wants to proceed in the jurisdiction that he believes will favour him.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The family lived in London until 2006.  Although they did not own a property here, from 1998, they lived in a property in Cathcart Road, SW10, owned by a family company.  In July 2006, the family moved to Lugano, Switzerland.  A substantial property in Figino, Lugano was purchased in the Husband&#8217;s name.   The Wife and children have lived there constantly, other than during holidays, for the last eleven years.  The Husband, however, continued to spend a lot of time in London continuing his work for Cosmos/Monarch.  The pattern appears to be that he stayed here during the week but returned to Lugano for long weekends.  Holidays tended to be spent abroad, presumably because he wanted to get away from his working environment.  It is, therefore, correct that the Wife and children have spent little time in the UK during the last eleven years.  In the broadest of terms, the Wife has been here around 30 nights per annum.  </p>

In December 2014, the marriage broke down.  The Husband vacated the matrimonial home and moved into a flat he also owns in Lugano.  He says that he moved to Monaco in February 2016.  It is right to say that his statement refers to February 2015 but he says that is in error.  Monaco is undoubtedly where his father is based.  Mr Marks QC who appears on his behalf with Ms Clarke and Mr Bentham, told me that he obtained a residence permit in February 2016.  Mr Harrison QC, who appears for the Wife with Mr Nagpal, submits that he was only there for 132 nights in 2016.  Mr Harrison adds that the Husband spent 118 nights in Lugano in 2016 which increases to 139 in Switzerland if time spent in St Moritz and Zurich is included as well.  The Husband says he returns to Lugano to see the children as well as his family who are there.   </p>

There is a recital to the effect that the Husband contends that the English Court does not have jurisdiction to make maintenance orders.  It then says that complying with the directions shall not constitute entering an appearance or agreeing to confer jurisdiction in relation to maintenance but it does add that &#8220;this recital is without prejudice to the wife&#8217;s contention that, in the event that the husband files a statement in (reply to the Wife&#8217;s LSPO statement), his so doing shall constitute entering an appearance or submission to the jurisdiction&#8221;.  It is the Wife&#8217;s LSPO statement that sets out her financial position and her main contentions as to the Husband&#8217;s means.  Complaint has been made to me on the Wife&#8217;s behalf that the Husband has declined to provide financial disclosure to this court.  In the light of the recital, I consider the complaint to be unjustified.  If the Wife had wanted financial disclosure, she would have had to say the opposite, namely that answering the LSPO statement did not constitute submission to the jurisdiction. </p>

He says he has not been here much at all since the family disposed of Monarch Airlines at the end of 2014.

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Professor Andrea Bonomi, a professor of law at the University of Lausanne, was appointed as Single Joint Expert.  His report, which is agreed, is dated 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April 2017.  Jurisdiction in Switzerland in divorce cases is governed by the domicile of the defendant (Swiss Private International Law Act 1987, hereafter &#8220;SPILA&#8221;).  Domicile in Swiss law is not the same as in our law.  It is more akin to habitual residence.  The Professor translates the French and Italian definition as being the State where the person resides &#8220;with the intent of residing there permanently&#8221; but another translation shown to me by Mr Marks uses the word &#8220;with the intention of settling&#8221;.  There is an objective as well as a subjective element.  Temporary residence is not sufficient.  It must have (or be intended to have) a certain duration.  The courts consider that a person&#8217;s domicile is located at the place where he/she has the centre of his/her life, ie the centre of his/her personal and social interests.  There is no doubt, says the Professor, that the Wife is therefore domiciled in Switzerland and the Swiss Court has jurisdiction to entertain divorce proceedings.  The operative date is the date of the petition.</p>

The wishes of a child, particularly an older child, is very significant.  Any parent can relocate themselves without permission so the court will proceed on the basis that the Wife is in England and the Husband in Monaco.  The question will therefore be whether the child is better off living with the parent who is in England or the parent in Monaco.  Mr Harrison therefore submits to me that it is virtually inevitable that the Wife will get permission to bring the son to this country.</p>

Independent legal advice is provided by the Notary.  The court cannot refuse to enforce on the ground that the contract is &#8220;manifestly inequitable&#8221;.  The Swiss court has jurisdiction over maintenance, the allocation of rights in the family home and pensions.  Maintenance is decided on the basis of needs and resources.  There is a checklist that is very similar indeed to our section 25(2)(a), although as Mr Marks points out, it omits &#8220;conduct that it would be inequitable to disregard&#8221;.

In that case, it was impossible to conclude, having considered the matter objectively, that justice would not be done if the wife was compelled to pursue her remedy for financial provision in France, which was plainly the natural forum for the resolution of the matrimonial dispute.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Harrison on behalf of the Wife raises two further legal points that I must deal with.  The first would be, if correct, a knock-out blow.  He submits that there are no &#8220;continuing&#8221; proceedings in Switzerland by virtue of the suspension of the proceedings ordered in Switzerland on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2017.  He fairly acknowledges that, if this was just a &#8220;holding&#8221; type order, it could not prevent the proceedings &#8220;continuing&#8221;.  That must be right as, otherwise, it would lead to very unsavoury manoeuvring in all these cases.  However, he says the suspension here is different because it is based on the fact that Swiss law operates its own &#8220;first in time&#8221; lis pendens rule, akin to the provisions in Brussels II Revised. He argues that it is mandatory in Switzerland to order a stay in favour of the jurisdiction first seised (provided the court is satisfied that the jurisdiction will conclude proceedings within a reasonable time).  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Marks&#8217; response is to say that the question of whether proceedings are continuing in the English court is quite separate from whether they are continuing in another court.  Schedule 1 Paragraph 4 of the DMPA provides that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">for the purposes of this Schedule, proceedings in the Court are continuing if they are pending and not stayed</span>&#8221;.  I accept that this is referring to the English Court as that is clear by analogy with Paragraph 9.  Paragraph 5 states that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">provision may be made in rules of court as to when proceedings of any description in another jurisdiction are continuing for the purposes of this Schedule</span>&#8221;.  </p>

The Swiss court will not therefore recognise any attempt by this court to make orders inconsistent with the Swiss court&#8217;s exclusive jurisdiction.  The English court does have jurisdiction and might &#8220;dip its toe&#8221; in this water (subject to consideration of the Pre-Marital Agreement in the light of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Radmacher v Granatino</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/42" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 42" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 42</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 AC 534" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 AC 534</ref>) but the Lugano Convention does not apply, for enforcement purposes, to &#8220;rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship&#8221;.  It follows that a property adjustment order in relation to the Figino property made by the English court would not be enforced in Switzerland unless it could be shown to relate solely to maintenance, which might be difficult given that the Wife does not wish to reside there.  </p>

In one sense, this argument is somewhat academic as it is conceded that this court will have jurisdiction in relation to maintenance if the Wife returns to live here, which I consider highly likely.  Moreover, I am sure that my review of the factors making up &#8220;the balance of fairness and convenience&#8221; should include the likely position in the foreseeable future not just the position as it is today.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, in fairness to the competing arguments, I am satisfied that this court does not, as at today&#8217;s date, have jurisdiction to consider the Wife&#8217;s maintenance application.  To succeed, Mr Harrison would need to satisfy me that I should treat the Husband as being &#8220;domiciled&#8221; for the purposes of Swiss law in Switzerland not Monaco.  This is because Article 5 of the Lugano Convention starts by saying that a person can be sued in a State bound by the Convention only if he is domiciled in another Lugano Convention State.  Monaco is not a Lugano Convention State.  It is accepted that he would therefore have to be domiciled in Switzerland and that &#8220;domicile&#8221; in this case depends on Swiss law not English law.  </p>

First, I am quite sure that the Husband has &#8220;all his tackle in order&#8221; in relation to his residence status in Monaco.  It might have very serious tax ramifications for him if he did not.  Second, there is no doubt that both parties have proceeded throughout this litigation on the basis that he is domiciled for Swiss law purposes in Monaco.  For example, the Wife&#8217;s application to suspend the Swiss divorce proceedings refers to him being &#8220;domiciled in Monte Carlo&#8221;.  Her relocation application repeatedly stresses that he is not normally resident in Switzerland but that he has been living in Monte Carlo.  The instructions to Professor Bonomi say that he is resident in Monaco.  I cannot go behind any of this, let alone on the sort of 2016 &#8220;day count&#8221; proposed by Mr Harrison.  </p>

This court does not have jurisdiction pursuant to 2(a) of Article 5 as the maintenance creditor (the Wife) is not domiciled here for Lugano Convention purposes as she is not, at present, resident here (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27/section/41" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 41</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27" uk:canonical="1982 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982</ref>).  I further accept that 2(b) does not apply as the Maintenance Regulation determines whether this court has jurisdiction to entertain proceedings and, until the Wife returns here, the English court does not.</p>

It may well be that Mr Marks is right that the only reason it does not deal with that aspect is that there is no jurisdiction in Switzerland to do so but, in any event, that does not assist the Wife as the Agreement does not say England should have jurisdiction.   It is an important point that the Agreement does not purport to deal with maintenance.  The right of the Wife to go to the Swiss court to deal with that aspect has not been excluded.  The Agreement is therefore in some ways akin to an English Pre-Nuptial Agreement that excludes sharing but not needs.  It would have been a relevant consideration if it had purported to exclude maintenance but it does not.   </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Harrison gives eleven reasons in his document why he says that the Husband&#8217;s application should be dismissed.  I have already dealt with the first point, namely his contention that there are no continuing proceedings in Switzerland.  His second reason is to argue that the Husband&#8217;s application undermines the Lugano Convention.  I cannot accept that submission.  The essence of it is that a stay would frustrate the Wife&#8217;s maintenance claim that she is entitled to bring here but I have found that, at present, there is no jurisdiction for such a claim.  Mr Harrison refers to two cases (<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Turner v Grovit</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 101" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 101</ref> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">West Tankers v Allianz</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 AC 1138" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 AC 1138</ref>) for the proposition that it is impermissible for Member States to make domestic orders which have the effect of undermining community treaties and legislation.  I do not accept that.  The two cases referred to were examples of attempts in this jurisdiction to prevent litigation in other Member States and is thus very different but, in any event, I do not see how I am undermining the Lugano Convention which does not apply to divorce proceedings anyway. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Harrison&#8217;s third and fourth reasons are opposite sides of the same coin.  His third reason argues that Switzerland applies a &#8220;first in time rule&#8221; so I should do so as well.  His fourth is that the Husband&#8217;s petition was second in time.  I recognise that the Brussels II Regulation does operate such a rule but I am not dealing with that Regulation.  Indeed, the Wife could not have petitioned at all if she was in an EU Member State as she is relying for jurisdiction solely on her English domicile.  I do accept that the fact she was first in time is a factor in her favour but Mr Marks reminds me that the petitioners in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">S v S</span>, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">C v C</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ella v Ella</span> were also all first in time.  Moreover, I do take the view that the fact that negotiations had been ongoing in Switzerland for many months at the time when the Wife acted entirely unilaterally by petitioning here without notice, nullifies the force of this point.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Harrison&#8217;s fifth point relates to the limited scope of the Pre-Marital Agreement.  I accept that it does not cover the divorce itself but what it did cover applied Swiss law and linked the issue exclusively to the Swiss Courts.  Moreover, it seems tolerably clear that it was an advantage to the Wife that it did not cover maintenance claims as they can now be litigated in Switzerland if not agreed.  </p>

I accept that there may be a marginal advantage in this regard assuming the Wife is back in this country but judges are required to assess needs abroad regularly now that there are so many international families coming before the courts in all jurisdictions.  I am clear that the Swiss Judge can do so without undue difficulty.  Indeed, it did not stop the English Court sending <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">S v S</span>, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">C v C</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Ella v Ella</span> abroad even though the petitioners were all living in this jurisdiction.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The seventh reason given is that the Husband has not lived full-time in Lugano for some forty years.  Mr Marks contrasted this submission with the submission made by Mr Harrison that the Husband was now &#8220;domiciled&#8221; in Lugano.  I take the view that the strength of the point is more than offset by the fact the Husband has a greater connection with Switzerland than he now has in London; that there are assets there but not here; that the main family home is there and, at least at present, the Wife and children reside there.</p>

The Wife is not fluent and will need an interpreter whereas the Husband is fluent in English.  I accept that there is some force in that point but the Wife has lived there for some eleven years.  She will have to litigate the relocation application there.  The negotiations were taking place there prior to the divorce petition being issued here.  Finally, I am sure it will be possible to find a very able interpreter to the extent that one is required.   </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The ninth reason given is that the Husband contends that all the properties he owns in Switzerland are subject to usufruct in favour of his father other than the matrimonial home.  I do not entirely understand that point as it will be far easier for the court in Switzerland to deal with the law in this area and assess the true value to the Husband of these assets given that his father is now aged 89.  I anticipate that I would need expert evidence as to the law as well as a translation of the relevant documents if I was asked to deal with this aspect.   </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Harrison&#8217;s final point, other than that his client will not get substantial justice in Switzerland, is to argue that this court is well able to deal with this case flexibly and reach a fair conclusion taking into account the Pre-Marital Agreement, the trusts, issues about non-matrimonial property and the like.  I accept that we can do so but I am not persuaded that this is a significant advantage as against a fully developed justice system in another European Country.  What Mr Harrison is really saying is that his client will do better here.  That may well be right but it is not the test I have to apply.   </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I therefore now turn to whether the Wife can satisfy me that she will not receive substantial justice in Switzerland.  I take the view that she faces an uphill struggle to satisfy the court that a fully developed legal system such as that in Switzerland will not deliver substantial justice.  As with so many of these cases, the real nub of the argument relates to the treatment of Pre-Marital Agreements.  There is no doubt that the Swiss Court will enforce the separation of property agreement in this case.  Twenty years ago, the English Court was instinctively hostile to such Agreements.  Interestingly, it all began to change with cases such as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">S v S</span>.  Having said that, in this particular case, the Wife would not have been able to launch anything other than a &#8220;needs&#8221; based claim here prior to the decision in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">White v White</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 596" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 596</ref>.  Even today, in the absence of a Pre-Marital Agreement, she would almost certainly not be able to do so unless she proved that there was marital acquest. </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">But the law has changed here.  Following <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Radmacher v Granatino</span>, the Husband in this case would be able to argue that this Pre-Marital Agreement should be upheld here as well as in Switzerland.  I am not going to give any indication as to what the outcome of that might be as I have not heard the evidence.  All I will say is that there have been cases in this jurisdiction in which parties have been held to such agreements and, as a result, have not received capital (or any significant capital) outright.  Mr Granatino was one such litigant.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Husband has made an open offer to make available a property for the Wife worth up to nearly &#163;8 million and to pay significant maintenance.  I recognise that the Wife will be concerned as to a number of aspects such as her security should the Husband die; whether the provision of a property should end if she remarries; whether the quantum of maintenance offered is consistent with the factors in the Swiss equivalent of our section 25 and whether the maintenance should be capitalised.  I cannot possibly say, certainly at this stage, that the Swiss Court, which applies a very similar needs checklist to the English Court will not offer substantial justice but, in any event, I remind myself that there is a safety net in this case.  Mr Marks concedes that the Wife can apply to this court for financial provision after an overseas divorce pursuant to Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref>.  Again, I intend to say nothing as to the prospects of success of such an application at this stage.  I acknowledge that the Husband may well resist such an application forcefully.  There is no doubt that the outcome of the Wife&#8217;s application in Switzerland will be very relevant to the consideration of such an application here.  </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is no certainty that such an application will be necessary.  I very much hope that it will not be necessary.  The fact that it is available may influence the thinking of the parties in the Swiss negotiations but I cannot ignore the fact that it is available as a fall-back.  If there is eventually an application, I consider it should be listed before me.  Moreover, I am sure that it is one of the few cases where the application should be on notice and the Husband given an opportunity to be heard.  I would envisage a directions hearing prior to the substantive hearing at which the decision to grant or refuse permission would be made.  </p>

I therefore grant the application for a stay of her divorce petition which will be dismissed on pronouncement of final decree in Switzerland.  I will give her liberty to apply to lift the stay should, for whatever reason, the Swiss Court decline to discharge its suspension of the Husband&#8217;s Swiss petition.</p>
