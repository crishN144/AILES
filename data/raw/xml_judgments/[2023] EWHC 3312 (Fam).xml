She also similarly referred to OO (TT&#8217;s girlfriend) having told TT about her own sexual abuse, which may have led TT to make the allegations against the F. This was the first time TT made the allegations, and therefore Ms MacLynn puts particular emphasis on OO&#8217;s role. She also suggests that JJ reinforced and supported TT&#8217;s story. She points to errors in the recording and process of the various police officers, including encouraging TT to speak.</p>

They were faced with a teenage girl who had made serious allegations but was very reluctant to speak. The Guidance upon which Ms MacLynn places such reliance does not mean that the police should be so concerned about not &#8220;encouraging&#8221; allegations that they cannot help a potential victim of abuse to speak. There needs to be a nuanced and proportionate response to such situations, which may well not be uncommon. </p>

SS herself was a believable witness, both in her ABE interviews and the evidence she gave to court. Her allegations have been consistent, from the handwritten note in November 2020, to the phone note in April 2021, her note to PP on 1 May 2021 and then the ABE interviews and oral evidence. I reject Ms MacLynn&#8217;s suggestion that SS&#8217;s failure to mention the F touching himself in her second written account undermines her evidence. </p>

I can just about accept that she might have made an original allegation out of anger, but to maintain it when she was losing her main home, her mother and her siblings, seems very extreme. Further, her initial retraction of the allegations is wholly explicable by the level of pressure she was placed under by the M and the F. I accept that the M left her alone with the F after the finding of the notebook (in itself a dereliction of proper parenting) as was SS&#8217;s account recorded in the RASSO log. </p>

Her presentation in both the ABE interviews and her oral evidence is of someone totally overwhelmed by her sense of responsibility and the enormity of what she was disclosing. In non-psychological terms, she seemed to be rendered almost mute by what she was saying. In my view this was because of her extreme sense of responsibility for her mother, an emotion forced upon her by extraordinarily poor parenting over the years and her sense of responsibility for her siblings. It also makes sense that she should feel very guilty about failing to support SS in April 2021. </p>

If there is a deeply distressed child who is making allegations, then it is only human to give them some support, which might later be interpreted as encouragement. It is a matter of judgement whether such support stepped over a line, and in my view that did not happen in this case. </p>

She was a palpably truthful witness, who nobody has suggested had a motive for lying. Her narrative of sensing that the F was someone who overstepped boundaries and posed a threat, rang entirely true. It was evidence which would resonate with any young woman who has had to learn to identify men who pose a threat from their &#8220;low-level&#8221; conduct. Her evidence of the F acting inappropriately and her feeling he was a threat is strongly supported by the fact that she rang her boyfriend on the evening of the NEC concert and kept him on the phone because she was so worried about the F. I accept that the F did not, save for grabbing her bum, assault her. However, her evidence of the sense of threat he posed is, in my view, important because it shows a course of conduct of not respecting sexual boundaries, and of behaviour towards teenage girls and young women, which I would describe as &#8220;grooming&#8221;. </p>

He did not accept that there was any possibility of any of the girls misunderstanding playfighting or any other actions by him. There were some parts of his evidence I found hard to accept, or at least to understand. He said that he thought of SS and TT as his children, but the way he spoke about them did not suggest to me that that was true. Further, his lack of response to the allegations, particularly that of SS, seemed false. If he had truly never sexually assaulted her, and he had read the content of the notebook, then I would have expected him to be angry or at least utterly bemused and questioning. Instead he suggested he had been largely passive and life had gone on as normal. That in my view is highly unlikely. I conclude that he lied to the court on the key issues of abuse, and what was happening in the household. </p>
