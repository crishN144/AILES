The husband&#8217;s position statement advertised a request for oral evidence only in relation to a possible Art 13 (a) defence of consent, a defence which the mother did not, in fact, pursue. An oral application was made extending the enquiry to issues as to Art 3 that morning. As Mostyn J makes clear in the authority of <span style="font-style:italic">ES v LS </span>[2021] EWHC 2758 the relief under the Hague Convention 1980 is of an interim, procedural nature. The proceedings are summary and oral evidence is very much the exception, rather than the rule. I did not consider this case met any test of exceptionality.</p>

This will involve a real and detailed consideration of (inter alia): the child's day to day life and experiences; family environment; interests and hobbies; friends etc and an appreciation of which adults are most important to the child. The approach must always be child driven. I emphasise this because all too frequently and this case is no exception, the statements filed focus predominantly on the adult parties. It is all too common for the court to have to drill deep for information about the child's life and routine. This should have been mined to the surface in the preparation of the case and regarded as the primary objective of the statements. I am bound to say that if the lawyers follow this approach more assiduously, I consider that the very discipline of the preparation is most likely to clarify where the child is habitually resident. I must also say that this exercise, if properly engaged with, should lead to a reduction in these inquiries in the courtroom. Habitual residence is essentially a factual issue, it ought therefore, in the overwhelming majority of cases, to be readily capable of identification by the parties."</p>

Habitual residence is a question of fact and the scope of the enquiry depends entirely on the particular facts of the case. What is important is that the judge demonstrates sufficiently that he or she has had in mind the factors in the old and new lives of the child, and the family, which might have a bearing on this particular child's habitual residence. The court's review of all of the relevant evidence about habitual residence cannot be allowed to become an unworkable obstacle course, through which the judge must pick his or her way by a prescribed route or risk being said to have made an unsustainable finding. In some cases it will be necessary to carry out quite a detailed analysis of the situation that the child has left; in other cases, less detail of that will be required and the judge will be able to explain shortly why that is and focus more on the circumstances in the new country."</span></p>

The mother says that &#8220;emotionally and psychologically&#8221; she could not settle there as she was so worried about the father&#8217;s &#8220;violent and abusive&#8221; behaviour. I accept entirely that she was unhappy and sometime between September 2021 and January 2022 she had resolved to return to England.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have to focus on the day to day life of C within the context, as I find, of a initial plan to move permanently to Poland. Consonant with that plan, C spent a six month period integrating into family life in Poland, living in places that were central to both the maternal and paternal families. He would have enjoyed time with members of his family, whether maternal grandparents, or paternal grandparents, uncles and aunts or cousins every day. Even after the separation of the parties he saw his father and paternal grandparents at four times a week.</p>

Moreover, I remind myself that Poland is a Brussel IIA country as were until recently and is a 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-Operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Child (1996 Hague Convention) country as we still are. The premise of both those schemes is that there is an efficient functioning system  enabling access to justice. I have received no evidence of any appreciable delay in applying for orders to deal with domestic abuse or financial need and no evidence that the mother would not be able to obtain access to justice for interim relief if she so sought. That absence of evidence coupled with undertakings provide appropriate protection so the any risk under Art 13 (b) is neutralised. I therefore do not have to consider the question of discretion. The undertakings have been accepted by the court and have the force of an order. Therefore, the undertakings are to be treated as necessary measures of protection under Art 11 Hague Convention 1996 which Polish authorities are required to treat as though made by court in Poland. </p>
