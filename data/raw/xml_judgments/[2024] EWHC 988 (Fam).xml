It is not in dispute that the children and their mother arrived in England in November 2022 and have been present in this jurisdiction ever since. &#8216;N&#8217; arrived in the United Kingdom a little earlier, in June 2022.</p>

Those proceedings concluded with a &#8216;consent judgment&#8217; made in the Chief Magistrates&#8217; Court at Kira. The judgment is recorded as having been made with the consent of &#8216;A&#8217; and &#8216;R&#8217; on 19 September 2022 and bears the signatures of both parties. &#8216;N&#8217; was named as Second Respondent in that Order and the consent judgment bears his signature also. The judgment in the Ugandan court proceedings records that both parents would share joint custody for the children. Further the judgment in the Ugandan proceedings stipulated that neither parent was permitted to take the children out of the jurisdiction of Uganda without the consent of the other nor change the names of the children without the written consent of the other parent.</p>

It is not disputed that on 30 November 2022, the mother then removed the children from Uganda, in breach of the terms of the Ugandan judgment. The mother travelled with the children to the United Kingdom, without the father&#8217;s consent or knowledge, joining &#8216;N&#8217;, who had travelled to the United Kingdom some weeks earlier. The children have remained living in the United Kingdom with their mother and &#8216;N&#8217; for a period now of some seventeen months. There is no dispute between the parties that the mother and &#8216;N&#8217; are present in the United Kingdom legally on the basis of visas allowing them to live and work in the United Kingdom.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Applicant father applied to this Court on 14 November 2023 seeking, variously, a Location Order, a Disclosure Order and an Order for the summary return of the children to Uganda. In the course of the proceedings, the mother challenged the issue of the paternity of the youngest child. Directions were given for independent expert evidence by way of DNA testing. The DNA test report concludes that &#8216;A&#8217; &#8220;cannot be the biological father&#8221; of &#8216;V&#8217;. Further DNA test results provide strong evidence that &#8216;N&#8217; is the biological father of &#8216;V&#8217; with a probability of paternity of at least 99.99%.  The expert evidence is not challenged by any party. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There are several facts that remain in dispute. The father asserts that the mother changed the names of the children, in breach of the Ugandan judgment, obtaining passports for the children using their new names. The allegation is denied by the mother. Both parties produce in evidence conflicting birth certificates for each child. Further, the mother makes serious allegations against &#8216;A&#8217; of domestic abuse. Those allegations are denied by &#8216;A&#8217;. At an earlier Directions hearing the Court examined whether, in order to sufficiently identify what the children&#8217;s welfare requires, it should conduct an inquiry into the disputed facts and, if so, how extensive that enquiry should be. The Court concluded there should be no fact finding element to this Final Hearing. This is<span style="font-style:italic"/>not the forum for determining those allegations, in the context of this application for an Order for the summary return of the children, as the welfare of the children does not require it.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In the course of these proceedings, a report was obtained from Cafcass to ascertain the wishes and feelings of the children. This Court had the real benefit of hearing oral evidence from the Cafcass Family Court Adviser, Ms Huntington, alongside her written report of 21 February 2024. Additionally, the Court considered the documents filed, including a bundle of comprising just short of 500 pages, together with a further bundle of authorities. No oral evidence was heard from the parties. All parties were present and legally represented, the Applicant father attending by video from Uganda. The Court was greatly assisted by helpful and focussed submissions from Ms Perrins and Mr Gibson-Lee of Counsel, for which the Court is enormously grateful.</p>

She asserts that some of the abuse she received from the Applicant father was in the presence of the children, which caused the children to suffer trauma. She further asserts that the children were at risk of sexual abuse from the father, asserting that the children shared his bed and that he watched pornography in their presence. The mother further asserts that the children contracted urinary tract infections whilst staying with their father. She accepts that she did not report any incidents of abuse to the authorities in Uganda. She says that is because the father boasted about having connections with people in government, including a family member who was closely connected, she says, with the President. Furthermore, she points to background source material suggesting that, even though marital rape is said to be a widespread issue, there is no recorded evidence of a marital rape case ever being brought against a spouse in Ugandan case law.</p>

The Family Court Adviser told the Court, &#8220;The children were not worried or reticent in speaking positively about their father. I did not gain any sense that they were influenced by their mother.&#8221; The children are, there can be no doubt, aware of their mother&#8217;s views of not wishing to return to Uganda. Their own views are closely aligned to the views of their mother in this context. This Court also bears in mind that the children&#8217;s wishes are balanced, with some positive memories of Uganda and with some positive aspects in respect of their relationships with their father in the past. I am satisfied, however, that the confluence of the views of the mother and the children arise out of matters of mutual concern, grounded in a shared lived experience in Uganda. The Family Court Adviser told the Court that the children were, &#8220;very aware&#8221; of the parental conflict in Uganda, whether or not they witnessed the domestic abuse as asserted by their mother. Moreover, the Family Court Adviser told the Court, &#8220;The children expressly stated to me that their previous circumstances were difficult under the shared care arrangement in Uganda.

Within this context, in this Court&#8217;s judgment, the expressed wishes of the children not to be returned to Uganda must carry weight in the Court&#8217;s welfare evaluation in this case.

The Family Court Adviser recognised in her written report in respect of the child &#8216;V&#8217;, given the clear and reliable expert evidence in respect of her paternity, that it would be difficult to see how there could be proper consideration of a return to Uganda for &#8216;V&#8217; in these circumstances. The Court recognises that it is <span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT">well established that a person may have the status of &#8216;parent&#8217; in a social and psychological sense, even if they are not a biological parent </span>(<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;color:#000000">e G</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;color:#000000"/><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:#000000"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2006/43" uk:canonical="[2006] UKHL 43" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] UKHL 43</ref>). The Family Court Adviser, however, observed in her evidence that &#8216;V&#8217;s time with the Applicant father in Uganda was more limited than the time spent between &#8216;A&#8217; and the older three children, by reason of her young age. &#8216;V&#8217; has spent a significant part of her life in the United Kingdom as a proportion of her childhood and she views &#8216;N&#8217; in a parental role as a father figure. Further, the children have been raised as a sibling group. Their sibling relationship is a positive one and there is a strong sibling bond. </span>Separation of the sibling unit would have significant implications for the sibling relationship.  <span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;color:#000000">The </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT">Applicant father and the mother both agree that the chid &#8216;V&#8217; needs to remain living with her sibling group, and to be treated equally with her sisters. However, there would, in those circumstances, be the real likelihood of &#8216;V&#8217; returning to Uganda as part of sibling group, without her mother and without her biological father, with no biological parent exercising Parental Responsibility for her.  The Family Court Adviser observed that </span>it was not in the interests of all the children for one child to remain in the United Kingdom and for three of the children to return to Uganda. Furthermore, if the youngest child was ordered to return to Uganda, that would deprive her of her natural father. The Family Court Adviser was clear that the children should be kept together as siblings and they should not be separated from their mother. The children should have regular contact with their father. Respectfully, I agree with the conclusions of this experienced Family Court Adviser.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">The significant change of circumstances that would follow in any of those scenarios must be balanced with the feeling of loss the children have expressed in respect of their relationship with their father. The consequence of not returning to Uganda would continue to have an impact on the children in terms of that relationship. This can be ameliorated to some extent by continued regular video contact with their father, such contact having been put in place by Order of Mr Justice Cobb on 13 December 2023. The mother has expressed her willingness for regular video contact to continue. Further, the mother is agreeable to direct contact taking place between the children and their father, if the father was able to travel to the United Kingdom. </p>

The children have settled in education in England. This Court is satisfied that remaining in England would not prejudice the children&#8217;s educational welfare. Conversely, a further change of circumstances by returning to education in Uganda would have an adverse impact on the children by way of disruption to their education. The children have stability of accommodation and education in England, where they are being cared for by their mother as part of their strong sibling group. Within this context, this Court is satisfied that the change of circumstances that would be constituted by a&#160;summary&#160;return&#160;to the&#160;jurisdiction&#160;of Uganda would be significantly de-stabilising for the children and would be unnecessarily disruptive. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">In respect of the disputed allegations of harm, the Family Court Adviser was rightly concerned that the mother&#8217;s allegations against the Applicant father raise significant risk factors. Further, the Family Court Adviser made plain that it was evident from her discussion with the children that they had been exposed to and involved in varying degrees in the parental dispute for a number of years. Furthermore, the mother and &#8216;N&#8217; have both expressed fear about the mother&#8217;s safety if she returned to Uganda with the children in the context of their belief that the father has connections with people in power in Uganda. They consider, whether rightly or wrongly, that the father would attempt to exert influence in his favour if the dispute was determined in Uganda.  The Family Court Adviser observed in her oral evidence that the mother was &#8220;very distressed&#8221; at the possibility of returning to Uganda: &#8220;She conveyed feeling fearful for her safety and for the safety of [&#8216;N&#8217;]. She was fearful she would be separated from the children and criminalised with no recourse to fair and accessible welfare proceedings. She could not conceive being separated from her children but conveyed real concerns about the consequences of being separated from the children in Uganda. This was not just about a reluctance to return to Uganda. She showed real fear about her circumstances and for the children in the event of a return&#8230;if ordered to return to Uganda, this would cause her great distress and fear.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">With respect to the children&#8217;s physical, emotional and educational needs, this Court bears in mind that a decision not to&#160;return&#160;the children to the&#160;jurisdiction&#160;of Uganda will inevitably interfere with them re-building and developing a relationship with their father. There is concern that if the children grow up with no direct relationship with their father, emotional harm to the children is a potential prospect. However, in this Court&#8217;s judgment, the fact of returning the children against their wishes, which may serve to increase the opportunities for contact between the children and their father, may cause further damage to the relationship between the children and their father in circumstances where they may blame him for the disruption to their lives and they may feel he has not listened to their expressed views. Within this context, this Court is satisfied that, given the strength of the feelings expressed by the children, the consequences for the children&#8217;s relationship with their father of being forced to&#160;return&#160;against those wishes would be contrary to their best interests. Having regard to the foregoing, this Court is satisfied that in the short to medium term, the children&#8217;s relationship with their father may be better promoted by weight being accorded to their wishes and feelings and for contact to continue on a regular thrice weekly basis by video. In this Court&#8217;s judgment, there is a greater prospect of a relationship between the father and the children being maintained if their wishes and feelings are listened to than if not. Whilst this Court accepts that remaining in England will make it more difficult for the children to maintain a relationship with their extended family, this Court is satisfied that the children could maintain their relationship with their wider extended family albeit on a remote basis at this stage.</p>

	      <p class="judgment-bodytext" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">This Court takes into consideration the age, sex, background and other characteristics of each of the children and in particular their nationality, culture and family background. If a&#160;return&#160;Order is not made, the children will not&#160;return&#160;to a country that constitutes a significant part of their identity and their cultural heritage. Against this, in light of the history over the past seventeen months, the children have a degree of connection to England. The children have spent a significant period of time in the United Kingdom now. They know the country well. They are fluent in the English language, which is also the official language in Uganda.  The United Kingdom is a multicultural society. This Court is satisfied that whilst living with their mother and siblings, each child will continue to understand their heritage. Whilst the mother entertains strong negative views about a&#160;return&#160;to Uganda, there is no evidence to suggest she is not capable of promoting the children&#8217;s culture and heritage. Once again, it is important in this context to recognise that the children form a very close sibling group and a shared heritage. </p>

The Ugandan Order did envisage revisiting the arrangements for the children in the event of either parenting remarrying. The mother has entered a second marriage. This Court has the benefit of a report from an experienced Family Court Adviser who has identified the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings as can be ascertained currently. Looking at all the evidence available now, when applying the factors in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT">re J</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT">, this is not a case where the welfare interests of the children, individually or collectively demand their summary return to Uganda. This Court must conclude that to do so would be contrary to their best interests and would cause them considerable and unnecessary disruption to their lives. Further, the children would be exposed to a degree of risk of harm upon return, either by way of emotional harm consequent upon any separation from their mother&#8217;s care or consequent upon impairment of their mother&#8217;s parenting capacity which would inevitably result from being required to return to a situation she is so fearful of.
