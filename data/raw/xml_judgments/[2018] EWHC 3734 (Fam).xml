		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.01in">&#8220;In my view the approach <span style="font-style:italic">[of the family court to earlier findings]</span> has three stages. Firstly the court considers whether it will permit any reconsideration or review of, or challenge to, the earlier finding (here referred to by the parents as a review). If it does the second and third stages relates to its approach to that exercise. The second stage relates to, and determines, the extent of the investigations and evidence concerning the review. The third stage is the hearing of the review and thus it is at this stage that the court decides the extent to which the earlier finding stands by applying the relevant test to the circumstances then found to exist.&#8221; </p>

I do not, with all respect to Baker J's tentative comment, think that different approaches are called for in different forensic contexts. The attempt to create such a forensic taxonomy would, I fear, be productive merely of satellite litigation. Of course, the <span style="font-style:italic">application </span>of the general approach in any particular case will reflect the circumstances of that case.  </p>

I add this: one does not get beyond the first stage unless there is some real reason to believe that the earlier findings require revisiting. Mere speculation and hope are not enough. There must be solid grounds for challenge. But for my own part I would be disinclined to set the test any higher. I have misgivings about McFarlane J's use in Birmingham (No 2) , paras 42, 55, of the words I have emphasised in paras 16&#8211;17 above. I suspect that in significant part they reflected the approach of Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">In re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] AC 563" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] AC 563</ref> . *106 Be that as it may, I think, with great respect to McFarlane J, that the nuance is wrong.  </p>

There is an <span style="font-style:italic">evidential </span>burden on those who seek to displace an earlier finding&#8212;in that sense they have to &#8220;make the running&#8221;&#8212;but the <span style="font-style:italic">legal </span>burden of proof remains throughout where it was at the outset. The judge has to consider the fresh evidence alongside the earlier material before coming to a conclusion in the light of the totality of the material before the court. I think that Charles J's phrase &#8220;a high test&#8221; is best avoided at this as at previous stages. I can well understand why, in the particular circumstances of Birmingham (No 1) , where there were concurrent findings of two High Court judges and the Court of Appeal, Charles J used those words, but to elevate them to a test&#8212;a legal principle&#8212;is unwarranted, unnecessary and potentially misleading.

Here, the application to admit the evidence was being made after the fact-finding stage of the proceedings had concluded. This was not fatal to the application, but it was a consideration. Regard must be had to the principle of finality and, approaching three years since the allegations were first made, the emotional cost to the children of further prolonging the fact-finding process was always likely to be high.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in">Lastly, (h) requires the court to have regard to any matters prescribed by Family Procedure Rules. Here Ms Cheetham strongly submits that the court should have regard to the wholesale flouting of the provisions of Part 25 by the mother and by her solicitor. She refers to: the unilateral approach to Cansford in the middle of proceedings without the knowledge of the court or any other party; the disclosure to Cansford of police material that was covered by a nondisclosure undertaking; the absence of any letter of instruction; and the misleading by omission of Cansford, who were not told about the ongoing proceedings at all. Overall, Ms Cheetham argues that this state of affairs is flatly contrary to the philosophy relating to the instruction of expert witnesses as articulated by Wall J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Family Proceedings: Expert Witnesses)</span> [2001] EWHC Fam 7 at [35-37]:  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.01in">"The essence of case management in proceedings relating to children is that the process should be transparent, and that each party should know the case that party has to meet. It is equally important when it comes to expert evidence, that if such evidence is required in a case, the issues to be addressed by it should be identified at the earliest possible stage in the proceedings and debated at an early directions appointment, so that the briefs to be given to whatever expert or experts are to be instructed can be defined by the court and permission given by the court for the relevant documentation to be disclosed. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.01in">It is for the court to decide what expert evidence should or should not be obtained in any case, and it is in my judgment quite contrary both to the spirit and the letter of the approach to expert evidence which has developed since the implementation of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, that one party, without notice to the other party or the court, should commission a report from an expert about which neither the court nor the other party knows anything. </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.01in">It is equally important, in my view, that expert witnesses should always understand their role in the proceedings in clear terms. In particular, they must know the terms of the court order which defines their involvement, and the purpose for which they are being instructed. In my judgment, expert witnesses asked to write reports for proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> are not only well advised to find out, but need to know precisely what the court requires of them in order that they can properly fulfil their obligations as experts to report fully and objectively to the court." </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.01in">I agree with Ms Cheetham's submissions on this point. The court should as a matter of principle be slow to admit expert evidence that has been irregularly obtained. Plainly, it will not stand on ceremony at the expense of child welfare, but if the rules are not enforced, parties are encouraged to ignore them. A lax approach will inevitably be felt to be unfair by other parties and satellite issues of this kind cause delay and increase costs. Moreover, although it has not apparently happened in this case, there would be nothing to stop a litigant shopping around, unbeknownst to the other parties, until they alight upon a favourable opinion. A response such as that of the Guardian (see paragraph 22 above) does not in my view give adequate weight to the importance of the proper procedures, which are there to serve the interests of children and of justice.  </p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in">I would suggest that in a case like this, where a court is faced with expert evidence that has already been obtained in breach of s.13, it should as one part of its thinking ask itself whether it would have granted permission to seek the expert evidence with which it is now presented as a <span style="font-style:italic">fait accompli</span>. That of course is not the only consideration, but to ask the question ensures that the requirements of the statute and the rules are not forgotten. In this case, had the mother made an application at the hearing on 26 April for permission to instruct a further expert, such an application would inevitably have been refused. The fact that she chose to ignore the rules is a matter the court should take into account.  </p>

There are two fundamental reasons. Firstly, he does not have the necessary expertise to offer an opinion to a court on the origin of radiological appearances in infants, particularly pre-term infants, as they are a patient cohort of which he has no clinical experience. Secondly, his approach is shot through with the dogma that child abuse is over-diagnosed. It does not matter for this purpose whether he is right or wrong. The expert with a scientific prejudice may perform a service to science by asking questions that challenge orthodoxy, but be unsuited to be an expert witness, a role that requires objectivity when giving answers.&#8221; </p>

A metaphyseal fracture is the result of a significant pulling or twisting force applied to a limb. In the absence of an accident that provides such a force this injury is a significant pointer to a non-accidental injury. The metaphyseal fracture is difficult to age.

Much of the paper is a discussion of histopathological changes, and a major criticism by these authors that previous publications on metaphyseal fractures did not include pathologists as coauthors [not true; Kleinman (2014) Classic metaphyseal lesions.

I believe Dr Ayoub probably had a biased viewpoint, having been quotes elsewhere saying &#8216;I do not believe that any of the fractures that I have seen have been the result of real physical child abuse&#8217;, and &#8216;almost 100% of cases I look at [in the 3-5 cases a week that he looks at for <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">defence</span> lawyers] have rickets&#8217;. One of the other authors (Dr Marvin Miller) is a proponent of an America version of &#8216;temporary brittle bone disease&#8217;. (You will be aware that Dr Colin Patterson who proposed such a diagnosis in this country was struck off the medical register). A search on Google indicates that Dr Ayoub, has opinions on a number of issues outside his own expertise, including vaccinations as part of a population control plot. It would also be appropriate for you to know that the Ayoub et al publication was criticised in an accompanying paper in the same issue of that journal [Wood BP (2014) Commentary on &#8220;A critical review of the classic metaphyseal lesion:traumatic or metabolic?&#8221; <span style="font-style:italic">AJR</span><span/><span style="font-weight:bold">202</span>:197-198] and by The Society for Paediatric Radiology Child Abuse </p>

If a child is falling over, then a force is being applied and this may cause fracture.

Leverage forces on the bone would be less due to the increased range of movement of the joint. In other words the joint would dislocate rather than the bone fracture. Conversely if hEDS is a connective tissue disorder of collagen, then there may be other factors at play that render the bone less tolerant of any flex. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in">The absence of explanation or account of an accidental causation for the fractured skull, given the extreme distress that would have been apparent to the carer, is highly suggestive on the medical evidence of a non-accidental injury. The second metaphyseal fracture of the left leg, which because of its twisting and pulling mechanism is usually caused nonaccidentally. The medical opinion is unanimous and point inextricably to only one conclusion, the combination of injuries and the absence of an accidental explanation I am satisfied excludes an accidental causation for either injury. I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that the injuries were inflicted on the same occasion and that this was a single violent incident or sequence of events. I say this because of the inability of the four adults responsible for the care of Y to recall any pattern of changed behaviour or changed mood apparent in the child during the preceding days and weeks, despite very careful investigation and questioning. This I find points towards a significant but isolated event. The fractures skull was caused by a significant blow or impact to the side of the head. I am satisfied that Y was very distressed and that his carer would be aware that something serious was wrong, but that his carer would not necessarily have known that Y&#8217;s skull had been fractured. I am also satisfied that on the balance of probability that in the same sequence of events that his carer forcefully pulled and twisted Y&#8217;s leg in such a way that the carer would be aware that this was causing Y to suffer pain and distress. After the immediate distress had subsided there would be no obvious symptoms apparent to the carer who may therefore not have been aware of the extent of Y&#8217;s injuries. Other carers who were not present would be unaware that Y had suffered significant injury and might have put his apparent grumpiness down to a number of different childish complaints, such as colic, teething or frustration at not having his yoghurt dessert.&#8221; </p>

Even on this unproven, unestablished basis, his clinical experience as an eminent consultant geneticist, was that this condition with or without Vitamin D deficiency did not result in fractures, especially in infants, without a history of inappropriate force or trauma. In terms, Dr Chapman agreed. </p>

The notion that Y at 9 months of age suffered one event of trauma when he sustained a skull fracture and a metaphyseal fracture of his left femur completely unwitnessed and/or without any adverse reaction from him, even if he did suffer from hEDS and/or Vitamin D deficiency, I consider to be very unlikely not to say fanciful. The idea that he suffered these injuries in two separate events, albeit close in time, unwitnessed and without any adverse reaction, I consider to be even more unlikely and fanciful. </p>

Even accepting Y might have sustained fractures with the application of a lesser degree of force as the mechanism, his bones were still broken. The notion that he suffered broken bones in an unwitnessed event or events and without any adverse reaction, I consider to be unlikely and fanciful. </p>
