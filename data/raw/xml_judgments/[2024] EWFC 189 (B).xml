At the time of his admission to Hospital M was nearly eight months old. He is now 2 years 4 months old. His parents are mother and father X. On investigation by clinicians M was found to have serious injuries. The injuries identified were as follows:- (a) chronic bilateral multifocal subdural collections (b) acute subdural blood over the left frontal lobe (c) parenchymal injury to the cortex of the left frontal lobe (d) multiple bilateral cortical vein ( bridging veins) thrombosis towards the vertex (e) a lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (f) blood over the surface of the tentorium (g) encephalopathy (h) asymmetric bilateral multiple retinal haemorrhages affecting multiple layers, some with white centres, more extensive in the left eye where all quadrants were affected. </span></p>

	<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-size:12pt">There has been a complicated procedural history with these proceedings. I believe it is helpful to refer to it at this stage. The fact-finding hearing was originally listed in April 2023 but at that time the Local Authority had concluded that the evidence and conclusions of the Part 25 instructed experts would not enable the Local Authority to establish threshold for the purposes of section 31 Children Act 1989. The Local authority therefore made an application, quite properly, to withdraw the proceedings which came before this court on the 17 April 2023.</span></p>

It was agreed that a draft written judgment would be circulated to the parties on the 20 April 2023</span></p>

Arrangements were made to reunite M with his parents. After the interim care order was made M had been looked after by a family member, but for the 6 months prior to the hearing M had been in local authority foster care.</span></p>

M's parents were interviewed and, as I understand it, that investigation is ongoing. From time to time the issue of disclosure of documents to the police was discussed during hearings in these proceedings but the formal application was only heard in June 2023.</span></p>

The exact sequence of events is not important. The police officer in charge of the criminal investigation had become aware of the Local Authority application to withdraw proceedings. That officer advised the Local authority&#8217;s legal advisors on or about the 20 April 2023 that the police had obtained two expert reports in the criminal investigation that had both concluded that the more likely cause of M&#8217;s injuries was non accidental.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It is fair to note that there had been a level of misunderstanding on the part of Social Services and the disclosure officer when they had been advised, at an earlier stage in the year, of a report from Dr Khandanpour supporting the conclusion of NAI. The police officer had indicated that the report could not be shared. Unfortunately, that instruction was understood by the personnel involved to mean that the report could not be shared internally within the Local Authority and their legal advisers. There are statements in the main bundle setting out what happened and when, but the existence and import of the report was not made available to the legal team until 20 April 2023. The Local Authority reviewed the evidence and advised parties and the court that it was likely they would be making another application, effectively to reinstate proceedings and then consider whether a fact-finding hearing was necessary.</span></p>

The Local Authority made a further application for permission to adduce the two reports obtained by the police into these proceedings. That application was successful albeit I made the decision that the two experts, Mr Simmons and Dr Khandanpour would not be accorded Part 25 status. That decision was not appealed. Further time was then taken by the various representatives to review the new reports which had been obtained from the police. The Part 25 experts instructed in the family proceedings were also provided with copies of the new reports.  After this review period the Local Authority position was that a fact finding was necessary as there was expert evidence to support a finding that M&#8217;s injuries were more likely than not inflicted and were not accidental.</span></p>

The mother was noted to be very proactive with M&#8217;s care.  She showed affection and emotional warmth to her son.

In A County Council v K D &amp; L [2005] EWHC 144(Fam) at paragraphs 39 and 44 Charles J observed &#8220;It is important to remember that the roles of the court and the expert are distinct and that it is the court that is in the position to weigh up the expert evidence against its findings on the other evidence. The judge must always remember that he or she is the person who makes the final decision&#8221;.  Charles J added at paragraph 49 to that judgment &#8220;In a case where the medical evidence is to the effect that the likely cause is non accidental and thus human agency, a court can reach a finding on the totality of the evidence either (a) that on the balance of probability an injury has a natural cause, or is not a non accidental injury, or (b) that a local authority has not established the existence of the threshold to the civil standard of proof. The other side of the coin is that in a case where the medical evidence is that there is nothing diagnostic of a non accidental injury or human agency and the clinical observations of the child, although consistent with non accidental injury or human agency, are the type asserted is more usually associated with accidental injury or infection, a court can reach a finding on the totality of the evidence that on the balance of probability there has been a non accidental injury or human agency as asserted and the threshold is established&#8221;.</span></p>

If the court cannot do this, it will have to consider which of the adults, with the care of the child within the relevant timeframe, should fall within the pool of perpetrators. The test for identification of a perpetrator/pool of perpetrators is threefold (1) is there a list of people who had the opportunity to cause the injury? (2) Can the court identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probabilities? (3) Only if it cannot identify the actual perpetrator on the balance of probabilities should it go on to ask in respect of those on the list, &#8220;&#8230;is there a likelihood or real possibility that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries&#8221;&#8212;Re B (Children: Uncertain Perpetrator) 2019 EWCA Civ. 575 paragraph 49.</span></p>

The accidental fall from the bed is unlikely to fully explain M&#8217;s injuries. It is possible that a fall from the bed caused some acute subdural bleeding in the context of established subdural collections caused by an earlier episode of trauma. In my opinion, in the absence of any underlying bleeding or metabolic disorder, M was likely subject to an episode of non-accidental injury. The presence of bilateral haemorrhages raises the suspicion of non-accidental injury.&#8221;</span></p>

Again, this is rare and when it occurs it is usually on the same side of the cyst although bilateral hygromas can occur. My impression of subtle expansion of the middle fossa disproportionate to the size of the cyst is supportive of cyst rupture. The growth in the arachnoid cyst suggests that it is accumulating CSF. Arachnoid cysts can grow over time due to trapping of CSF that can flow in but cannot flow out or due to the production of CSF by the cyst membrane.  Most arachnoid cysts do not grow but some do.&#8221;</span></p>

So for me the bed fall is fairly consistent with the acute subdural blood seen on the scan. So then the question comes down to what is the source of the chronic subdural collections. I must admit only on reviewing the December, the second scans or the later scans in December and looking back at the scans in May I added more weight to the possible importance of the arachnoid cysts [sic]... so I think it is possible that M had an arachnoid cyst that was actually, you know, initially quite large, but ruptured causing subdural hygromas on both sides of the head with a progressively increasing intra cranial pressure over the few days prior to his presentation and that caused the vomiting that he presented with prior to his index presentation. Then the bed fall on the day of presentation pushed him over the edge. So had chronically raised pressure at that point, presenting with encephalopathy, perhaps developed retinal haemorrhages because of that.&#8221;</span></p>

Possible recent trauma includes the bed fall or an episode of non-accidental injury. Possible causes of the earlier event that caused subdural collections include rupture of the arachnoid cyst from trivial trauma or an episode of non-accidental injury.

Further, he believed that the short fall from the bed could have caused the injury to the bridging veins if there were subdural hygromas present at the time of the fall.

In such a scenario a short fall as described could account for the unusual array of features seen on the scans. In consideration of the possibility of inflicted injury, I would say that this cannot be entirely excluded on the basis of the neuroradiology evidence but some of the features shown on the scans are not typically seen in the context of a shaking mechanism of injury in my experience brackets [i.e. the spot in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the tiny cortical injury to the left frontal lobe]. This case includes a number of unusual or anomalous features that are not typical of inflicted injury, in my view. On that basis I see no reason from the medical opinion perspective to favour inflicted injury as a cause for the findings over accidental injury but I leave it to the court to decide which explanation it prefers&#8221;.</span></p>

Certain aspects of the injuries, more particularly those identified by Dr Hogarth, presented challenging questions on causation. At the beginning of the medical investigations, it was not only the bilateral subdural collections that raised concern of potential non accidental injury, but the significant bilateral retinal haemorrhages. As Mr Jalloh said in his first report, the existence of the bilateral retinal haemorrhages raised the suspicion of non-accidental injury. Mr Markham's evidence as to the potential cause of the bilateral retinal haemorrhages was very important. In his report he had excluded birth trauma and the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation performed by the grandfather as possible causes for the retinal haemorrhages. He was clear in his opinion that the bilateral retinal haemorrhages were likely to have been secondary to the intracranial pressure changes.</span></p>

Although the existence of the arachnoid cyst had been known from the beginning, it was not until the December 2022 scan was considered by Mr Jalloh that the cyst assumed greater significance for him, particularly the fact that it had grown by so much between May and December 2022. It was only then that he considered an earlier possible rupture as being a credible reason for the subdural collections.  As can be seen from Dr Hogarth&#8217;s responses to the questions, also set out in some detail earlier in this judgment, he had explained that his doubts about some of the features of M&#8217;s injuries could now be explained by the chronic subdural collections having been caused by a rupture of the cyst and the other injuries by the fall from the bed. Dr Hogarth also set out in his response the very important point that some of the features of the injuries, as seen on the scans, were not typically seen in the context of a shaking mechanism injury, the spot in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the tiny cortical injury to the left frontal lobe [E463].</span></p>

If HSD was present and bleeding was more extensive, the bleeding might take longer to clear. It was unusual to suffer retinal haemorrhages as a result of HSD. Dr Saggar agreed that if M had HSD together with the arachnoid cyst, that could account for prolonged bleeding in the cranium, but it was not possible to be certain. The cause for excessive or longer bleeding in patients with HSD was because the connective tissue was fragile. The thin capillaries which join arteries to veins are more prone to rupturing.</span></p>

If M had landed on his shoulder it was likely his head would also hit the ground because he would not be able to hold it up.

Mr Jalloh said that he did not believe this to be a particularly important issue, a vein could have been pulled off with the accumulating collections. Asked about Dr Khandanpour&#8217;s view that the Palifka criteria had been met and that it was more likely to be a laceration rather than a venous injury Mr Jalloh responded, &#8220;a laceration is a cut in the brain. I would expect to see it on the MRI sequences and it is not there.&#8221; With respect to shaking type injuries Mr Jalloh stated that generally with these types of injury one would see diffusion restriction i.e. swelling on the brain on both sides of the brain. Mr Jalloh said that when there is just one spot it becomes difficult to reconcile it with a shaking injury. In his opinion it made it much less indicative of a shaking type injury where the abnormal force used in the shaking mechanism leads to bleeding in multiple areas. In Mr Jalloh's opinion, the presence of the small area of diffusion restriction did not assist to distinguish between the two hypotheses.</span></p>

He had seen it happen with children of 13 and 14 years of age. When trying to date the rupture Mr Jalloh thought that the vomiting provided some evidence of a sign of increased intracranial pressure together with some changes in M&#8217;s behaviour, for example, the development of the eye squint and the white seen above the iris in his eye. In his opinion these changes would not necessarily have been noticed by the parents except for the vomiting. In his opinion the vomiting was a much earlier sign of raised intracranial pressure than papilledema.</span></p>

Mr Markham explained that there was no way of testing whether the chronic collections weakened the eyes prior to the fall and thus caused the rational haemorrhages seen on the 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">th</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> and 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">th</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> May 2022. It was not possible to confirm when they had actually occurred. However, Mr Markham maintained his opinion that a low level fall could have caused the retinal haemorrhages if there was raised intracranial pressure. The raised inter intracranial pressure squeezed the optic nerve and blocked ectoplasmic flow. The build-up caused the nerve to swell. Mr Markham explained that it had been the prevalent theory in ophthalmological circles for some time that retinal haemorrhages were thought to be independent of other events, but Mr Markham said that current thinking from some experts now cast doubt on that. Mr Markham denied that his view departed from what was the recognised orthodox view. He said that a number of his colleagues agreed with his view and, Mr Markham said, he did not believe that his position was a minority position.</span></p>

Dr Khandanpour agreed that this was an acceptable opinion as there was no conspicuous haemorrhage apart from the changes around the tentorium. In his opinion there was no complete answer, but the MRI was more sensitive; Dr Khandanpour was happy to accept Dr Hogarth's revised position, saying that it was possible.  Dr Khandanpour was also happy to accept that there was an arachnoid cyst present in May 2022, something which he had previously discounted. Where he differed from Dr Hogarth was that he believed that there was a lesion in the brain tissue in the left fossa lobe and a lesion in the splenium. He said that this was evidenced in the images. Dr Khandanpour suggested that it was probably a laceration to the brain compatible with AHT. Dr Khandanpour believed that the shape over the surface of the cortex as seen on the T2 sequence speaks for itself, as he put it. It was consistent, he said, radiologically, with AHT. </span></p>

He is of course a vastly experienced practitioner, and he told us of his extensive clinical experience at court. With respect to the identified ANKRD26 VUS, Dr Saggar concluded that there was not enough known about the VUS to consider it to be responsible for the cerebral and retinal bleeding. Dr Saggar confirmed his opinion that M had 50% chance of inheriting HSD [formerly EDS III] from his mother who in his opinion had the condition. In his report and at court Dr Saggar confirmed that there was no gene yet identified for this condition, so diagnosis had to be made on a clinical basis. Doctor Saggar had not found any clinical evidence that M had HSD but said that it could not be excluded as a possibility because diagnosis in very young children was difficult. </span></p>

As set out earlier in this judgment Dr Hogarth explained why, in his opinion, the small spot of acute blood seen over the left frontal lobe was not typical for traumatic injury. It was not situated in an area near a bony surface of the skull which one would expect with traumatic injury. He considered that this tiny area of tissue damage seen on the same side of the brain as the cyst could be a tiny venous infarct. Doctor Hogarth disagreed with Dr Khandanpour that it was a parenchymal brain laceration [PBL]. In support of his view Dr Hogarth pointed to the fact that there were no blood products showing on or in that tissue. If it had been PBL Dr Hogarth said that he would have expected to see far more serious injury. In his clinical experience when he had encountered PBL the injuries were life threatening which was not the case here.</span></p>

CB&#8217;s letter from January 2023 does not mention what AD believed was said during that appointment.  The notes set out the examination and the findings as one would expect. If it is being asserted by the Local Authority that these appointments were all part of an elaborate cover up story on the part of the parents, or one of them, to obtain a satisfactory explanation for the vomiting, knowing that they had caused injury to M, I find that to be, frankly, ridiculous. I reject that assertion; there is no evidence to support it, and in my judgment would involve a level of sophistication and guile that   these parents do not possess.</span></p>

This complete absence of other features associated with shaking type injuries is, in my judgment, an important part of the overall evidential picture.

Mr Simmons and Mr Markham both very properly made concessions when necessary. I found them both to be sensible and straightforward witnesses. The Local Authority placed great weight on the fact that there is little peer reviewed research supporting Mr Markham 's view. He very fairly accepted that in his evidence. Mr Simmons&#8217; participation in various working parties of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists does not assist this court very much in assessing the evidence. The Mayeda paper demonstrated the lack of empirical evidence in respect of the ophthalmological consequences of an arachnoid cyst rupture. Of the 30 children examined only three had retinal haemorrhages and none were comparable with those seen in M. Only 15 of the children had swelling of the optic nerve characteristic of raised intracranial pressure. The Hagan paper identified retinal haemorrhages associated with rupture of an arachnoid cyst but the haemorrhages were flame shaped, not found in M's case. It must be accepted that the numbers involved in the studies were very small.</span></p>

I have dealt with the reasons earlier in this judgment. At that time the Local Authority filed a statement explaining their error, and the legal team did the same. As I understand it, further staff training was to be implemented to ensure such problems did not occur again. It is quite extraordinary that the system in place at the time did not pick up on the problem earlier, but I do not consider it appropriate to comment further than that. The delay caused by the situation was about 7 months, which is very regrettable. The only saving grace is that M has been back in his parents&#8217; care during that time. </span></p>
