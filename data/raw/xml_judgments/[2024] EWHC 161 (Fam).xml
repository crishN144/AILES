The question for me is whether, when T is aged 18, the judgment should be published naming the parties.  A separate question is whether on publication in an unanonymised form, there would be some protection to T (and his older sister S, now aged 18) if I were to remove their names from the judgment.</p>

In that case the Court of Appeal upheld Lieven J&#8217;s order allowing publication of the parties&#8217; names but not of the child&#8217;s and also gave guidance on publication of otherwise private children cases.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Scotland pointed out that<span style="font-style:italic"> Griffiths v Tickle</span> was a fact-specific decision.  Part of the reason for the decision made by the Court of Appeal was that Mr Griffiths had abused and raped his wife during the marriage and told lies.  It was in the public interest for the public to know what the MPs were doing in private whilst public figures.  In contradistinction, neither the mother nor the father were public figures and there were no reasons why the public should know the identity of the parents or the children.   The judgment should be published only in a fully anonymised version.  </p>

The courts findings had never been shared with the children and it was likely that they had been given a misleading impression of these.</p>

The general rule is that proceedings are held in public and what is said, including the names of the parties and witnesses, can be observed and reported. In a case which involves the &#8220;determination&#8221; of criminal liability or civil rights and obligations, Article 6 confers on each party to litigation the right to a public hearing and a public judgment&#8221;.</p>

This necessitates what Lord Steyn in Re S, para [17], called "an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case". There are, typically, a number of competing interests engaged, protected by Articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention. I incorporate in this judgment, without further elaboration or quotation, the analyses which I set out in Re B (A Child) (Disclosure) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/411" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 411 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 411 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 142" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 142</ref>, at para [93], and in Re Webster; Norfolk County Council v Webster and Others [2006] EWHC 2733 (fam) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 1146" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 1146</ref>, at para [80]. As Lord Steyn pointed out in Re S, para [25], it is "necessary to measure the nature of the impact &#8230; on the child" of what is in prospect. Indeed, the interests of the child, although not paramount, must be a primary consideration, that is, they must be considered first though they can, of course, be outweighed by the cumulative effect of other considerations: ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/4" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 4</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 2 AC 166" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 2 AC 166</ref>, para [33].&#8221;</p>

Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.

Needlessly protracted litigation has potentially damaging consequences not only for parents, but on children and their best interests.

The headmaster of the young people&#8217;s school was certainly aware of the poor relationship between the mother and the father.  The risk of wider identification, for example, by future employers and future social contacts, is far more remote and is less likely where T and S are not named.</p>
