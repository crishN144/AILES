With the dedication of his parents and the support of his local disability services, DE has prospered and achieved far beyond what may have been expected given his level of disability. Prior to 2009, not only had he achieved a modest measure of autonomy in his day to day life, but he had a long standing and loving relationship with a woman, PQ, who is also learning disabled. </p>

The consequences were profound for both families; legitimate concerns that DE may not have capacity to consent to sexual relations meant that protective measures had to be put in place to ensure that DE and PQ were not alone and DE became supervised at all times. DE was clear that he did not want any more children. His relationship nearly broke under the strain but remarkably it has weathered the storm </p>

DE was tested using the Ammons Quick test of IQ by Dr. David Milnes, the independent Consultant in psychiatry of learning disabilities instructed to provide an opinion in this matter.  This test suggested that DE has an IQ of 40. People with this level of IQ have an adult mental age of between 6 and 9 years, which gives an indication of the magnitude of DE&#8217;s difficulties. In real terms it means that DE could not live on his own, he cannot use money, he has limited speech and is dependant on his parents to provide him with significant support both practical and emotional. The family have taken advantage of all the excellent services available to the learning disabled in their area with the result that DE has  had an interesting and varied life with plenty of social contacts out side the family and as much independence as is possible. </p>

They have worked tirelessly to give him the best possible quality of life and in particular to ensure that he has as much independence and autonomy as can possibly be achieved. Although it took 15 years of patient work and support to get to that stage, by 2009 when PQ became pregnant, DE had learnt to travel to the day centre on the bus on his own (albeit with a telephone call to remind him to set off and a support worker knowing which bus to look out for when he arrived). In addition DE was able to walk through town to a leisure centre where he went to the gym with a friend and also to go to the local shops from his day centre without support. DE is a keen swimmer, going to training sessions for those without disabilities as well as the club at which his father coaches.  He also loves football. </p>

DE&#8217;s social worker, MB (who specialises in supporting disabled adults), told the court how very unusual it is to see such an enduring relationship between two significantly learning disabled people, it is she said remarkable and very <span style="font-style:italic">precious</span> and should be valued and protected in their interests. </p>

PQ&#8217;s learning disabilities, although not as severe as DE&#8217;s, nevertheless meant that she was unable to look after her baby herself and the local authority issued care proceedings in relation to XY. These were resolved by agreement by the making of a Special Guardianship Order in favour of XY&#8217;s maternal grandmother at whose home XY and PQ both live. PQ is unable to take XY out unaccompanied, requiring the assistance of a support worker. In this way she is able to go out and about with XY including to the social club she attends.  </p>

I think it likely that DE&#8217;s parents did not appreciate that the relationship was fully sexual. FG and JK undoubtedly had some reservations about the relationship; in court they were tactful and reluctant to articulate precisely what it was that made them less than happy about PQ. Reading between the lines I suspect that they felt that PQ was drawing DE into a relationship the nature of which he could not fully understand; indeed shortly after XY was born, when feelings were running very high, they suggested that DE had been sexually exploited by PQ.  JK undoubtedly said some intemperate things at what was a very difficult time and the atmosphere, in what was usually a relaxed, happy household largely geared round ensuring DE&#8217;s health, happiness and the maximising of his independence, became discordant and strained. </p>

In addition to this fear it had had to be explained to PQ that if she and DE had sexual intercourse she would be committing a criminal offence. It is hardly surprising that, frightened and with a limited ability wholly to understand what was happening, PQ completely withdrew from DE.

He said to Dr Milnes about a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">child I&#8217;ve got one&#8217;</span> that, Dr Milnes says, is a common and valid reason men give for not wanting another child. DE associates the time of XY&#8217;s birth as a period of considerable distress and upset for all his family. DE Dr Milnes said personally suffered significant psychological distress. Mr Moon suggested to Dr Milnes that having been through it once, it would not be upsetting a second time. Dr Milnes disagreed believing that it may be worse for DE a second time. </p>

He has been broadly been in favour of the idea although in his most recent session with CH and ZZ on 23 July 2013 and with Dr Milnes, he expressed a view that he would prefer to use condoms.  Neither CH nor Dr Milnes think these recent meetings are wholly to be relied upon. On 23 July, DE had just learnt that a very close friend had died and was deeply distressed, in addition, he had just had a session in which the issue of pain immediately following a vasectomy was discussed with DE. CH thought that this may have been the influencing factor. Dr Milnes&#8217; final view is that if it is explained to DE that a vasectomy is foolproof in relation to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">no more babies</span>&#8221;, but that he might conceive with a condom <span style="font-style:italic">he would go for the vasectomy. </span></p>

DE was very upset when there was a three or four month hiatus in their relationship, I am satisfied that if the relationship foundered due to another pregnancy it would be a real and enduring loss to DE. </p>

JK explained that she would not, for example, feel able to encourage DE to start travelling on the bus alone. The bus she explained goes past PQ&#8217;s home and she would be worried that DE would get off and they may have unprotected sex or, given the high incidence of pregnancies with condoms, she may in any event become pregnant. If DE had a vasectomy she would feel able to encourage him to use the bus.  </p>

It is no answer, as was suggested by Mr Moon, to say that because DE has not strained against the restrictions which have dramatically curtailed his independence, then it is not a significant feature. DE&#8217;s independence was hard won and no one could fail to admire the efforts that JK and the workers are presently making to reintroduce DE to walking a 10 minute route with a friend without a support worker. Such advances take not weeks but months or, in the case of the bus, years to achieve and much of that progress has been lost. All those who care for DE (in every sense of the word), want to see his previous independence restored so that he can once again go to meet a friend for coffee or stroll in town with his friends. </p>

He has, not surprisingly, become &#8220;fed up&#8221; although given his amenable personality and desire to please, he has gone when asked to do so. Work will have to continue with DE in any event, but this will be at a low level reminding him periodically of the importance of using condoms as protection against STDs and STIs. Such work is different from expecting him to embark on further training in the use of condoms involving as it will practical work which he finds embarrassing. This is a small matter in the general scheme of things but is part of the overall picture which overwhelmingly points to re-establishing as normal a life as possible as soon as possible for DE. </p>

In some cases, in some situations, they may carry much, even, on occasions, preponderant, weight. In other cases, in other situations, and even where the circumstances may have some superficial similarity, they may carry very little weight. One cannot, as it were, attribute any particular a priori weight or importance to P's wishes and feelings; it all depends, it must depend, upon the individual circumstances of the particular case. And even if one is dealing with a particular individual, the weight to be attached to their wishes and feelings must depend upon the particular context; in relation to one topic P's wishes and feelings may carry great weight whilst at the same time carrying much less weight in relation to another topic. Just as the test of incapacity under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> is, as under the common law, 'issue specific', so in a similar way the weight to be attached to P's wishes and feelings will likewise be issue specific. </span></p>

DE is very close to his parents; he loves and relies upon them. If they are upset he is upset. The court can take into account the benefits to FG and JK of DE having a vasectomy if it is a factor DE would consider if he had capacity.

They know their anxiety has an impact upon DE, I am sure they do their best to protect DE from it but they are only human  and inevitably DE is acutely aware of their distress; this has had a significant impact upon his own emotional comfort and well being.
