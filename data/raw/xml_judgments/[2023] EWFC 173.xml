	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The original threshold is to be found in the bundle at A9.  On the portal I was provided helpfully with a colour coded version of that document, which set out those matters which were agreed, and incorporated the mother's proposal in relation to a finding of failure to protect.  The threshold of course relates back to events on 11 November 2022, when the Local Authority commenced proceedings.  It is right to say that the instigating factor was information provided by A on 11 October 2022 within the school environment.  It is equally fair to say that the threshold encompasses issues going beyond the matters which she had discussed.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first element of dispute is set out in paragraph 5.  Father filed one statement in these proceedings in which he denied any form of sexual abuse by him towards A.  He ceased having any contact with the younger children on 4 November 2022, and he has not provided instructions or attended hearings for a considerable period, measured in months.  That continues to be the position today.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_16">
	  <num>16.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The allegations against him are a pattern of sexual abuse of A from the time when she was 7 years old, up until 10 October 2022.  He has been arrested by the Police in relation to allegations of rape and child cruelty, and a charging decision is awaited from the CPS, now scheduled to be next week.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_17">
	  <num>17.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second area the Local Authority seek to rely upon is contingent upon the findings against Father, in other words, it is said that she had independently failed to protect A from the harm she suffered at the hands of Father.  It is encapsulated in paragraph 7C, where it is asserted by the Local Authority that the mother showed inadequate insight into risk of sexual harm to the children and prioritised her relationship with Father over the children.</p>
	  </content>
	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_18">
	  <num>18.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her response the mother accepts she ought to have been aware that Father posed a potential sexual risk more generally and failed to take reasonable steps to protect A.  That relates to two separate occasions when she had been confronted with information regarding separate allegations against him.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_19">
	  <num>19.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, the scope of the dispute is not about whether there was a failure to protect, it is not about whether there were risks which the mother should have avoided, it is whether the mother in the form of paragraphs 7D and E was specifically told in clear terms that A was being sexually abused; and, knowing that she was being sexually abused, not only did she do nothing to protect her, but actively discouraged her from giving that information to people who could help.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_20">
	  <num>20.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These allegations derive essentially from information provided by A within the school environment on 11 October 2022.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_21">
	  <num>21.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is acceptance within paragraphs 8 to 12 of domestic abuse and alcohol abuse within the parents' relationship.  There is specific reference to a pattern of behaviour which speaks to the deplorable circumstances which the children were required to live.  Father is an alcoholic, and alcohol abuse has been a feature in his behaviour towards the children; there is no issue about that.  In paragraph 10, the mother accepts that she has repeatedly downplayed the issues in the home, with domestic abuse and Father's alcohol use, to professionals, and has not taken appropriate steps to safeguard the children, in permitting Father to remain in the home, and in not reporting his behaviour to professionals.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_22">
	  <num>22.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That relates directly to her role as a protective factor within the home environment to these children.  The only difference is that the Local Authority seek to establish two particular factual allegations which suggest not only did she fail but she did so in the knowledge that there were specific issues of sexual abuse occurring.</p>

Clearly, the necessity or otherwise of the investigation will always be a key issue, particularly in current circumstances. Every fact-finding hearing must produce something of importance for the welfare decision. But the shorthand of necessity does not translate into an obligation to conclude every case as quickly as possible, regardless of other factors, and that is clearly not the intention of the administrative guidance. There will be cases in which the welfare outcome for the child is not confined to the resulting order. Not infrequently, a finding in relation to one child will have implications for the welfare of other children.  Sometimes, findings that cross the threshold at a minimum level will not reflect the reality. The court's broad obligation is to deal with the case justly, having regard to the welfare issues involved. McFarlane J put it well in paragraph 21 of <span style="font-style:italic">Oxfordshire</span> when he identified the question as being whether, on the individual facts of each case, it is "right and necessary" to conduct a fact-finding exercise.&#8221;</p>

When considering the potential evidential result of a fact-finding hearing it may sometimes be appropriate for the judge to have regard to the apparent quality of the evidence. It will never be appropriate, however, to carry out a detailed evaluation, not least because the court can only make findings on the totality of the evidence and at the case management stage not all of the evidence will have been filed. Anything akin to a mini-trial of the allegations would therefore be wrong in principle and wasteful of time and resources. Although each decision will depend upon the circumstances of the case, the apparent quality of the evidence is accordingly unlikely to be a powerful factor in the overall decision unless it is clear without the need for detailed assessment that the evidence appears to be particularly strong or particularly weak.&#8221;</p>

It often relates to a mother who has covered up for a partner who has physically or sexually abused her child or, one who has failed to get medical help for her child in order to protect a partner, sometimes with tragic results. It is also a finding made in cases where continuing to live with a person (often in a toxic atmosphere, frequently marked with domestic violence) is having a serious and obvious deleterious effect on the children in the household. The harm, emotional rather than physical, can be equally significant and damaging to a child.</p>

The positive assessments speak to that.  In the event that they were clear that the allegations had not been resolved against Father nor had he been acquitted of those allegations and that they remained live, real allegations which the Court had not been required to resolve within these proceedings then I would anticipate they would be able to understand that, and understand the need to work with that position, and that view would no doubt be subject to the potential impact of criminal proceedings being issued, and a trial in the future too.</p>

The counterpoint to that is that Ms Ross accepts that a fair trial may well be capable of being dealt with in future.  The court has what is likely to be the best account of the allegations, namely the ABE interview of A.  That will not disappear.  It has the written accounts of the teaching staff, and the material which can no doubt be assembled after the proceedings if they end today regarding the process.

The court's broad obligation is to deal with the case justly, having regard to the welfare issues involved.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reality is that the patterns of parenting go back well beyond and are far broader than the allegations which emerged on 11 October 2022.  The reality is that issues in this case date back to the period from 2014 and particularly 2018.  During the latter period the Local Authority were extensively involved, but actions were not then taken which provided the necessary safeguarding for A and the children.</p>

Fact finding will of course place the parties under additional stress, but that, I am afraid, would be a small price to pay if the allegations were otherwise necessary to determine or just to resolve.</p>

There are gaps in the evidence, but they may be capable of being filled without undue delay.  Whether they are remains to be seen, but I would not be too sceptical about the ability to regularise the evidential position.  It is not submitted that there is any reason to think a fair trial may not be possible in the future if the issue emerges.</p>

The counterpoint to that is the best accounts of the witnesses are likely to be the detailed statements already provided.</p>

There is a possibility that there will be criminal charges and proceedings in which these allegations will be explored fully.  That may well result in A being subject to pre-recorded cross-examination in relation to the allegations.  There is of course no guarantee, but it is a real prospect at this stage.</p>

Fundamentally, the issues which would be the subject of any future assessment are understood and are clear.  Furthermore, I regard the evidence in relation to that as weak and take that into account in the evaluation of whether that issue, the failure to protect, should be litigated or not.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The determination of these issues will make no difference to the permanence provisions of the care plan nor the type of order.  There will be advantages in determining the matter now, certainly in terms of witnesses being known and being contactable, possibly to a small extent memory, albeit that may already have diminished significantly.  It is not inevitable that the issues in relation to sexual harm will need to be determined in the future, given the multiple issues in the case, but there is a real prospect that they may need to be considered, and there would be a benefit in being able to have a determination of that now rather than later.</p>

Whilst it may help the paternal grandparents to know, alongside other family members, whether the Family Court has made a determination on the balance of probabilities, that will not in my judgment impact their ability to prioritise the safety and care of the children, given the issue will be left undetermined.</p>

It is important that they are able to adapt to the arrangements for contact, and whilst there are undoubtedly some benefits to the court grappling with those issues at this stage, on balance I do not regard the failure to do so as adversely impacting the welfare of any of these three children. </p>
