The only asset of any significance was the former matrimonial home in which W lived with the two school-aged children of the family.  The property was low value with an outstanding mortgage of &#163;90,000 and an equity of a little over &#163;37,000.</p>

In the circumstances of the very limited assets in the case and the needs of the children this order was eminently predictable.</p>

As a result, it has taken some 18 months before this final disposal.  It was his second successful appeal in front of the judge that led her to direct that the matter be heard before a judge of the High Court.</p>

He says that the district judge should never have made an order which left H on the mortgage in circumstances when W never had the capacity to secure his release.  He complains strongly that the court never obtained a mortgage capacity report which would have shown, he says, W&#8217;s inability to obtain the release.</p>

The order was made and H&#8217;s appeal against it was unsuccessful.  I would go no further than to say that it appears unwise for the district judge to have allowed such a very short time frame for W to obtain the release.  Whether any time frame was appropriate is debatable.</p>
