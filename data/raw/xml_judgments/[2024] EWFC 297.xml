The husband was born in 1974, so is about to turn 50. The wife was born in 1981, so is currently 43. They began to cohabit in 2006 and married in 2007. They have 2 children, A, born in 2011, and so nearly 13, and B born in 2014, so now aged 10. The parties separated in August 2022, and their divorce application was issued later that year. This was therefore a 16 year marital relationship. </span></p>

Save for a small amount of value created by the husband before the parties began to cohabit, it is accepted that the balance of the substantial value of his back-catalogue of work is a matrimonial asset, and that in broad terms, subject to questions of liquidity, taxation and valuation, it should be shared broadly equally between the parties. Already the company which holds the bulk of the parties&#8217; assets is owned as to 51% by the husband and 49% by the wife. That this application had ended up in a trial with significant costs expenditure on both sides is because the parties sadly have been unable to agree either upon the safe value to attribute to the catalogue or how any sharing of its value should be implemented.</span></p>

I will deal with these later. The parties&#8217; other assets can be briefly identified. The wife continues to live at the former family home in North London ("the Family Home"), valued at &#163;3.73m, but subject to a mortgage of &#163;2.314m, with the children of the family when they are with her. The parties also own 3 flats (Flats 1-3) in the same property in North London, but with a combined equity of just under &#163;220,000. Aside from these properties the husband has various investments, including in a not yet delivered sports car, and outstanding loans coming to a total of just over &#163;1m, and wife has an ISA and two cars, together with a share in one of the loans coming to just over &#163;180,000. The joint loan (total outstanding value &#163;127,000) may never in fact be repaid. Together, the parties&#8217; have pensions with a combined value of just over &#163;740,000. It can therefore be seen that it is the value of the husband&#8217;s interests in the music business which forms the principal area of dispute and interest in the case.</span></p>

A thorough investigation into these differences can be extremely expensive and of doubtful utility". I understand, of course, that the application of the sharing principle can be said to raise powerful forces in support of detailed accounting. Why, a party might ask, should my "share" be fixed by reference other than to the real values of the assets? However, this is to misinterpret the exercise in which the court is engaged. The court is engaged in a broad analysis in the application of its jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes Act, not a detailed accounting exercise. As Lord Nicholls said, detailed accounting is expensive, often of doubtful utility and, certainly in respect of business valuations, will often result in divergent opinions each of which may be based on sound reasoning. The purpose of valuations, when required, is to assist the court in testing the fairness of the proposed outcome. It is not to ensure mathematical/accounting accuracy, which is invariably no more than a chimera. Further, to seek to construct the whole edifice of an award on a business valuation which is no more than a broad, or even very broad, guide is to risk creating an edifice which is unsound and hence likely to be unfair. In my experience, valuations of shares in private companies are among the most fragile valuations which can be obtained."</span></p>

The reasons for this are many. In the first place there is likely to be no obvious market for a private company. Second, even where valuers use the same method of valuation they are likely to produce widely differing results. Third, the profitability of private companies may be volatile, such that a snap shot valuation at a particular date may give an unfair picture. Fourth, the difference in quality between a value attributed to a private company on the basis of opinion evidence and a sum in hard cash is obvious. Fifth, the acid test of any valuation is exposure to the real market, which is simply not possible in the case of a private company where no one suggests that it should be sold.

As referred to by both King LJ and Lewison LJ, the broad choices are (i) "fix" a value; (ii) order the asset to be sold; and (iii) divide the asset in specie: at [134] and [195]. However, to repeat, even when the court is able to fix a value this does not mean that that value has the same weight as the value of other assets such as, say, the matrimonial home. The court has to assess the weight which can be placed on the value even when using a fixed value for the purposes of determining what award to make. This applies both to the amount and to the structure of the award, issues which are interconnected, so that the overall allocation of the parties' assets by application of the sharing principle also effects a fair balance of risk and illiquidity between the parties. Again, I emphasise, this is not to mandate a particular structure but to draw attention to the need to address this issue when the court is deciding how to exercise its discretionary powers so as to achieve an outcome that is fair to both parties. I would also add that the assessment of the weight which can be placed on a valuation is not a mathematical exercise but a broad evaluative exercise to be undertaken by the judge.</span></p>

This studio is essentially loss-making, but allows the husband to continue to produce the works which will in due course become part of the valuable catalogue. Prior to an attempt to sell the rights to the catalogue to the well-known brand &#8216;ABC&#8217; in 2020/1, the studio&#8217;s losses were offset within the company by the income generated from the catalogue. However, in order to enable the proposed sale to take place, these two parts of the husband&#8217;s operation were separated out into different companies by April 2021. </span></p>

This had very negative tax consequences for the parties, and rendered the earlier costly restructuring of the company unnecessary. Further, an offered earn-out which might have brought the value of the sale up by a significant amount was proposed on terms that required the catalogue to achieve 10% compound growth for each of the five years following the sale. The husband tells me, that he did not believe that this was in any way achievable.

To achieve these figures he has applied the recognised Discounted Cash Flow (&#8216;DCF&#8217;) methodology, taking a 9% Weighted Average Cost of Capital (&#8216;WACC&#8217;) rate, although for illustration he has shown that a half point variation in the rate in either direction might have affected overall valuation by more or less 5%.

However, given that, at least in part, I am satisfied that the husband&#8217;s rejection of the ABC offer was down to his dissatisfaction with the price eventually available, and given the higher value of the XYZ offer (which as a comparable would have to have been for as much as &#163;L, if on an asset sale basis, to have produced as much for the parties, and which the husband chose not to pursue), I am not persuaded that the ABC offer is a reliable indicator of current value. It was also revealed in his statement that the husband&#8217;s solicitor was prepared to indicate in April 2023 on the parties&#8217; behalf that he considered the sum offered by XYZ a reasonable point at which they might have been interested in negotiating with XYZ, before that company made their offer.

Thus triangulated, I am satisfied that, whilst the SJE&#8217;s valuation is unlikely to be a completely accurate indicator of the current true value of the IP rights in this case, it is likely to be reasonably close to that figure, and is, therefore, the safest available figure on which to proceed.

Consequently, in arriving at a value I will assume tax rates and management commission on the basis that there will be such a sale.  In terms of commission, this means an effective rate of 10%, rather than the 20% that would be payable on an ongoing basis in the absence of a sale.</span></p>

This may bite if the husband is engaged in a similar trade within 2 years of his receipt of his distributions, and if one of the main purposes of the winding up is the avoidance or reduction of a charge to income tax. </span></p>

The matter is not straightforward, however, as the husband has signed a contract with Record Company 1 on 21 June 2022. Under this arrangement, it has paid him a sum for which advance he has assigned the copyright of all of his compositions during the term of the agreement, likely to be for 4 years to June 2026, with the advance being repaid from the income stream generated by the work. It is therefore clearly contractually impossible for the husband to cease working in the trade at least until the expiry of the agreement, after which the company will not be able to recoup any unreturned balance. Thereafter, the husband might be said to have a &#8216;choice&#8217; as to whether to rest and so avoid the risk of the additional tax, but not before.</span></p>

It is something to which presumably he and his advisors had given some thought at the time that the contract was signed in 2022, as by then the first wave of negotiations with ABC had already passed and the reorganisation of the assets into separate companies had already been undertaken. Clearly too, if a sale were avoided, the risk of the tax could be deferred until such time as the husband could of his own choosing take a break from his career. It would thus be wrong to assume in any circumstances that he would have to pay at the dividend rate, and so to reduce the wife&#8217;s receipt by half of the additional tax automatically, in anticipation that the liability would fall in.   </span></p>
