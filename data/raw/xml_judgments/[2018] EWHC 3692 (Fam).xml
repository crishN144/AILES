In light of the contents of Ms Kisser&#8217;s further representations, I acceded to her request that I reconsider the decision articulated in the draft judgment, namely allowing the husband&#8217;s appeal to the extent of varying the lump sum order made by the learned Judge.  In consequence, I invited further written submissions from Ms Campbell in response to Ms Kisser&#8217;s invitation, and written submissions from Ms Kisser in reply.  Given the potential impact on the conclusions set out in my draft judgment of Ms Kisser making good her contention that there was significant omission in the figures underpinning those conclusions, I also made provision for a further short hearing should either party wish to supplement their respective written submissions.  The parties took advantage of that listing. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The parties have three children, aged 13, 10 and 6.  The children share their time more or less equally between the parents, pursuant to an order made in proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  The learned Judge considered that there was no reason, in respect of the children, to distinguish between the respective care responsibilities of the parents.  This conclusion later featured prominently in his assessment of the parties&#8217; respective housing needs.  At the conclusion of the final hearing the learned Judge was informed that the CMS had confirmed the maximum assessment of &#163;11,930.88 per annum. The children are all educated privately and the learned Judge found that, given the disparity of income as between the husband and wife, there was no reason why the school fees of approximately &#163;66,000 per year should not be paid by the husband, as should the costs of the nanny of &#163;42,300 per annum.  In addition, the learned Judge made a top-up maintenance order of &#163;24,000 per annum.  These figures that are to be borne by the husband have featured prominently in the husband&#8217;s argument that the judge was wrong in this case to depart from equality to the extent that he did in this case. </p>

The husband contended that his partnership status would change on or around his 55<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday and that, thereafter, his income would not be as high.  This contention was grounded in the husband&#8217;s evidence that partners at his US law firm do not generally continue to work for that firm after the age of 55, that there are only three partners at the London office aged 55 or over and that, once retired from his US law firm, the husband will have a &#8216;run off&#8217; period where his earnings will be significantly reduced.  The learned judge proceeded on the basis that, going forward, the husband would have available to him a minimum income figure of &#163;605,000 per annum net.   </p>

Ms Kisser tells this court that the husband contended at the final hearing that the wife&#8217;s restricted stock units that had not yet vested should be treated as income rather than capital, which contention the learned Judge accepted.  Whilst, ultimately Ms Campbell did not demur strongly in respect of that assertion at the appeal hearing, in her additional written submissions Ms Campbell sought to argue that the restricted stock units were a resource available to the wife over the timescale in which it was envisaged she would be buying a new home.  It is however clear, as Ms Campbell acknowledges in her additional written submissions, that counsel for the husband at the final hearing indeed conceded that the unvested restricted stock units should be treated as future income rather than capital. The learned Judge found that </p>

Whilst in her additional written submissions Ms Campbell appeared suggest that this court should treat the wife&#8217;s income as some &#163;200,000 per annum net, this court proceeds on the basis of the learned Judge&#8217;s findings as to income, Ms Campbell having indicated to Roberts J at the permission stage that she did not seek to go behind those findings.  The learned Judge expressed himself to have taken a minimum income figure for both parties &#8220;because this is a needs case and I am anxious to secure that any arrangement I come to is a robust resolution.&#8221; </p>

From that agreed Schedule can be derived the following summary of the matrimonial assets, as so characterised at the commencement of the hearing, bearing in mind, once again, that the husband contended during the course of the final hearing that the wife&#8217;s unvested restricted stock units of &#163;80,600 should be treated as income rather than capital and the learned Judge accepted that contention: </p>

It is further clear from the papers that these two adults continue to bicker and squabble over aspects of their financial arrangements and arrangements in respect of their children.  I hope that it is not lost on either party that the alarming amounts of money that they have now spent on their ongoing internecine financial warfare is money that will not now be available for the comfort and security of themselves or their three precious children. </p>

The learned Judge notes in his judgment that the wife wished to retain this property, arguing that retaining the Foreign Property A was important to ensure that her strong connection with the country in which that property is situated, and the connection of the children to that country, was maintained.  In contradistinction to this position, the learned Judge also noted that, in circumstances where the evidence before the court suggested that the wife would have a greater mortgage capacity in this jurisdiction were Foreign Property A to be sold, the husband had argued that the sale of Foreign Property A should be ordered and the proceeds divided equally between the parties. </p>

There was a dispute between the parties as to whether the property constituted a matrimonial asset.  The learned Judge noted that the property was held in the sole name of the husband, that the husband acquired it prior to the parties&#8217; relationship commencing, that it was a property in which the husband&#8217;s mother had resided for some 16 or 17 years and that there was no intention that the property be sold.  Within this context, the learned Judge concluded that, whilst on a sharing basis there was a case for treating only, say, 25% of the value of the property as a matrimonial asset, in circumstances where the case was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">overwhelmingly one of need</span>&#8221;, it was not necessary to undertake a detailed analysis of the extent to which Foreign Property B should be regarded as a matrimonial asset or not. </p>

It is noted, but that is part of his engagement with his company currently.&#8221;  The learned Judge further noted that the husband was in the process of drawing down further funds from his partnership loan facility in the sum of &#163;88,000 to enable him to repay some of his immediate liabilities.  </p>

The learned Judge&#8217;s primary finding in this regard was that, in circumstances where both parties would each retain obligations for caring for the children, both parties had a need for sufficient monies to produce a deposit on, and to enable them to afford a mortgage in respect of a property with a purchase price of &#163;1.25M.  Within this context, the learned Judge stated his primary conclusion in respect of need as &#8220;Both [the husband] and [the wife] require sufficient monies to produce deposits on properties to enable them to afford a mortgage.&#8221;  In his judgment, the learned Judge does not deal expressly with purchase costs.  I will return to this issue in more detail shortly, forming as it does the basis of Ms Kisser&#8217;s submission that there was significant omission in the figures underpinning the draft judgment circulated to the parties. </p>

The learned Judge also recorded the wife&#8217;s evidence that she would be able to raise a mortgage of &#163;100,000 against Foreign Property A, given the greater flexibility and lower interest rates for mortgages in that jurisdiction.  With respect to the husband&#8217;s mortgage capacity, the judgment suggests that the evidence before the court was that the husband could raise a mortgage of &#163;1M.   </p>

With respect to the reasoning underpinning his decision as to the distribution of capital, and with respect to the wife, the learned Judge began as follows: </p>

She has &#163;59,434 available to her from bank accounts, but she has debts of &#163;144,773 on a net basis.  Therefore, she would have only available to her some &#163;275,000 upon the sale of the house and the payment off of all her debts.  However, in terms of liquidity there is some amelioration.  There has been much dispute about what should happen to [Foreign Property A].  It is sought on behalf of [the husband] that that property should be sold, that the proceeds divided equally between himself and [the wife] and the liabilities under that should not impinge on [the wife&#8217;s] mortgageability.  The mortgage experts that I have seen say that her mortgage potential was only some &#163;770,000-odd if she retained [Foreign Property A], but if it was to be sold she might have a potential of over &#163;1 million. </p>

She tells me that the mortgage facilities in [the country in question] are more flexible, they can be achieved at a low rate and she would hope to be able to discharge the bulk of her outstanding legal debts from them.  If that is the case and she was able to raise another &#163;100,000 from that property, she would have liquid capital available to her of &#163;375,000.&#8221; </p>

As can be seen, the learned Judge then noted that, having regard to her debts of &#163;144,773, this would still leave the wife with only &#163;275,000 after the sale of the former matrimonial home and &#8220;the payment off of all her debts&#8221;, this being an insufficient deposit to purchase a property for &#163;1.25M having regard to her mortgage capacity.  Within this context, the learned Judge thereafter concluded that there &#8220;in terms of liquidity, there is some amelioration&#8221; in the form of Foreign Property A, which the learned Judge accepted could be used to raise an additional &#163;100,000.  Further, and within this context, the learned Judge observed that this would allow the wife to get to almost &#163;375,000 by way of a deposit on a new home, after the payment of her debts.    </p>

I have come to the conclusion, on the basis of need, and on the basis of the fairness between the parties, that the need for [the wife] to have some additional capital and for her to retain the property are consonant.  It provides a capital resource for her if she is able to manage the financial situation to retain it, then that will be all well and good.  Thus, looking at the wife&#8217;s situation, and including the &#163;100,000 immediate liquidity from [Foreign Property A], she would have that total I have identified, &#163;375,000, to go towards the purchase of a property.  She has told me she would be able to raise a mortgage of &#163;850,000, even returning (<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>) the [Foreign Property A], and with the costs of some &#163;4,000 per month.

The learned Judge concluded that the wife had sufficient funds, including &#163;100,000 raised from Foreign Property A, to obtain a housing fund of &#163;1.225M. The learned Judge thereafter concluded that the wife &#8220;is short in liquid funds of &#163;101,000&#8221; and stated his intention to make a lump sum order against the husband in the sum of &#163;65,000.  However, on the basis of the learned Judge&#8217;s calculations up to that point, which calculations included &#163;100,000 from Foreign Property A, and having regard to her identified need for a property worth &#163;1.25M, the wife appeared short of liquid funds by some &#163;25,339 with respect to her housing need.  On this basis, I concluded in the draft judgment that the learned Judge&#8217;s lump sum order resulted in an award that exceeded the wife&#8217;s identified housing need. </p>

In her additional written submissions made in response to Ms Kisser&#8217;s request that the court reconsider its conclusions in light of the above, Ms Campbell was equivocal as to whether the husband accepted that the learned Judge factored purchase costs of &#163;76,000 into his judgment.  Ms Campbell made the point that it is not possible from the judgment to see that the learned Judge had explicitly in mind purchase costs when reaching his conclusions regarding the appropriate division of assets, Ms Campbell noting that the figures in the judgment do not add up precisely to reveal the purchase costs figure, and that it is necessary to look to the transcripts and the learned Judge&#8217;s August judgment to see explicitly the learned Judge&#8217;s treatment of such costs.  However, at the further short hearing listed by the court to permit the parties to make any supplementary oral submissions they wished, Ms Campbell conceded that the learned Judge&#8217;s judgment did indeed factor in purchase costs of some &#163;76,000.   </p>

That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that, whilst the figures in judgment for the residual equity in Foreign Property A of &#163;34,770, and the lump sum of &#163;65,000 mentioned in Paragraph 29 of the judgment, do not add up precisely to the shortfall of &#163;101,000 identified by the learned Judge in that paragraph, the shortfall figure identified by the learned Judge does bring the capital award to the wife to &#163;1.326M, and thus matches the figure needed to purchase a property worth &#163;1.25M with purchase costs of &#163;76,000.

Within this context, the learned Judge determined that, after the discharge of debts, this outcome would leave him with capital of &#163;243,000, which he could supplement with the further partnership loan of &#163;88,000 to bring him to a capital position of &#163;331,000, enabling the husband also to put down a deposit on a property worth &#163;1.25M on the basis of evidence that the husband could raise a mortgage of &#163;1M.  Whilst the learned Judge noted that the sum of &#163;331,000 would be immediately reduced by the lump sum payment to the wife of &#163;65,000, as set out in the passage of his judgment that I recite at Paragraph 33 below, the learned Judge considered that this was an outcome justified by the wife&#8217;s need, and in circumstances where the husband could make up that deficit from his superior earnings by the time his then current tenancy ended and, thus, by the time he came to put down the required deposit against a property valued at &#163;1.25M.   </p>

Indeed, having described his decision and the effect of it, the learned Judge moved, without more, to consider the question of periodical payments.

I do note that at paragraph [28] of his judgment, the learned judge states that the wife needed additional capital to meet need and &#8220;on the basis of fairness&#8221;.  Further, immediately after noting that the lump sum payment of &#163;65,000 to the wife would reduce the capital available to the husband by that amount, the learned Judge went on to state as follows:  </p>

Looking at [the husband&#8217;s] net income and using the figures that I have identified of &#163;605,000 per year, identifying that he will have paid school fees, including the reasonable extras and the school clubs and the nanny, so that there is some &#163;110,000odd coming out with some additional expenses to meet each parent&#8217;s need and the &#163;24,000 a year, I have no doubt that he has ability to make up by way of capital result the deficit to enable him to put down the deposit he requires to do against the purchase of a &#163;1.25 million property before the end of March next year.  By that means he will be in a position at the end of his current tenancy, which is in salubrious accommodation in the appropriate area, to be able to purchase for himself, if he so chooses, a property at &#163;1.25 (<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>) or, indeed, such other property as he wishes to.

They still leave [the husband] in deficit in terms of a fifty/fifty split.  I am quite satisfied that was an appropriate method to arrive at in the judgment in May and that it remains fair at this point given [the wife&#8217;s] additional needs and the much greater income of [the husband] over [the wife] going forward.&#8221; </p>

However, and as noted by Roberts J during the permission hearing, it remains difficult to identify with further specificity, the factors and the reasoning underpinning the learned Judge&#8217;s conclusion that a departure from equality to the extent endorsed by the learned Judge was appropriate in this case.   </p>

The learned Judge rejected the wife&#8217;s arguments in this regard and granted the husband&#8217;s application for an order permitting him to buy the wife out of her share of the former matrimonial home upon payment to her of a lump sum of &#163;425,843 (this being half of the net proceeds of the former matrimonial home in the sum of some &#163;360,000 plus the lump sum payment of &#163;65,000).   </p>

Ms Campbell also emphasised the existence of what she termed a surplus to the wife in her additional submissions.  It is of note that the figure of 76% is significantly higher than the figure of &#8220;at least 68%&#8221; contended for in the first ground of appeal.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0in">Judge, Ms Campbell submits that the wife arrives at her very different figures by (a) excluding the liability of &#163;159,538 from the calculation with respect to the division of the liquid assets and (b) including the parties&#8217; respective pension provision in the overall division calculation.  This approach, Ms Campbell submits, is unprincipled in circumstances where (a) the wife&#8217;s calculation for the division of the liquid assets includes the partnership loan drawdown of some &#163;88,000, which drawdown results in the increased liability of &#163;159,358 and (b) the pension provision is an illiquid asset of a different character and, therefore, in a different category from the other capital assets.  At the further short hearing to deal with Ms Kisser&#8217;s request that the court reconsider its conclusions in the circumstances I have described, Ms Campbell made clear that she was not seeking to suggest that the pension assets do not fall to be considered where determining the division arrived at by the learned Judge.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">First, Ms Campbell submitted that, in so far as the justification for the division was the disparity in the parties&#8217; earning capacity, that division failed to reflect the fact that, pursuant to the learned Judge&#8217;s order, the husband was left with considerable child maintenance obligations and responsibility for all school fees and certain other expenses, whereas, by contrast, the wife&#8217;s contribution to the children&#8217;s maintenance is limited to day to day expenses save for the costs of tuition and speech therapy.  Within this context, Ms Campbell submits that the learned Judge failed to take proper account of the fact that the wife&#8217;s income remained largely unimpeded and that the husband was, in effect, underwriting the costs that the wife incurred in supporting her own career or, to put it another way, providing her with a significant indemnity in relation to the costs of generating her own income.  Ms Campbell further pointed to the evidence that the husband&#8217;s high earning capacity is time limited, in contrast to the position of the wife, and to the husband&#8217;s contention (not made at first instance) that the wife&#8217;s earning capacity would increase over time. Ms Campbell also relied on the fact that a portion of the husband&#8217;s capital, namely Foreign Property B, is illiquid in character.  In her additional written and oral submissions for the further short hearing, Ms Campbell re-emphasised these points, submitting that the husband is required to underwrite completely the wife&#8217;s earning capacity in circumstances where the husband&#8217;s own high earning capacity is strictly time limited and pointing to a number of additional items of expenditure the husband has agreed to meet. </p>

Conceding that, in circumstances where the learned Judge&#8217;s award to the wife met her housing need as he assessed it to be, Ms Campbell however, re-emphasised her submission that the manner in which the learned Judge structured the award to the wife took the division of capital far outside that which was reasonable, in circumstances where the structure of the award made to meet the wife&#8217;s housing need reduced the funds the wife was able to contribute by way of a mortgage. </p>

With respect to this latter point, Ms Campbell submitted that the learned Judge provided no real analysis or explanation for his decision.  For example, Ms Campbell points to the fact that the learned Judge makes no mention of how he dealt with the wife&#8217;s deferred restricted stock unit bonuses, albeit that Ms Campbell latterly conceded, as had the husband&#8217;s then counsel had at the final hearing, that it would have been fair to treat them as income.  Ms Campbell also submitted that the learned Judge did not make clear how he treated Foreign Property B, and the fact it was an illiquid asset, nor the loan due to the husband from his sister. </p>

Within this context, Ms Campbell submits that had the learned Judge, as he was required to do, stood back and measured the views he had arrived at having undertaken the statutory exercise against the yardstick of equality, it would have been apparent to him that the order he proposed to make was unfair to the husband and was not in any way &#8220;slight&#8221;, the fact that the learned Judge believed it was so demonstrating, submitted Ms Campbell, how inadequately reasoned his decision was.   </p>

However, if one includes the liability of &#163;159,358 when calculating the division of the liquid assets, then the percentage division is as demonstrated by Ms Campbell in the schedule I have reproduced at paragraph 34, namely 73% in favour of the wife.  It is only when pensions are added in that one gets to the division in favour of the wife as contended for by Ms Kisser.  During her oral submissions, Ms Kisser asserted that, in calculating the capital division arrived at by the learned Judge, the pensions must be included (particularly where what Ms Kisser characterised as the &#8220;illiquid loan&#8221; of &#163;159,358 is also included). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, in a stalwart defence of the learned Judge&#8217;s judgment, Ms Kisser submits that, in accordance with the foregoing table, the net effect of the learned Judge&#8217;s judgment was an overall division of assets of 59% to the wife and 41% to the husband. Ms Kisser further submits that, in circumstances where the husband was thereafter successful in persuading the court to allow him to keep the former matrimonial home, and successful in resisting the wife&#8217;s submission that an increased lump sum payment should be made to reflect the savings that the husband would thereby make through not incurring stamp duty and purchase costs on a new property, the division arrived at was, in the end, some 57% to the wife and 43% to the husband (figures which, Ms Kissers submits in passing, would not have justified even permission to appeal had they been brought to the attention of Roberts J).  Ms Kisser contends that the learned Judge was justified in departing from equality in this way in circumstances where, having carried out a careful evaluation of both parties&#8217; housing needs (which Ms Kisser reminds the court is an evaluation that is not disputed on appeal), the learned Judge was faced with parties with a relatively limited capital base but a proportionately large income base and a husband with an income of three and a half times that of the wife.  In the circumstances, Ms Kisser submits that the learned Judge cannot be said to have been wrong in departing from equality when seeking to meet the respective housing needs of each party, one party having a considerably lower income than the other.  Within this context, Ms Kisser further submits that none of the criticisms levelled at the judgment by the husband stand up to scrutiny.   </p>

Ms Kisser further submitted that the wife will receive only &#163;24,000 per annum in child maintenance from the husband&#8217;s income of &#163;605,000 per annum and that, whilst she does obtain some benefit in terms of her ability to generate income from the husband meeting other childcare costs, the husband also derives a benefit in return by reason of there being no need for spousal maintenance. </p>

With respect to the loan, Ms Kisser submits that the learned Judge clearly had regard to it and anticipated that any shortfall in repayment could be met by surplus income going forward, pointing to the passage in the judgment that I have quoted above. </p>

Within this context, Ms Kisser submits that the division he arrived at was not outwith the ambit of learned Judge&#8217;s discretion and that the decision of the learned Judge was entirely fair and not impeachable having regard to the latitude an appellate court should accord a first instance judgment.   </p>

Ms Kisser further re-emphasised that the learned Judge had heard evidence and made findings regarding the wider importance to the wife and children of being able to retain Foreign Property A if she could arrange her affairs to enable her to do so, given the link the property allowed her and the children to retain with the country in question.  Within this context, Ms Kisser reiterated her submission that the findings of the learned Judge that underpinned his structuring of the award to the wife were reasonable and should not be disturbed by this court, in particular where this court has not had the benefit of hearing the evidence that underpinned those findings. </p>

The wife contended that, in establishing the division reached at first instance, all of the matrimonial assets, including the pension assets, must be included.  As I have noted, at the short additional hearing, Ms Campbell made clear that she was not seeking to suggest that the pension assets do not fall to be considered when determining the division arrived at by the learned Judge. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">With respect to this issue, I note a number of points.  First, the Schedule of Assets routinely drafted for proceedings of this nature includes pension assets as well as nonpension assets.  Second, the Form E that parties are required to complete for the purpose of setting out for the court the assets that form the subject matter of the financial remedy proceedings requires a grand total of all assets, including pension assets.  Third, in applying the principle of equality as a starting point, that principle must be applied to all matrimonial assets.  It would appear illogical in the circumstances, therefore, to exclude a defined species of assets when seeking to consider on appeal whether a departure from equality is justified in a given case.  Against this, there is an argument that, when looking at pensions within the context of calculating the overall division reached at first instance, regard must be had to the fact that, depending on the particular circumstances of the case, pension assets may be illiquid and subject to taxation.  Within this context, there is an argument that in determining the division reached at first instance pensions assets should be subject to a modest discount.  However, I did not hear any detailed argument on this latter point.  Further, in light of the fact that this is plainly a case of need, it is not necessary for me to reach a definitive conclusion on the precise method for calculating the division reached at first instance for the purposes of determining an appeal concerning that division.  Within this context, I make some more general observations on this point below. </p>

However, for the reasons I have given, having circulated the draft judgment with the standard rubric requiring counsel to point out typographical corrections and other obvious errors, I am satisfied that the draft judgment contained such an obvious error, namely that the figures on which the decision expressed in the draft was based omitted to include purchase costs which, whilst not appearing in the learned Judge&#8217;s judgment, were, I am now satisfied from other sources, included in his calculations. </p>

Not least in this case because the husband will have considered himself successful by reference to the draft, only for the court to reach the opposite conclusion in the judgment handed down. Against this however, as pointed out by Lady Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">L and B (Children)</span>, a judge must have the courage and intellectual honesty to admit and correct an error or omission and, as Rimer LJ made clear in his dissenting judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Re LB (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/984" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 984" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 984</ref>, in doing so is honouring his or her judicial oath. In the circumstances, whilst, as I can attest, it is an uncomfortable exercise for the judge, particularly where the error or omission acts to change the decision handed down in draft, and is disappointing for the litigant who believed they had been successful, a judge is duty bound to correct his or her omission or error.  To do otherwise would not be just.   </p>

Ms Kisser argued in her Skeleton Argument for an overall figure of 59/41%, both excluding and including pension provision and (in circumstances where the husband was subsequently successful in persuading the court to allow him to keep the former matrimonial home, and successful in resisting the wife&#8217;s submission that an increased lump sum payment should be made to reflect the savings that the husband would thereby make) ultimately 57/43% in favour of the wife. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">First, I am not able to accept Ms Campbell&#8217;s initial submission that in arriving at a decision as to what division was reached at first instance, the parties&#8217; respective pension provision should be excluded in their entirety.  As I have indicated, Ms Campbell stepped back from that submission at the further short hearing and, accordingly, the point largely falls away.  As I have noted, there is an argument that, in determining the division reached at first instance, pensions assets should be subject to a modest discount but that is not a matter I need determine for the purposes of disposing of this appeal.  Second, and whilst not a significant point in light of the foregoing conclusion, I am not able to accept Ms Kisser&#8217;s calculation of a 59/41% split of the <span style="font-style:italic">liquid</span> capital assets.  To include the additional drawdown from the partnership loan on one hand but exclude the concomitant liability on the other is not a proper approach.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It follows that I am satisfied that the division with which this court is concerned is one which takes account of the total capital assets of the parties, including their pension provision.  On the figures before the court, this means that this court is concerned with the overall division contended for by Ms Kisser in her Skeleton Argument of 59/41% in favour of the wife.  Were there to be a slight discount in the value of the pension assets for the purpose of calculating the capital division reached at first instance, the percentage in favour of the wife would increase slightly.  At the short hearing, Ms Campbell acknowledged that in circumstances where the husband was successful in persuading the court to allow him to keep the former matrimonial home, and successful in resisting the wife&#8217;s submission that an increased lump sum payment should be made to reflect the savings that the husband would thereby make, it is possible to arrive at a final figure of 57/43% in favour of the wife. I am satisfied that the division of the assets arrived at by the learned Judge cannot be said to be wrong having regard to the particular circumstances of this case. </p>

With respect to the question of disparity of income, whilst the learned Judge does identify &#8220;that [the husband] will have paid the school fees, including the reasonable extras and the school clubs and the nanny, so that there is some &#163;110,000-odd coming out of his account&#8221;, together with the top up maintenance of &#163;24,000 per year, beyond looking at the impact of this on the husband&#8217;s ability to raise a deposit following the payment of a lump sum of &#163;65,000, the learned Judge gave no apparent consideration to how this situation affected the fairness of the capital division. Within this context, I accept Ms Campbell&#8217;s submission that the learned Judge does not appear to consider, when concluding that the disparity in the parties&#8217; income justified a departure from equality, the extent to which the wife&#8217;s income of &#163;171,000 per annum will, by reason of the obligations placed on the husband by the court, remain largely unimpeded and the fact that the husband was, in effect, underwriting the costs that the wife incurred in supporting her own career.  Or, to put it another way, providing the wife with a significant indemnity in relation to the costs of generating her own income.  If the learned Judge did consider these factors, he did not reflect them in his judgment. </p>

This increase also fell to the husband to address from his share of the capital assets, resulting in an additional call on the husband&#8217;s share of capital.

Further, whilst I accept that it is unclear from the learned Judge&#8217;s judgment whether and to what extent the matters set out in the foregoing paragraphs, and prayed in aid by Ms Campbell, formed part of the consideration of the learned Judge, this court is in a position to consider whether those factors, namely the burden of the meeting the costs of the children placed upon the husband and the structure of the disposition arrived at by the learned Judge, render the conclusion reached by the learned Judge wrong for the reasons Ms Campbell has pressed upon this court.  </p>

Whilst this resulted in a less than equal division of the assets, need, as assessed by the court having regard to the evidence before it, is capable of providing a good reason for departing from equality.

Namely, by requiring the wife to contribute more to the purchase of a property in this country by ordering the sale of Foreign Property A, thereby allowing her to utilise her greater mortgage capacity in this jurisdiction and reducing the call on the husband&#8217;s share of the matrimonial assets.   </p>

It is the case that the wife had a higher mortgage capacity in this jurisdiction.  However, it is also the case that the learned Judge had the benefit of hearing evidence regarding the strength of the wife&#8217;s connections with the country in question, and her evidence regarding the desirability of retaining the same for herself and the children, which evidence I did not have the benefit of hearing.  Having heard that evidence, the learned Judge drew the conclusion that Foreign Property A constituted an important link for the wife and the children to that country and, in circumstances where he accepted that the wife could raise a mortgage of &#163;850,000 in England and an additional sum of &#163;100,000 against Foreign Property A, grounded his conclusion that wife&#8217;s case that she should keep Foreign Property A as a link for her and the children </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is correct that the way in which the learned Judge chose to meet the wife&#8217;s identified housing necessitated the making of a lump sum order in favour of the wife, and that ordering the sale of Foreign Property A, thereby allowing the wife to utilise her greater mortgage capacity in this jurisdiction, was an alternative route to meeting the wife&#8217;s need.  However, whilst another judge might have decided to take that route having regard to the burden placed on the husband with respect to the outgoings for the children, in light of the conclusions the learned Judge reached on the evidence regarding the importance of Foreign Property A for the wife and the children, the ability of the wife to raise a mortgage of &#163;850,000 in England and an additional sum of &#163;100,000 against Foreign Property A, and within the context of the husband&#8217;s significantly greater earning capacity, I am not satisfied that it can be said that the learned Judge was <span style="font-style:italic">wrong</span> to adopt the course that he did in this case where his award met the wife&#8217;s identified need precisely.  Whilst the course adopted by the learned judge required the husband to fund a lump sum in the context of the burden placed upon him with respect to the outgoings on the children, as the learned Judge observed, the husband&#8217;s significantly greater income allowed him to make up that lump sum by the time he came to purchase a property of his own, and to bear the costs of the outgoings with respect of the children whilst maintaining a large surplus income.  On the evidence before him, these were conclusions that were open to the learned Judge.   </p>

Whilst one can debate whether this constitutes the &#8220;slight&#8221; departure which the learned Judge stated he was aiming for, the division arrived was one that was open to the learned Judge in circumstances where both parties had the same housing need and where one party earned at a considerably higher level than the other.
