	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the challenges facing the Courts and Local Authority Social Services Departments in cases involving radicalisation of children and young people is the relatively limited opportunity (in many cases) to effect change or to provide an appropriately rigorous scheme of protection.  Though I am resistant to making any kind of generalised observation in these cases, I would note that children or young people in the age bracket 14 &#8211; 18 years have appeared to be particularly vulnerable.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In public law care proceedings generally, young people in this age group are often perceived as &#8216;hard to reach&#8217; or resistant to intervention.  The same challenges apply in this new facet of child protection.  There is, however, a pressing need to put some kind of supportive measures in place. The contemplated harm is grave i.e. the individual child secretly leaving the UK either to fight jihad or to become a jihadi bride.  I have commented in other judgments and need not repeat here, that these cases involve risk of death and, particularly in the case of female children, exposure to degrading and inhuman treatment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Brighton &amp; Hove City Council, the Applicants in this case, have gone to great lengths to keep Y, the young person with whom I have been concerned, safe and secure in the UK.  Y is a particularly vulnerable young person who (latterly) has lived in Britain in an extraordinary family, where the male members are all committed to waging jihad in Syria.  To that end three brothers travelled to Syria to fight for Jabhat Al Nusra (an <span style="font-family:Arial;color:#282828">Al Qa'ida affiliate) </span>now Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, in the civil war.  Two of Y&#8217;s brothers and one close friend, have died there:  Y&#8217;s brother, &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">A</span>&#8217; travelled to Syria when aged 17 and was killed aged 18 in 2014; his younger brother, &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">B</span>&#8217; was also killed later in the same year having travelled to Syria, when he was aged 16 years; a family friend, &#8216;<span style="font-weight:bold">C</span>&#8217;, again a teenager, who had lived in Y&#8217;s home with his family, was killed in September 2014.  </p>

There have undoubtedly been significant problems in stimulating Y&#8217;s engagement with the services offered to him.  There have also been ongoing concern with this family more widely, but as I have said previously, Y is still here in the UK, and remains safe, for the time being.  As Mr Downs, on behalf of the Local Authority, comments &#8216;it is no small achievement to have kept Y alive&#8217;.  I agree.  </p>

The legal mandate of the Local Authority inevitably alters too.  I have been concerned that the support and protection offered to Y should not simply evaporate on his 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday, he does not become less vulnerable merely by chronological age.  I raised the question with the advocates as to what obligations fall upon the Local Authority when the Wardship falls away.  The answer was by no means straightforward.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority has filed a Position Statement which deals with the legal obligations to care leavers generally and, in particular, the position of Y.  It is to be noted that it has never been necessary for Y to be accommodated by the Local Authority.  He has, at all times, remained at home with members of his family. In this case, having regard to the background, the Director of Children&#8217;s Services has agreed to authorise a bespoke service to Y largely mirroring the support that it would be legally obliged to make available to a care leaver.  This, it has been submitted would not be triggered automatically on the discharge of Wardship, in contrast to the automatic support frequently available on the expiry of a Care Order.   Brighton and Hove City Council offers a <span style="font-style:italic">Pledge</span> to care leavers in the City and have developed a special one for Y designed around his own needs.  This will last until he is age 21 or potentially longer if he is in further education.  It could, however, be withdrawn in the face of persistent non-engagement.  Y will also have to agree to &#8216;information sharing&#8217;, which will involve submitting to a degree of intrusion. </p>

Ms Natasha Watson, Managing Principal solicitor for Brighton &amp; Hove City Council and who has wider advisory roles, has prepared a detailed analysis of the identified issue.  Her Position Statement is, if I may say so, a model of its kind.  It is a compelling exegesis of the interrelationship of the various statutory regimes that apply in such circumstances.  Mr Downs submits that the point generally and Ms Watson&#8217;s work, in particular, requires to be placed in the public domain so that others involved in these cases will be able to benefit.

There is no single definition for what constitutes preventative activity and this can range from macro measures aimed at promoting health, to more targeted, individual interventions aimed at improving skills or functioning for one person or a particular group.

I, for my part, am not prepared to exclude such a possibility.  More significantly however, there remains the scope of the inherent jurisdiction to protect a class of vulnerable adults who whilst vulnerable, nonetheless retain capacity.

Nor am I suggesting that the jurisdiction can only be invoked if the facts can be forced into one or other of these headings. Quite the contrary. Often, indeed, the facts of a particular case will exhibit a number of these features. There is, however, in my judgment, a common thread to all this. The inherent jurisdiction can be invoked wherever a vulnerable adult is, or is reasonably believed to be, for some reason deprived of the capacity to make the relevant decision, or disabled from making a free choice, or incapacitated or disabled from giving or expressing a real and genuine consent. The cause may be, but is not for this purpose limited to, mental disorder or mental illness. A vulnerable adult who does not suffer from any kind of mental incapacity may nonetheless be entitled to the protection of the inherent jurisdiction if he is, or is reasonably believed to be, incapacitated from making the relevant decision by reason of such things as constraint, coercion, undue influence or other vitiating factors.</span></p>

As I have already pointed out, it has long been recognised that the jurisdiction is exercisable on an interim basis "while proper inquiries are made" and while the court ascertains whether or not an adult is in fact in such a condition as to justify the court's intervention. That principle must apply whether the suggested incapacity is based on mental disorder or some other factor capable of engaging the jurisdiction. As Singer J put it in Re SK (Proposed Plaintiff) (An Adult by way of her Litigation Friend) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/3202" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 230" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 230</ref>, at para [9], and I agree, the court has power to make orders and to give directions designed to ascertain whether or not a vulnerable adult has been able to exercise her free will in decisions concerning her civil status.</span></p>

So it is likely to be easier to persuade the court that there is a case calling for investigation where the adult is apparently vulnerable than where the adult is not on the face of it vulnerable.

There is, in my view, a sound and strong public policy justification for this to be so. The existence of 'elder abuse', as described by Professor Williams, is sadly all too easy to contemplate. Indeed the use of the term 'elder' in that label may inadvertently limit it to a particular age group whereas, as the cases demonstrate, the will of a vulnerable adult of any age may, in certain circumstances, be overborne. Where the facts justify it, such individuals require and deserve the protection of the authorities and the law so that they may regain the very autonomy that the appellant rightly prizes. The young woman in Re G (above) who would, as Bennett J described, lose her mental capacity if she were once again exposed to the unbridled and adverse influence of her father is a striking example of precisely this point. </span></p>

Nor is it wise or helpful to place a finite limit on those who may, or may not, attract the court's protection in this regard. The establishment of a statutory scheme to bring the cases in this hinterland before the Court of Protection would (as Professor Williams described) represent an almost impossible task, whereas the ability of the common law to develop and adapt its jurisdiction, on a case by case basis, as may be required, may meet this need more readily.&#8221;</span></p>

Nonetheless, the potential of the Channel Project to be effective, even in the absence of consent, requires to be emphasised.  This has not always been fully understood. For completeness I would also note that where consent is withdrawn some panels (such as Brighton &amp; Hove) have identified &#8216;continual review&#8217; at a minimum of 6 months.  By way of illustration Y&#8217;s brother (D) had been accepted on the Channel scheme, following the death of his brothers, but following his discharge from prison, declined to engage.  I am satisfied that there is no support or encouragement, within his family to help Y to escape the pattern of behaviour that has developed.  </p>

Mr Downs, in a submission which predated MacDonald J&#8217;s judgment, observed:</p>

There are circumstances with which this court is already familiar where care orders are the right legal approach, and these have the advantage of potentially acting as a gateway to the duties to care leavers. The authority consider that it would be a most unfortunate consequence of wardship if this were to mean that similar levels of vulnerability were treated quite differently in terms of ongoing services into adulthood. &#8221;</span></p>

This authority has had a different set of circumstances where it became evident that any attempt to impose a relationship upon the young person that went beyond the Channel mechanism was likely to be entirely counterproductive: Just as wardship presented a  unique solution to a unique case,  the authority have concluded that what is required at the conclusion of wardship is a further bespoke exercise of the local authority&#8217;s discretion, in such a way as to prioritise the welfare of the young person, and where possible to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by the legal route which had been taken in childhood to secure their welfare. &#8221;</span></p>

I have emphasised where such support is an obligation of statute and illustrated something of its application to these particular facts.  Once again however, I would wish to make it very clear that, in these challenging and evolving cases, a universal truth must not be forgotten: every child is different and every radicalised child is different.  The applicants in this case, under Mr Downs guidance, have demonstrated this in a case which has been worked with conspicuous professional skill and commitment.</p>
