The wife&#8217;s Form E disclosed that since 2013 she had been the owner of [House 1A]. This is a property next door to her parents&#8217; home at [House 1B], from which she has run a child-minding business. [House 1A] was gifted to her by her parents in 2013. The wife says the husband was well aware that it had been transferred into her name by her parents, as part of their planning around inheritance tax. She says she did not take on any financial or other responsibility for the property and never regarded it as anything other than belonging to her parents. The husband says that the first time he became aware that she owned this property was when he read the Form E in January 2024, and it was then that he understood why the wife had not wished for there to be exchange of financial information back in 2019. </p>

The wife says that this is the first time she had evidence of the company&#8217;s worth, but it was in around January 2023 that she first had an inkling that [ABC] was making substantial money. She says, at the time of their separation and during negotiations for the separation agreement, the husband misled her about the value of and prospects of the business, and had she known the truth, she never would have entered into the agreement. She argues that she should not be held to the terms of the separation agreement, and intends to seek independent valuation evidence of [ABC] (now and as at the time of the agreement), and full disclosure of the husband&#8217;s business and property assets, in order to achieve what she says would be a fair division of the assets of the marriage upon divorce.</p>

It was not necessary to think in formal terms; it was sufficient to ask whether there was any material lack of disclosure, information or advice.

The wife does now assert that the agreement is insufficient to meet hers and the children&#8217;s needs, and seeks a review. The husband says that the agreement was predicated on the wife&#8217;s needs, set out by her during extensive negotiations. He says the parties have lived with the terms of the agreement for the past five years without any idea of the wife&#8217;s or the children&#8217;s needs not being met.

The language he used in his WhatsApp messages was the same as his every day speech; direct, to the point and without any side to it. He is the kind of person that someone might describe as an open book, and perhaps a man who wears his heart on his sleeve. He trained as a plumber, set up in business with a friend just over twenty years ago fabricating industrial plumbing equipment. During the marriage he worked extremely hard on his business, rising at around 5.00 a.m. and working long days, and often at the weekends (he says after the children were born he would be home for bath times). His long working hours did become a source of difficulty in the marriage. He said that he did not in any way seek to hide anything from his wife about his business dealings, but that if he did talk to her about a particular project or plan or contract he had won, she took no interest, and tended to shut the conversation down immediately.</p>

This description was wholly out of line with all the evidence that I heard and read. Throughout the evidence, the impression I formed was of a man who largely deferred to the wife, sought her agreement on all significant decisions, and if such agreement was not forthcoming, did not challenge her. There are just two messages among many hundreds spanning over many years, in which he expresses some impatience, and suggests that if financial matters between them cannot be resolved, then the family house may need to be sold, or he would have to move back in. If to be taken as threats, these two comments do not appear to have been taken as such by the wife, who didn&#8217;t even respond to them, and are not followed up by him. </p>

She did not wish for them to embark on divorce proceedings. Her hope was to send the boys to a catholic secondary school, and she was concerned that the school would have a negative view of children of divorced parents. Another factor was the parties&#8217; agreement to wait for two years until a petition could be made based on two years&#8217; separation with consent. The parties had separated before the provisions for no-fault divorce came into effect.</p>

His understanding at the time was that he would not be able to purchase his own home until he had been released from the mortgage on the family home. The wife did not agree to the children staying with their father in his rental. Every week she sent him a note on a Monday morning setting out the times the children&#8217;s and her schedules allowed for him to spend time with the children; collecting them from school or taking them to various sports activities at the weekend or spending short periods of time with them, or &#8216;baby-sitting&#8217; for them. The WhatsApp messages show the husband was fully accepting of what he was offered, while also suggesting ideas to enable him to spend more time with the boys which might meet with the wife&#8217;s approval, but not to the extent that he might aggravate her, and lose the times he was being offered each week. The clear impression is that he did not want to rock the boat. The tone of the messages between the two of them is overwhelmingly respectful, efficient and straightforward.</p>

One of them is that the husband asked her in 2008 if he could use most of their wedding gift money of &#163;8,000 to pay a tax bill for his company. When they had contemplated moving to a bigger house, she told me the husband said they could afford it, but if things didn&#8217;t work out, they could sell up.

Her evidence is that she paid &#163;61,178 towards the mortgage in November 2019 (savings, premium bonds and the husband&#8217;s &#163;15,000). She says she then paid a further &#163;40,782 in April 2020, (a contribution from her parents), and two further instalments (&#163;10,300 in October and &#163;20,000 in March 2021), these being a mixture of contributions from her parents and her own savings. </p>

The husband was party to the same messages. Having received the wife&#8217;s disclosure, he responded by producing a large file containing the same messages, but revealing that a very substantial number of the messages from the wife omitted whole threads of conversations before and after. This removed the context for a large number of messages and also at times created a false impression that messages from the husband were one-way, pressing for an answer, when in fact there had been an even-handed dialogue going between them. The wife suggested in her evidence that the selection of the messages had come about because of the way her phone had downloaded them. I did not accept her explanation. I find that the messages she has disclosed have been curated by her with the purpose of painting the husband in a negative light. The wife did not suggest that the message selection was the result of some honest but mistaken belief that she only had to disclose messages she wanted to rely upon. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not suggested that the wife has sought to edit or tamper with the content of the messages themselves, but nonetheless, I do find that the selective way she presented the messages did negatively affect her credibility. </p>

In general, the tone adopted by the husband and wife in their direct communications is practical, cordial, and direct. At times they show some compassion to one another, commenting on how difficult it is to be having such discussions. Each at times expresses a wish to sort out as much as they can between them so as not to incur unnecessary expense. They comment about the increasing length of the settlement agreement once lawyers have become involved. None of the messages, either individually or viewed as part of a pattern, suggest that the husband is seeking to convey an impression to the wife that he cannot afford lawyers or the process itself is causing financial pressure on him. Neither do any of the messages suggest that the husband had any kind of agenda to circumvent the lawyers, or to put pressure on the wife by insisting that she negotiate directly with him rather than through solicitors.</p>

On 1 February 2019, she responded with amendments to the one-page document, raising the maintenance to &#163;1,750 a month and seeking for the &#163;15,000 to be a lump sum, not a loan.

On 20 September 2019 the wife&#8217;s solicitor added a handwritten note to clause 2.4. After a statement acknowledging that the wife has no legal or beneficial interest in the husband&#8217;s business or other properties, the addition reads, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Equally, [the husband] acknowledges that he shall have no legal or beneficial interest in any property acquired by [the wife] post the date of separation.&#8217;</span> In her oral evidence the wife said that this was inserted because she feared that if the husband&#8217;s business failed, he would come after the family house. But the agreement makes clear beyond any doubt that the family house, already in her possession, was to be protected. She may have had [House 1A] in mind, although, unbeknownst to anyone else, she had in fact already acquired that some six years earlier. I have not been able to find a satisfactory explanation, but in general terms, this clause is consistent with the rest of the agreement in its intent to sew up all issues between the parties then and there, with a binding agreement, and to prevent there being any future litigation.  This amended draft was returned to the husband. After he confirmed his agreement to the wife&#8217;s further amendments through his solicitor, the agreement was executed and dated 25 September 2019.</p>

The husband inherited a third share of a farm at [<span style="font-style:italic">place name redacted</span>] on the death of his grandmother in 2004. In October 2016 he bought a house next to the farm. It was in need of significant renovations. I accept his evidence that he told the wife about it, because he wanted to take the boys on holiday there but she did not agree. He spent money on installing a kitchen and bathroom. The money that he used came from the business. This property is currently valued at &#163;300,000 with mortgage of &#163;81,078. I am not sure of its value in 2019 but it is likely to be substantially less. The husband&#8217;s share in the farm is currently valued at &#163;130,000. Any sale of the property or the farm would attract capital gains tax.</p>
