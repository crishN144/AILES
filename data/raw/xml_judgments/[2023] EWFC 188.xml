	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case has a very long history which for the sake of brevity I will very much summarise.  The family proceedings were commenced following an allegation by F that she had been sexually abused by the mother&#8217;s partner (T).  Criminal proceedings were also commenced.  A fact finding hearing in the family proceedings came to the conclusion that T had sexually abused F with the knowledge of the mother. Both those findings were set aside by the Court of Appeal which was, amongst other things, critical of the way in which the ABE interviews of the child had been carried out.  The issue of whether T had abused F was remitted for a rehearing which was listed for this week.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the meantime the judge presiding over the criminal proceedings made a ruling that the original ABE interviews were inadmissible due to flaws in the process. Shortly before start of this fact finding hearing the local authority became aware that the police and Crown Prosecution Service had decided to carry out another one, even though almost three years have now passed since the alleged events. The mother had not been consulted about the decision to reinterview T but the father had given his agreement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the pre-trial review the mother, local authority and Guardian in these proceedings expressed grave concerns about the proposal to conduct another ABE interview, not only so far as the probative value was concerned, but also because of the effect on the welfare of F herself and her relationship with her mother and younger sibling.  The mother in particular evinced an intention to apply to the court for an order preventing the police from carrying out the interview.  This issue was listed before me today, the fact finding hearing having been adjourned not only because of the issues concerning the interview but also because the intervenor had been taken ill.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can deal with the first question swiftly.  Although counsel for T (supported by some of the other parties) submitted to me in the first instance that the police could not undertake an ABE interview if one parent alone refused consent that issue has subsequently fallen away.  Consent is dealt with at paragraphs 2.50, 2.54 and 2.60 of the 2022 Achieving Best Evidence Guidance on Interviewing Victims and Witnesses. In the first sentence of paragraph 2.54 it is stated that &#8216;the consent of an adult with parental responsibility is required where the child is not able to understand the implications of participating in the interview..&#8217;. The second and third sentences read &#8216;In cases where an adult with parental responsibility refuses to allow a child to be interviewed and the child is not able to consent in their own right the interview cannot take place.  A strategy discussion between the police and social services should consider whether it is appropriate to make an application for an Emergency Protection Order (EPO)&#8230;and to seek a direction from the court under s44(6) for an interview to take place&#8217;.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me to be plain on reading that paragraph that the police only need to have the consent of one parent to go ahead with an interview, even if the other parent withholds consent.  It cannot be the intention of the guidance (and it should be noted that it is guidance rather than law) that the police must apply to the court whenever one parent objects even if the other consents. There are many cases in which there are allegations of criminal conduct by one parent or child against the other parent. It would be wholly impractical for the police to have to apply to the family court in the event that one parent agreed to the child being interviewed and the other did not.  The answer to (a) is therefore, a clear yes.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This leaves (b), (c) and (d).  In the event none of the parties pursued an application for an injunction against the police today. In those circumstances what  I have to determine is the mother&#8217;s application for a prohibited steps order against the father, which the local authority suggest is better framed as an application for a specific issue order. Nonetheless, given the effect of  the order as sought by the mother would be to leave the police unable to carry out the interview without making an application to the court it is important to bear in mind the case law which relates to the making of orders preventing the police from exercising their statutory function.</p>

Ryder J, as he then was held that the grant or refusal of consent to an interview of a child was an aspect of parental responsibility which could be controlled by the court (either under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> or the inherent jurisdiction). He held that the test to be applied by the court was a balance of rights of interest within which the child&#8217;s welfare was not the paramount consideration.

It matters not that the chosen public authority is one which acts administratively whereas the court, if seized by the same matter, would act judicially&#8230;&#8230;. The courts must be careful in that area to avoid assuming a supervisory role or reviewing power over the merits of decisions taken administratively by the selected public authority&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court of Appeal noted that the core duty that arises from police powers and obligations is to protect the public, including by detecting and preventing crime, although there is no duty to investigate every crime.  The making of an order preventing the police from carrying out their core duties must be considered highly exceptional.  It appears from the judgment of Macur LJ that the issue of parental consent was raised, but only at the eleventh hour. It was not raised before Keehan J at all.</p>

She submits that the mother&#8217;s reasons for inviting the Court&#8217;s intervention are child focussed, with the welfare of both children at the fore.  In support of her application she draws attention to what she says is the police&#8217;s failure to consult her as the child&#8217;s mother, and the dubious purpose of the proposed interview. She states that there has been no apparent welfare analysis by the police and that the likely probative value of the interview itself must be minimal as the events alleged are said to have occurred so long ago.  F has already been poorly interviewed twice and has made no further allegations for some two years.  She notes the Court of Appeal criticism of the two ABE interviews and the decision of the criminal court that they should be excluded but also points out that the ABE guidance governing decisions to conduct further interviews does not seem to have been followed. There also seems to have been some decision to approach the school to work with F without informing her parents, the local authority or the guardian.</p>

Lending consent to anything less, she submits, is ill-advised, and asks the court to prohibit the father from letting that happen.  She acknowledges that the Family Court is not the forum to seek injunctive relief against the police but states that the advantages of the Prohibited Steps Order, restricting the father&#8217;s ability to give consent is that &#8216;it will force the police&#8217;s hand to properly address the matters set out in the ABE guidance&#8217; and that if consent is not forthcoming they will need to make an application to the court setting out the reasons for the proposed interview, &#8216;satisfying the court of its welfare analysis and providing a landscape for the pre-interview and interview planning&#8217;.</p>

He sets out a number of relevant factors for the court to take into account, submitting that the test for the court to apply is as set out by Ryder J (as he then was), namely that welfare is not paramount but that the court must carry out a balance of rights of interest, as a reasonable parent would weight up their child&#8217;s interests against the public interest.  At the end of his skeleton argument he poses the question as to whether the grounds here for making an order are made out for the family court to interfere with the investigation in that way.</p>

Mr Barrass-Evans states that it would be premature for the court to make such an order given that the police have agreed that a welfare analysis should take place, and have not made a final decision.</p>

I am inclined to agree with counsel for the local authority and guardian that this is best framed as an application for a specific issue order, but for the purposes of my decision I do not think that it really matters.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no doubt that the current decision to hold another ABE interview subject to the intermediary assessment is an unusual one.  As a matter of observation it is not difficult to see problems with the reliability of evidence from an ABE interview where the events in question were said to have happened almost three years ago when F was only six.  More than this, F was the subject of leading questions in the old ABE interviews and consideration is bound to have to be given as to whether suggestive questioning affects reliability now as well as then.  If the interview is carried out, this is something that the family court will have to grapple with, as will the criminal court if the case there proceeds.</p>

The Re W assessment (which related to the issue of whether F should give evidence in the family proceedings) carried out in June 2022 by Ms Scallan noted that F was a vulnerable child who risks regression if traumatised by further questioning. The weight on her of responding to more questions may be distressing and triggering for her.   There could be serious damage to the relationship with her sibling and her mother.</p>

It was the mother who exercised her parental responsibility to refuse to agree to the police request, and the decision for the court was whether to set that aside in order to allow the police to conduct their enquiry. The circumstances in which  Ryder J made his decision are not precisely analogous to those here where it is the court itself which is invited to interfere with the decision making process of the police and CPS.   In my judgment, notwithstanding the application is for a prohibited steps order against the father, the proper test to be applied is that of  <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B </span>and all the cases cited therein.  Parliament has entrusted to the police the duty of investigating crime and it is not for this court, when one parent has consented, to exercise a supervisory power over that process save in exceptional circumstances, whether that be by orders preventing the father from giving consent, making a specific issue order or injuncting the police.</p>

If they have not done so sufficiently to date it is very much to be hoped that these applications have caused them to focus on the various factors (including those related to welfare) with more intensity. They now have the report of Ms Scallan, and will be conducting a further assessment.</p>

I ask the parties to keep in mind the test to be applied and the risk of harm to both F and her younger sibling by further delay in formulating their responses.</p>
