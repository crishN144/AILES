The father attended a job club twice a week from 4 August to 25 September 2003.  So the father was employed for two months when L was a small baby and for about six months in 2002 when L was 2 and the subject child was under one.  He attended the job club in the weeks shortly before the death of H.  Apart from those periods of employment and attendance at the job club the father was at home and helped the mother look after the children.  The parents shared the care of the children.

[The father&#8217;s] parents have died and his siblings live in different parts of the world, he has very little contact with them. [The mother] has her extended (sic) living in Hastings.  She has a couple of aunts that are not in good health and elderly grandparents.  Contact with them all is seldom due to [the parents] being busy with the three children. [The maternal grandmother] is at present living in Surrey, her aunt telephoned her mother to say that H had died.  [The mother] is upset that her mother's reply was that she probably would not be able to come down to the funeral.  [The mother] does feel unsupported by her mother and states that her mother is not a proper grandmother. Both [the parents] stated that their relationship is very strong and that they support each other, and this was evident when they were speaking to me about their family and the death of H.</p>

All three children are close in age, the tragic death of H has affected [both parents] considerably.  Both [L and the subject child] are too young to understand the concept of the death and just refer to H as being asleep.  ------------------ The coroner has explained that H&#8217;s body could be in London for a couple of months before his body is released for burial.  The couple have an appointment with DSS about the cost of the funeral.  The couple feel the need to remain together at this present time, as they are grieving the loss of one of their children.  There are no concerns about this family they present as a close-knit family that manage really well living off of a low income</p>

She took H&#8217;s funeral service and after that became a reasonably regular visitor to the parents&#8217; house.  The mother and the children also became quite regular attendants at Sunday services with the father coming too on occasions.  The children also attended the monthly children's hour and L played Mary in the Christmas nativity.  Rev M gave pastoral care to the mother who occasionally came to the vicarage for a chat.  I shall return to the part played by Rev M on the day of L&#8217;s death and her views of the family.  At this stage I simply pause to record that early in her statement to the police Rev M says that she has always been impressed by the care of the children by the mother and the father and that the children were well-behaved well presented, happy and contented.</p>

He told me, and I accept, that he first became aware that this was significant and that his proposed return to work early in 2004 was worrying the mother at a party around Christmas time when the mother had had a couple of glasses of wine which went straight to her head.  Rev M in her evidence said, and I accept, that around Christmas the mother was depressed and was telling her that she was prepared to walk away from her family. Rev M was sufficiently concerned to offer to put the mother in touch with a doctor in connection with her depression; she did not do so and the mother did not see a doctor about this.</p>

That test has not been varied nor adjusted by the dicta of Lord Bingham of Cornhill or Lord Steyn who were considering applications made under a different statute. There would appear to be no good reason to leap across a division, on the one hand, between crime and preventative measures taken to restrain defendants for the benefit of the community and, on the other hand, wholly different considerations of child protection and child welfare nor to apply the reasoning in McCann to public, or indeed to private, law cases concerning children. The strict rules of evidence applicable in a criminal trial which is adversarial in nature is to be contrasted with the partly inquisitorial approach of the court dealing with children cases in which the rules of evidence are considerably relaxed. In our judgment, therefore, Bodey J applied too high a standard of proof in the case of Re ET and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">the principles set out by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead should continue to be followed by the judiciary trying family cases</span> and by magistrates sitting in the family proceedings courts&#8221;.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;At trials, however, the court normally has to resolve disputed issues of relevant facts before it can reach its conclusion on the issue it has to decide.  This is a commonplace exercise, carried out daily by courts and tribunals throughout the country.  This exercise applies as much where the issue is whether an event may happen in the future as where the issue is whether an event did or did not happen in the past.  To decide whether a car was being driven diligently, the court will have to decide what was happening immediately before the accident and how it was being driven and why.  Its findings on these facts form the essential basis for its conclusion on the issue of whether car was being driven with reasonable care.  Likewise, if the issue before the court concerns the possibility of something happening in future  --------------------------------------------------- A decision by a court on the likelihood of a future happening must be founded on a basis of present facts and the inferences fairly to be drawn therefrom.&#8221;</p>

As to that, I refer to 591E to G in the [AC] report and 101B in the [FLR] report, (which in my view applies equally to the issue whether actual harm has been inflicted as it does to the issue of whether there is a likelihood of future harm to which it is specifically directed) where Lord Nicholls says:</p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in">&#8220; I must now put this into perspective by noting, and emphasising, the width of the range of facts which may be relevant when the court is considering the threshold conditions.  The range of facts which may properly be taken into account is infinite.  Facts including the history of members of the family, the state of relationships within a family, proposed changes within the membership family, parental attitudes, and omissions which might not reasonably have been expected, just as much as actual physical assaults.  They include threats, and abnormal behaviour by a child, and unsatisfactory parental responses to complaints or allegations.  And facts, which are minor or even trivial if considered in isolation, taken together may suffice to satisfy the court of the likelihood of future harm.  The court will attach to all the relevant facts the appropriate weight when coming to an overall conclusion on the crucial issue.&#8221;</p>

In that case, three medical experts had agreed that it was unusual to find subdural haemorrhages of the character described unaccompanied by any other physical injury in non-accidental cases. The medical experts had apparently said that it was never more than a possibility that the illness of the child in the instant case was caused by injury, and all were agreed that it was impossible to elevate it beyond possibility to anything approaching either a confident diagnosis or a convincing diagnosis<span style="font-size:11pt">.  </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:11pt"/>The expert opinion in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> was that &#8220;it is known that trauma, including shaking, can often cause these&#8221; (see para.2 of the judgment). It was therefore possible for Dr De Sousa, a Consultant in paediatric neurology, to state that the subdural haemorrhage &#8220;was entirely consistent with non-accidental injury&#8221; (para.25) because non-accidental injury (shaking or impact injury) is one of the recognised causes of subdural haemorrhages. Dr. De Sousa had indicated in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> that of the other possible explanations for subdural haemorrhages, &#8220;none of those recognised causes [of subdural haemorrhages] had any application to L&#8217;s case&#8221;. Moreover, Dr. De Sousa&#8217;s evidence (possibly contradicting the previous point) was that of the number of possible causes of the subdural haemorrhages, the &#8220;front-runner possible cause of subdural haemorrhage is non-accidental injury&#8221; (para.18).</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">[25] It seems that on that very carefully stated and carefully balanced appraisal the judge would have been failing in his primary protective function if he were to have acceded to some submission that because the doctor had not been prepared to say in medical language that there was a confident diagnosis therefore there was no evidence of risk of harm.  The elevation of a medical opinion to the status of a confident medical diagnosis is very much a matter of art and bounded by medical conventions that are fully recognised and, indeed, negotiated at a professional level.  What this doctor was saying was that the child&#8217;s condition was entirely consistent with non-accidental injury and that there was no other more probable explanation.  The case, in my view, is as straightforward as that.  Although Mr Storey sought to say this is some dangerous invasion of the right of parents to presumptions of innocence and to safeguard from adverse findings absent the strongest and clearest of evidence, those submissions, in my opinion, are not realistic in the facts and circumstances of this particular case.&#8221;</p>

If there is nothing before the court, no facts or no circumstances shown to the court which throw doubt on the expert evidence, then, if that is all with which the court is left, the court must accept it.

An expert is not in any special position and there is no presumption of belief in a doctor however distinguished he or she may be. It is, however, necessary for a Judge to give reasons for disagreeing with experts' conclusions or recommendations. That, this Judge did.

At that time understandably the paramedic was of the view that further ventilation was more important than any further clearing of her mouth and airway and it was common ground that the further ventilation caused air to enter L&#8217;s lungs. I pause to comment that this evidence provides, what in my view is a compelling explanation for vomit being found in L&#8217;s airways (see for example the report of Professor Gardiner cited at paragraph 36 of Schedule C).</p>

Degrees of likelihood were not gone into in detail in the evidence but again in my judgment a fair overview of the expert medical evidence was that each of the possibilities suggested on behalf of the mother was far from being a strong possibility and was less likely than the cause that the experts had agreed was more likely than not to be the cause which I shall refer to as the possible inflicted cause (which I accept is a shorthand description which covers a series of events that caused inflicted compression to L&#8217;s neck, obstruction to her airway and venous return, her death, the cut to her forehead, the bruises to her back and the marks to her neck). </p>

At both stages I acknowledge the point (repeated later) that the rival possibilities are all unlikely in the sense that if they occurred they would all be a very rare event.  The comparison of likelihood is therefore between rare, and thus by reference to that criteria unlikely, possibilities.  However it is not made against a background of uncertainty as to result because, very sadly, L died and there is no dispute that she suffered the injuries identified and agreed by the pathologists. All the possibilities are also based on the common ground that L was asphyxiated. </p>

In my judgment the questions I have suggested might be put to medical experts (see paragraph 89 hereof) show the questions that the court should put to itself, and thus the reasoning process that the court also has to go through in reaching a conclusion as to whether amongst the reasonable possibilities advanced for a very rare event one (or more of them together) is (are) more likely than not to be the actual cause or causes for L&#8217;s death and her injuries. </p>

In my view their description of the marks and the fact they noticed and remembered them, taken together with the absence of any evidence that the cardigan which had been worn by L fairly regularly had caused any chaffing or discomfort before, mean that not only is it very unlikely that these marks were caused by chaffing but that it is more likely that they were the result of the possible inflicted cause.</p>

In the light of their evidence and that of the experts I accept that it is possible that one or both of them might have accidentally caused the bruising to L&#8217;s nose and thus that this is a possibility.  In my judgment, having regard to their training it is less likely that any of the other persons involved in the resuscitation attempts would have caused this bruising.  Professor David had not seen such bruising caused by intentional suffocation or resuscitation and saw no reason for preferring one cause over the other. </p>

The detail of this is included in Schedule D.  This possibility was put back to the medical experts.  Having regard to the evidence of Mr Flaherty, his skill and experience in CPR, the distribution of the bruises and the expert evidence I have concluded that it is very unlikely that these bruises were caused by Mr Flaherty during his attempts to resuscitate L (or by him and others who attempted to resuscitate her) and more likely that they were the result of the possible inflicted cause. </p>

As a result he was asked to give a statement and was called.  His evidence did not provide this support although it did not undermine the evidence of Mr Flaherty.

He told me that he had seen such petechial haemorrhages usually on the upper part of the body and specifically referred to the neck and face.  He also told me that he had seen one small infant with a rash on the lower limbs.  He was of the view that vigorous CPR and attendant medication (which he said was nearly always given during resuscitation in hospital) can cause petechial haemorrhages.  As I understood it he accepted in answering questions put on behalf of the mother that in cases where there was a combination of increased air blockage, cardiac compression and medication, the result can be that pressure can change and vessels can be so affected that although an ECG is not recording any electrical impulses the circulation caused by compression can produce petechials.

At all stages they acknowledged the possibility that petechial haemorrhages could be caused by CPR even though natural circulation was not restored, but were of the view (which I accept) that the amount and distribution of the petechial haemorrhages seen on L meant that it was very unlikely that the main or only cause of them was CPR, and it was more likely than not that they were the result of the possible inflicted cause.

In my view this is the more likely explanation of the gurgling sound heard by Rev M and Mrs H notwithstanding the point that Rev M stopped when she heard this noise and checked that L&#8217;s tongue was not in her throat.  Rev M was worried that she did not tilt L&#8217;s head far enough back, but as I say in Schedule D in my view both ladies should be praised for, and proud of, their efforts to resuscitate L and for their humanity and pragmatism in the difficult and distressing circumstances they found themselves in.</p>

This puzzle relates not only to the possibilities advanced on behalf of the mother but also to the possible inflicted cause and thus a conclusion that part of the events surrounding the compression to L&#8217;s throat included a struggle, or other event, that led to the cut to her forehead.  In respect of the possibilities advanced on behalf of the mother she does not refer to there being any &#8220;clean up&#8221;, such possibility exists on the alternative of inflicted injury but the forensic examination of the house indicates that any &#8220;clean up&#8221; would not have been of profuse bleeding.  The explanation is therefore that the cut took place at, or very close to, or after, the point of death.

In my view Rev M was an impressive witness who took considerable care in expressing her views in a fair way.  In their final submissions counsel for the mother extracted from the evidence a number of points made about the mother and her family by Rev M, Mrs P, the playgroup supervisor, the health visitor, the social worker and a neighbour which are complimentary and found the view that if the mother caused L&#8217;s death this was wholly unexpected in the eyes of third parties who had had discussions with, and observed the behaviour of, the mother (and the whole family) following the death of H.  I accept this.  Further points that also support that conclusion are that the mother and father were in a stable relationship which had lasted for about 5 years and was perceived by outsiders to be a loving and supportive one, they appeared to be managing well on a low income, the children appeared happy and well looked after, the home and lifestyle of the family bore none of the hallmarks or warning signs associated with abuse of children, and outsiders had not seen or heard the mother lose her temper.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> The mother has consistently said that while she was downstairs she heard nothing and would have expected to hear L if she had cried out or hit her head on the headboard.  Her account and evidence was that she was very sensitive to noise from the children and could hear what was going on in their bedroom from downstairs.  She and the father were both aware that it was easy to hear movement and noise throughout the house and it seems to me that this means that it is likely that the mother would acknowledge and assert, as she consistently has, that she would have expected to have heard L if she had cried out or hit her head on the headboard.  This evidence again does not fit with the models advanced on behalf of the mother. A qualification to this point is that it is less easy to hear what is happening in the children's bedroom from the kitchen and that the mother had gone into the kitchen during the early  afternoon. I accept that this might explain why she did not hear the events leading up to, and surrounding, L&#8217;s collapse if she took no part in them, but it would require the coincidence of those events taking place during the short time that she was in the kitchen.  I also accept that the mother has not advanced any excuse or reason, such as the TV being on loud, to explain why she did not hear L collapsing and cutting her forehead and that she might have done so if she was giving a false account. </p>

In her evidence she said that she did not want to &#8220;fight with L&#8221; (meaning having an argument with her) but this explanation does not fit with the general description of L, namely that she was a well-behaved and easy child.  The trainers were found on the mantelpiece in the sitting-room.  No explanation as to how they got there, if as the mother has said L was wearing them when she put her to bed, has been given.  It is possible that someone took them off during the attempts to resuscitate L and has forgotten about this; but this seems very unlikely.  In my judgment it is also very unlikely that the mother simply got this wrong and that when she was putting L to bed, in the manner and circumstances she asserts, L was not wearing her trainers and therefore no issue, or potential dispute, as to her taking them off arose between mother and daughter.  In my judgment the most likely explanation for the mother's evidence that L went to bed fully clothed, and with her trainers on, is that the mother put L into bed in different circumstances to those she has described and thought that in those circumstances she had her trainers on.  In my view it is very unlikely that those circumstances would have been normal. </p>

I accept the evidence of Rev M and the divergence between her description and this description of the mother is a factor in favour of conclusions (a) that the mother is not giving a full and accurate account of the events that took place and the things she did and saw before the arrival of Rev M, and (b) that a full and accurate account thereof would include her having seen at one stage of the events that actually occurred L&#8217;s face with a purple colour around the eyes, cheeks and mouth.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother's failure to telephone for an ambulance is also odd and unusual as is her failure to take any steps herself to try to resuscitate L.  Naturally I accept that people will act very differently, and possibly very strangely and inexplicably, in moments of shock and panic and that finding one&#8217;s child in a state of collapse is something that would be exceptionally distressing.  The mother's failure to telephone immediately for an ambulance has been remarked on by some of the doctors, in particular Professor David, as being an unusual feature of this case.  Those remarks are based on their experience of witnessing the reactions of parents in similar situations.  However if this point had stood alone I would not have attached great significance to it because of the difficulties in assessing and criticising the actions of someone suffering from distress, shock and panic. Further I accept the point that this mother did not put on a show of concern and distress to the people she summoned which is something that Professor David commented is sometimes done by a perpetrator of a non accidental injury who has not called an ambulance.  Indeed, as I have mentioned, a number of people remarked that the behaviour of this mother was unusual and incongruent. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But the mother had experienced the circumstances following the collapse of H during which she had, following instructions from the operator, given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  She was thus very aware of the potential benefits of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and of the point that an ambulance could and should be called.  The mother has said that she thought Rev M had told her that she would call an ambulance.  I do not accept that Rev M said this and indeed the mother accepted in her evidence that Rev M had told her to call an ambulance immediately.  The father told her to do the same thing in explicit terms when she spoke to him at about the time Rev M got to the house.  In my view it is relevant to note that in his account of this conversation the father does not say that the mother told him that Rev M was calling an ambulance, which would have been her natural response to his question whether she had done so if she had thought it was the case.  I acknowledge the possibility that by the time of this conversation with the father Rev M had made it clear on her arrival at the home that the mother was to call an ambulance.  But if that is the explanation it is not easy to see why the mother continued with her call to the father before calling for an ambulance.</p>

This smear of blood was not something that any of the other witnesses recall seeing.  If it had been there I am confident that both Rev M and Mrs H would have noticed it and remembered it.  Both ladies had a clear view of the left side of L&#8217;s face when they were attempting to resuscitate her and have a consistent and clear recollection of the cut and the very limited associated bleeding.  Indeed Mrs H remembers thinking how clean L&#8217;s face was.  Also none of the ambulance men remember any smear of blood.</p>

Also this account does not sit easily with the evidence of Rev M, which I accept, that when she entered the room L was lying on her side.  As to this it needs to be remembered that the mother has consistently said that she found L lying with her face in the pillow.  It follows that if all the mother did was to tilt L&#8217;s head in the manner she described, how L came to be lying on her side is unexplained.</p>

Also in my judgment the mother&#8217;s reference to there being a smear of blood is an indication that there was one, and if this was the case it had been cleaned away before Rev M and Mrs H arrived at the home.  Further in my judgment the evidence of Mrs H provides clear support for the view that L&#8217;s face had been very recently cleaned.

I've got to get help.&#8221;  She then asserts  that she telephoned Rev M.

This is because on that description she had a limited observation of L, she did not move her and she would have been unlikely to have noticed (and she does not mention having noticed) any mark or blood on the headboard.  Further, as already mentioned, the mother says that the duvet was undisturbed and L&#8217;s clothing was not in any disarray.   Also the mother's description of her panic and shock, together with the action she then took, do not lend themselves to her making this deduction albeit that if she had entered the room finding the duvet in some disarray and for example L sprawled out on the bed it would be a logical deduction.  Further I accept that it is a deduction that can readily be made particularly after the discovery of the blood on the headboard.  But in my view this early assertion of the mother that L had <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">obviously</span> banged her head on the headboard is an indication that she has not given a full and accurate account of what happened and that the mother knew that this is what had happened.</p>

However when she came to give her second taped interview the mother asserted that before she took L up to bed she was demonstrating signs of illness and that she thought that L might be going down with meningitis.  In the second taped interview she gives quite a detailed account of this saying, for example, that L was very pale, she was white and she did feel hot, and that she checked her temperature.

However, even on that basis, this change of account (a) is an example of the mother failing to give a true account of the events leading up to L&#8217;s death to the best of her recollection, and (b) does not, in my view, indicate that the first account of L feeling tired and therefore going to bed is correct.</p>

The inconsistencies relate to whether this happened on one or two occasions, whether it happened in the morning or after lunch and whether she soiled the loo seat.  It is common ground that it would have been very unusual for L to soil herself and that she did not mention such an accident to the father when they spoke at lunchtime.  In some of the accounts the mother says that she rinsed out the soiled knickers.  The mother has not provided a convincing explanation as to why one pair of obviously and fairly heavily soiled knickers, together with another pair of knickers and a pair of pyjama bottoms, which were lightly soiled, were found in the washing machine.</p>

This is at odds with the evidence of the father and Rev M, and indeed with the mother's evidence taken as a whole.  In my judgment the mother was concerned regarding the father's return to work and the fact that he would not be available to assist with the care of the children between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. five days a week.  On its own I would not regard this as a particularly significant point because it is understandable that an innocent mother might play down the concerns and worries she had had in this respect, and that she had been depressed over the Christmas.</p>
