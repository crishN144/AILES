	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">As regards JK, he could have applied at the outset, or even later before the above order was made, to be made a party. If he had applied, it was not submitted to me by anyone that he would not have been added as a party. As a party, he would have had access to the documents which he now seeks. He could have chosen to participate in the proceedings or, having seen the relevant documents, he could have remained neutral. In addition, the solicitors for AB have on a number of occasions, and in a number of ways, offered to engage with JK so as to inform him of what happened in the proceedings and have offered to give JK access to the expert in old age psychiatry, who is also treating Z, to ensure that JK was fully informed about the medical evidence which had been given by that expert and details of Z&#8217;s treatment.  However, JK did not respond to any of these offers of assistance at the time at which they were made and he remains unwilling to engage in the way which has been proposed. It is also remarkable that although JK relies on the open justice principle which is designed to assist public scrutiny of cases which ought to be heard in public, the original proceedings were not dealt with in public and were never going to be dealt with in public. Further, JK does not apply for an order opening up the documents </p>

In addition to all this, at the outset of the hearing of JK&#8217;s application, Mr Dew invited me to sit in private and thereby to exclude the public from hearing an application which was made in purported reliance on the open justice principle. I acceded to that application which had the support of all the parties and which I considered appropriate in the best interests of Z. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">But there are features of the opposition to this application which are also worthy of remark. As I have pointed out, JK could have applied to have been made a party to these proceedings and it seems that such an application would have succeeded, whereupon all the documents now in issue would have been seen by JK. Further, as explained, AB&#8217;s solicitors (I infer with the approval of EF and GH) have offered to provide JK with a considerable amount of information including information from the expert in old age psychiatry but yet AB, EF and GH oppose an application which seeks, amongst other things, disclosure of the evidence given by that expert to the court in the proceedings. Further, AB, EF and GH accept that JK is bound by the above order and has locus to apply under rule 13.4 for a reconsideration of the order. Nonetheless, they submit that JK should not have access to the documents which were before the court when it made the above order and if JK were minded to take legal advice on whether to apply to the court for a reconsideration of the order, he and his legal advisers should be left unaware of the material which was placed before the court and on which the court is likely to have relied, at least to some extent. </p>

Thus, the open justice principle applies where there has been a hearing in open court (whether or not a judicial decision was given) and to an application which leads to a judicial decision on the papers (that is, where there has not been a hearing in open court). Further, something akin to the open justice principle applies where there has been an application which is not pursued but where &#8220;there are strong grounds for thinking that it is necessary in the interests of justice&#8221; to allow a non-party to have access to the relevant documents. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in"><span style="font-style:italic">ABC v Y</span> involved a series of hearings in private. Later, a non-party applied for disclosure of relevant documents. The judge held that as there had been a good reason for holding the hearings in private there was similarly a good reason for not allowing a non-party to have access to the documents. The judge said, in the light of <span style="font-style:italic">Dian</span>, that even where there had not been a hearing in open court, the court could still permit a non-party to have access to documents where there were strong grounds for thinking that such access was necessary in the interests of justice. As there had been judicial decisions at private hearings in that case, then following <span style="font-style:italic">Dian</span> (as explained by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Dring</span>) the judge could have held that the open justice principle was engaged but it was still open to the judge to dispose of the case in the way in which he did. Essentially his view was that if there had been a good reason, notwithstanding the principles as to open justice, to hold the hearings in private, that would normally also be a good reason to withhold access for a non-party to the material used at those hearings. </p>

As regards matters which were agreed between the parties and which did not involve a judicial decision, the principle of open justice is not engaged save that there remains a power for the court to permit access to documents filed with the court if there are strong grounds for holding that such access is necessary in the interests of justice.  </p>

The case was due to be listed before me. On 23 November 2018, the solicitors for AB wrote to me stating that the parties had agreed a draft order which I was asked to make. The draft order was sent with the letter. The letter explained that the draft order included a declaration that Z lacked capacity to manage his property and affairs. The parties recognised that the court would only be prepared to make such a declaration if it was satisfied on the evidence before it that such a declaration was appropriate. The letter of 23 November 2018 specifically drew my attention to the expert evidence in the case. That evidence was principally from Professor Howard but in addition there was evidence from a Dr Series. The letter invited me to make this declaration and the remainder of the draft order without an oral hearing but stated that if I would be assisted by an oral hearing, then the parties agreed that such a hearing should be arranged. </p>

I considered whether it was appropriate to make declarations by consent appreciating that whilst I had jurisdiction to make a declaration by consent, I should be cautious before doing so. The draft declarations by consent related to the dispute between AB, EF and GH on the one hand and CD on the other as to lasting powers of attorney which Z had granted or purported to grant. The draft declarations were sought as a result of the parties&#8217; agreement as to which lasting powers of attorney would be effective and which would not. The parties&#8217; agreement was helpful as it resolved that dispute between the parties and provided clarity in that important matter. The draft order asked the court to declare that the parties&#8217; agreement about the powers of attorney was in the best interests of Z. I considered that it was in the best interests of Z for the dispute to be resolved by agreement. On that basis, I made the declarations by consent in accordance with the draft order. Finally, I reviewed the remainder of the draft order and concluded that it was a proper order to make. I considered that I did not need to have an oral hearing before reaching these conclusions. I made the order accordingly. </p>

That was certainly the case in relation to the declaration as to the capacity of Z. As regards the declarations by consent, there was an element of judicial decision making involved in that I had to be satisfied that it would be appropriate to make declarations by consent. Conversely, I did not have to decide the underlying dispute about the powers of attorney because the parties had settled that dispute. As I have explained, my judicial decision related to it being appropriate for me to record the agreement of the parties as declarations by consent but I did not make a judicial decision as to who would have succeeded if the disputed matters were to be determined at a trial. Accordingly, in relation to the substantial body of evidence which related to that dispute, I consider that the open justice principle is not engaged; however, I have power to allow JK to have access to that material if there are strong grounds for holding that it is in the interests of justice to allow him to have access. As regards the remainder of the material which was provided to the court in relation to matters which were settled and which were the subject of other parts of the order of 26 November 2018, the open justice principle was not engaged but, as before, I have power to allow JK to have access to that material if there are strong grounds for holding that it is in the interests of justice to allow him to have access. </p>

Z had been the protector of that trust. On 30 October 2017, the trustee constituted a protector committee in view of serious concerns which it then had about Z&#8217;s capacity to act as the protector of the trust. The protector committee consisted of a limited company, AB, EF, GH and another son of Z, but not JK. This decision was approved by Z at the time. On 15 January 2018, the trustee met JK to explain to him the trustee&#8217;s decision to constitute this committee. The trustee explained that its decision was supported by a medical report dated 21 December 2017, as to the capacity of Z, prepared by a consultant neurologist, Dr Jarman. In so far as JK is concerned about his exclusion from the protector committee, that matter came before the issue of the original proceedings. </p>

Later, during the course of the original proceedings, JK did intend to give a witness statement via CD&#8217;s lawyers. In the event, he did not give such a statement.

It should have been obvious to JK that a decision that Z lacked capacity would mean that Z could not act as a decision maker of any kind in relation to the family trust. It should also have been obvious to JK that in so far as he had asked Z in the past to act as a decision maker in relation to that trust so that JK would benefit from such a decision, that would not be possible if it were determined that Z lacked capacity. It should also have been clear to JK that the court in the original proceedings would be asked to decide on the validity of powers of attorney granted by Z and that those decisions would determine who were and who were not the validly appointed attorneys for Z.

I am somewhat sceptical as to the reasons he gives for not applying to be joined. His reasons have the appearance of being a reconstruction of his position at the time with a view to suggesting explanations as to why he did not participate in the proceedings at the time but yet he now applies for information which he could have obtained earlier. I am prepared to accept that he may not have foreseen in February 2018 everything that happened after the order of 26 November 2018. However, I consider that I do not need to make any findings as to the reasons JK had for not participating at the earlier stages. This is because what is of greater relevance is the fact that JK was given the ability to involve himself in the proceedings and to be fully informed about them but he did not seek to be involved and he did not ask for any information about them. </p>

They stated that it was important that JK received some clarity in circumstances where, according to a letter from solicitors for CD, the trustee had misreported the position regarding Z&#8217;s capacity to third parties. This must have been a reference to the trustee&#8217;s letter of 11 December 2018. I do not see anything in that letter which amounted to a misreporting as to Z&#8217;s capacity.

The application was supported by a witness statement from Mr Mowat, JK&#8217;s solicitor. Mr Mowat stated that JK had been excluded from family, financial and personal matters in consequence of the original proceedings. He gave the particular example of the forming of the protector committee which did not include JK, although this had happened before the issue of the original proceedings. Mr Mowat said that JK did not accept that Z lacked capacity for all matters. Mr Mowat explained that he had been asked to advise JK as to his position and to inform JK as to how the court made the orders which it did and he expressed the view that he could not do that without the documents he had requested.

He made detailed comments about his relationship with Z and with the other members of the family. He stated that while Z&#8217;s capacity had diminished with age and he had become more vulnerable, the recent attitude of the other family members was disparaging and hugely disrespectful of Z. JK explained that he would like to understand the evidential basis for the declaration as to Z&#8217;s capacity. He stated that as regards the powers of attorney, the important thing was that they were exercised properly. He said that he wanted to understand and scrutinise what happened in the original proceedings. He said that he wanted to be able to explain matters to Z himself. He suggested that Z wanted to seek independent legal advice in relation to the original proceedings and in relation to JK&#8217;s application. </p>

Professor Howard has no reason not to give a faithful account. The only possible reason to doubt his account is that JK may have been somewhat incoherent and he did call Professor Howard a fraud but this was misunderstood by Professor Howard as referring to Z. Neither version of the conversation reflects any credit on JK. If he called Z a fraud, then that is very revealing as to his relationship with Z, notwithstanding many statements in his evidence which seek to portray a very different relationship between Z and JK. If JK called Professor Howard a fraud, then it seems that JK is not prepared to accept Professor Howard&#8217;s professional judgment on the matters on which he has expressed his considered opinion. However, I have been given no reason to doubt Professor Howard&#8217;s professionalism, or objectivity or integrity so my conclusion would be that JK is being irrational on the subject of Z&#8217;s incapacity. </p>

AB explained that Professor Howard could assist the court if it had any questions in relation to those matters and Professor Howard was tendered for cross-examination by Mr Dew, counsel for JK. Professor Howard did attend the hearing on 25 November 2019. I did not wish to ask Professor Howard any questions to supplement his reports and his witness statement in relation to JK&#8217;s application. Mr Dew did not wish to ask Professor Howard any questions and suggested that the application for permission to have Professor Howard in court and the fact that he was tendered for cross-examination was entirely inappropriate and, in any event, unnecessary for the purposes of dealing with JK&#8217;s application for disclosure. </p>

JK responded by saying that this evidence was untrue or inaccurate and was, in any event, irrelevant to my decision. The evidence being irrelevant, he said it would not help me if he were to give his version of events and, in the main, he did not deal with the allegations against him. With one exception, to which I will refer below, I will not make findings as to these matters. I do not agree with JK that this evidence was irrelevant although in the end I am able to deal with his application without making findings in relation to it. The evidence was relevant because, if accurate, it showed that JK was a considerable source of conflict in the family, that his behaviour was unjustified and that it posed a risk of Z being involved in the conflict leading to harm to Z, contrary to his best interests. However, there are difficulties in my making findings of fact on disputed matters without the evidence being tested by cross-examination. Further, if I held that JK is a source of conflict and is ready to involve Z in that conflict in a way which is harmful to Z, the outcome of this application will not have a direct bearing on that possibility. If, in the past, JK has behaved in that way, the dismissal of his application will not of itself stop JK&#8217;s behaviour (unless the court imposes restrictions on JK and I have not been asked to do that). Similarly, if JK succeeds in his application to any extent, he will obtain documents which will probably not tell him very much but which may encourage him to involve Z in conflict and to cause harm to Z&#8217;s best interests. In addition to these considerations, there is the additional point that it may not help the members of this family to co-operate with each other in the future if I were to examine in detail all of the allegations and cross-allegations which have been made particularly where I do not need to do so to determine the present application.  </p>

It was not made clear whether this was a reference to the present application or to quite separate proceedings concerning JK&#8217;s son. It was clear to AB that JK wanted money quickly. AB said that JK was intimidating and provocative in his language to Z (and AB). JK told Z that JK was going to fly to the family office in Switzerland to sort matters out.

It should have been obvious to JK that it was not in Z&#8217;s best interests to fly him to the family office in Switzerland to have a confrontation there in order to force the family office to provide the money to JK, contrary to what they had written to others, including JK, on 11 December 2018, that they would not be able to accept Z&#8217;s instructions to make substantial payments out of the trust. If that was not obvious to JK, then his perception as to how to behave and the adverse effect of his behaviour on Z is seriously defective. If it was obvious to JK that he was not acting in the best interests of Z but was determined to obtain a large sum of money from the trust, then JK is also open to serious criticism. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Before considering the position in more detail, I comment that this is an unusual case in which to attempt to apply the open justice principle. The original proceedings were dealt with in private. The application for disclosure was heard in private. JK does not apply for the public to have access to any documents in these proceedings. It follows that if I were to accede to his application, this would not enable the public to scrutinise the way in which courts decide cases nor would it allow the public to understand the issues and the evidence adduced. In many respects, this case is not about open justice at all. Instead, it is an application by one individual for information about what happened in the proceedings where any such information will remain private. The parties are entitled to say that if JK had participated in the proceedings, </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">he could have had all this information but he chose not to obtain it. JK is entitled to respond that if he could have had all the information earlier, what is the difficulty about providing him with the information at this stage. The parties are then entitled to answer that by saying that they have offered repeatedly to provide JK with the information either from Professor Howard as to medical matters or from Macfarlanes as to anything else but JK has repeatedly refused to accept the information in that way. Instead, JK has insisted on the information being provided by means of disclosure of a large amount of material which had earlier been prepared, including a substantial body of evidence which was never used at any court hearing or in any decision. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Notwithstanding that general comment, I will attempt to analyse the case by applying the principles as to open justice as that is the way in which JK&#8217;s application is made. The major event in the original proceedings was the making of the order of 26 November 2018. As I explained earlier when discussing the legal principles, the open justice principle is engaged in relation to those parts of the order which involved a judicial decision. The declaration as to the capacity of Z involved a judicial decision. As regards the declarations by consent, there was an element of judicial decision making involved but there was not a judicial decision in relation to the underlying dispute about the powers of attorney, because the parties had settled that dispute. Accordingly, in relation to the substantial body of evidence which related to that dispute, the open justice principle is not engaged; however, I have power to allow JK to have access to that material if there are strong grounds for holding that it is in the interests of justice to allow him to have access. As regards the remainder of the material which was provided to the court in relation to matters which were settled and which were the subject of other parts of the order of 26 November 2018, the open justice principle is not engaged but, as before, I have power to allow JK to have access to that material if there are strong grounds for holding that it is in the interests of justice to allow him to have access. </p>

The third concerns the evidence as to matters which were settled and did not involve a judicial decision. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The declaration as to Z&#8217;s capacity was based on medical evidence which was not disputed by the parties. JK had been told at the outset that the proceedings would involve the court being asked to determine Z&#8217;s capacity but yet JK showed no interest whatsoever in being involved in that matter. He failed to respond to offers from Macfarlanes to answer any questions he might have had. The principal evidence came from Professor Howard. Professor Howard remains involved with Z&#8217;s care. He has prepared two further reports which have been provided to JK. JK has been invited to meet Professor Howard to ask any questions which he might have but he has shown no interest in doing so. The only time that JK spoke to Professor Howard (on 15 January 2019) he did not use the opportunity to seek information about Z&#8217;s capacity. JK did not want his counsel to cross-examine Professor Howard on any matter. </p>

If JK wanted more information about Z&#8217;s capacity, he has not put forward any good reason as to why he should obtain such information by means of an order as to the evidence prior to the order of 26 November 2018 instead of obtaining the information in the other ways in which it has been offered. Insofar as the medical evidence already provided to JK, in the form of Professor Howard&#8217;s two recent reports, deal with the up to date position rather than the position before November 2018, it is obviously the up to date position as to Z&#8217;s capacity which matters. JK stresses that he has no present intention of applying to the court for a reconsideration of the declaration as to Z&#8217;s capacity but if he were to apply for a reconsideration, then the court would focus on the current position in that respect and that is the subject of the more recent reports. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I consider that I have not been given a good reason for the court to make a compulsory order that the parties disclose the medical evidence which was relied upon when I made the order of 26 November 2018. Conversely, I am not persuaded that there is any very powerful reason why that evidence should be withheld. As I understand it, Professor Howard is prepared to answer all proper questions from JK as to Z&#8217;s capacity in the past and at present. It is therefore not obvious to me why Professor Howard&#8217;s earlier reports should not be available to JK if he genuinely wants to know what is in them.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I suspect that the dispute about the previous medical evidence has been caught up in the wider dispute about disclosure of documents. JK&#8217;s application is for everything or virtually everything which was filed with the court, including material relating to a dispute with CD which has been settled and the parties can legitimately take the view that that dispute should stay settled. Further, AB, EF and GH have real concerns about JK&#8217;s behaviour if he had access to all of the documents which he seeks and that behaviour might adversely affect Z. As against that, as I have already stated, absent any restrictions on JK&#8217;s behaviour, AB, EF and GH will no doubt continue to have concerns about JK&#8217;s behaviour whether he obtains the documents or not. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I also suspect that this application for disclosure is being brought and resisted for reasons which go beyond the legal arguments deployed before me. JK plainly feels excluded and wants the court to make orders in his favour and against AB, EF and GH which he will be able to see as a vindication of his position. However, when I am asked to make a compulsory order, an applicant must establish the grounds for such an order. In relation to the medical evidence which is sought by JK, he has not persuaded me that I should make that order. As regards the continuing relationship between JK and his family, I do not consider it is appropriate for the court to make an order, which is not otherwise justified, just for the purpose of allowing JK to claim vindication. </p>

In the order of 26 November 2018, I made declarations by consent. I did not need to, and I did not, consider the evidence as to that dispute. Instead, I was aware that this dispute within the family had been settled by the parties to the proceedings and indeed they had settled the wider dispute in relation to CD. I considered that such a settlement was to be welcomed in the wider interests of family harmony and was in the best interests of Z who was adversely affected by tension and conflict. As I have indicated the open justice principle is not engaged in relation to documents which were relevant to the dispute which was settled but which were not relevant to the limited decision which was made. The judicial decision relied on the fact of the settlement not the merits of the underlying dispute. Although I could order disclosure </p>

Insofar as the reference to scrutiny is a reference to scrutinising the behaviour of the court, the only specific matters mentioned on behalf of JK which might come within the subject of scrutiny appeared to be the reference to the proceedings being in private and to Z not being a party. Apart from those matters, the role of the court was limited to giving other case management directions and making the order of 26 November 2018. In this judgment, I have given a full explanation of the role of the court when it made the order of 26 November 2018. In fact, that explanation would not have been revealed by the disclosure of the documents sought by JK, which is what his application seeks. </p>

I am sure that is right and that is the wish of AB, CD, EF and GH also. However, I do not see how disclosure of a substantial number of documents to JK will serve to reduce conflict. The way to reduce conflict, so far as the subject matter of this application is concerned, is for JK to engage in a mature way with Professor Howard and if he genuinely wants to know more about the course of the earlier proceedings, for JK and his solicitors to ask Macfarlanes for information. It is not good enough for JK to say that he wants something and when that is not agreed by others for JK to say that the court must make an order in his favour to avoid conflict. JK can only obtain a court order in his favour if he demonstrates proper grounds for such an order.  </p>

On the other hand, Macfarlanes have on occasion suggested that they might be inhibited in providing certain information to JK because the proceedings were conducted in private. There should not be any real difficulty in this respect. If all of the parties agree that JK can be given the information which he seeks, subject to restrictions as to its continued confidentiality and (possibly) other restrictions as to its use, then that information can be provided to JK. If, contrary to my expectation, there are difficulties in this respect, then JK or a party can seek a direction from the court. </p>
