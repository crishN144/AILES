At the conclusion of the part of the hearing concerned with that application, I announced my decision that I would make the adoption order sought and that my reasons would follow in writing. I then went on to consider and determine an application for costs which is not the subject of this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">The adoption application is unusual. DD was born on <span style="color:initial">20</span><span style="color:#FF0000"/>December 1998 and is of Non UK  origin. She is, therefore, 18 years old and will be 19 on <span style="color:initial">20</span><span style="color:#FF0000"/>December 2017. Her mother is CC, who is also of non UK origin but lives in London. DD&#8217;s biological father has not been identified within these proceedings, although it appears that CC may know who he is. However, it appears uncontentious that the biological father has never had parental responsibility for DD or any involvement in her life. AA and BB were DD&#8217;s Special Guardians under an order made in the County Court on 24 April 2013 and, apart from a period of three months when she was in her mother&#8217;s care, she has lived with them since August 2011, when she came from outside the UK to live with them. The adoption application was issued on 14 December 2016, shortly before DD&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. The effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/49/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.49(4)</ref> and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.47(9)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (&#8220;ACA&#8221;) is that I may make an order notwithstanding that DD has attained her majority, but any such order must be made before her 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday.</p>

An Order of District Judge Gibson made on 27 February 2017 (by which time DD was already 18) recites that the judge confirmed at that hearing that the father&#8217;s consent to an adoption order was not required.</p>

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">However, the Authority feels unable to support the application and adopts a neutral position, and the Guardian does not support the application. In summary, in the course of carrying out their Rule 14.11 assessment, the Authority encountered some reluctance on the part of AA to share information and explore the background, in particular in respect of his adult children. On 27 February 2017, the Authority was ordered to prepare an addendum assessment. In the course of that assessment, they interviewed AA&#8217;s adult children. The Authority and the Guardian are concerned about the information given by some of those adult children, from whom AA is estranged. The Guardian is also concerned about information she has received from, DD&#8217;s psychotherapist. The Authority and the Guardian express concern about the following matters that they consider need to be taken into account in deciding whether or not the adoption order should be made:</p>

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">Notwithstanding that the above concerns raise factual issues, the adult children of AA were not asked to make witness statements or give oral evidence before me. At the start of the hearing, the parties informed me that nobody wished to cross-examine DD or AA. I understood that Miss Rensten was prepared to cross-examine the Guardian if I thought it necessary. The parties sought my guidance as to whether, as part of my inquisitorial oversight, I wished to hear oral evidence from AA or the Guardian. I considered that nothing would be gained by hearing oral evidence, in circumstances where the concerns of the Authority and the Guardian are founded on information provided by third parties who would not be giving evidence: i.e. on hearsay. It would have been futile to require the Guardian to be cross-examined about the reliability of such hearsay statements, since she could not speak to that, and the weight to be given to those statements was something that could more appropriately be dealt with in submissions. Whilst I could have insisted that AA give oral evidence, nobody wished to cross-examine him and it would potentially have been unfair to insist that he be cross-examined about factual matters founded on hearsay statements, which could not be tested by cross-examining their makers. I was therefore content to allow AA&#8217;s statements to stand as evidence in chief without the need for oral evidence. Furthermore, insofar as EE the psychotherapist expressed opinions to the Guardian about DD&#8217;s welfare, those opinions are not contained in an expert report, and very little explanation for them is recorded in the Guardian&#8217;s Analysis. It is therefore impossible to evaluate them in any reliable way. In those circumstances, the parties invited me to proceed on the basis of the written evidence and reports, taking into account the concerns expressed by the Authority and the Guardian and attributing to them such weight as I think appropriate. The hearing therefore proceeded on the basis of the written evidence and position statements supplemented by oral submissions made by Counsel on behalf of the Applicants, the Authority, and DD, and by the Guardian in person. CC did not attend the hearing, but wrote to the Court on 5 November 2017 stating that she continued to support AA and BB adopting DD. </p>

They came to the attention of the Authority in November 2011, following which FF returned to his country of origin and DD went to stay with CC for a period of time. However, she returned to live with AA and BB in April 2012, having expressed the wish to do so. In August 2012, following assessments, they were approved as private foster carers. In parallel, the Authority also carried out a Special Guardianship Assessment.  As noted above, on 24 April 2013 the County Court made a Special Guardianship Order.</p>

For example it records that the social worker who carried out a Core Assessment in early 2012 raised concerns regarding a lack of co-operation and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">controlling and manipulative behaviour</span>&#8221; in relation to the Authority&#8217;s involvement. There is a suggestion that, in May 2012, AA and BB asked for their solicitor to attend all home visits and for them to be tape recorded, which the Authority declined, although the report states that AA and BB did then engage in the private fostering assessment. There is also reference to difficulty in obtaining references and family details for the purposes of the Special Guardianship Assessment; it is said that the Authority was unable to complete that assessment, which was subsequently completed by a different authority where AA and BB had moved to be nearer to DD&#8217;s school. On the other hand, that other authority reported that AA and BB had engaged and worked with them for the purposes of the assessment. </p>

On the limited evidence available to me, it is impossible to come to any conclusions about where the fault for this lies, but whatever the concerns were during that period of assessment, the Court was clearly satisfied that it was appropriate to make the Special Guardianship Order.</p>

It appears common ground that, whilst DD has maintained her relationship with CC, it is AA and BB who have met all of her basic, day to day needs, cared for her, and exercised parental responsibility for her during that time. In her own statement, dated 24 October 2017, she refers to AA as &#8220;Dad&#8221; and to CC as &#8220;Mom&#8221;; she refers to BB by her forename. She says that she would feel proud to be adopted by them and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">it would be a true reflection of my family life and of the stable home I have with [them] and my sense of belonging there.

In their first statement dated 12 December 2016, they say that DD had been asking them to adopt her for some time but they had waited until the last minute to be sure that this is what she wants. The Rule 14.11 report states that CC reported that DD had wanted AA and BB to adopt her for some time and that CC had wished her to wait until she was over 16 years old to make that decision. DD was seen on 3 August 2016 alone, on 28 November 2016 with AA and BB for a family session, and on a number of other shorter occasions including 17 February 2017. On each occasion, adoption and its potential implications were discussed, and DD stated that she wished to be adopted by AA and BB as she wished to feel a belonging to the family and support her identity. She felt this would support her emotional wellbeing. She intended to continue to have contact with her birth family. AA and BB encouraged her to see CC and will continue to do so. According to their first statement dated 12 December 2016, DD visited her family in their country of origin during the summer of 2016, but asked to return home early; they suggest this was because she did not feel at home there, having absorbed British culture so much.</p>

Somebody using a forename similar to DD&#8217;s (but spelt differently) had tried to contact him via iMessage on 19 March, but he had ignored it. Many years ago he had been advised to sever all ties with AA. He wanted nothing to do with AA or the people that surround him. He wanted no contact from AA, BB , DD or anybody associated with them and would regard any attempt to contact him as harassment.</p>

	      <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;border:none">PA had not had contact with AA for over 12 years. He was shocked to receive a letter regarding DD&#8217;s adoption. He did not understand how anybody could adopt an 18 year old and described the situation as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">bizarre</span>&#8221;. He was under the impression that DD and FF were AA&#8217;s biological children. He stated that during his childhood AA was a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">good father</span>&#8221; in the sense that he provided well for the family, but he was often absent and their mother was their primary carer. AA was a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">domineering and controlling father who demanded the respect of his children</span>&#8221; &#8211; although PA said that is some ways this was positive. However, he described AA as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">brilliant and a strategist&#8221;</span> who assumed authority by being charming, but only did that in order to gain from the interaction. He suggested that his father was financially controlling, and had abandoned his mother and children after the divorce. He was evidently very upset about AA&#8217;s relationship with BB and was of the view that they had had an affair before AA separated from his first wife. He had a close relationship with AA until he was about 26, about the time of his parents&#8217; divorce, when he felt like a puppet under AA&#8217;s control, and under his thumb. He suggested that AA was being sued for dishonest business practices, implied that he had behaved In an unethical way, that there was a warrant for his arrest, and that AA had previously sued him for libel and they had been involved in legal battles prior to their estrangement. He was very cautious of AA. He did not want to go against him as, despite everything, AA remains his father who he wishes to honour.</p>

	      <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;border:none">GA last had contact with AA at her paternal grandmother&#8217;s funeral about 5 years ago. Other than that, they had not had ongoing contact for approximately 12 years. AA was not present during much of her childhood. Her parents had a very difficult relationship and there was a high level of stress within the home environment &#8211; GA suggested this included several physical arguments, although no details are recorded in the assessment. AA&#8217;s former wife experienced depression through a great deal of GA&#8217;s childhood, which impacted on the children. GA stated that AA was paranoid and moved the family around a lot to avoid being served with papers in relation to litigation. She described occasions when her mother dressed in disguise and they moved to different motels, and when the children were asked to hide &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">in the floorboards of a car</span>&#8221; to avoid being served with papers, although AA later won the case. She said that AA enjoyed being involved in &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">drama</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">fighting others</span>&#8221;. G<span style="color:initial">A</span> stated that, when she was about 5 or 6 years old, GA said AA promised her a trip to a theme park if she would visit a nutritionist; she was later dropped off at the home of her grandmother (who she said &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">she did not feel was a known adult to her</span>&#8221; from where she was taken to sessions with a nutritionist who measured her body fat with calipers, which she said was extremely traumatic. She stated that AA had different relationships with each of his children and used relationships to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">feed himself</span>&#8221; based on what he can draw out of a person. GA feels that he is narcissistic. Whilst she is open to reconciliation, she was concerned about him having contact with her 3 year old daughter due to her own childhood experiences and a fear that AA would use the relationship for his own benefit, in that he only demonstrates an interest in others when it benefits him. She gave an example of an occasion when AA gave her a job in the church so that she could save to buy a car but then did not pay her. During the same period he contacted the police because he did not like her boyfriend (who was 18 while she was still under 18 at the time). This was during the period when AA and his former wife were going through divorce proceedings and it was a difficult time as a family. AA had tried to reach out to them prior to her grandmother&#8217;s funeral, but she perceived this to be because it looked bad for his children to be estranged from him and did not come from his heart. She implied that her sister had only reconciled with AA because he had provided a house for her. She was concerned that DD might have similar experiences.</p>

She refutes any suggestion that she has been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">brainwashed</span>&#8221; by AA. She says that she is able to disagree with him and, if they disagree, he respects what she has to say and lets her speak her mind. He is protective of her but also supportive of what she tries to do. She gives examples of ways in which she has taken her own decisions contrary to the views of AA. She does not share his views about Christianity. It was her decision to discharge herself from the clinic, contrary to his wishes. She says she now knows what Stockholm syndrome is; she denies that she has this syndrome and says she regards the suggestion as ridiculous. She also disagrees that she is desperate to find out who her biological father is and says that has been misreported by EE. She gives evidence about the steps she is taking to recover from bulimia, including participation in a 12 step programme. She says that she has always maintained a good relationship with CC, and AA and BB have supported this. An adoption order will not change her practical relationship with CC, but she understands it will change her legal relationship.</p>

Nonetheless, the paternal grandmother was clearly a relative, not an unknown adult. The Guardian further appears to accept uncritically the information that GA was taken to a therapist who used calipers to measure her body fat, and that this was extremely traumatic, without taking into account that GA was apparently 6 years old at the time, which may have distorted her memory of this event. She suggests that the concerns about this event partly reflect DD&#8217;s eating disorder, but on the evidence available to me I consider the suggestion of any link between the two to be pure speculation;</p>

An application to adopt a child who turns 18 during the course of the proceedings is undoubtedly unusual but it is expressly provided for by the legislation. Bearing in mind the context, that DD has been in the care of AA and BB for about 6 years, that they had parental responsibility for her after the special guardianship order was made, and that she regards them as her parents and they regard her as their child, I do not accept that the application to adopt her is either dubious or bizarre;</p>

However, it is notable that, although a number of referrals were made to the Authority in relation to DD&#8217;s mental health and well-being, the Authority did not think it necessary to intervene, because they were satisfied with the support plan AA and BB had in place and that they were adequately safeguarding DD; therefore, they did not find evidence of abuse or neglect that would justify their intervention. </p>

Furthermore, in my view, the Guardian&#8217;s analysis does not adequately take into account the current status quo: AA and BB have been caring for DD for most of the last 6 years, they had and were exercising parental responsibility for her until she turned 18, she regards them as her parents, she will continue to reside with them for the foreseeable future, and they will continue to support her in the future. The Guardian&#8217;s statement that it is questionable whether DD&#8217;s relationship with her birth family should be severed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;to enable AA and</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial"> BB</span><span style="font-style:italic"> to legally adopt an 18 year old</span>&#8230;&#8221; does not, in my view, do justice to the circumstances of this case. The purpose of the application is not to enable them to adopt &#8220;an 18 year old&#8221;, but to enable them to adopt DD, who they have cared for since 2011 and is already part of their family; furthermore, seen from DD&#8217;s point of view, the purpose of the application is to enable her to be adopted and thereby legally integrated the family she already views as her real family. As Miss Roberts recognised when making submissions on behalf of the Authority, whilst the Guardian&#8217;s concerns might have been more significant if DD was still a young child, their importance is significantly diminished in the circumstances that now exist.</p>

Miss Whittam informed me that she had come to court to present her application actively, because she feels strongly and passionately about it. Her wishes and feelings have been consistent for some time. The evidence in the Rule 14.11 report and the Guardian&#8217;s Analysis show that she is an articulate and reflective young woman whose competence is not in doubt. She was acutely aware of the instability in her early years but AA (who she called &#8220;Dad&#8221;) and BB had given her that stability. She wanted to express to the world who her family are and would not be able to do that without an adoption order because AA and BB would not be her legal parents. An adoption order would reflect the reality of her experience. She did not want to miss the opportunity she now had to give legal effect to her relationship with them. She wished to continue to have a relationship with CC and her birth family, saw no difficulty with that and said that AA and BB had supported it. She also saw the benefit of being able to embrace the wider family of AA and BB in their respective countries of origin. According to the Rule 14.11 Report, she has consistently said to the Social Worker since August 2016 that she wished to be adopted, and CC reported that she has expressed that wish since before she was 16, which is consistent with the evidence of AA and BB.</p>

In broad terms the spectrum will run from a fully opposed, public law &#8216;stranger&#8217; adoption at one extreme, to an adoption within the child&#8217;s existing &#8216;de facto&#8217; family unit, which is made with the consent of both parents. In between there will be step-parent adoptions which are actively opposed by &#8216;Parent B&#8217;, who is himself fully involved in the life of his child, or step-parent adoptions&#8230;where Parent B, whilst not consenting, has played no active parental role for some years</p>

For the child, and for the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life, there will be a qualitative difference between adoption by strangers, with no continuing contact or legal relationship with any member of the birth family, on the one hand, and an adoption order which simply reflects in legal terms the reality in which the child&#8217;s family life and relationships have been conducted for some significant time</span>. In ECHR terms, no adoption order will be justified in terms of its interference with family life rights unless it is &#8216;necessary&#8217; and &#8216;proportionate&#8217;, but in assessing those factors the degree to which there is an interference will be relevant.&#8221; (Emphasis added).</p>

Each case must be decided on its own facts and in its own context. Adoption applications lie within a spectrum of severity of interference.

CC has consented to the adoption; DD, who is now an adult, wishes the order to be made; AA and BB have cared for DD since she was 13 years old and were her Special Guardians for the last 3 &#189; years of her minority; I accept that they have been, and are, highly committed to caring for and supporting her, and it is clear from the evidence that they regard themselves, and DD regards them, as being in substance her parents; I accept Miss Rensten&#8217;s submissions that they are her psychological parents; an adoption order in this case would thus give effect to the existing status quo that they regard themselves as family members in a parent/ child relationship.</p>

Indeed, when Miss Roberts was addressing me on the need to consider whether an adoption order in this case was a proportionate interference under Article 8, I was struggling to understand how, in this case, the order could be an interference with the right to respect for the family life of CC and DD in anything other than a hypothetical sense, given that they both agree to the order being made; Miss Rensten submitted that there is no infringement of DD&#8217;s rights in this case.

On the other hand, Miss Rensten submitted that to treat AA and BB as other than parents, or to introduce a hierarchy between biological and psychological parenting, would be to discriminate against them in relation to their Article 8 rights, contrary to Article 14 of the Convention, and they should therefore be treated as DD&#8217;s de facto parents. As set out above, I agree that they have become her psychological and de facto parents; but the relevant provisions of the ACA necessarily distinguish between (biological) parents and non-parents, because the latter need the court&#8217;s approval to become legal parents by adoption. I consider the answer to Miss Rensten&#8217;s submission is that, as set out above, the court must properly reflect the context of the case in its assessment of welfare and proportionality; provided it does so, I do not consider that Article 14 is engaged. However, I accept that the Article 8 rights of DD, AA and BB require me to take into account their de facto relationship, and their desire to give legal effect to that relationship, in my analysis of the requirements of welfare and proportionality in this case.</p>

In almost every way Mr. TMI had become A&#8217;s and D&#8217;s father. The making of an adoption order would confirm that status as a matter of law. It would also render A and D full siblings in the eyes of the law (not a factor considered by the judge in his analysis). It was the outcome that A firmly wished for.

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">In my judgment, McFarlane LJ was there saying that a number of matters, which he set out, were crucial and determinative factors in favour of making an adoption order. Those factors all related in some way to the benefits that an adoption order would bring by harmonising the child&#8217;s legal and de facto family life. Very similar factors exist in this case, and, as will be seen below, I think those factors together with DD&#8217;s wishes are decisive in the balance on the facts of this case. But, in my view, McFarlane LJ was there dealing with the balance of welfare in the circumstances of the case before him, not laying down a principle of wider application. Furthermore, it was the combination of factors, not just A&#8217;s wishes and feelings, that McFarlane LJ found to be crucial and determinative. I think it is going too far to suggest that the passage cited supports the proposition that DD&#8217;s wishes and feelings should be determinative in this case or that I can ignore the other factors in the welfare checklist. This is an unusual case, in which the statute provides that DD falls within the definition of a child for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref>, and I am therefore required to consider all of the welfare requirements in that section, not just DD&#8217;s wishes although, as set out below, they should be given substantial weight given her age and competence. As I have said above, I am grateful to the Guardian for her assistance, and I have considered the countervailing welfare issues she has raised, although as will already be apparent, I have disagreed with her analysis and recommendation.</p>

As I have recognised above, any consideration of the Article 8 rights that operate in this case must take into account the reality of the existing family relationships and desire of DD, AA and BB, consented to by CC, to give legal effect to their relationship. Although parental responsibility is no longer an issue, and an adoption order will not bring with it the benefit of conferring parental responsibility, the legal harmonisation of DD&#8217;s de facto relationship with AA and BB will nonetheless have important, lifelong effects. The Guardian suggests that DD could change her name by deed poll, but that will not alter her legal relationship to AA and BB: an adoption order is the only way in which the de facto parent-child relationship can be legally confirmed. The letters from DD&#8217;s doctors and therapists referred to in paragraph 20 above all suggest that there may be welfare benefits for DD from the making of an adoption order. The welfare factors set out in the foregoing section of this Judgment generally suggest that DD&#8217;s welfare would be served by the making of an adoption order.</p>

One reason suggested by the Guardian is that, contrary to the expectations of her doctors and therapists, the fact of adoption may not have any psychological benefit for DD and &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">may impact in the longer term on her emotional wellbeing when reality hits that nothing has changed</span>.&#8221; Of course, it is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the fact of adoption will bring the psychological benefits anticipated by DD&#8217;s doctors and therapists. The Guardian recognised that adoption may bring the benefits hoped for by DD and her therapists. However, it may turn out that DD&#8217;s daily reality will not change, and this will have an adverse impact on her. This raises the possibility that DD may, in future, regret the making of the adoption order. However, as set out above, the evidence shows that DD has consistently expressed her wishes and feelings for some time. When I put to Miss Whittam the possibility of later regret, she informed me that DD understood what was involved in an adoption order. Nevertheless, she wished me to make the order. </p>

That is a significant consideration. Whereas a young child is completely dependent on her adult carers to meet her needs, help her to form and maintain important relationships, and take the important decisions that will determine her future, as an adult DD is now responsible for these things. She can expect to be guided by her parents, but she is legally responsible for the choices she makes, and the inherently unpredictable, short and long term consequences of those choices. She has already formed important relationships with her birth family and with AA and BB. She is entitled to decide for herself what is in her best interests, how she wishes to meet her physical and emotional needs, and how she forms and carries on important relationships. Insofar as it is up to her, she can decide how closely she wishes to maintain her day to day relationship with her biological mother and family, and with AA and BB, and with others who are or who become important to her. She is now entitled to marry, and thereby to alter her legal relationship with the person who becomes her spouse.</p>

Furthermore, a marriage may be dissolved, but adoption involves a permanent, lifelong change in legal identity. The requirement to consider the child&#8217;s welfare &#8220;throughout his life&#8221; reflects the fact that adoption involves a permanent change in the child&#8217;s legal identity, severing their legal relationship with their birth family and grafting them legally onto their adoptive family. However, marriage at least provides an illustration of the freedom DD has, as an adult, to choose to form what is a very significant legal as well as personal relationship.</p>

	    <p class="Body" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;border:none">The above considerations suggest to me that very great weight should be given in the welfare balance to DD&#8217;s wishes and feelings, notwithstanding the possibility raised by the Guardian that DD will be disappointed to find that daily reality does not change, and may even regret the making of the order. In short, significant respect should be given to the fact that she is now an autonomous person, able to take responsibility for her own decisions and the way in which those decisions may shape her future.</p>

An adoption order is proportionate in the circumstances of this case. </p>
