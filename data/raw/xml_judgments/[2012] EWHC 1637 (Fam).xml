The local authority was absolutely opposed to C living with any family member on the basis that it was too dangerous.  The Guardian on balance supported the local authority.  At that time the various criminal trials, described in the unedited judgment, were a long way off.  Had C remained in foster care, which was not going well for her, she would probably have been there for at least a year before a decision could be made about her future.</span></p>

After negotiation between senior management and the court, the local authority agreed to place C with her aunt under an interim care order on the basis that it provided the services while the court accepted responsibility for the risks.  I commended the local authority for this, as C needed the security of a care order at that stage.  </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The proceedings continued after the first report of Dr Lucey and the criminal proceedings because there was no agreement about the final outcome. Both interim applications, referred to in the paragraph above, reflected the rather poor relationship between the aunt and the local authority.  In May, the aunt wanted a residence order so as to become a family carer rather than a foster carer.  I dismissed the application, not because of any concern about her care of C, but because there still needed to be an interim care order at that stage.  Then, in September, the position was the other way round.  The local authority remained aloof on the question of whether the aunt should be granted permission to apply for an SGO or adoption order.  Furthermore, it had referred the aunt&#8217;s position to its fostering panel.  This arose from what it regarded as her lack of cooperation with its procedures.  I was so concerned at the state of affairs that I asked for confirmation that the referral was not in fact going to lead to the aunt being deregistered as a foster carer and, having had that confirmed, I recorded it in the order.  As it happens, the local authority persisted with the referral, but the aunt was not criticised by the panel and the placement continued.</span></p>

There then followed detailed negotiations about the terms of an adoption support package, which were not concluded until the second day of the hearing on 23 May.  The local authority will continue to pay an adoption allowance and will fund specialist therapy for C.</span></p>

Without the aunt, C could not have remained within her family.  Given her age and the disturbing family history, adoption outside the family would have been unlikely, and she would have faced the bleak prospect of spending the rest of her childhood in foster care.  In that sense, the desirable outcome for C was clear from the moment that she was placed with her aunt.  Whether the placement would succeed could not be known until it was tried, but it was objectively going to be best for C if she could remain with the aunt, particularly after the outcome of the criminal trials.</span></p>

C was placed with her in a highly charged situation.  The placement, which had not had the support of the authorities, was strongly opposed by the father at the time that it was made.  The mother, the aunt&#8217;s sister, was not to be allowed any contact.  The grandmother, the aunt&#8217;s mother, was only to have a peripheral role.  The aunt was preoccupied, if not overloaded, with the demands of settling and looking after a disturbed child who knew (and still knows) only part of what has happened within her family.  The secrecy of the placement has had to be maintained against family members and outsiders.  The aunt has needed to deal with professionals (the local authority, the Guardian) whose ultimate support was uncertain.  At the same time as all this she has been holding down a full-time job.  Added to all that, she was expected to participate in the proceedings without having the means to do so.</span></p>

At that stage, and well into 2011, the parents and the grandmother had leading and junior counsel. </span></p>

I suspect that both could have done more to make things go smoothly.  However, my reading of the situation, gained from two hearings in 2011 and one in 2012, is that the local authority was slow to see the big picture, which is that this was a placement that needed the fullest encouragement from the start.  Instead its approach was that it needed to be satisfied by the evidence that C&#8217;s permanent placement with her aunt was something it should support.  It was entitled to choose this approach, but it had consequences for the working relationship with the aunt, who understandably detected a lack of enthusiasm on its part.  For example, at the hearing in May 2011, the court heard positive observations about the aunt&#8217;s parenting from Dr Lucey, C&#8217;s school, and from a fostering support social worker who had assessed the aunt.  In contrast, there were no very positive observations from the allocated social worker and mixed comments from the Guardian, while a former play therapist in fact doubted the aunt&#8217;s ability to meet C&#8217;s needs.  I have already noted that it was not until May 2012 that the aunt knew that her wish to care permanently for C had clear official support.  </span></p>

In this regard, the submission of the local authority that a distinction can be drawn between correspondence about the aunt&#8217;s position as a foster carer and her position as a litigant is only likely to be made good where the distinction can be clearly seen.  The aunt&#8217;s position as both a family foster carer and a putative permanent carer has been closely interlinked and it will generally be artificial to attempt to separate one role from the other.  However, the local authority is entitled to draw attention to any instances where the contrary can be clearly shown.</span></p>

To eliminate delay, the court will, where appropriate, need to use every weapon at its disposal.  The sword of costs may need to be more frequently unsheathed in both private law and public law proceedings. </span></p>
