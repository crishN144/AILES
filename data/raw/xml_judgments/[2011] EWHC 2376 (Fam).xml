I propose to read the rule which deals with these matters: it is taken from the Rules of the Supreme Court Order 52, rule 6. which now appears in Schedule 1 to the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR)</p>

Had I sent her to prison in private my decision would have been unlawful and the Court of Appeal would have had the power to set it aside.   I, myself, have been very critical of a judge who sentenced a contemnor without hearing mitigation and without going into open court to do so; see the case of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Hammerton v Hammerton</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2007/248" uk:canonical="[2007] EWCA Civ 248" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] EWCA Civ 248</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 2 FLR 133" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 2 FLR 133</ref>, in which the order of the judge  was set aside.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My second point is, I appreciate, repetitious.  The Family court are frequently accused of acting &#8220;in secret&#8221;. It needs to be emphasised that courts hearing cases involving children under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> sit in private to hear evidence because they are democratically authorised to do so by Parliament.   They do so to protect the interests and confidentiality of children.   The courts thus regard - and I certainly regard - with particular seriousness any breach of a court order designed to protect the identify and confidentiality of a child.</p>

Every child case involves a balance between the rights enjoyed by everybody to respect for their private and family lives:  see Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).   In each case <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, enacted by Parliament, requires the welfare of the child to be paramount; that is more important than anything else.</p>

It will no do harm in this judgment to read in Article 10 of ECHR which, of course, is now part of the English law as enacted by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>:</p>

For present purposes the decision of the House on the facts of</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">&#160;</span><span class="apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Campbell</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">&#160;</span><span class="apple-style-span" style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">and the differences between the majority and the minority are not material. What does, however, emerge clearly from the opinions are four propositions. First, neither article has </span><span class="apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">as such</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">&#160;</span><span class="apple-style-span" style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test. This is how I will approach the present case.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Another aspect which makes Ms. Watson&#8217;s contempt particularly grave is that she breached the order not only by communicating through e-mails with a large number of third parties, but also gave material to an internet provider, one Sabine McNeill who runs a website called </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Inquiring Minds</span><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">.  Ms. McNeill (who at one point acted as Ms. Watson&#8217;s McKenzie Friend in these proceedings) lives, I am told, in Germany although she has a flat in London.   The mischief of the publication, as Ms. Watson now appreciates, is that the publication of allegations which I and two other judges held to be without foundation not only puts the identity of the child into the public domain and renders it accessible to anybody who cares to look for it or to read it; but equally, Ms Watson has put herself in the hands and the power of the internet provider. The omens do not altogether look good.</span></p>

She should be extremely grateful to her counsel and to the solicitors whom she has chosen.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the factors I have outlined and the contents of my previous judgment explain why a prison sentence for Ms. Watson was inevitable.   She has today, herself, expressed (both through counsel and personally) contrition.   In plain language she has told me she is very sorry for what she has done.   I have thought about this very carefully and I am satisfied that she has done what she can to remove from the internet the offending material which she caused to be placed there.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What I propose to do in these circumstances is to suspend Ms. Watson&#8217;s sentence.   I would be entitled, if I wished, to keep her in prison until such time as the blog to which I have been referred and which is the one outstanding matter has been investigated and those responsible for it have been given the opportunity to remove the e-mail.   I have considered that option very carefully.   I have decided, however, in the end not to do it.   I am satisfied that Ms. Watson has had a very unpleasant experience in prison.   I am willing to accept her undertaking &#8211; which has the force of a court order &#8211; to use her best endeavours to remove the offending e-mail from the blog and I am satisfied that to keep her imprisoned would serve no real purpose as far as she is concerned.</p>

Provided there is no repetition and provided Ms. Watson complies with her undertaking and provided she is not in breach of the order within the next two years, that will be the end of the matter.   If she is in breach or if there is any repetition for which she is responsible or partly responsible, she will go back to prison and serve the remainder of her term.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To the operator of the blog which continues to print the offending e-mail &#8211;  which I will not read out &#8211; I say very simply that it would be in the interests of the child with whom I am concerned for it to be removed.   Its presence does not and will not advance mother&#8217;s cause one iota.   Of course, there can be criticism of the family justice system, but the criticism must be rational, balanced and fair.   The e-mail in question is none of these things and the sooner it is removed the better.</p>

I have read the Emails written by Ms Watson to Sabine McNeill. I have not heard from the local authority.</p>

I also accept their assurance that they have been instructed by Ms Watson  to carry our their own checks, and that these have revealed one further  potentially offending article which has been removed. Subject to the emergence of material about which I am currently ignorant, I am content to accept that Ms Watson has complied with her undertaking. </p>

Their work is hugely demanding and often highly stressful&#8221;. Those who criticise the System and the integrity of those who work within it would do well to bear these findings in mind.</p>

Everybody is entitled to free speech; but equally nobody is entitled to breach an order of the court.</p>
