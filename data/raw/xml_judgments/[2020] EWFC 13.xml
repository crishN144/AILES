The second application is an application, also by the wife for an order injuncting the husband from selling the former matrimonial home unless he agrees to the wife&#8217;s proposed terms for an escrow agreement with respect to the sale of the former matrimonial home. The parties remain agreed that the former matrimonial home should be sold. </p>

Save in respect of child maintenance, the consent order makes no provision for periodical payments and effects a clean break by dismissing the parties&#8217; respective claims for periodical payments orders. </p>

The husband is 54 and is a German Citizen, born in Leipzig in what was at that time East Germany.  The husband moved to Russia in 1982.  The parties began a relationship in 2000 and began to cohabit in 2004.  They married in April 2006.  The parties have two children, a son, who is 11 years old, and daughter, who is 8 years old.  The husband has three other children from previous relationships.   </p>

The wife case is that she gave up work in 2008 following the birth of the parties&#8217; first child. In 2014 the parties relocated with the children to England.  The marriage broke down in 2017 over the Christmas and New Year period. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dealing in detail first with the background to the application by the wife for maintenance pending suit, as I have noted, a key feature in this application is the existence of a concluded financial remedies consent order.  In 2009, the parties entered into a post nuptial agreement in Russia.  In 2014, the parties entered into a second post nuptial agreement in England.  At the time the parties entered into the second agreement, the husband was advised by Withers and leading counsel and the wife was advised by Charles Russell and leading counsel.  The second post nuptial agreement provided that, upon divorce, the wife would receive total assets of some &#163;40M from the husband. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Following the breakdown of the marriage, on 10 January 2018 the parties signed an agreement which was expressed to be in full and final settlement of all claims that each may make against the other in connection with their marriage or on death.  The agreement provided the wife with assets of some &#163;32M (the husband contending that the agreement differed from the 2014 post-nuptial agreement by reason of changes in his financial position between 2014 and 2018).  The wife now contends that she was pressured into signing this agreement by the husband (who she alleges implied there would be serious adverse personal consequences for the husband and financial consequences for the family if she did not sign) at a time when she was shocked and distressed at the very recent breakdown of the marriage. </p>

The wife contends that she remained in a state of shock at the breakdown of the marriage and has a poor recall of this meeting.  The wife originally contended that the file from Farrer &amp; Co should not be disclosed by reason of legal professional privilege.  However, she eventually conceded to its disclosure.    It is accepted by all parties that Farrer &amp; Co did not see the agreement of 10 January 2018, or the subsequent draft consent order the wife ultimately signed on 22 January 2018.  However, disclosure of the file from Farrer &amp; Co shows that over the course of the one and a half hour consultation with Caroline Holley:   </p>

You would go for the house in Sardinia for sure&#8221; and received clear advice that &#8220;this is a fraction&#8221; of what she could expect to receive in financial remedy proceedings based on her assessment of the husband&#8217;s worth (which the wife estimated at &#163;500M), that he would wish to do such a deal as he would be &#8220;getting off lightly&#8221; but that this would be the wife&#8217;s decision. </p>

On 22 January 2018 the wife also signed a statement of information for a consent order (Form D81) and signed the revised version on 28 January 2018 but now contends she does not remember doing so. The wife contends that as a result of threats made by the husband she also withdrew her instructions from Farrer &amp; Co on 26 January 2018.  The file from Farrer &amp; Co contains an attendance note of that date in which it is recorded that the wife was withdrawing her divorce petition against advice, that the wife stated she &#8220;trusted&#8221; the husband and that she understood that if she had reached an agreement with the husband she should take legal advice on its terms. </p>

Both those documents bear that date and the signature of the wife.  The file from Farrer &amp; Co which details the meeting on 16 January 2018 reports the wife (via LK) as telling Farrer &amp; Co that the husband had told her he was going to issue divorce proceedings.  By contrast, the wife now contends that on 8 June 2018 she received a certificate of entitlement to decree and was again shocked as she contends she had not received a divorce petition and had not knowingly signed an acknowledgement of service.   </p>

Specifically, the husbands points to the fact that the wife has now taken over the fifteen franchises in Russia pursuant to the terms of the consent order, signing the relevant documents on 30 June 2018, after which the wife actively managed the business and retained the profits therefrom.  He further asserts that the wife found an alternative property in Ascot, which the husband purchased for her in the sum of &#163;2.25M as part of the financial agreement between them.  On 6 July 2018 the wife signed a document confirming that the purchase price of her new property would be offset against her entitlement under the consent order.   The husband has sought from the wife disclosure of messages she sent to him on a messaging app called Theema, contending that these further evidence the wife&#8217;s enthusiastic participation in the implementation of the terms of the consent order.  The wife now contends that messages from the app are no longer available as she sat on the telephone, which had the effect of permanently deleting the app, preventing her from accessing the messages. </p>

With respect to the latter, the wife asserts that the husband &#8220;stripped&#8221; assets out of that business in the form of a $686,000 dividend and a withdrawal of $385,000 prior to the business being transferred to her.  The wife contends that the husband refuses to allow her access to &#8364;1,479,886 to which she is entitled under the terms of the consent order, placing her under financial pressure.   </p>

The wife signed these letters on 6 and 11 July 2018 respectively.

In September 2018 the wife returned to England with the children from holiday in Sardinia to find, on her case, a bare minimum of her and the children&#8217;s personal items from the matrimonial home and that the husband (or someone else in the household) had opened some boxes and left them in disarray.

There is borrowing secured against the property of &#163;17,325,000.  There is no agreed valuation before the court but the husband contends the property is now worth between &#163;20M and &#163;22M. In September 2018 the wife registered a Home Rights Notice against the former matrimonial home.  On 11 February 2019 the husband applied to the Land Registry to cancel that notice.  The wife has now secured a stay of that application based on the interlocutory application before this court for injunctive relief.  The husband contends that a sale of the former matrimonial home has fallen through due to the existence of the Home Rights Notice.  On 18 April 2019 the parties reached agreed terms with respect to an escrow agreement to deal with the sale of the former matrimonial home.  However, as matters stand, that agreement has broken down. </p>

At one point Mr Holden seemed determined to present that history to the court stage by agonisingly detailed stage.  However, the genesis of the current dispute is a depressingly familiar one.  Namely, an irreconcilable breakdown in trust.  The wife does not trust the husband to deal honestly with the proceeds of any sale of the former matrimonial home and contends that the same will only be sufficiently safeguarded by their being an escrow agreement in terms agreed by the parties (to which proposal the husband agreed, although agreement as to the terms has foundered).  By contrast, the husband contends that he can be trusted and that, to the extent that the wife&#8217;s requires reassurance, an undertaking by his solicitors to hold the proceeds of the sale of the former matrimonial home is sufficient to protect the wife&#8217;s interests, which undertaking he has offered.   </p>

Mr Chamberlayne further submits that, whereas in <span style="font-style:italic">BN v MA </span>the court was dealing with a prenuptial agreement, in circumstances where this court is dealing with a consent order approved by the court, the wife&#8217;s application requires an even closer scrutiny of the likelihood of the wife succeeding in having the order agreed between the parties set aside. </p>

Within this context, it is important also to note the principles that are applied on an application to set aside a consent order.  In this regard, Mr Chamberlayne reminds the court that, as I have already noted, PD9A paragraph 13.8 states that in an application to set aside a financial remedy consent order pursuant to FPR r 9.9A(a)(ii) the starting point is that the order which one party is seeking to have set aside is properly made.  Paragraph 13.5 of PD 9A further makes clear that the grounds on which a financial remedy order may be set aside are and will remain a matter for decision by judges but include fraud, material non-disclosure, certain limited types of mistake or a subsequent event, unforeseen and unforeseeable at the time the order was made, which invalidates the basis on which the order was made. </p>

As Mr Chamberlayne submitted, the court is not here concerned with the question of whether a party should be permitted to argue that the court below made an error, but rather with the question of whether a party should be granted relief in the face of an agreed order precluding such relief where the starting point is that the order was properly made and before the application to set aside the order has been determined.  To make an order for maintenance pending suit in these circumstances would be to fundamentally disturb the concluded agreement reached between the parties and approved by the court prior to the decision of the court as to whether that agreement should be upheld.  In the circumstances, before the court takes such a step it must be satisfied to an appropriately rigorous standard that such relief should be considered. The applicable test for taking such a step must reflect this and in my judgment the test for permission to appeal does not adequately do so. </p>

As was made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">L v K (Freezing Orders: Principles and Safeguards) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] Fam 35" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] Fam 35</ref> at [18] and [19], for an application for an injunction to restrain the disposal of assets to succeed the applicant must put forward an appropriately strong case, supported by evidence of objective facts (rather than mere expressions of suspicion or anxiety) that the respondent to the application owns or has an interest in specified assets and that there is a real risk of their dissipation.  Proof of that real risk of dissipation requires proof of an intention to dissipate, dissipation in this context meaning a deliberate or reckless dealing with the assets in question rather than some random event unconnected to the motives of the respondent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within this context, the first difficulty with the wife&#8217;s application is that in my judgment she has not put forward an appropriately strong case.  The wife has not provided objective evidence that there is a real risk of the husband dissipating the proceeds of the sale of the former matrimonial home.  The only evidence cited by the wife to support her contention that there is a real risk that the husband will dissipate the asset comprising the former matrimonial home is the husband&#8217;s application to remove the Homes Rights Notice, the failure by the husband to agree the wife&#8217;s proposed terms for the escrow agreement and an assertion that the husband took profits from the Russian business prior to its transfer to the wife (which the husband contends were legitimate transactions, there being no term in the agreement that prevented profits being taken prior to the transfer of the businesses).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Even were these matters to constitute evidence of a real risk of dissipation (which I question), I note that the husband has provided three assurances to the wife via his solicitors regarding the treatment of the funds raised from the sale of the former matrimonial home.  More fundamentally however, I am satisfied that there is no imminent prospect of the former matrimonial home being sold.  There is currently no potential buyer for the property and it is unlikely that a sale will be possible until the litigation regarding the Home Rights Notice in the Lands Tribunal is concluded, which it is anticipated will take up to six months.  Within this context, I am satisfied that the evidence currently before the court comes nowhere near that required to demonstrate a real risk of dissipation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Further, as was also made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">L v K</span> at [25], absent objective evidence of a real risk of dissipation, there is no jurisdiction to grant a freezing order simply in order to provide security for a party&#8217;s claim.   Within this context, the order sought by the wife is, in circumstances where it seeks to force the husband to agree to the wife&#8217;s terms concerning the escrow agreement and in the absence of an appropriately strong case, supported by cogent evidence that there is a real risk of dissipation, an order that seeks simply to provide security <span style="font-style:italic">per se</span> for the wife&#8217;s claim.  In effect, the injunction says that, independent of any real risk of dissipation, the husband is not allowed to sell the property unless he provides the specific security for the wife&#8217;s claim that she has chosen, namely an escrow agreement in the terms stipulated by her.  That is not an appropriate use of a freezing injunction. </p>
