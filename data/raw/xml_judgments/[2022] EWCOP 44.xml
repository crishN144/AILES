	    <p><span style="font-size:13.5pt;color:#FF0000">A Transparency Order is in force which prevents any publication or communication which identifies or is likely to identify the subject of these proceedings, members of her family, the place where she lives other than as being in the North of England, or the expert witness, Dr X. The Order provides that the Third Respondent Trust must be referred to only as an NHS Trust and the Applicant as a Local Authority. Identification of those involved with A&#8217;s care and treatment would be likely to identify where she is living and so they have been anonymised within the judgment. The judge has given leave for this version of the judgment to be published on condition that (irrespective of what is contained in the judgment) in any published version of the judgment the anonymity of A, the subject of proceedings and members of their family must be strictly preserved and the Transparency Order shall be complied with. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that this condition is strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns closed proceedings at which the Court of Protection has authorised the covert administration of hormone treatment to a young woman without the knowledge of her family. A is the subject of these proceedings. B is her mother. This judgment is published as a single judgment but Part One follows a closed hearing on 15 September 2022, to which B was not a party, on the Trust&#8217;s application in relation to the covert medication of A. Part Two follows an open hearing involving all parties on 20-22 September 2022. Given my decisions (i) to approve the continuation of covert medication but (ii)  to end the closed proceedings and to inform B of the covert treatment of A, I circulated my draft judgment in Part One to all parties&#8217; representatives during the open hearing. B was then made a party to the Trust&#8217;s application and the closed proceedings bundle of documents was disclosed to her. At the open hearing I gave oral rulings on the next steps in the proceedings, contact, and reporting restrictions, and informed the parties that I would prepare a written judgment on those issues. I then circulated my full draft judgment. This judgment, approved for publication in anonymised form, includes both the closed and open judgments. The paragraph numbering is consecutive over the two parts.</p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Part One of this judgment follows closed proceedings in the Court of Protection concerning the covert administration of hormone treatment to A, a 23 year old woman, soon to be 24, who has been found to lack capacity to conduct this litigation or to make decisions about her residence, care, contact with others, and her medical treatment for epilepsy, primary ovarian failure, and vitamin D deficiency. Until 2019, A lived at home with her mother, B. By a series of orders in the Court of Protection, to which B was a party and A was represented by the Official Solicitor as her Litigation Friend, A has been removed from her mother&#8217;s care against the wishes of both of them, and now resides in Placement A and has only indirect, telephone contact with her mother. The reasons for those orders are set out in judgments of HHJ Moir, the Circuit Judge who has conducted all previous hearings in this case, dated 18 June 2019 and 17 June 2020. Those judgments have not previously been published but the parties have had copies of them and I rely on those judgments in full. I have taken steps to have the judgment of 18 June 2019, a copy of which HHJ Moir approved for publication, anonymised and published. Its neutral citation number is <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2019/68" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCOP 68" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCOP 68</ref> and it is being published simultaneously with this judgment.

As a result A had not undergone puberty. She was aged 20 years 8 months at the time of the Judge&#8217;s first judgment. The Judge accepted expert evidence from Dr X, an endocrinologist who told the court that it was exceptionally unusual for a young woman with absent periods not to be brought to medical attention and that he had never had experience of a woman of A&#8217;s age having avoided investigation. The advised treatment was by way of hormone medication which was straightforward, guaranteed to succeed, and would transform A from a child to a woman. Without treatment she would have an &#8220;extremely bleak&#8221; prognosis with significant risks to her physical and mental health as set out in the judgments. The Judge recorded that Dr X became &#8220;quite emotional&#8221; giving evidence to the court, saying to the Judge that it was &#8220;unthinkable&#8221; that A should not receive the treatment and that it was the &#8220;basic human right of every girl to blossom into a woman&#8221;.</p>

B was not made a party to the application. At that hearing the Judge approved a covert medication plan in respect of the hormone treatment. A had been refusing such medication. The Judge found, again, that A lacked capacity to make decisions about such treatment and remained very concerned that B&#8217;s influence was causing A to refuse the medication. The court received further expert evidence from the Consultant Endocrinologist, Dr X.</p>

The plan would be known only to a limited number of healthcare professionals and carers. A did refuse to accept the hormone treatment and so covert medication began to be administered at the end of 2020. A has continued to refuse the treatment and so covert hormone treatment medication has continued since then. The plan has been reviewed by the court on a number of occasions since then, most recently by the Circuit Judge on 4 March 2022. Continued attempts have been made to engage A in education about her health, recently with some success. The continuation of the covert medication plan and attempts to encourage A to elect to accept the medication have also been given considerable attention by the Trust, the Local Authority and the relevant staff at placement A.</p>

When comparing the hearings, both observers were &#8220;dismayed&#8221; and &#8220;baffled&#8221; because over a two year period of separation from her home and her mother - a separation that appeared to be for the primary purpose of administering endocrine treatment that A was not likely to receive at home - A had still not received endocrine treatment and there was an application for her to return home &#8220;in the hope that (after all this!) her mother will then be able to persuade her to have it.&#8221; The observers were wrong &#8211; A had been covertly administered the medication &#8211; but they were not to know that having only observed the open hearings in this case and, like A and members of A&#8217;s family, being unaware that covert medication was being administered and that A was benefiting from it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A further closed hearing to review the covert medication plan was heard by me on 15 September 2022. This judgment follows that hearing, the first hearing before me in this case. It had been listed earlier in the summer but due to administrative reasons had to be vacated and could only be relisted shortly before the open hearing. As at previous closed hearings, the Local Authority, the Trust, and A (through the Official Solicitor) were represented but neither B nor her legal representatives were aware of the hearing. The hearing was not included in the open list and so no observers or journalists were present. It was necessary to conduct a closed hearing in order to determine whether closed hearings should continue. Given the unique circumstances of this case due to A having not entered puberty by her early twenties and her separation from her mother by court order, any reporting or commentary on the case would be very likely to identify A to her mother, family members, and carers. Even the listing of the case number (which is the same as the case number in the open proceedings) would be likely to alert B to the happening of the closed hearing. It is common for Court of Protection hearings listed at the Royal Courts of Justice before a Tier 3 High Court Judge to be tweeted in advance of the hearing so that those interested may choose to attend the hearing to observe. Should B or her legal advisers have seen such a communication then the closed hearing would be discovered. In those circumstances I considered that it was not possible to list the case publicly. In retrospect it might have been possible to list the case without a case number or with a new case number created for the specific hearing, without any identifying names or initials to enable the listing to be linked to any previous open proceedings, and to make a reporting restrictions order at the hearing to prevent any communication or publication about the hearing (at least not until further order).</p>

The Trust, the Council and the Official Solicitor and the court were faced with a situation where, as the court had found, due to A and B&#8217;s enmeshed relationship A was refusing medication she needed to prevent serious harm to her physical and mental health and which would not give risk to any foreseeable adverse complications. </p>

Dr X&#8217;s strong recommendation is that the maintenance hormone treatment should continue for as long as possible. A will benefit permanently from having gone through puberty, but without continued maintenance medication she will be at a higher risk of early osteoporosis, fractures and cardiovascular complications. She would not be able to carry pregnancy using donor eggs (albeit it is unlikely A will ever be able to consent to fertility treatment). Were her treatment to cease now she is likely to suffer from significant decreased bone density with complications from osteoporosis some twenty years earlier than would be the case should maintenance treatment continue.</p>

Not only has the court found that A lacks such capacity, but the court has previously found B&#8217;s assertions about encouraging A to take hormone treatment to be hollow and unreliable.

B has very restricted contact with A, and gradually her influence may wane, but it continues to exert a strong hold on A&#8217;s beliefs, wishes and feelings. Nevertheless, I do take into account A&#8217;s consistently expressed wish is not to receive hormone treatment and B&#8217;s views that it is in A's interests to take the medication but that A has a right to choose for herself whether or not to do so.

She continues to refuse the treatment when offered to her. On the other hand, the continued implementation of the covert medication plan is fraught with risk. My concerns are (i) that A will discover the fact that she has been and/or continues to be medicated covertly; and (ii) that the discovery will have harmful repercussions in that she will lose trust in those caring for and treating her, perhaps even to the extent of losing trust in all professional carers and healthcare professionals, refusing food prepared for her at her current or other residential homes, and suffering physical and mental harm as a consequence. In the past, at placement A, A has refused food. She has learned to distrust healthcare professionals and if she finds out that they have been secretly medicating her against her will, her fragile residual trust may well disappear.</p>

A has undergone marked physical changes. She has developed breasts and body hair. She sometimes wears a bra. Dr X told the court that A looks very different facially &#8211; she looks like a woman not a pre-pubescent girl. Yet, A herself has not commented on these changes or asked questions about them. As already noted, that indicates the degree to which she falls short of having capacity to make decisions about her care and treatment. A has asked staff why they keep offering her the hormone treatment tablets since she always refuses them, but she has not extended her questioning any further. B has not seen A for over three years &#8211; the only contact she has is by telephone. But, A&#8217;s grandparents do see her and last saw her in June 2022. It is remarkable that they have not asked questions about A&#8217;s changed appearance. They have commented on her weight gain but not in the context of pubertal changes: they suggested that she should exercise more. Some care staff at Placement A are not aware of A&#8217;s covert medication plan, but it appears that no-one has inadvertently said something to A to lead her to question why she has undergone the physical changes she has been through.</p>

Unless A were to be prevented from having any contact with her grandparents that allowed her to see them, and/or were prevented from attending their respective funerals, she would be visible to them (when alive) or other family members and the changes in her appearance would be obvious.

The benefits of the medication continue but they are not as significant as they were for the first year or so of the operation of the covert medication plan. As A&#8217;s body has visibly changed due to puberty, so the risks of discovery of the covert administration of medication, and the potentially harmful consequences of that discovery, have increased. On the other hand, the questions of cessation and what, if anything, A should be told about the changes to her body and the medication she has had, requires anxious consideration. The conclusion I have reached is that the long term continuation of covert medication is unsustainable but that its immediate cessation would not be in A&#8217;s best interests. A&#8217;s best interests are served by exploring the most effective way of transitioning from covert to open medication and/or ending covert medication in a way that is likely to cause the least harm to A. This needs to be a controlled process, if possible. The reasons why the covert medication plan was authorised in 2020 were sound but the very success of the covert hormone treatment plan has created the problem of how to end it with the least harm to A.</p>

Such exclusion requires regular review and scrutiny of changing circumstances to ensure that it remains justified.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties to the closed proceedings are united in their view that there is a significant risk that if B is informed of the use of covert medication she will find a way to reveal it to A. In the past B has given notes to A during face to face contact with messages designed to encourage her not to submit to the advice of those wanting to treat her. The adverse consequences to A from discovering that she has been and is being covertly administered medication could be very harmful to her, as set out above. Accordingly, there was no written submission to me prior to the hearing that B should be told. On the other hand, the parties to the closed proceedings were all anxious about how the open hearing of B&#8217;s applications in respect of residence and contact could be managed whilst the use of covert medication was withheld from B and her legal advisers. Although there are a number of reasons other than the benefits of continued covert medication why the parties to the closed proceedings will oppose the application that A should return home, the fact is that B will argue for a return home in large part because she believes that A has not had any benefit from medication for her primary ovarian failure whilst at Placement A. Further, the primary ground for opposing face to face contact between A and B, or even indirect contact by video, is to avoid B seeing the physical changes in A and realising that she must have been administered hormone treatment without her knowledge. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical advice is that the best health benefits to A are from lifelong maintenance hormone treatment but, in my judgement, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to sustain the covert medication plan in the long term. However, it would be even more difficult to continue the plan without the fully informed co-operation of B. If B were to discover the use of covert medication inadvertently, then, given her past conduct and views, as set out in the Circuit Judge&#8217;s judgments, B would be likely to find a way to inform A. That could have very harmful consequences for A as I have set out above. </p>

A proper consideration of A&#8217;s best interests ought to take into account the views of A&#8217;s family if that is at all possible. Further, at the open hearing of B&#8217;s applications, it is very difficult to see how the hearing could be held, and a judgment given without actively misleading B and observers if the use of covert medication and the benefits it has brought, remains secret.</p>

If B were told simply that there had been closed hearings about A&#8217;s treatment, she would be bound to infer that the treatment in question was hormone treatment and that the hearings had been closed because covert administration of that treatment had been considered. It was not possible in this case to provide a gist of the withheld information and material without in effect alerting B to the covert medication.</p>

The balance of rights and A&#8217;s best interests now weigh in favour of openness with B about the past and ongoing use of covert medication. Accordingly, B and her legal advisers should now be informed that A has been, and continues to be, covertly administered hormone treatment for her primary ovarian failure. B should be informed that the treatment has been successful and that A has now gone through puberty with the associated physical changes, that A appears not to have recognised those changes, or the significance of those changes, and that her socialisation and behaviour have improved. Given the limited time before the open hearing begins, and the need to impart the previously withheld information in an orderly manner, the information will be given to B and her legal representatives by me at the opening of the hearing on 20 September 2022. </p>

The extent of any risk of that happening and of A then learning of the use of covert medication as a result, needs careful consideration, but there are grounds to believe that publication or communication of the fact that covert medication has been given to A, would be likely to lead to her identification. There are no observers, legal bloggers or journalists present at the closed hearing because no notice has been given and the case has not been included in the open list. The open hearing on 20 September will be listed and journalists or others may attend. There is a Transparency Order in force, made in 2020, which prevents the publication or communication of information that would or would be likely to identify A, members of her family including B, and where she lives (Placement A). A Reporting Restrictions Order preventing publication or communication of the covert administration of medication to A would provide additional protection against A discovering inadvertently, directly or indirectly, about the use of covert medication, a discovery that could well have very harmful consequences for her. It appears to me to be necessary and proportionate having regard to the balance of Article 10 rights and Article 8 rights, to make a Reporting Restrictions Order in respect of the issue of covert medication to hold the position at the beginning of the hearing on 20 September 2022 when the existence of closed proceedings and the use of covert medication is revealed to B and her legal advisers. However, I shall then review the justification for continuing the order, following any representations from the news media, bloggers, and the parties, including B, either during or at the conclusion of the open hearing.</p>

A&#8217;s birthday is imminent and B proposes face to face contact between her and A on that occasion, and continuing thereafter. B remains pleased that A has gone through puberty, will encourage her to take the maintenance medication, but does not want to lie to A.

The previous findings of the court, and B&#8217;s blithe assumption that A would now accept B&#8217;s encouragement to take the medication and would continue to do so in the long term whilst at home in her mother&#8217;s care, should give the court no confidence at all that B&#8217;s proposal is realistic or in A&#8217;s best interests.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I set out in Part One of this judgment, the covert medication plan has been successful. A has gone through puberty and this will bring irreversible advantages to her physical and mental health and her neuro-development. However, there would be harm to her health, in particular in later life, were she to cease what is now maintenance treatment with hormones. Ideally, she should continue to take the treatment for the rest of her life. Certainly, the longer she takes the medication, the better for her. However, A has undergone noticeable physical changes &#8211; she now has fully developed breasts, normal bodily hair distribution and her bodily habitus has changed from that of a girl to that of a woman. She has not had any menstrual bleeding which is due to the maintenance medication she is receiving, but the physical changes are obvious. I found that there are very significant risks that A could discover at any time that these changes are due to medication given to her secretly and that if A discovers that she has been and is being covertly medicated there are very  significant risks that she could respond negatively, refusing to eat or drink food prepared for her - as she has done in the past - and could lose the carefully built but fragile trust she has in carers and healthcare professionals. That would be very damaging to her.</p>

I have not been asked to hear any oral evidence at this hearing and have not considered it necessary to do so. HHJ Moir did hear oral evidence and was very familiar with the case.

HHJ Moir wrongly recorded Dr X&#8217;s evidence that &#8220;Spine crush fractures are around 10 percent more common than fractured neck or femur in patients with osteoporosis.&#8221; [80]. His evidence was that spinal crush fractures were around ten times more common than fractured neck of femur in such patients. Left untreated, A would have been at a significant risk of a spinal crush fracture by the age of 50-60. She would have a significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. A would look very young for her age for a decade or two but would then look much older than her age because of having oestrogen deprived skin. In addition, there would be adverse effects on A&#8217;s mental health and neuro-cognitive development were she to remain untreated.</p>

She had the advantage of having heard evidence from B at previous open hearings and was very familiar with the case. The Trust&#8217;s application regarding the covert medication plan was supported by the Local Authority and by the Official Solicitor acting as A&#8217;s Litigation Friend.

HHJ Moir approved her open judgment of 18 June 2019 for publication but it has not previously been published. I have taken steps to ensure that it is published, suitably anonymised, simultaneously with the publication of this judgment. Her open judgment of 17 June 2020 was not approved for publication but all parties have a transcript. The court and the parties have a note of the closed judgment, authorising covert medication and the exclusion of B from the closed proceedings, and a recording of the hearing, but no transcript of the judgment or written judgment has been prepared. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to have regard to HHJ Moir&#8217;s judgments not least because they assist this court in approaching B&#8217;s assertion, through her Counsel, that she will now encourage A to take the hormone treatment. A has gone through puberty and so the current and future treatment is for maintenance. It has a different purpose from the medication plan under consideration in 2019 and 2020, which was to ensure A went through puberty. There has been a material change in that A has now gone through puberty and B now knows that for the first time. There has also been a considerable passage of time from when B gave evidence to HHJ Moir. Therefore, it is feasible that B could have genuinely changed her attitudes and intentions. However, the benefits of the proposed treatment were even more striking in 2019/2020 than the benefits of the ongoing treatment are now. If B would not or, on her case, could not then persuade A to take the medication, is it credible that she would or could do so now? Although I have not heard evidence from B and I have not heard her assertions tested in cross-examination, given the previous findings, I treat with considerable caution B&#8217;s assurance that she would encourage A to take the hormone treatment and would ensure that it was taken if she were to look after A at home. Further, the evidence shows that during telephone contact B has never once made encouraging remarks to A to listen to those giving her healthcare advice or to take the hormone treatment. The lack of encouragement noted by HHJ Moir appears to have continued. Even if B genuinely tried to encourage A to take the medication, A might not necessarily be persuaded. The issue of what information and advice is given to A,  by whom and in what circumstances, requires careful and skilled planning. It may be that B has a role to play in that planning and in a transition to open medication, if that is feasible, but she needs to demonstrate by her actions that she will play a positive role and will not create a risk of harm to A, as she has done in the past, in relation to the issue of her health and treatment.</p>

I ensured that the fact of the RRO and its review was made known to the national news media through the Copy Direct scheme in accordance with PD 4A of the Court of Protection Rules Rules 2017. The RRO and brief summary was sent during the lunch adjournment on 20 September 2022 to Copy Direct. No representative of the national news media attended the open hearing but I received written and oral representations from three bloggers/observers about the continuation of the RRO. In addition, Counsel for the parties made submissions. Mr J O&#8217;Brien KC for the Trust and Mr Karim KC for the Official Solicitor proposed that the RRO should not be continued. There was considerable public interest in the workings of the Court of Protection and, in particular, decisions that had been made in closed proceedings about covert medication. It was important however that the use of covert medication and closed proceedings was fully understood. At all times the steps taken were decided to be in A&#8217;s best interests. Ms James-Stadden for the Local Authority expressed concerns that the use of covert medication could leak out and reach A causing irreparable harm. </p>

He took the opportunity to complain that B&#8217;s exclusion from the closed proceeding concerning covert medication meant that she and her legal representatives were induced to believe that no medication was being given. That understandable misapprehension was at the heart of B&#8217;s application in respect of residence and formed the basis of the written submissions made on her behalf. Hence, time and resources were wasted, and B was deprived of the opportunity to engage meaningfully in the proceedings. Her Art 6 rights were significantly compromised (as the court has recognised). Although Mr M O&#8217;Brien KC did not say so, it may be considered to be material to the decision about continuing the RRO that B&#8217;s exclusion should be reported. If there is a prohibition on reporting on the covert medication, in effect there would be a prohibition on reporting on use of closed proceedings. Further, there would be a risk that B&#8217;s true position could be misrepresented. </p>

It was held that an intense focus on the comparative importance of competing rights under Articles 8 and 10 was required. Neither Article has presumptive weight over the other; the proportionality test must be applied to each. The court should always ask whether there is any less restrictive or more acceptable alternative to a RRO &#8211; see also <span style="font-style:italic">JIH v News Group Newspapers Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 WLR 1645" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 WLR 1645</ref>.</p>

One might even say that her Art 2 rights are engaged given the risks to her. She is a vulnerable young woman who might well respond to any discovery that she has been covertly medicated by losing trust in those caring for her, those treating her, and, more broadly, with all professional carers and healthcare professionals. It is possible - and this I not a fanciful suggestion - that she might refuse to eat or drink. She has done so in the past. That might be her response because she may believe that the medication is a form of poison.</p>

The use of covert medication is on the face of it contrary to the exercise of her autonomy since she refuses the medication but it is a means of overcoming the detrimental influence of her mother and it is considered to be in her best interests. It therefore empowers her and so arguably enhances her autonomy and her Art 8 rights.</p>

The current hearings are obviously linked to the previously reported open proceedings and so A will be identifiable as P. The blog raised questions, publicly, about why A was not being medicated, leading readers to doubt, on false information,  the rationale for the court continuing to direct that it was in A&#8217;s best interests to reside at placement A and to not see her mother face to face. That is not to criticise the blog authors in any way &#8211; they were not to know of the closed proceedings and clearly did not contemplate the possibility that medication might have been administered covertly. However, as the blog authors have pointed out to this court, the misleading impression will stand uncorrected if the RRO remains in force.</p>

It prevents identification of placement A and the expert witness Dr X. The Transparency Order therefore affords considerable protection against the identification of A as the subject of these proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the one hand, A&#8217;s case is possibly unique. The expert witness Dr X told the court that he had never come across a young woman of A&#8217;s then age &#8211; 20 who had not been treated for primary ovarian failure. Exceptionally, A was still a pre-pubescent girl at the age of 20. Accounts of this case, even anonymised, may well obviously refer to A to any reader who knows her or of her. There are neighbours of B for example who do not know about A&#8217;s covert medication plan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the other hand, A lives at Placement A away from most people who know or know of her, and with limited contact with a few family members. They are B, her maternal grandparents, two uncles and an aunt. A does not watch or read the news according to the social worker whose evidence I have considered. She does now enjoy a number of outings  - a measure of her progress at placement A - but otherwise has very limited contact with the outside world. Furthermore, she is supervised on outings and her contact with family members is also supervised. It seems to me that it is unnecessary and not in A&#8217;s best interests for any family members other than B to be informed of the covert medication. None of them have asked any questions about A&#8217;s physical changes so far. If they do so, then a holding answer will have to be given before consideration of whether they should be told and, if so, whether any injunctive order is necessary to prevent them telling A. One uncle has been pressing B for information about this hearing. B is injuncted from revealing the use of covert medication to him. However, it would be permissible for B&#8217;s solicitor, an experienced Court of Protection practitioner, to speak to this uncle to inform him that there is information within the proceedings that cannot be disclosed to him by B or anyone else and that if he wants to know what it is, consideration will have to be given to making him subject of an injunction. If that uncle or any other of the close family members were to work out from reading a report of the case that mentioned covert medication that A had been covertly medicated, it would remain unlikely, in my judgment that they would tell A about it. Again, consideration could be given to imposing injunctions against them to prevent them discussing the matter with A. B knows about the covert medication but she is the subject of an injunction not to disclose that knowledge. The existence of an RRO would not provide any further protection against her disclosing the covert medication to A. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In terms of Article 10, it seems to me that it is of considerable public interest that a case in the Court of Protection has involved closed proceedings, from which P&#8217;s mother and family members were excluded and in which the use of covert medication for the purpose of inducing puberty has been authorised. These are exceptional circumstances. It is a matter of public interest that the court can and does authorise the use of covert medication in exceptional cases, but it adds another layer of exceptionality and public interest that family members were excluded from those decisions. I do not wish to imply that the court was wrong to proceed in that manner in A&#8217;s best interests, but clearly the fact that it did so is a matter of public interest which is liable to attract comment and diverse opinions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would be virtually impossible to report or blog about this hearing in a meaningful way without reference to covert medication. It would be close to a reporting ban to restrict reporting of the issue of covert medication because that is at the heart of the proceedings now that it has been revealed to B and her legal representatives. The decisions about residence and contact depend in part on the benefits and risks to A of covert medication.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One possibility is that the RRO should remain in force until transition to open medication has been accomplished. The next few weeks will see the introduction of face to face contact with B and could be an unstable time for A. Would it be best to extend the RRO until A is taking medication openly and voluntarily? The problem with that option is that the implementation of a medication plan might take months, even if the plan is approved by the court in November. It may be that the plan will be not to reveal the use of covert medication to A in which case the justification for continuing the RRO for an interim period would continue for a further interim period until it continues in the long term.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The RRO concerns convention rights and A&#8217;s best interests. There is considerable and understandable anxiety to remove any chance of A discovering that she has been and continues to be covertly medicated. An RRO might go some way towards preventing those who know A or know of her, from finding out about the use of covert medication, but there seems to me to be a very slim chance of anyone then conveying that information to A, and there is an even lower chance of A herself accessing a report of the case and realising that she has been covertly medicated. Weighing the risks of that happening against the importance of open justice, weighing the convention rights to which I have referred and scrutinising the comparative rights with an intense focus, in my judgement the RRO should be discharged. The protections of A&#8217;s interests afforded by the Transparency Order and injunction, allow the RRO to be lifted.</p>

However, so that the full circumstances of the case are available, I shall lift the RRO simultaneously with publication of this judgment. There have already been reports of this case which were based on only partial information &#8211; through no fault of the authors &#8211; and I am anxious to avoid any repetition. The short time over which the RRO will therefore remain in force will also allow for reflection on the marked changes in the circumstances of these proceedings and some preparation for the difficulties that are liable to arise in the near future before any publicity about the case begins.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the present case  in 2020 the court was asked to approve a covert medication plan and to do so without the knowledge of the family of the person involved. This was an exceptionally unusual situation for the Court of Protection to consider. Further distinctive features of this case were that the covertly administered medication would bring about obvious physical changes in the person treated and that the treatment would ideally be required to be continued for the rest of her life. Aside from the difficulties that this combination of exceptional features has presented to those caring for A, it has made the management of hearings extremely problematic. Although the Official Solicitor was involved in the closed proceedings representing A&#8217;s interests, there was in fact no dissenting party and therefore no prospect of oversight by an appellate court. Open proceedings have been held in parallel with closed proceedings but information and material which was highly relevant in open proceedings was withheld from a party, B, and her legal representatives, who did not know that any information or material had been withheld. All this arose from fully reasoned decisions in A&#8217;s best interests which were given the most anxious consideration. The court&#8217;s role at these two most recent hearings, as set out in this judgment, has been to chart the best course forward rather than to hold a review into the proceedings to date. </p>
