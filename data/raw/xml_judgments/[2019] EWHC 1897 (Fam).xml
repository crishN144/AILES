I have already commented that she has historically done this voluntarily rather than out of necessity, and as such I cannot disregard any income, she receives from this.

This was an 8 page document.  H&#8217;s position was that the arbitrator had made a clerical error in excluding the rental income from lodgers when considering forecast income. H also included new material from a Government web site going to what costs were deductible for tax purposes.  Overall, H suggested that the arbitrator should recalculate the monthly net income and suggested that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the omission of a large part of the wife&#8217;s income impacts the whole direction and consideration of the award&#8221;.  </span>He requested that the error and the consequences of it be corrected. </p>

This was an 11page document and contained a detailed analysis of the annual income figures for the wife, focusing on the 3 tax years between 2015 and 2018.

This time he indicated that he introduced no new evidence, although he again asked the arbitrator to refer to the Government website on what items were deductible, and noted that rental costs are not deductible. </p>

It was not reasonable to include these costs as part of her continuing needs, especially where the &#8220;rent a room&#8221; tax free allowance allowed for reasonable wear and tear.  H submitted that he had not challenged the arbitrator&#8217;s assessment of W&#8217;s needs and was still not challenging that.

The award was expressed to be a final award and this was the intention of the parties when they agreed to arbitrate. The issues raised by H about W&#8217;s stated income were not raised by H during the arbitration.  H had sought a clean break in the arbitration and this application was essentially an attempt to have the award revisited.

The issues raised in these requests (in particular tax reliefs claimed by W and whether there was an element of double accounting in W&#8217;s figures) were matters that should have been raised during the hearing. </p>

This was particularly important where she was a litigant in person and had asked him whether he would reconsider, and where there were tight time frames over Christmas.

The arbitrator was entitled to take into account the evidence of costs related to renting out the house and H had an opportunity to challenge that evidence at the hearing.

Intervention is not justified merely because something has happened that falls within one of the grounds.

In entering arbitration the parties signed the ARBF1S on the express basis that challenge to court was limited and a variation would only be justified in an exceptional case.  The reason why intervention is exceptional is because the parties have chosen to use arbitration in order to bring an end to their dispute in a fair and efficient manner. Parties do not agree for an arbitrator to resolve their disputes in an award in order for this to be a precursor to further rounds of extended submissions on possible errors and then a set of court proceedings before the matter is remitted back to the arbitrator for further submissions and perhaps a further hearing.  This must be the last outcome the parties would intend and the court would not allow it unless the high statutory threshold is clearly met. </p>

His original award involved exercising his discretion to draw conclusions from a broad range of information. If the arbitrator had incorrectly failed to give proper account to income received from lodgers and the tax status of such income (or even ignored it) then he made a mistaken assessment of the evidence (whether by his own error or because  the  evidence was not clearly presented).  If his award was inconsistent in saying at one point that he would take into account rental income but then at another stage not taking full account of that income then that is also a fault or gap in reasoning. Similarly, if the arbitrator incorrectly or inaccurately assessed W&#8217;s needs then this was a mistaken assessment of the evidence rather than an accidental omission or slip.

He was dealing with two litigants in person in circumstances where an award had been made and ordinarily his work would be complete.  The informality of the exchanges suited the parties but it  may have led them to believe that submissions could continue as if there had been no award. The arbitrator decided to allow an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref> to address what he perceived as a shortcoming in his original award that should be corrected.  He took the view that both income and needs needed recalculation such that the overall correction should not be as large as H requested.  It was understandable that he wanted to improve his decision so as to correct it.  However, attempts by parties or a tribunal to perfect, correct or improve an award (except for the narrow powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref>) are not allowed under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> where finality is valued more than meticulous accuracy.   </p>

When the arbitrator later changed course and re-opened the assessment of income on 3 February 2019 he expressly acknowledged that he was being asked &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">to look at the matter afresh&#8221;. </span>He accepted that he had gone back to reconsider the documents afresh.<span style="font-style:italic"/>This was not a situation where he had accidentally left something out or accidentally omitted his &#8220;first thoughts&#8221;. Instead, he re-opened his reasoning and reconsidered his method of assessment.  He presented the figures in a different way and gave two pages of  additional reasons for adjusting his previous reasoning. In my view the errors he sought to correct were not within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">However, even if the errors were not within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref>, the application to challenge the amended award on grounds of the arbitrator exceeding his powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/68" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 68</ref> fails for want of substantial injustice.  This would apply equally to the complaints of W (who preferred the original award with no corrections) and also H (who was unhappy with the recalculation of needs).  The arbitrator decided that a correction was required to give better allowance for income and costs due to lodgers.  The parties had agreed that he should decide their financial dispute.  Justice does not require me to undo his decision or send it back to him for reconsideration. To the contrary, his decision reflects a fair and careful assessment of the parties&#8217; needs. I note that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> also makes provision for an arbitrator to admit an error falling outside <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s57</ref> such that the parties can either agree for the award to be corrected or one party can apply to court for remission under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/68/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s68(2)</ref>(i) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>.  This is intended for extreme cases but shows that a court may give effect to an arbitrator&#8217;s admission of an error. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">There was a separate but related objection that the arbitrator should have allowed both sides to make further representations. I do not accept that the arbitrator acted unfairly in making his decision on 3 February 2019 without calling for further representations.  H had made two very full sets of submissions regarding the corrections he was seeking on assessment of income and spousal maintenance. The parties had already been given a full opportunity to serve submissions and evidence regarding income and needs at the hearing.  The arbitrator correctly concluded that no new evidence should be allowed following the award. W had served detailed comments regarding H&#8217;s application for a correction.  It was not the arbitrator&#8217;s role to advise her whether she needed to get further legal advice, or to tell her what he was likely to decide before he decided.  He would have been open to criticism if he had done this.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.04in">Given that he had concluded that there was an error within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref>, the arbitrator could have returned to the parties raising the point that the costs of keeping lodgers had also not properly been accounted for. I accept H&#8217;s submission that where an arbitrator makes a correction of his own initiative he should give both parties an opportunity to comment.  With the benefit of hindsight (and assuming, contrary to my earlier conclusions, that the matter was within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s57</ref>) a further round of submissions may possibly have prevented one ground of complaint.  I can also understand W&#8217;s concern in feeling she might have added a stronger response.  However, she had a reasonable opportunity to make representations.  She had made her position clear in a 4 page document and overall she had more than a month to respond to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s57</ref> application.  Lengthy submissions should not be required on a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/57" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57</ref> application.  Another round of submissions would have increased costs and delay, and could have spawned further unnecessary and unmeritorious attempts to re-open the decision or seek further corrections.  </p>

It was clear that neither party would have been entitled to put in fresh evidence. The arbitrator cannot be criticised for relying on the existing evidence in making an allowance for the costs of keeping lodgers.  The husband emphasised that the arbitrator made a mistake in assessing W&#8217;s future needs at around &#163;200pcm greater by reference to past capital costs rather than looking more broadly at running costs.  He also found fault with the arbitrator&#8217;s assessment of income. However, these sort of complaints going to the arbitrator&#8217;s assessment of the facts are not procedural shortcomings justifying court intervention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/68" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 68</ref>.  In my view the arbitrator&#8217;s conduct in making a decision on 3 February 2019 without allowing further submissions falls far short of making this an extreme case requiring court intervention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/68" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 68</ref>.   </p>

However, on an appeal the ordinary rule is that costs should follow the event and I consider that the costs of these applications should follow the event.  W is entitled to an order for her costs of the applications, to be assessed summarily when I hand down judgement (if not already agreed). </p>

H accepted that he had no objection to the award being made an order of the court in such circumstances.  I consider that W&#8217;s application to show cause was justified because an order would not have automatically been made following the end of the appeal process.  It would be necessary for the parties to seek the court&#8217;s approval of an agreed draft order or for one party to make an application for an order, typically using an application to show cause. Accordingly, in this case the amended award should be made into an order of the court.  The draft order is attached to the arbitrator&#8217;s original award.  An order in that form will be made but adjusted to reflect the amended award so that &#163;300 is substituted for &#163;500 in the spousal maintenance, and also to reflect my order for costs. </p>
