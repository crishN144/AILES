MA and PB found a suitable care home close to them in Worcestershire and he moved there later in March. MA visits him twice a week and PB visits him two or three times a week.

However, this was originally a non-contentious property and affairs application and the order was made on 2 September 2014 on the papers by an authorised court officer. Paragraph 6 of the order expressly states that &#8220;any person who is affected by this order may apply to the court for reconsideration of the order within 21 days of the order being served on them by filing an application notice (COP9) in accordance with Part 10 of the Court of Protection Rules 2007.&#8221;</p>

I spent over an hour on a fortnightly basis on the phone trying to close down his tax affairs. Fortunately, this has now been dealt with after a long battle with HMRC. However, due to the stubbornness of ST there are still ongoing bills for the shop premises which need to be resolved. A suggestion to &#8216;let&#8217; the shop premises was made to him in order to cover these costs, however ST did not want strangers below his flat. This therefore remains an on-going issue which is costing our father money.</p>

However, there was insufficient capital to be able to provide a long term carer for him and, as his only other asset was a shop with a flat above in Basingstoke, MA and I felt that the property had to be sold to pay for our father&#8217;s care. However, my brother, ST, was living, and continues to live, in the flat above the shop premises and my solicitors wrote to ST on 19 December 2014 advising him of our intentions and asking for his proposals to vacate the property. A similar letter was sent to the other applicants, TT and DC, on the same day, so that they were aware of our intentions. I have to assume that the applicants&#8217; application to this court has been made as a result of our solicitor&#8217;s letter of intention regarding the disposal of the property.</p>

However, at that stage, in December 2014, the deputies were contemplating providing a care package for FT in his own home, which would have been expensive. As FT only had about &#163;10,000 in savings, there was really no alternative other than to sell his shop and flat. The circumstances have changed considerably since then. FT&#8217;s house has been sold; he is living in residential care, and the deputies have reassured ST that they will not seek to sell the shop and flat whilst there are other funds available to pay for FT&#8217;s care.</p>

They have sought professional advice, where appropriate, and will need to bring a further application to the court for an order authorising them to execute a statutory will to redress any unfairness that may have arisen as a result of the ademption of the specific devise in FT&#8217;s will when his house was sold. </p>

This suggests that she may not be in a position to pay her share of the costs of the proceedings or, even if she does have some savings, having to contribute towards the costs could cause her financial embarrassment.
