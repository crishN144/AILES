In consequence, the Secretary of State applied for permission to impose a TPIM notice on the father on 10 June 2016.  Permission was granted by Cranston J on 14 June 2016.  On 20 June 2016, the father was served with a TPIM pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/23/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/23" uk:canonical="2011 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011</ref>.  </p>

That review is conducted by reference to the principles applicable on an application for judicial review.  At the time of the review, the Secretary of State must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the subject of the TPIM is, or has in the past been involved in terror related activity.  It is not however, necessary that the Secretary of State be satisfied that the subject of the TPIM is still involved in terror related activity at the time of the review hearing. The TPIM to which the father is subject was reviewed by Nicol J in June 2017.   On the question of whether the father is, or has been, involved in terrorism-related activity, Nicol J made clear at [42] that he took the following approach to this issue:</p>

He was further satisfied, on the basis of open evidence, in addition to the closed evidence, that ALM continued to exist.</p>

Thus, Ms H asserts that families in which parents have an association with Al-Muhajiroun are expected to remain as invisible within society, so as to remain under the radar of the authorities.  In this context, Ms H asserts that families in which parents have an association with Al-Muhajiroun don&#8217;t work and claim benefits.  She does not however mention that the father worked before being the subject of a TPIM or that the mother is educated to degree level and was training as a teacher before having children.  Ms H further asserts, within the context of her assertion that families in which parents have an association with Al-Muhajiroun are expected to remain as invisible within society, that the fact that X and Y are home schooled may indicate an attempt to isolate them and restrict them to differing world views.  She does not however go on to state that Z was enrolled in, and attending nursery or to relate that the Secondary Learning and Assessment Team had assessed X and Y&#8217;s education as adequate and sufficient in 2013 and 2015.  </p>

Leaving aside for a moment that using health services no more than is strictly necessary is what one might expect of most parents, Ms H&#8217;s conclusion is drawn in the context, acknowledged by her, of the parents having engaged fully with health services in respect of Z&#8217;s genetic condition and the mother proactively seeking a CAMHS assessment in respect of Y following concerns regarding her ability to concentrate.  Finally, Ms H cites the fact that families often request greater clarity with respect to the reasons for local authority intervention and the legal basis for that intervention and seek to engage the services of a solicitor.  Neither of these steps is however, in any way inappropriate.</p>

Ms N&#8217;s home visit in October 2016, at the request of children&#8217;s services, revealed X to be an articulate and thoughtful child capable of the kind of independent study necessary to make a success of home education at the secondary stage.  She demonstrated herself to be an avid reader of fiction books.  Y too was noted to be an avid reader, to the extent that she complained she had read all the suitable books on offer.  She was seen to be working at a level expected for her age and was observed to be creative and energetic.

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;From what I have seen the children in this case do not appear to have much interest in religious and political issues.  They have more interest in cartoon characters and some interest in the cultural/heritage side of Islam&#8230;from an examination of their books the mother has focused on Islamic core beliefs, culture and heritage. I think that is the right approach at their age.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, Mr Mohammed stated that the parents would benefit from an action plan of wider interaction with people, ideas and activities in the Muslim community, as distinct from intervention, a <span style="font-style:italic">Dawah</span> training course for the parents, a structured course on Islam and discussion with members of the Syrian community on the impact of ISIS in Syria.  However, Mr Mohammed is clear that the desirability of this work must be weighed against the fact that mother is caring alone for children due to the strictures of the TPIM.  Mr Mohammed suggests that the attendance of the children at an Islamic school may relieve some of the pressure on the mother in this regard.  Further, in the absence of any evidence that the children have been affected negatively by any extreme political or religious views Mr Mohammed does not recommend any intervention for the children, contending that such intervention may have the opposite effect to that intended when they are displaying no interest in religion or politics.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Mohammed&#8217;s CV indicates that he has a range of roles, one of which is providing reports in criminal and family cases involving alleged radicalisation, extremism and terrorism based on his experience of these fields.  His assessment is based on a discussion with each parent and visit to family home.  I of course bear in mind that I have not had the benefit of hearing oral evidence from Mr Mohammed.  However, I accept Mr Barnes&#8217; submission that, on the face of it, a greater degree of challenge to the parents might have been expected by an assessor in light of the findings of Nicol J.  I likewise accept Mr Barnes&#8217; submission that Mr Mohammed&#8217;s characterisation of ALM is difficult to square with what is known about the organisation (and successor organisations) proscribed under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/11" uk:canonical="2000 c. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Terrorism Act 2000</ref> and its members.  That said, overall, Mr Mohammed&#8217;s risk assessment provides some useful insights in the context of the application that is before the court, particularly in relation to question of the extent of the impact of the parents&#8217; alleged conduct on the children.</p>

The Children&#8217;s Guardian found both X and Y to be extremely welcoming and happy to talk about their lives and what they liked.  She had no concerns regarding Z.  Once again, and consistent with the experience of Ms P and Mr Mohammed, it is of note that in her involvement with the family the Children&#8217;s Guardian has <span style="font-style:italic">at no point</span> seen any evidence of the children having been radicalised or exposed to extremist material.  Indeed, the mother expressed concern to the Children&#8217;s Guardian that Ms P had asked the children on a number of occasions about their views in relation to ISIS and wearing the Hijab, and the children told the Children&#8217;s Guardian that they did not get on with Ms P.</p>

However, I note that Ms P&#8217;s parenting assessment does make clear that she questioned X, who was 14 at the time, about wearing the hijab and what her parents would do if she did not wear it, and that X and Y were questioned by her about ISIS and matters of religion.  The mother related to Mr Mohammed that this had forced her to explain to X and Y what ISIS was, which the mother states was an unpleasant experience in circumstances where children had heard of ISIS but did not know a lot about it.  This raises at least the unfortunate possibility that the first time the children were exposed in detail to the significance and aims of ISIS was as a result of the social worker seeking to establish whether the children were at risk of radicalisation.</p>

The Children&#8217;s Guardian lends tacit support to this approach.  The parents submit that on the material before the court, the local authority is unable to satisfy the threshold criteria and, accordingly, the court must grant the local authority&#8217;s application for permission to withdraw the proceedings on that basis.</p>

The parents have expressed reservations in respect of the plan and it is clear that it was not discussed with the father prior to its formulation.  As I have noted, Mr Mohammed sets out an alternative plan of support.  Whilst I will make some brief observations regarding these issues later in this judgment, this court has no jurisdiction to dictate the approach of the local authority, or indeed of the parents, to these matters. During submissions, both the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian made clear that the application to withdraw is pursued independent of any indication by the parents that they will or will not engage with the &#8216;Children in Need&#8217; plan.</p>

Sometimes the linkage will be obvious, as where the facts proved establish physical harm. But the linkage may be very much less obvious where the allegation is only that the child is at risk of suffering emotional harm or, as in the present case, at risk of suffering neglect. In the present case, as we shall see, an important element of the local authority's case was that the father "lacks honesty with professionals", "minimises matters of importance" and "is immature and lacks insight of issues of importance". May be. But how does this feed through into a conclusion that A is at risk of neglect? The conclusion does not follow naturally from the premise. The local authority's evidence and submissions must set out the argument and explain explicitly why it is said that, in the particular case, the conclusion indeed follows from the facts.&#8221;</p>

In her final statement, the social worker confirms that the children &#8220;have not said anything that I would consider to be extremist views of their religion or about the parenting they receive, or about their peer/family relationships.&#8221;  Further, this has been the position over the course of nearly eight years, notwithstanding that social services, home education services and, latterly, health services and CAMHS have been involved with this family at regular intervals [<span style="font-weight:bold">redacted</span>]. At no point during this period is there evidence from professionals or others contradicting the assessment of the social worker, Mr Mohammed and the Children&#8217;s Guardian in this respect.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, the detailed and comprehensive assessment in this case that I have recounted not only reveals children who display no signs of having been drawn into a radical or extremist view of the world, or of having been exposed to material propounding such views, but children who present as well balanced, articulate, thoughtful, keen on learning about a whole range of diverse subjects and with their own passions and interests, including superheroes, reading, writing and the natural world.  The evidence further suggests that the children are actively involved in outside activities, have sufficient and adequate education and a supportive family network.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, there is no evidence before the court that the children <span style="font-style:italic">have </span>suffered significant harm whilst in the care of their parents.  Whilst it is correct that a final hearing would involve the challenging of the parents in cross-examination about the impact of their alleged views and beliefs on the children, on the evidence before the court there is no proper evidential basis to put to the parents that they have radicalised their children or exposed them to extremist material.  Further, beyond some evidence of a reluctance on the part of the children to engage with the social worker, which Ms P accepts could be an ordinary reaction to the presence of a social worker in the family home, there is no proper evidential basis for putting to the parents that the children are part of a scheme to disguise the true position in the family home, such a scheme in any event having to span years and rely on the complete co-operation and word perfect compliance of all three children over that time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the same position is reached in respect of the question of<span style="font-style:italic"> risk</span> of significant harm.  In the circumstances that I have set out in the foregoing paragraphs, and having regard to the fact that the local authority can point to no evidence of the children having suffered significant emotional harm, in my judgment the local authority would be unable to make out a finding of a <span style="font-style:italic">risk</span> of significant harm on the evidence before the court.  In the absence of any evidence of the children having been drawn into a radical or extremist view of the world or having been exposed to material propounding such views, the only basis for finding that they are at risk of significant harm would be if the court were to conclude that parents in the contended for position of these parents must, <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span>, constitute a risk of significant harm to their children.  I accept Ms Meyer&#8217;s submission that risk of significant harm must be established on the basis of evidence and not assumptions or speculation on future behaviour. Further, even if it were accepted as valid, the proposition that the parents must, <span style="font-style:italic">a priori</span>, constitute a risk of significant harm to their children is wholly undermined by the evidence in this case of an absence of harm to the children over the eight years in which professionals have been involved with this family.  In this case, the evidence before the court demonstrates that a risk of significant harm does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> inevitably follow from the contended for position of these parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whatever the nature of the allegations before the court, any findings the court makes must be rooted in the totality of the empirical evidence before the court, and any inferences it is reasonable to draw therefrom.  This fundamental principle applies as much in a case of alleged radicalisation as it does in other cases brought under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  Further, as in all other cases brought under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, in cases of alleged radicalisation and in order to meet the threshold criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>, the local authority must be able to demonstrate that the facts relied on justify the conclusion that the child has suffered, or is at risk of suffering, significant harm of the type alleged.  I am satisfied that, on the evidence before the court, the local authority would not be able to do that in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am reinforced in my conclusion by the social worker&#8217;s own evidence, set out in her final statement dated 21 November 2017, in which the social worker states her view in terms that the &#8220;Threshold of significant harm to the children has not been evidenced in these proceedings&#8221;.   I am further reinforced in my conclusion by the fact that, at its highest, Mr Barnes was compelled, in his carefully weighed Skeleton Argument, to put his case that the court &#8220;might&#8221; be able to find a risk of significant harm on a basis that took no account of the evidence concerning the children&#8217;s position and presentation as set out above, Mr Barnes realistically further accepting that that evidence militates against a positive finding on threshold.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, as I have already noted, this court has no jurisdiction to dictate the approach of the local authority, or indeed of the parents, to the issue of any intervention in the family pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 17</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> or consequent &#8216;Child in Need&#8217; plan.  In the circumstances, I limit my observations as follows.  I endorse the submission of Ms Munroe that, if such a plan is pursued, there is a need for clarity, with a plan that is written down, that provides the name or names of the professionals who are responsible for its implementation, that has a clear stated purpose, that sets out what the family agrees to do and what the local authority agrees to do, that that is kept under regular review and that has a clear timeframe for completion.  I also endorse Ms Meyer&#8217;s submission that any work undertaken by the local authority with the children as &#8216;children in need&#8217; pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 17</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> must not be used as a means of securing supervisory powers in circumstances where the local authority has accepted that it cannot succeed in its application for a supervision order under Part IV of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref>.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is easy to assume that a straight line can, without more, be drawn between a parent who is said to hold extremist views, or a parent who is said to be involved in terror related activity and the suffering of significant harm or the risk of significant harm to that parent&#8217;s child or children.  However, the <span style="font-style:italic">evidence</span> in this case demonstrates that the position is more complex than that and one that falls to be considered carefully on a case by case basis in light of the evidence in a given set of proceedings. Applying the well-established legal principles that I must to the evidence available in this case, and for the detailed reasons I have given, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to grant the local authority&#8217;s application for permission to withdraw these care proceedings on the basis that the local authority is unable to satisfy the threshold criteria in this case, and I do so.</p>
