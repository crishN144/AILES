In early 1994, the couple decided to emigrate to the USA to seek business opportunities and, thus it was, that S was born in Fort Worth, Texas.

In January 1997, there was an incident with a firearm which resulted in the Mother shooting the Father. She claims that she acted in self defence following domestic violence when he threatened her with the gun. The Father says she simply acted with aggression against him. I do not seek to make any findings about the cause of that incident, but the effect is not in doubt - the Father was taken to hospital and, as I understand it, required some 3 operations. The police were involved and the Mother faced prosecution.</span></p>

Despite his assurances, the Mother alleges there were soon further incidents of aggression/violence. For example, her car brakes were tampered with and she suspects the Father. Moreover, she says that on her return she discovered that Mr M had &#8220;lost&#8221; the statement that was to save her from prosecution. Consequently, for the next three months, she felt very vulnerable because of the pending criminal prosecution.  It is her case that the Father manipulated (or prevailed upon) Mr M</span><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#FF0000"/><span style="font-size:10pt">(who she regarded as her lawyer) to misplace the document.

As set out above, the Father was assisted in the Australian proceedings by Mr M &#8211; who was, inter alia, a member of the legal firm instructed by the father and was the signatory of at least one letter to the father. She now uses this incident as a pointer to her Husband&#8217;s ability to manipulate even her lawyers against her. I can and do not seek to make any findings about this assertion. But it is certainly a matter of some concern that, prima facie, Mr M</span><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#FF0000"/><span style="font-size:10pt">appears to have altered his primary allegiance. Moreover, it is clear from a letter which I have seen that the Father offered his Australian lawyers a $50,000 bonus if they secured a residence order in his favour. An unusual incentive in this type of litigation. Despite all these difficulties (or perhaps because of them) before the trial on the merits, the parties came to terms.</span></p>

Not surprisingly, that Court refused the application - no doubt, because it was in clear breach of the parties&#8217; agreement. When thwarted, the Father fled from Durban with S (then aged about 3 years old). He travelled through 3 African countries and eventually arrived in Dubai &#8211; all were Non Convention destinations. For a period of about one month, the Mother did not know the whereabouts of her child. [It is interesting to note that when the Father made his original ex parte application to this Court in these proceedings &#8211; where there is a particular duty of full disclosure &#8211; he failed to make any mention of this incident]. </span></p>

She says that she took this action after she had been badly beaten. On this occasion, she sought medical assistance (as a result of which a report was prepared which I have seen) and photographs were taken which showed extensive bruising to her eye and marks to her neck (which she says were made when the Father gripped her by the throat as if to strangle her). She gave the photographs to Ms Meiring for safe-keeping. In the event, she decided against seeking Court Orders. In consequence, Ms Meiring closed her file, but kept the photographs, various documents and attendance notes. In the intervening period, the photos have become degraded with the result that it is not possible to see any injuries to the neck but, I have seen the damaged photographs and they show clearly extensive bruising to the Mother&#8217;s eye. The contemporaneous medical records also confirm injuries which are consistent with the Mother having been struck.</span></p>

She says that both she and S were banned from seeing certain people of whom the Father disapproved. These included a (former) baby sitter called Michelle. The result was that mother and child had to visit on a clandestine basis. The Mother was therefore surprised to discover that the Father had apparently recently befriended Michelle, assisted her financially and, for some reason, had brought her to be present outside this Court. I was informed by Counsel on behalf of the Father that there was nothing sinister in these actions but I have no doubt that the Father appreciated that the Mother would be unsettled by seeing her former babysitter (and one time friend) apparently now siding with the Father. The Mother is concerned lest this means that the Father has sought to subvert Michelle.   </span></p>

She says that this caused her pain, damaged her anus and caused her to bleed. She says that this allegation is corroborated, inter alia, by a document exhibited to her statement that was prepared by the Father as a wish list for his birthday. The document contains a number of requests but includes 2 particular phrases  (i) &#8220;Trim the Amazon&#8221; (which she says is code for trim pubic hair) &#8211; against which she wrote &#8220;DONE&#8221; and (ii) &#8220;All areas certificate&#8221; (which she says is code for anal sex) &#8211; against the latter she has written &#8220;sorry but NO!!&#8221;.

For my part, although I regard myself as bound by the recent decisions (which I outline below), I find myself very troubled by this stricture when allegations of this type of abuse are made. To my mind, if proven, this category of allegation will gravely affect a mother&#8217;s and therefore a child&#8217;s ability to withstand pressure from a domineering presence in their life. Moreover, there will often not be a great deal of third party evidence in the country of origin of such matters which, by their very nature, remain hidden as the injured party is often too afraid and/or ashamed to make complaint. I consider that a Court of 1st instance ought to be in a position to make findings when an Article 13 (b) defence of this type is raised by making directions, inter alia and at the very least, for appropriate psychological assessments to be made of the parties and the child before sending the child back to a potentially abusive situation, I consider that the damaging scenario may obtain even if parties live in separate households on return and even if the local Court puts in place protective measures.</span></p>

Her plan was to try and remain in the marriage until her daughter was 12 years old when, she believed, S&#8217;s wishes (as to where she wanted to live) would be taken more fully into account. The Mother states matters unfortunately came to head when the Father left messages telling her that she should leave.

She considers that he can (and will) use his wealth and connections to manipulate the due process of Law. By that, she does not mean the Court, but rather potential witnesses and even lawyers. She prays in aid that he was able to persuade the lawyer who she had instructed in 2000 &#8211; Ms Retha Meiring &#8211; to act on his behalf.

Her position being that her previous instructions were some time ago in relation to a different matter. I find her assertions to be remarkable. I would expect any responsible professional to see an immediate conflict of interest. I am not surprised that the Mother was unnerved by this turn of events. Moreover, when the Mother&#8217;s advisers asked for her old file, they received only part. There was some rather unsatisfactory evidence from a Mr Govender (Ms Meiring&#8217;s assistant) which asserted that the file had been handed over. Later this was shown to be inaccurate as other documents were revealed. The Mother also asserts that some photographs have gone missing. The photographs showing her injuries (left for safekeeping) have become degraded &#8211; apparently because the humidity in Durban has affected the prints whilst in storage. The problems of humidity are so well known in Durban that I would have expected simple precautions to be taken to store potential evidence in a safe manner. It is still possible to see the black eye but the marks to neck are no longer visible. As a result of enquiries in relation to this aspect of the case, the Father now accepts that he should use a new lawyer and he has agreed that he will not re-instruct Ms Meiring.     </span></p>

In fact, she failed to open it and so sent it on to her solicitor. The technical department of the firm discovered that the attachment was in fact a programme called &#8220;E Blaster&#8221; which has the ability to worm its way, undetected, into a computer allowing the original sender to receive all the e-mails that have been sent to the recipient. In this way, it is asserted that the Father expected to have knowledge all the Mother&#8217;s communications &#8211; including those with her solicitor. If this allegation is proved, it is a very serious, because it means an attempt was made to gain access to privileged communications.  The Mother surmises that he will undertake similar acts in South Africa and she will not have the expertise to know what is happening. </span></p>

In these cases, the Authorities make it clear that in normal circumstances the courts of the country of habitual residence are best to determine issues relating to the welfare of the child. Primarily, because the best outcome for the child&#8217;s future will be identified by reference to past events and the physical, emotional, social and cultural milieu in which the family have lived. All these matters, including in particular any resolution of factual disputes relating to past events, are, prima facie, more easily addressed in courts of that State. Where two States might exercise jurisdiction over a child, one of them should, as early as possible, cede jurisdiction to the other, so that an even rule of law across both jurisdictions is thereby achieved &#8211; see </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">Re H (Child Abduction: Mother&#8217;s Asylum EWHC 1820</span><span style="font-size:10pt">. Moreover, the ratio of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">Re C (Abduction: Grave Risk of Psychological harm) 1999 1FLR 1145 </span><span style="font-size:10pt">provides that a very high threshold has to be set to establish defences of a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or of the placement of the child in an intolerable situation. The defence requires clear and compelling evidence of a grave risk of harm or other intolerability to be measured as substantial, not trivial and of a severity which was much more than is inherent in the inevitable disruption, uncertainty and anxiety which followed an unwelcome return to the country of the habitual residence. In short, it is a stringent test. </span></p>

		<p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:10pt">The principles that can be drawn from all these cases are clear &#8211; first, the threshold is very high and the evidence must support a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">grave</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> risk of psychological harm to the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt">child</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation. Domestic violence by a father to a mother is not, of itself, enough because it is presumed that the Courts of the foreign jurisdiction will assist a battered wife and protect her. Moreover, the Mother&#8217;s distress is not relevant to the test &#8211; it is only its possible impact on the child which is important.  I accept that this is Law. Accordingly, I do not consider that the Article 13 (b) threshold has been crossed. There is no real evidence of S&#8217;s grave distress because, I suspect, she has been shielded from a good deal of marital unpleasantness. Although she reported upset to the Cafcass officer and told him how much happier her Mother was in England &#8211; she did not report serious concerns about her own position upon return. The Court does not have the evidence about the psychological impact of the life that she has lead to date and the effect of a return to a country where her mother will be very unsettled and unhappy.</span></p>

I am concerned that the Law is adhering to a very laudable principle that children should not be unilaterally removed from the place of their habitual residence and should, in normal circumstances, be returned without any real consideration of the impact of domestic violence on a family. I am concerned that the Law may be failing those cases where the allegations are of oppressive conduct because the Authorities do not permit the Judge at 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:10pt">st</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> Instance to give any proper consideration to the long-term psychological effects on a wife and child who have lived in traumatic, violent circumstances and are being returned to the country of origin &#8211; even if to a separate household.  </span></p>

		<p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:10pt">I am very troubled by the evidence which I have read in this case. I do not regard the Father&#8217;s bland denials as satisfactory and, although I have not heard evidence, I have been able to watch his demeanor in Court over 2 days and I have observed how he looked at the Mother. In the circumstances, I am of the firm view that the Mother and S require a raft of protective measures to be in place before they have to return. Indeed if these are not in place prior to return I would be more concerned about the Article 13 (b) threshold. During the course of the Hearing, I had a dialogue with Counsel for both parties in which I ventilated the basic measures which I considered were important pre-requisites. As a result, most of the raft of measures were volunteered by the Father. Eventually, the parties reached agreed terms &#8211; depending on my decision. A copy of those measures is annexed to this Judgment. In addition, the Father has accepted that he will not use Ms Meiring and will not re-instruct her. These measures are designed to ensure that the Mother and S will be able to live separate from the Father in a town - Kloof has been mentioned &#8211; which is someway out of Durban. She will have a sum of money to provide for her maintenance for the next six months (including high level security if she wishes) and to fund litigation.  Mr. Everall Q.C., on behalf of the Mother, sought high figures but I consider that the Mother requires R 200,000 as a maintenance fund for the first 6 months and R300, 000 towards a litigation fund. I sought specific submissions whether the Father could afford R500, 000. Mr. Setright Q.C.  &#8211; on the Father&#8217;s behalf &#8211; said that the Father did not wish to make submissions (which I took to mean that he had no problems raising the funds) &#8211; nevertheless I sought clarification.  After taking instructions, Mr Setright stated that he could afford the maintenance but could not afford the higher level of legal fees sought (given that an earlier &#8211; and I consider inadequate &#8211; figure had been given by the Mother&#8217;s South African solicitor. He did not seek to explain the reasons for this submission or give proper figures showing/proving that this sum was unaffordable.  Accordingly, I do not accept that the Father could not afford this sum. I made it clear to his Counsel that he was not to seek a return of these funds, whilst this case remained unresolved. By this, I do not seek to restrict the obvious right of the South African Court to determine the final financial issues between these parties. I simply make it plain that, in front of me, the Father made no suggestion that he would seek to sever or reduce the financial life line that has been put in place by agreement. Thus, it would be disingenuous if he applied for the release of any of these funds to on an interim basis or sought to suggest he did not have sufficient means.</span></p>

A child may be mature enough for it to be appropriate for her views to be taken into account even though she may not have gained that level of maturity that she is fully emancipated from parental dependence and can claim autonomy of decision-making. The child&#8217;s &#8216;right&#8217; &#8211; and I use the word loosely &#8211; is, consistently with Art 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, to have the opportunity to express her views and to be heard, not a right to self-determination.
