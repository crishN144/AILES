	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I am concerned today with a little girl called QR who was born in May 2020 and is, thus, three years and five months old.  The applicants are EF and GH.  Both are Indian nationals resident in this jurisdiction.  They made an application pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> for a parental order.  This is because QR was born in consequence of a gestational surrogacy agreement in India to a married surrogate called XY.  XY husband&#8217;s name is unknown to the applicants and, therefore, to the court.  The application was made on 17 May 2023 and I gave directions to facilitate this final hearing on 4 August 2023. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In coming to my decision, I have considered a bundle of documents prepared on behalf of the applicants and also a report by the parental order reporter Ms Baker, dated 2 November 2023, which recommends the making of a parental order.   I have also had the benefit of a detailed skeleton argument prepared by Mr Powell, counsel appearing on behalf of the applicants. </p>

When I gave directions in August 2023, it was apparent that the application was being made on the basis that the court would be invited to dispense with the consent of both the surrogate and her husband.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">I turn now to the background in these proceedings.  The applicants have been a lawfully married couple since 2004, although their marriage certificate is dated, for a variety of reasons which need not concern the court, as 10 March 2006.  Both were born, educated and employed in India.  Following their marriage, the applicants lived in India until 2010, apart from a year spent in the United States between 2007 and 2008 by reason of EF&#8217;s employment.  In March 2010, the applicants moved to the UK so EF could be part of a project for his employer and, when that project concluded after three and a half years, EF and GH stayed in the UK, as EF was able to continue his employment here.  The couple began to see their long-term future in this jurisdiction and, accordingly, they applied for indefinite leave to remain which was granted with effect from 13 February 2015 for a period of ten years.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The applicants had tried to have children of their own since their marriage but only sought medical help in 2013 when they were not able to become pregnant.  By 2015, the couple  had been  referred to specialist IVF services in the UK but, instead, they decided to seek treatment in India where they had three unsuccessful rounds of IVF.  In 2018, GH was 40 years old and, in view of her age, it was suggested that the couple explore surrogacy using her eggs.  Later that year, an attempt to do so was sadly unsuccessful and, by 2019, the medical advice was that the couple should use donor eggs and a surrogate together with EF&#8217;s sperm in order to become pregnant.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The applicants  decided to pursue that course and engaged the services of IVF specialists in Mumbai.  Their surrogate, XY, was pregnant by November 2019.  The arrangements for this surrogacy were made using, as I have indicated, a team of IVF specialists recommended by EF&#8217;s sister who is a practising gynaecologist.  The doctor involved was a Dr ZJ who handled the egg donation and surrogacy arrangements.  She was the sole source of information for the applicants about their surrogate.  They asked to meet XY but were advised that this was not customary and instead received a photo and updates from Dr ZJ about the pregnancy.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The applicants saw XY briefly from a distance on 7 September 2019. They did not know precisely where she lived during her pregnancy, but they were aware that she had moved into accommodation arranged by Dr ZJ.  The applicants found Dr ZJ reassuring and professional in her approach which was focused upon providing XY with a good level of care.  They sent gifts to XY for a baby shower organised by Dr ZJ in March 2020 and asked to send a card or make a phone call to her but were advised by Dr ZJ not to contact her.<span style="font-size:14pt"/>All the applicants knew about their surrogate was that XY had temporarily resided with her sister at an address in Mumbai but had moved to accommodation arranged by Dr ZJ for the course of her pregnancy.  They knew of the address in Mumbai and they also knew that XY was a married woman but were never provided with her husband&#8217;s name.  She was said by Dr ZJ to be estranged from her husband.<span style="font-size:14pt"/>All the legal arrangements consequential on the surrogacy, such as applying for a birth certificate, were undertaken by Dr ZJ.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Moving a little forward in time, in 2022 when the applicants had been advised that they should apply for a parental order on returning to the United Kingdom, the applicants sought further information from Dr ZJ about XY&#8217;s circumstances and whereabouts.  In August 2022, they were told that XY had returned to Nepal, and I pause here to note that, before that date, they had never been told that she had come from that place. They were also told that XY had kept her surrogacy confidential from family and friends.  In September 2022, the applicants asked Dr ZJ to provide them with written confirmation of what she had told them in August.  She failed to respond substantively and, in October 2022, the applicants drafted a letter for Dr ZJ to sign setting out the information about XY which she had given them.  In response to that letter, Dr ZJ confirmed that she had been trying to contact XY but had been unable to locate her.  Such enquiries as she had made, which were unspecified, had led Dr ZJ to believe that XY had returned to an unknown address in Nepal.  From my perusal of the WhatsApp messages between the applicants and Dr ZJ at this time, it is evident to me that Dr ZJ professed to have no awareness that other jurisdictions might have different legal requirements in respect of surrogacy to those pertaining in India.  Her one significant WhatsApp message said: </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">QR was born in May 2020 at the height of the global Covid pandemic.  The applicants were not present at her birth as India was in complete lockdown.  They were fortunate enough to be able to get a flight to India fairly quickly but had to be quarantined for two weeks after their arrival.  They thus did not meet QR until 27 May 2020 when she was discharged from hospital and had had no opportunity at all to meet XY at the birth.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Sadly, QR became very ill when she was 45 days old and required urgent and sustained hospital treatment.  Further medical complications arose because of her frail state, requiring more hospitalisation which left her &#8211; at the age of three months &#8211; weakened and traumatised by the medical intervention she had experienced.  When QR was about six months old, the applicants started to plan to return to the United Kingdom, but in December 2020 and January 2021 there was an upswing in the Covid pandemic and another lockdown in India.  The applicants were naturally fearful of travel because of QR&#8217;s weakened health.  However, by spring 2022, the applicants were determined to return to the UK but yet again events overtook them.  War broke out in Ukraine which had the effect of delaying their application for a visa to enable QR to travel to the UK.  These problems persisted throughout 2022 until the applicants engaged the services of an immigration lawyer.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">At some point in the summer of 2022, the applicants were advised that they should apply for a parental order but only once they had returned to the United Kingdom.  They had taken some initial advice about the legal process in respect of an overseas surrogacy in 2018 when they had been considering surrogacy in Ukraine as well as in India. However, they misunderstood the need to apply for a parental order because they thought, as Indian nationals entering into an agreement in India with an Indian birth certificate naming them as QR&#8217;s parents, that this would suffice in order to obtain a visa for QR to travel to the United Kingdom and for them to be recognised as her parents in English law.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In May 2023, UK Visas and Immigration, as part of their visa application process, asked the applicants for proof within ten working days that a parental order application had been made for QR in this jurisdiction.  Before that point, the applicants were still labouring under the belief that they could apply for a parental order once they were back in this jurisdiction.  In a panic, the applicants finally instructed specialist surrogacy lawyers who explained the process of applying for a parental order.  The applicants made their application on 17 May 2023 and also obtained specialist immigration advice via their surrogacy lawyer to assist them with QR&#8217;s visa application.  With this expert help, QR was finally granted a visa on 16 June 2023 and she and her parents travelled back to the UK on 26 June 2023. </p>

Dr ZJ did not respond to that letter.  On 13, 25 and 27 July 2023 the applicants&#8217; lawyers again wrote to Dr ZJ by email inviting her to sign an affidavit confirming her knowledge of the surrogate&#8217;s whereabouts.  No response was received to any of those enquiries.</p>

QR was conceived by IVF, this procedure having been undertaken in a clinic in India.  She was born via gestational surrogacy and she is not biologically related to the surrogate, XY.  I have seen DNA test results which show that EF is the father of QR. </p>

Through no fault of the applicants, there is a lack of clarity about how much of the money received by the surrogate can be described as &#8220;reasonable expenses.&#8221;  Finally, QR&#8217;s welfare is paramount and overrides all other matters.  She needs a parental order to recognise and cement her place in her new family.  I retrospectively authorise the payments made to Dr ZJ and, by extension to the surrogate, XY. </p>

The reasons for this provision are obvious.  A surrogate mother is not merely a cipher.  She plays the most important role in bringing the child into the world.

It is, therefore, not surprising that some surrogate mothers find it impossible to part with their babies and give consent to the parental order.

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.98in">&#8220;First, when it is said that the woman who gave birth to the child cannot be found, the court must carefully scrutinise the evidence as to the efforts which have been taken to find her.  It is only when all reasonable steps have been taken to locate her without success that a court is likely to dispense with the need for valid consent.  Half-hearted or token attempts to find the surrogate will not be enough.  Furthermore, it will normally be prudent for the applicants to lay the ground for satisfying these requirements at an early stage.  Even where, as in this case, the applicants do not meet the surrogate, they should establish clear lines of communication with her, preferably not simply through one person or agency, and should ensure that the surrogate is made aware during the pregnancy that she will be required to give consent six weeks after the birth.</p>

The weight attached to such earlier consent is, however, likely to be limited.  The courts must be careful not to use such evidence to undermine the legal requirement that a consent is only valid if given after six weeks.</p>

Mr Ford submits, and I accept, that this includes decisions about whether to make an order without the consent of the woman who gave birth in circumstances in which she cannot be found or is incapable of giving consent.  It would, however, be wrong to utilise this provision as a means of avoiding the need to take all reasonable steps to attain the woman&#8217;s consent.&#8221;</p>

The applicants have also been sensitive to the cultural issues arising from attempts to locate XY and were concerned that to do so might compromise her safety and well-being.  Therefore, they decided not to send correspondence to the address on the surrogacy agreement, this being but a temporary address in Mumbai where XY is said to have resided with her sister.  They did so because Dr ZJ had confirmed that XY had apparently moved back to Nepal and there was, thus, the possibility of correspondence being read by unknown third parties.

XY was described as being estranged from her husband but that may no longer be the case.  She may have formally ended one marriage to embark upon another relationship and in both of those scenarios I cannot know if she has told her husband, old or new, of her experience as a surrogate.

That proportionality evaluation, Mr Powell submitted, is of course specific to the circumstances of the individual case but it is also specific to the context and the cultural situation in the country wherein the surrogacy has taken place.  Proportionality is of course engaged by the surrogate&#8217;s rights to privacy and to respect for her Article 8 rights.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in">EF described quite candidly in his written evidence and in what he told me this morning that the applicants were simply unaware of the need to apply for a parental order.  They thought as Indian nationals that they did not need to do so because they would have an Indian passport and an Indian birth certificate showing them as the lawful parents of QR.  Once it became apparent when they applied for QR to obtain a visa that they should make an application for a parental order, they applied for such an order immediately having taken specialist advice.  Had it not been for the Covid lockdowns that swept the world in March 2020 and QR&#8217;s ill health, the applicants would no doubt have returned to this jurisdiction within the first six months of her life.  I accept that the combination of QR&#8217;s ill health, their ignorance and the Covid pandemic, together with poor legal advice in the summer of 2022, contributed to the delay in applying.  These were not applicants who deliberately tarried.  The minute they knew that they had to apply they did so.</p>

This cannot, in my view, have been the intention of Parliament in the circumstances of this particular case.  Were I not to permit their application to proceed, that would ultimately be prejudicial to QR&#8217;s best interests.  They are the only people who seek to exercise parental responsibility for her in circumstances where no one else is available to do so.  I am satisfied that I can disapply the requirement in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54(3)</ref> and permit this application to proceed.</p>

A parental order, like an adoption order, has an effect extending far beyond the merely legal.  It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious, consequences.  It creates what Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (Adoption: Non-Patrial)</span> [1998] INLR 424, 429, referred to as &#8216;the psychological relationship of parent and child with all its far-reaching manifestations and consequences.&#8217;  Moreover, these consequences are lifelong and, for all practical purposes, irreversible ... and the court considering an application for a parental order is required to treat the child&#8217;s welfare throughout his life<span style="font-style:italic"/>as paramount ...

	    <p style="margin-left:0.4in">The contents of Ms Baker&#8217;s report make plain that QR is thriving in the care of the applicants.  She is clearly a much loved and wanted child.  She needs a parental order to give permanence and security to her care arrangements in circumstances where no one else other than the applicants seek to provide lifelong care for her.  As Mr Powell put it, QR enjoys a family life with the applicants, that is her social reality.  A parental order will not only reflect her life story but will make her legally part of the applicants&#8217; family, thereby ensuring her social and legal realities are congruent.  I observe that QR will need a full understanding of how she came to be born and will require support and love from her family to deal with this information as and when it is made known to her.  EF has told me that he and his wife intend to impart that information to QR in a child-focused and appropriate way.  </p>

Many of the problems in this case would have been avoided if the applicants had informed themselves about the legal requirements for making a child born via surrogacy their own child according to the law in this jurisdiction.  This case is also a cautionary tale about the problems arising with arm&#8217;s length surrogacy arrangements.  That is my decision.</p>
