She has a long-standing diagnosis of schizophrenia but it is common ground that her symptoms are substantially controlled by depot medication. More pertinent to these proceedings, she has mild learning difficulties. She has poorly controlled diabetes, which has led to impaired vision and chronic kidney disease, for which she receives dialysis three days a week. She is described as &#8216;morbidly obese&#8217; and &#8216;blind&#8217;, and has limited mobility. At the outset of the hearing she required two sticks to mobilise. Since the commencement of this hearing, SJF has fallen on more than one occasion and has had three admissions to hospital (where she remains presently.) Her mobility is now further reduced to &#8216;a few steps&#8217; and it is not clear whether or how much improvement on that may be regained.    </p>

He attended a Special Needs school and his ability to read and write is limited. He is represented in these proceedings, and considerable care has been taken by his representatives and the court to ensure that the matter has proceeded in a way which has not overwhelmed his ability to give instructions. In particular, most of the second morning of the hearing was taken up with clarifying whether or not JJF wished to part company with his representatives. Ultimately he decided to retain their services. I commend Ms. Hearnden and Mr. Lowenstein for the care they have taken to ensure that JJF&#8217;s case is seen by him to have been fully presented to the Court.  </p>

JJF provided support at other times but he was finding it difficult to cope. An incident occurred which prompted SJF&#8217;s GP (Dr. Carter) to raise a safeguarding alert. JJF&#8217;s conduct towards Dr Carter subsequently meant that she could no longer continue as SJF&#8217;s GP. JJF pleaded guilty to an assault on his mother.

It is on the ground floor and all on one level. The flat has a kitchen, dining area, wet room, small garden and two bedrooms. There are two ways in which this accommodation could be used. Either the flat could be exclusive to SJF, with the second bedroom used for a sleep-in carer; or a second &#8220;service user&#8221; could &#8220;share&#8221; the flat with SJF, sleeping in the second bedroom. If SJF were to have exclusive occupation of L flat, the Applicant would provide 4 visits a day plus a night support worker. If the flat was to be shared with a second person, a waking night support worker would be funded. Ms. George&#8217;s latest statement refers [<span style="font-weight:bold">G809]</span> to 4 care visits in the daytime and a &#8220;Waking Night-Support worker,&#8221; which suggests that &#8220;sharing&#8221; the flat with another resident is very much envisaged. </p>

By the start of the hearing, the position had changed to being willing to facilitate contact at L flat during one of the 4 care visits, with a second support worker being provided for that session (ie contact limited to 45 minutes to one hour a day). Ms. George&#8217;s latest statement refers [<span style="font-weight:bold">G809</span>] to twice weekly contact at the flat for a period of 2 hours. Ms. Walker confirmed that this is an error and the intention of the Local Authority is to enable contact at the flat <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">three</span> times per week, with both the usual support worker and an additional support worker present; and additionally 3 hours per week of &#8216;community access&#8217;, with support from one support worker.

By the end of the third day of the hearing, the Litigation Friend was minded &#8220;not to stand in the way of&#8221; a trial of Option 1, and that remained the position until after the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December hearing. However, by 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December [<span style="font-weight:bold">J358</span>] the Litigation Friend&#8217;s position was that the deterioration in SJF&#8217;s health and mobility now meant that a trial home would not be in her best interests, and Option 4 was preferred. </p>

Therefore she was unable to weigh up the information about the impact of her diet on her diabetes&#8221; and lacks capacity around diabetes treatment.

SJF was initially willing to go but on the day of the visits, JJF rang whilst they were preparing to leave [<span style="font-weight:bold">I114</span>]. SJF then said that they should wait for him to arrive. When he did arrive he wanted to know why the visits were being undertaken without his knowledge and he became abusive. No visits took place that day. Further arrangements were made for visits on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October. Ms. Abang noted that SJF &#8220;was not really engaging&#8221; with the first visit but she &#8220;insisted she wanted to carry on with the viewing.&#8221; [<span style="font-weight:bold">I115/6</span>] By the third visit (SZ) she &#8220;appeared a bit more relaxed and was more engaging&#8221;. Back at HV, SJF was heard to tell JJF by telephone not to worry as she was not going to take any of the places.  SJF then did tell Miss Abang that she was not going to take any of the flats. She was unable to give any reason other than &#8220;I do not want them.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">On the question of incapacity, it is common ground that the diagnostic limb of the test is met but the only operative diagnosis is mild learning disability. Ms. Hearnden submits that this is not sufficient for the Court to be satisfied that SJF lacks relevant capacity. Instead, she says, this is a paradigm example of a case where professionals are &#8220;harshly judging what they see as an unwise decision as being one which betrays a lack of capacity.&#8221; Family dynamics are variable and personal to the individuals involved &#8211; some families are simply &#8220;more shouty&#8221; than others. It is, she says, for SJF to say whether she finds her son&#8217;s behaviours intolerable or to be overlooked in large part as a product of his own difficulties. Rather than being unable to understand, use or weigh information about risk to her health if she lives with him, SJF&#8217;s clearly stated wishes simply give greater weigh to her family life and her wish to be with her son, in her own home of many years. Ms. Hearnden suggests that this interpretation is borne out by the differing conclusions of professionals within the Standard Authorisation process, by Dr Rippon&#8217;s initial position in respect of the tenancy, and by other domains in which SJF is treated as having capacity. She suggests that Dr. Rippon overinflates &#8220;what might happen&#8221; and attaches undue weight to that risk, to the detriment of other considerations. </p>

I am satisfied that Dr. Rippon has carefully considered the complexities of SJF&#8217;s health conditions and her relationship with her son. I accept her conclusion that it is SJF&#8217;s underlying learning disability which directly impacts on her decision-making capacity and results in her being unable to understand, use or weigh relevant information about her treatment needs and the risks to her ability to have those needs met if she returns to live with her son at 3TH. </p>

If the hospital clinicians take a different view, this matter will have to come back to court again. I have taken the view that a decision between the currently available options needs to be taken now, notwithstanding some uncertainty in the medical picture, because of the reality that at least two of these options (2 and 4) are likely to be lost within days if no decision is made today. It is imperative that SJF has the most appropriate placement to be discharged to, if and when she is well enough.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, the magnetic factor in this matter is SJF&#8217;s need for healthcare by professionals. She is once again taking Novorapid injections, administered twice a day by care home staff; and Lantos injections, administered each morning by district nurses. Additionally her ulcers require frequent dressing and she attend dialysis three times a week. There is no realistic prospect that these healthcare needs could be met adequately or at all if she lives in first floor accommodation or with her son. The effect of failure to meet these needs will clearly be, at best, further and rapid deterioration in her health, and increased hospitalisation.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In the early stages of the hearing I expressed some concern at the Local Authority&#8217;s account of the position of healthcare professionals in respect of delivering healthcare to SJF in her own home at 3TH. It is axiomatic that healthcare district nurses and GPs should be able to carry out their important community work in safety and without fear. However, it was not apparent to me that the reported decision to refuse to attend 3TH because of risks posed by JJF was reached on the basis of full information. There appeared to be an element of &#8220;institutional echo&#8221; of JJF&#8217;s failings, possibly without proper consideration of countervailing positive factors such as his track record </p>

I have considerable sympathy with that submission but the Local Authority has now filed further documentary confirmation of the healthcare professionals&#8217; position, and there is no indication that such position may change. JJF&#8217;s suggestion that he leave the property whilst healthcare is provided is considered impracticable and unsustainable. I must therefore consider the options on the basis that necessary healthcare services could not be delivered to SJF with Option 1.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">SJF&#8217;s need for kidney dialysis requires her to leave her home and attend hospital three days a week. Those days are long and tiring for her. The process of getting there and back is an important aspect of her ability to cope with the treatment; and level entry to her home is an important aspect of the process of getting to and from the treatment. I agree with the Official Solicitor that it is not acceptable or sustainable on anything more than a temporary basis for SJF to be able to leave her home only with the assistance of 4 ambulance staff. JJF&#8217;s expectation that he will be able to help his mum with the stairs at 3TH as he did before is sadly no longer realistic. In my judgment Option 1 and Option 3, SJF&#8217;s long-term home and her current placement, are therefore both now unsuitable for her needs.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">This conclusion of course goes against SJF&#8217;s wishes. Unfortunately, it is in my judgment now impracticable to give effect to those wishes, even on a trial basis. The imperative towards implementing SJF&#8217;s clear preference is outweighed by the equally clear potential for detrimental effect to her health. Were she to return to 3TH without services from healthcare professionals at home, and with extremely restricted ability to leave that property, it seems to me inevitable that care arrangements would break down very quickly and, at best, SJF would be back in hospital again. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">The only remaining options are therefore SZ or L Flat. Neither of them is ideal. As between them, the comparison is that at SZ would have her own room within a shared house, some 15 or 9.4 miles away from dialysis; whereas at L Flat she would have her own flat (at least until another resident is identified) and be only 4 or 2.9 miles away from dialysis. On the face of it, contact would be <span style="font-style:italic">less</span> restricted at SZ but in reality, it is likely to be <span style="font-style:italic">more</span> limited simply because JJF feels unable to travel there. The deciding factor between them however is that both SJF and JJF have expressed a preference for the L Flat.  </p>

Much will depend on how JJF conducts himself in those six weeks but, just as he will need to remember his responsibilities to his mother and those who provide her with care, professionals may be expected to allow some appreciation of how difficult JJF is likely to find adapting to the new situation. I will give any party permission to bring the matter back to court if necessary for further consideration of contact arrangements at the six week review point. </p>
