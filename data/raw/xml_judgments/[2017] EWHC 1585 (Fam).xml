The proceedings in relation to Y, as I referred to him, concluded on 23 March 2017 when, without any opposition, I made a final care order in relation to him: <span style="font-style:italic">Re Y (A Child) (No 2) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/967" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 967 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 967 (Fam)</ref>. It had been intended that that should also be the final hearing in relation to X. But although it was apparent that the only possible outcome was the making of a final care order in relation to her, the care plan as put before me on that occasion was, in significant measure, too inchoate to enable me to approve it. So the final hearing had to be adjourned. I now hand down this judgment to explain why, on 15 June 2017 and without any opposition, I made a final care order in relation to X.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before proceeding any further I should mention that the court has had the advantage of reports, dated 25 January 2017 and 28 April 2017, from Dr Audrey Oppenheim, a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, following examinations of X by Dr Oppenheim on, respectively, 12 January 2017 and 24 April 2017. Following the first examination, Dr Oppenheim diagnosed an Insecure Attachment Disorder, Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Conduct Disorder and borderline learning difficulties, but said that X did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>fulfil the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis of mental illness. In her second report, focusing on X&#8217;s decision-making capacity, Dr Oppenheim said that, despite her diagnoses of Insecure Attachment Disorder, Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, she did not think that these diagnoses constitute impairment or disturbance in the functioning of the mind such that X lacks capacity to make choices and decisions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority&#8217;s final threshold document is dated 12 March 2017. I do not propose to go into all the details: there is no need to do so. In short, the local authority&#8217;s case was that from 2014 onwards X had regularly engaged in antisocial-criminal behaviours, having been arrested on numerous occasions and charged with offences of violence, including assaulting a police officer; that she presents a risk to herself through acts of self-harm and engaging in violent and destructive behaviours towards others; that she had absconded from home and demonstrated a consistent disregard towards authorities, including the police and children&#8217;s services; and that her mother (her father is dead) has demonstrated an inability to manage her aggressive and destructive behaviours and has failed to engage adequately with professionals in attempting to address these issues. Unsurprisingly, in these circumstances, and as I explained in <span style="font-style:italic">In re X, In re Y</span>, paras 5, 9, I had no choice but to require her to be placed and remain in secure accommodation.</p>

Eventually, X was sentenced by the Youth Court to a Detention and Training Order. She is currently detained in a secure unit which I shall refer to as ZX. She is expected to be released in mid-August 2017. The fact that she is subject to detention in consequence of a criminal conviction is, of course, no bar to my making a care order, though in practical terms my functions in relation to her placement and welfare inevitably remain largely in suspense pending her release: see <span style="font-style:italic">Islington London Borough Council v TM</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2050" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2050 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2050 (Fam)</ref>, paras 17, 19, quoted in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Anton) v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Re Anton</span> [2004] EWHC 2730/2731 (Admin/Fam), <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 818" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 818</ref>, para 39, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re a Ward of Court</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/1022" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 1022 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 1022 (Fam)</ref>, para 51. </p>

Whilst I am fully aware of the psychiatric assessments filed by Dr Oppenheim within these proceedings and accept that her findings are in accord with all previous such assessments of X by treating clinicians throughout her time in local authority care, I decided to relay to the parties the full extent of the observations by the secure unit staff who are with X 24 hours a day. They describe intensifying suicidal intent and ideation, and ongoing distressing restraints where X loses all control. <span style="font-style:italic">Their professional opinion, whilst not court appointed experts or medically qualified, should in my opinion be taken extremely seriously in terms of X&#8217;s safe care planning </span>(emphasis added). They observe [her] every minute of the day, even watching her from a seat near her bed whilst she sleeps such are their concerns. This is in contrast to the acknowledged problems of all the psychiatrists who have attempted to assess X as she simply refuses to engage or gives minimal, superficial answers.  In essence we have a difference between predominantly paper-based assessments and those taking place on the ground every minute of the day.&#8221;</p>

I do not believe the attachment to be secure; there is a deep-rooted insecurity within the mother/child bonding and attachment. The staff at ZX report that the overriding interaction between X and her mother during fortnightly contact visits is that [her mother] uses the majority of the time up relaying to X various family events, arguments or crises, leaving X still craving signs of affection or personal parental interest at the end of the time they have had together.</p>

Those of us who have known the family for the entirety of these proceedings will recognise that despite X and [her mother&#8217;s] professed love for each other, there are risks within their relationship, on the surface a close one to the exclusion of all others, yet underneath it a mass of unmet need for X and an ever present resentment and jealousy of her younger siblings whom she perceives as receiving more love and attention from [her mother].&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The facts of this case are calamitous. Indeed, a review of the initial evidence of the local authority from April 2015 (now over two years old) makes for sobering reading at what must today (by necessity of X&#8217;s pending majority) be the final hearing. At the time these proceedings were issued, the local authority were concerned for a child with poor school attendance, &#8216;low-level criminality&#8217;, periods of absconding and a mother who lacked the insight and parenting capacity to assist. Now, in June 2017, the court finds itself tasked with determining issues of welfare for a child seemingly committed to killing herself, with a raft of serious criminal convictions to her name and a toxic relationship with her mother. It would be an understatement to say that matters have moved on since April 2015; it is difficult to see, however, what (if any) progress has been made in the face of the appalling deterioration in X&#8217;s life that has taken place while in the care of the local authority. [She] has completed little if any therapeutic work; repeated opportunities to make progress were repeatedly lost in the early stages of this case such that (one might think) <span style="font-style:italic">we are no closer to a resolution: she remains in secure placement, with deteriorating behaviour and not a hint of a realistic exit plan</span> (emphasis added).&#8221;</p>

At the advocates&#8217; meeting on 13 June, it was confirmed that a multi-agency meeting involving professionals from health and social care will be convened with a view to considering (in the first instance) whether or not there is now scope for psychiatric intervention. This would certainly be supported by the guardian in light of her most recent report and the <span style="font-style:italic">considerable doubt that has been expressed by professionals on the ground as to Dr Oppenheim&#8217;s conclusion that X&#8217;s suicidal tendencies are behavioural rather than issues of mental health</span> (emphasis added).

The local authority acknowledges that, in light of the level of self-harming behaviours exhibited by X, including apparently obsessive expressions of a wish to die, it is &#8220;highly doubtful&#8221; that her behaviours can be effectively managed in a community setting. He says:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The local authority is alive to the urgent need to identify an appropriate placement and is making enquiries with health professionals, including Dr Oppenheim, in this respect. It may be that some form of private hospital/clinical provision could be identified where X can receive therapeutic treatment/input, in line with the recommendations of Dr Oppenheim; the local authority wishes to make clear that there are no budgetary restrictions placed upon searching for appropriate placement provision. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Currently, given X&#8217;s behaviours, the local authority&#8217;s position is that any placement immediately following her release from ZX will require restrictions to be placed upon her liberty; Section 25 is, in the view of the local authority, no longer an appropriate avenue &#8230; Accordingly, unless she is either detained under the Mental Health Act or assessed as lacking capacity, the only way for the local authority to obtain lawful authorisation for any such restrictions would be via the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction. If she is assessed as lacking capacity then the jurisdiction of the Court of Protection could potentially be used in order to seek authorisation of a restrictive care plan, however, currently, this child has been assessed as having capacity and there is no evidence which can properly be elicited to rebut that presumption. Accordingly, any placement sourced by the local authority is going to require restrictions to be placed upon X&#8217;s liberty, including possible restraint; in the absence of such restrictions there is ample evidence that she will simply abscond and resort to self-harming behaviours/attempts to take her own life. The local authority therefore sees it as inevitable that it is going to have to make a further application to the court, prior to her release from ZX, in order to authorise a restrictive care plan, which will clearly be required once a placement is identified.&#8221;</p>
