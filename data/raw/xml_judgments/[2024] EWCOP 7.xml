She would be part of the team monitoring both CP&#8217;s mental and physical health during delivery. Dr X gave oral evidence in Dr Z&#8217;s stead. I am grateful to Dr X for reading himself into the case at relatively short notice and for the focused and cogent evidence he gave. From that evidence it was clear that he was not simply following his colleagues' opinion but that he had formed his own professional view which built upon that already before the court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Before the hearing began, I met with CP who attended on the link with the support and assistance of a representative of her solicitors. In court was her own counsel and the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative who very kindly kept a note of my conversation with CP. That note was then circulated to all parties before the hearing began. Having met CP, I can report that she was as described by her clinicians. CP is clearly a bright woman. She was able to tell me that she wanted a pre-arranged Caesarean and a spinal block. She told me that she wanted a spinal block because she wanted to be present for the birth. That seemed to me to be a good reason and a reasonable one. She was content with the operation taking place on 14 February 2024 but wanted to move to the acute hospital before then. Her reasoning appeared to me to be dominated by her needs. She wanted to leave her current hospital because she found its regime of confinement in her words &#8220;traumatic&#8221;. She was not allowed out. She failed to tell me that she had previously absconded when escorted for a cigarette break. I was left with the impression, not just by what she said but how she said it, that the motivation to move to the acute hospital sooner than planned may well have been the plans in place there to enable her to smoke outside the hospital and vape within it. As a result of CP&#8217;s firm wish to move sooner than 14 February, her counsel made enquiries of the acute Trust. The plan could not be put into place sooner than already arranged. Thus, what CP wanted was not achievable and it was not pursued on her behalf.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">CP is now 30 years old. When circumstances allow, she is a heavy smoker. She has misused alcohol and illicit drugs. She is an intelligent woman. She is highly educated. Her first known meeting with mental health services was in January 2021. At that time, she was 27 years old and was said to be presenting with symptoms of possible schizophrenia. Notes from that time record that CP herself had been worried since 2017 that she might be schizophrenic, but she had not liked to voice her concerns for fear of stigmatisation. They also record her speaking about her troubled childhood which she says was traumatic.  CP was discharged from mental health services in the Autumn of 2021. She had no contact with them again until March 2022 when she referred herself. By 11 May 2022 she was in crisis. She was exhibiting disinhibited and self-neglecting behaviours which put herself at risk. On 13 May 2022, CP was detained under s.2 of the MHA. On 20 June 2022, she was discharged for home treatment. The planned home treatment was interrupted when CP absconded from the hospital to which she had been taken for treatment for a physical injury. Shortly after this episode she was made homeless. By the end of December 2022, CP had travelled to Amsterdam where she settled for a while.  Whilst in Amsterdam, her behaviour remained erratic and reckless. It is reported that whilst in Amsterdam she was drinking two bottles of wine a day. In February 2023, CP was admitted to intensive care in Amsterdam. She absconded from there during a cigarette break. CP was located and thereafter detained on a closed ward in Amsterdam until 29 March 2023. On detention her urine screen was positive for cocaine and THC. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">From 2017 until her detention in hospital in May 2022, CP was estranged from her parents. Thereafter CP has had intermittent contact with her father. There is evidence of her father taking steps to minimise the risks to which CP was exposing herself in Amsterdam. On 29 March 2023, CP flew home with her father from Holland. On return to England, CP had a base with her parents and input from the community mental health team. Her behaviours, however, continued to be erratic. She stayed with a man whose identity caused her father and professionals concern that she may be being exploited, and she was observed to be drinking alcohol excessively and regularly. To date, CP remains in contact with her father who visits her regularly. She has no current contact with her mother or her younger sister. She has stated that she does not want either of her parents at the baby&#8217;s birth.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"> On 22 August 2023, CP was assessed following the execution of a s.135 warrant. She was found in a state of self-neglect surrounded by empty wine bottles and cigarette butts. She was initially admitted to hospital under s.2 of the MHA. Whilst so detained she absconded more than once.  On 14 September 2023, CP was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3</ref> of the MHA. Since then, CP&#8217;s behaviours have included repeated claims that she is claustrophobic on the ward and needs to have coffee and a cigarette. For CP her need to smoke has been a pre-occupation throughout her detention. CP has made several attempts to abscond, one of which has been successful. Despite changes in medication, she remains acutely unwell with auditory hallucinations. </p>

I am told by Dr B that CP appears focused on her needs and in particular on her need to smoke and to have a cigarette. Ms M describes her as being detached and showing no interest in her baby during her antenatal care. Mr N tells the court that when he discussed her pregnancy with her, she was uninterested.</p>

However, even when detained in her mental health hospital CP has managed to abscond and did so on 30 October 2023 by eluding two members of staff when being escorted in the grounds for a cigarette break. She was missing for 4 weeks. She was returned to hospital on 23 November 2023. In the meantime, her mental health had deteriorated. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">CP&#8217;s view about her pregnancy has changed overtime. In November and early December 2023, the evidence was that CP wanted an emergency abortion. That was not an achievable option. CP&#8217;s view then changed to wanting to go to a mother and baby unit after the birth.  CP&#8217;s interest in a mother and baby unit appears to be linked to the possibility of a more relaxed environment in which she may be allowed to smoke.</p>

More recently she has expressed a wish for a pre-arranged C-section. That appears to be a reactive stance precipitated by Braxton Hicks with which she is not coping. It is an agreed fact that CP does not tolerate pain well.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In terms of CP&#8217;s mental health, she has been prescribed haloperidol since 11 December 2023. That medication has elicited a partial response. Her emotions are more settled, and her self-care has improved. There are mild improvements in her mental health, but she continues to respond to unseen stimuli. Her schizophrenia continues to impair her ability to order her thoughts and make decisions. She has displayed a pattern of behaviour which has not really changed over the last 18 months even when apparently treated with antipsychotic medication. She has displayed self-destructive and risky behaviours even on haloperidol. Dr C&#8217;s evidence to this court, which I accept, is that it is unlikely that any anti-psychotic medication will improve her executive functioning.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Applying the relevant law to the facts of this case, I concluded that joining CP&#8217;s parents would not enable me to better deal with this case. They each told me that they simply wished to observe the proceedings. They had not put any formal written evidence before this court, nor did they seek to do so.  They did not want to give oral evidence, nor did they wish to challenge any of the evidence before me. Their view that CP is not good at handling pain and would find a natural delivery a very difficult experience had been expressed to the clinicians who had reflected that in their written evidence before me. They reaffirmed that view when they spoke to me. They had nothing to add. CP, on the other hand, was opposed to their joinder. Whilst her reasons were brief and not fully informed, I weighed them in the balance. I also factored in the fractured relationship between CP and her parents. Standing back and looking at all the factors in this case I am obliged to consider and in particular factoring in the matters I have articulate in this paragraph, I considered that joining CPs parents would add nothing to this hearing.  In those circumstances CP&#8217;s parents remained observers to the proceedings. As such they were able to witness first-hand that the issues concerning their daughter were dealt with thoroughly and properly without having to enter the fray. That was, in reality, what they wished to achieve.</p>

CP&#8217;s risk taking and impulsivity impacts on her decisions making including her decisions about her obstetric treatment. Her decision making is short term and responsive to her immediate needs rather than considered and long term. Whilst there has been improvement in her mental health since being prescribed haloperidol, the improvement is relatively mild and has not improved her decision-making capacity. There is unlikely to be a change in her capacity which will affect her capacity to make decisions about her obstetric care. Sadly, she has been experiencing symptoms consistent with schizophrenia since early/mid 2021. Even when adequately and appropriately medicated, the improvement is mild and not substantive.</p>

The purpose of the best interests test is to consider matters from the patient's point of view. That is not to say that his wishes must prevail, any more than those of a fully capable patient must prevail. We cannot always have what we want. Nor will it always be possible to ascertain what an incapable patient's wishes are. Even if it is possible to determine what his views were in the past, they might well have changed in the light of the stresses and strains of his current predicament. In this case, the highest it could be put was, as counsel had agreed, that "It was likely that Mr James would want treatment up to the point where it became hopeless". But insofar as it is possible to ascertain the patient's wishes and feelings, his beliefs and values or the things which were important to him, it is those which should be taken into account because they are a component in making the choice which is right for him as an individual human being&#8217;. </span></p>

Respecting individual autonomy does not always require P&#8217;s wishes to be afforded predominant weight. Sometimes it will be right to do so, sometimes 12 it will not. The factors that fall to be considered in this intensely complex process are infinitely variable e.g. the nature of the contemplated treatment, how intrusive such treatment might be and crucially what the outcome of that treatment maybe for the individual patient. Into that complex matrix the appropriate weight to be given to P&#8217;s wishes will vary. What must be stressed is the obligation imposed by statute to inquire into these matters and for the decision maker fully to consider them. Finally, I would observe that an assessment of P&#8217;s wishes, views and attitudes are not to be confined within the narrow parameters of what P may have said. Strong feelings are often expressed non-verbally, sometimes in contradistinction to what is actually said. Evaluating the wider canvass may involve deriving an understanding of P&#8217;s views from what he may have done in the past in circumstances which may cast light on the strength of his views on the contemplated treatment&#8217;.</span></p>

That resonates with Ms M&#8217;s evidence, which I accept, that in discussion with CP, CP showed no real understanding of the natural birth process, its likely duration or the pain associated with it. </p>

On 5 February 2024, CP told Ms M that she wanted a pre-arranged Caesarean section before 16 February 2024 because she could not cope with the pain of the Braxton Hicks longer than that. CP accepts that that operation has been arranged for 14 February 2024 and has told me today that that is what she wants. I accept the evidence before me from the clinicians that CP&#8217;s decision is likely to be based on the discomfort she feels. It seems to me that it is not unnatural nor is it out with normal human experience for a first-time mother experiencing the realities of the process of labour to change her mind from wanting a natural birth to wanting a Caesarean section as quickly as possible. It is also not unnatural nor unreasonable to begin to experience pain and change your mind. I consider that a desire to avoid pain is a significant motivating factor for CP.</p>

If that were to occur, she would not necessarily have the package of support around her that a planned process permits. There would be a risk of an emergency caesarean section and that simply because of its urgency is likely to be traumatic. There are also physical risks of CP not cooperating with a natural labour and the management that is needed to prevent vaginal tears and lacerations such as instrument use to facilitate delivery or interventions to prevent potential haemorrhages. Without management these are grave risks. The risks cannot be managed without the patient&#8217;s cooperation. CP has a history of non-cooperation with staff. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Dr B sets out the comparative impact of the two options from his perspective, namely their likely impact on her mental health. Natural birth would be painful. CP does not tolerate pain well and is likely to find it difficult to manage. She is likely to find the experience highly stressful. Natural birth will require CP to cooperate, and CP is in Dr G&#8217;s opinion unlikely to follow commands; indeed, she has a history in other settings of not doing so. Failing to comply will lead to restraint and interventions performed in an emergency. Without adequate anxiolytics (especially during transfer to the acute hospital), CP is likely to try to abscond. Any such attempt would illicit a response which is likely to include restraint. Again, that is likely to increase CP&#8217;s stress and anxiety. A pre-arranged C-section would have the benefit of being organised and relatively calm. CP will have her anxiolytic medication and trained staff familiar to her around her on transfer, during birth and afterwards. The process is likely to be less painful and thus less traumatic for her. This of itself reduces the risk of non-cooperation with the delivery of her baby and reduces the risks to herself, her baby and her medical treating team of non-cooperative and risk-taking behaviours during labour.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In his statements to this court, Mr N very fairly sets out the advantages and disadvantages of vaginal birth and the advantages and disadvantages of a prearranged caesarean birth. The advantage of vaginal delivery is that it has the best clinical outcome for a medically low risk of primigravida. Recovery time is quicker than after a caesarean, there is no uterine or abdominal scar, there are less use of lines and thus less likelihood of wounds and infections. However, it is likely that CP will not tolerate the prolonged pain of labour over a protracted time. There is a risk she will not recognise that she is in labour, and she may delay summonsing help. There is a risk she will abscond. She is unlikely to cooperate with the management of the birth and with the professionals managing it. CP has a history of non-cooperation.  Calming, anxiety reducing anxiolytic medication would not be conducive to a natural birth. She may attempt to abscond and if she did, she would be restrained. All of which would have a deleterious effect on her mental health. In relation to a pre-arranged caesarean section, Mr N&#8217;s evidence, accepted by all before the court, is that the procedure will take 1-2 hours. There is less risk of CP becoming distressed or moving during the procedure although despite anaesthetic she may feel movement within her abdomen. Restraint is less likely to be necessary but even if it is, it is likely to be for a shorter period than during vaginal delivery. Because this procedure will be pre-arranged there will a seamless plan in place to transfer CP from the hospital where she is detained to the acute hospital for a procedure which will be conducted by a specialist team made up of familiar faces. Every caesarean section comes with risks, there will be intravenous, catheter, and drains which there is a risk she will move. There will be wound sites and thus an increased risk of infections. As the anaesthetic wears off there will be a risk of absconding which can be mitigated by supervision but cannot be eliminated.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On the basis of the evidence before me, I make a balance sheet of the advantages and disadvantages of both options. I note Mr N&#8217;s accepted evidence is that recovery from a spinal block is quicker than general anaesthetic. There is a lower risk of chest infection and a lower risk of aspiration. A spinal block is less likely to cause sickness and vomiting. It will be quicker to return to eating and drinking following the procedure. A spinal block also has the benefit of providing good pain relief immediately after surgery meaning there is less need for post-operative pain relief and the risk of associated side-effects. However, a spinal block does require CP to keep very still when the needle is inserted into the subarachnoid space or there is a risk of a dural tap and/or permanent headaches and nerve damage. CP may experience a short sharp scratch when the injections is given. CP may find the feeling of loss of sensation in her legs bewildering. The feeling is likely to be that of pins and needles but sometimes it is a short sharp shooting pain of momentary duration measured in milliseconds. There is also a risk that the anaesthetic could be administered in the wrong place, making the spinal not effective enough to perform the Caesarean section. Tests can be performed, including a cold spay, to ensure it is effective. Other complications include bleeding potentially around the spinal column, difficulty urinating, stop in blood pressure, infection of the spine and seizures are a rare risk if the spinal block cannot be administered or is not effective, then it is agreed in the circumstances of the care plan placed before me that it will be in CP&#8217;s best interests to use general anaesthetic. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">General anaesthetic has a number of benefits, not least CP will not be able to move at all. She will have no awareness of the procedure and will not become distressed or agitated during it. She will not need to be restrained when under the anaesthetic. However, there are risks. There is a greater risk of aspiration, failed intubation and chest infections. In oral evidence Dr X explained that in CP&#8217;s case, you had to factor in that she is a smoker. That leads to an increase in post-operative chest infection. There is an increased possibility she will need to go to HDU, although it is not inevitable. There is an increased risk of lung infection. She will have taken medication to calm and keep her calm when being transferred to the acute hospital and to the operating theatre. There is a risk because you do not know her metabolism and the individual effect of the sedatives on her. There is thus an increased risk that she will not be able to be managed on the maternity unit. In the longer terms, there are increased risks of lung scarring and poor respiratory recovery. Whilst the expectation is a good recovery, these are risks which need to be factored in. </p>

I consider that the risks as the effects of the anaesthetic wears off are likely to include CP seeking to abscond when she cannot walk properly but those risks can be managed by appropriate supervision. CP is likely to regain mobility faster after a spinal block than a general anaesthetic. A speedier recovery will be concordant with CP&#8217;s wish to move to the mother and baby unit and into an environment where she can smoke as quickly as possible. </p>
