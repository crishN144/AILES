DNA tests were then undertaken and it was shown that he was not the father.  Further tests ruled out DN and another man put forward by the Mother, namely EH.  The Mother has recently suggested the father might be DN&#8217;s adopted half-brother, MF. DNA tests will have to be undertaken but, as at the date of this hearing, the identity of W&#8217;s father remains unascertained.  This is clearly highly regrettable.  The Mother bears full responsibility for that.</p>

She accepted that the children had suffered significant harm as a result of the care given to them by her.  She accepted that neither child could return to her care.  As I have already indicated, this goes to her considerable credit. </p>

Again, to her considerable credit, the Mother recognised the need for stability in the placement.  She accepted that her contact should reduce from twice per week to once every two months.  She further agreed it should be supervised.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There was considerably more uncertainty in relation to W.  The Mother accepted that he could not return to her care.  The Local Authority&#8217;s initial care plan proposed that he remain in long-term foster care but this had been based on a misapprehension that there were no potential adopters available for W.  Further enquiries found two possible matches.  It was, however, not known if either would be suitable.  Equally, no application had been made for a placement order. At this stage, I merely observe that the test for adoption is not a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">best interests</span>&#8221; determination.  Such an order can only be made if &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">nothing else will do</span>&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second significant unknown in relation to W relates to the identity of his father.  I have made it clear on a number of occasions that he is entitled to know the identity of his father and that it is of very considerable importance.  All reasonable steps should be taken to discover the truth.  If it emerged that MF was the father, I was informed that the H family would wish to put forward a potential carer for him, possibly RH, the paternal grandfather of M.  Given that his son had been approved as a carer for M, it could hardly be said that there was no reasonable prospect of such an application being successful.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It followed that I came to the clear conclusion that I was not able to deal finally with W at this hearing.  I briefly considered making a final care order.  This would still have enabled me to deal subsequently with an application for a placement order but I would not have been able to approve a final care plan.  Moreover, I would not have been able to decide, in the event of a dispute, whether or not a member of the H family should care for W.  It became clear that I would have to continue the interim care order in relation to W, whilst dealing finally with M&#8217;s case.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The importance of the three issues can be seen by their seriousness.  If an allegation has been made falsely, the wrongly accused individual is entitled to a finding to that effect.  Such matters are clearly of relevance both in relation to any future consideration of the welfare of W, in particular, but also M.  They are also of great relevance in relation to any children that either the Mother or DJ may have in the future. Following the decision of McFarlane J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A County Council v DP, RS and BS</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 1031" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 1031</ref>, I was clear that it was appropriate for me to investigate these matters, albeit in a proportionate way.  In agreeing to do so, I recognised that it might not be possible to come to a definitive conclusion on all three issues, even on the balance of probabilities.</p>

By the time of the hearing, the Grandmother was not seeking residence of either child.  She did, however, wish to pursue an application for limited direct contact, albeit supervised.  It was, however, clear that the difficulties she faced were recognised by Ms Brandon.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are numerous extremely serious allegations levelled against the Grandmother.  She disputes most of them.  I have not carried out a fact-finding enquiry into those allegations.  It would be entirely disproportionate to do so in relation to a non-parent.  It follows that I will deal only with those matters that are not in dispute with two exceptions.  First, a number of findings were made by Anthony Lincoln J in relation to the Grandmother, in Wardship proceedings in 1988.  The Grandmother does not accept some of those findings.  I consider, however, that they are res judicata.  In other words, the issue has already been decided. I am satisfied that I should proceed on the basis of those findings, notwithstanding the Grandmother&#8217;s continuing denial. </p>

I have already indicated that I have not investigated them and therefore make no findings.  There is, however, by her own admission, no doubt that she has had a troubled life to date.  In  2002, a subsequent partner of the Grandmother, RM died in tragic circumstances.  It appears that the Mother was close to RM and this had a traumatic impact upon her.  The Mother has also alleged that, as a young child, she suffered serious sexual abuse.  This is denied by the alleged abuser, so  I cannot make findings.  All I can say is that, if the allegations are true, the court has nothing but the deepest sympathy for her.  In any event, it is abundantly clear that she has had a chaotic and unstable personal life as an adult.   </p>

The mere fact that a witness tells a lie in relation to one aspect is not in itself evidence of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">guilt</span>&#8221; or, as here, that the Local Authority&#8217;s allegations are true.

They may be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">innocent</span>&#8221; ones in the sense that they do not denote responsibility for tampering with W&#8217;s shunt.  For example, they may be lies to bolster a true case; or to protect someone else; or to conceal some other conduct unrelated to the matters in dispute before me; or out of panic, distress or confusion.

However, if I am satisfied that there is no such explanation, I can take the lies into account in my assessment as to this issue.  Equally, I must perform the same assessment in reverse when determining the allegation against the Grandmother.

The second set of bruising, identified later in December 2013, came into a different category.  It was possible that some of these bruises were caused accidentally.

It says that the week commencing 9th December 2013 was a difficult week for the Mother.  The anniversary of the birth of RM was approaching. This brought back traumatic memories for her and upset her.  W had been sick and distressed.  At times, he would shout and kick out a lot. It could be difficult to change his nappy as he would wrestle with her.  She had not been sleeping well and was very tired and unwell.

I formed the view that it was not therefore necessary to examine the matter further.  It follows that both DJ and the Grandmother are cleared of any involvement in the bruising.  They are both entitled to a finding that they have not caused any non-accidental injuries to W.  It was very regrettable that the Mother ever sought to blame DJ, given that she knew all along that he was innocent.  It is particularly regrettable in circumstances where she further alleged that he was the father of W when she knew at the very least that there was a doubt about it.  He was misled over a long period in relation to something very personal and very important.  He is entitled to an apology in relation to both matters.  </p>

So far as the 12th December grip mark bruising is concerned, I find that it was inflicted by the Mother using unnecessary and unreasonable force.  I do not believe that she deliberately sought to hurt W but she was reckless as to whether or not that was the effect.  Frustration would have played a part.  She knew it was excessive but was unable to admit it at the time.  It is, however, to her credit that she has now been able to do so, even at the eleventh hour.   </p>

A button is attached to the shunt.  It is embedded into the skull but is slightly raised from the scalp.  It is difficult to see save under close examination. It is quite clear that only medical professionals should ever depress the button.  The Local Authority&#8217;s allegation is that the Mother has, on a number of occasions, done so.  The Mother denies having done so.</p>

It should not depress itself so it was thought that the Mother might have been doing it.  The Mother accepts that she pressed the button but says she was asked to do so by a doctor at the hospital on the basis that he was not an expert in that field.  She denied in oral evidence that she had received training in how to manage the shunt and denied being told not to press the button.  </p>

The record goes on to say that she noticed it would not fill up for minutes and was getting worse each night.  In the evening, she said it was depressed.  She told me in evidence that she could not remember this incident but that she had not deliberately pressed the button whilst nursing W. Dr Ward&#8217;s conclusion was that it was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">highly unlikely that a shunt would get pushed in in this way</span>.&#8221;</p>

I am sure she would have been told from the very outset not to touch the button.  I reject her suggestion to the contrary.  I do not believe a doctor would have asked her to depress the button in March 2013.  I accept the medical notes.  I reject her case that the button was accidentally pushed in when she was nursing W.  I do not accept that she could remember what happened in March but not in May.  I reject the suggestion that it was further pushed in by contact with one of the metal bars on the hospital bed.  I also reject her evidence that she had not been told not to depress the button at the outset.</p>

She sought solace in her own FII, so that the burden of caring for W and M had to be taken over by someone else, in this case the Grandmother.  When she was in charge, she felt the need to secure more help and assistance.  One way was to exaggerate or fabricate symptoms with W.  Fiddling with his shunt was one such mechanism that enabled her to seek more assistance from medical professionals.  The consequences for him could have been extremely serious.</p>

He was told this was to administer a suppository.  In his evidence in chief, he repeated this but said he only saw it once.  In cross-examination by Mr Owen-Casey for the Mother, he said he had not seen the Mother do it.  It was clear from his other evidence that he turned away at the relevant time but that, in any event, whatever was happening was being done by the Grandmother.

He also saw the Grandmother perform a number of bowel washes but said that there was, in his view, nothing sinister in what he saw.  I do not understand why his written evidence was to the effect that he had seen it done.  Indeed, his evidence in chief had initially confirmed that.  Whilst it might be said that he was now minimising what happened, he has no reason to help the Mother and the Grandmother given what has happened.

CL said that the Grandmother told her that she had been informed by health professionals to insert her finger into W&#8217;s bottom to help him if constipated.  The Grandmother denies this and says it is inherently unlikely that she would do so at a family get together.  I have not heard oral evidence from CL.

When cross-examined by Mr Sellars for the Local Authority, she said she used a tissue as it was half way out but that she couldn&#8217;t just sit there for an hour and a half waiting.

This did involve putting the tip of her finger inside the anus.  I accept entirely that this did not have any sexual motive.  It was done to get the poo out.  It was, however, quite wrong to do so.  It could have done serious damage to W, particularly given the Grandmother&#8217;s nails which she told me were quite long.  The Grandmother should have been aware of this.  It is, in my view, another example of an inability of Mother and Grandmother to cope with W&#8217;s problems.   </p>

This is not a borderline case.  It is a serious case.  The allegations are, as Mr Sellars submitted, at the top end of the range.  There would be a high likelihood of repetition if either child was placed back with the Mother.  That cannot happen. I of course accept entirely that the Mother loves M and W very much.  It is a tragedy that she has been unable to cope but the court cannot permit the children to suffer further harm as a result.  It is to her huge credit that she accepts this.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I therefore approve the Local Authority Care Plan for M.  There will be a care order in favour of XZ on the basis that M will reside with her Father, MH.  Her contact to her Mother will be reduced to six times per annum on a supervised basis to ensure stability in her placement with her Father.  There will be a risk assessment conducted by the Local Authority in relation to contact with the Grandmother.  Even if the assessment is positive, this will just be for identity contact.  At best, it will be once per annum on a supervised basis with indirect contact (cards and small presents) twice per annum for birthdays and Christmas.  I do consider that it would be appropriate for the Grandmother to have a photograph of M (and W) once per annum.  This would obviously end if the photograph was placed on the internet or otherwise misused and might end if W is placed for adoption.    </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In relation to M&#8217;s name, I must apply the welfare test, considering all the circumstances.  I have already indicated that I consider the Mother&#8217;s surname should feature in her surname.  It would be wrong to remove it as it is an integral part of her identity just as it would be wrong not to reflect the paternal side of the family in her surname.  In this day and age, I do not accept that it is embarrassing if she has a different surname from her Father.  Regrettably, that is now all too common.  I have come to the clear conclusion that she should have the double-barrelled surname with a hyphen.  I worry that it would be too easy to drop the Mother&#8217;s surname if the hyphen was not included.  After all, she does not use her other middle name in every day life.   </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I have already recognised the very mature and considered approach that the Mother has adopted in relation to M.  However, I have detected a hint that she still sees a time when she will be able to make an application to resume care of M and/or W.  I make it clear that she should not harbour such thoughts.  The order I am making is a final one not a temporary one.  Whilst circumstances can change, there would have to be an absolutely fundamental change for any application by the Mother to be successful.  She should be in no doubt as to that and as to the fact that I cannot envisage such circumstances as I sit here today.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have considered very carefully what is best for W.  I entirely acknowledge that Parliament has decreed that all cases should be dealt with in twenty-six weeks.  There is, however, an escape clause that enables the court exceptionally to extend the period.  If any case is suitable for doing so, it will be the difficult ones in the High Court.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">When the President considered this in April, he was clear that a late application by a relative to care for a child could be a good reason for doing so.  In general, it is not good enough for a relative to come forward so late that the twenty-six weeks cannot be complied with.  In this case, however, no criticism can be levelled at the H family given that they are still in the dark as to whether or not W is a relative of theirs.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I could make a final care order on the basis that any application for a placement order would have to come back before me.  I consider this is unsatisfactory.  If placement for adoption is rejected, there may still be a dispute as to whether or not it should be long term fostering or placement with a member of the H family.  Given that MH has been successful in his application in relation to M, it cannot be said that placement of W with another member of the family is so unlikely that it can be discounted now.  If there was a dispute, the only way forward would be for someone to apply to discharge the care order. The Mother might not wish to do so.  It is difficult to see what status MH has in relation to W.  The Guardian would no longer be a party.  It could give rise to all sorts of difficulties.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Reluctantly, I have therefore come to the conclusion that I must maintain control over W&#8217;s case.  He will remain subject to an interim care order.  I am, however, clear that the matter must be finalised within six months.  I intend to list the case now for final disposal.  I will order a DNA test immediately of MF.  If there is an issue as to his capacity to consent, I will deal with it as a Judge of the Court of Protection.  I will not tolerate any delays for the Official Solicitor to consider the matter.  Any such application must be dealt with to conclusion within three weeks.  </p>

I have concluded M&#8217;s case by making a final care order.  It is now for the Local Authority to decide on matters such as grandparental contact, not the Court.  I cannot see any distinction so far as W is concerned.    Ms Brandon indicated that, if that was my conclusion, she would wish to have permission to withdraw the application.  I am quite happy to accede to that course of action so the application will be withdrawn rather than dismissed.</p>
