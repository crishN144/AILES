The parents were Roma from the Slovak Republic. They required the assistance of interpreters in Slovak. The hearing had been listed in accordance with an order made by His Honour Judge Murdoch QC in the Canterbury County Court on 11 April 2014. So far as material for present purposes, his order provided that &#8220;HMCTS do provide 2 Slovak interpreters for the hearing on 7 May 2014.&#8221;</p>

Despite the order made by Judge Murdoch, and although HMCTS had, as was subsequently conceded by it, gone through the appropriate procedures with Capita Translation and Interpreting Limited (Capita) to book two interpreters, no interpreter was present at court. I had no choice but to adjourn the hearing. How could I do otherwise? It would have been unjust, indeed inhumane, to continue with the final hearing of applications as significant as those before me &#8211; this, after all, was their final opportunity to prevent the adoption of their children &#8211; if the parents were unable to understand what was being said. Anyone tempted to suggest that an adjournment was not necessary might care to consider what our reaction would be if an English parent before a foreign court in similar circumstances was not provided with an interpreter. </p>

I directed that HMCTS was to provide two interpreters for that hearing. I directed that Capita&#8217;s Relationship Director, Sonia Facchini, file a written statement (with statement of truth) explaining the circumstances in which and the reasons why no interpreters had been provided by Capita for the hearing on 7 May 2014. I gave Capita permission to apply to vary or discharge this order. It chose not to. I reserved the costs of the hearing on 7 May 2014 to the hearing on 15 May 2014 &#8220;for consideration of, inter alia, whether Capita should pay such costs.&#8221;&#8221;</p>

The matter proceeded on 15 May 2014, Capita having provided the required two interpreters. Capita was neither present nor represented. Both Mr Roger Hall, on behalf of the local authority, Kent County Council, and Mr Jeremy Hall, on behalf of the children, indicated that they sought orders that Capita pay them their costs of the abortive hearing on 7 May 2014. They had each filed written submissions, those from Kent County Council dated 14 May 2014, and those from the children&#8217;s solicitors dated 15 May 2014. Plainly I could not deal with those applications without giving Capita a proper opportunity to consider the case being made against it. I accordingly adjourned the applications, directing that &#8220;The costs of the hearings on 7 and 15 May 2014 are reserved for determination by the President of the Family Division on a date to be fixed.&#8221;</p>

The order further provided that Capita was to send to Kent County Council and the children&#8217;s solicitors by Friday 20 June 2014 any further evidence and any submissions or other materials relied on in response to the applications. I gave all parties permission to apply for further directions. In fact no further directions were sought by anyone. In due course (see below) Kent County Council and Capita filed various documents in accordance with that order. The children&#8217;s solicitors did not.</p>

Both arrived late for the hearing on 17 August 2012. One of the interpreters was Czech, not Slovak, and was said to be able to translate Slovak only &#8220;very slowly&#8221;. According to Mr Johnson, they were late because, due to an error by ALS, they had been sent to Canterbury. He says that both interpreters were on ALS&#8217;s Slovak list, both had undertaken previous Slovak assignments and that neither had previously been the subject of any complaint. In the reasons they gave at the end of the hearing, the Justices expressed themselves in justifiably strong terms:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;This is the third hearing of this case. The first hearing had to be adjourned due, in part, to the failure of ALS, the company through whom the courts now have to arrange interpreters, to provide interpreters to assist the parents.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">The timetabling of this matter was tight and arrangements were made for the hearing to commence at 9.30am today in order to allow more time to hear the case. Unfortunately this court has been let down again by ALS. Although two interpreters were booked they were sent to the wrong court house causing such a lengthy delay there was no time to hear the planned evidence. The only options open to the court today was to hear very limited evidence from only one or two witnesses, or hear only submissions. No party felt that either of these options was appropriate or conducive to a fair hearing for the parents, bearing in mind the issue today was one of removal of children from their parents&#8217; care.</p>

The order made by Judge Murdoch QC contained recitals noting that the previous hearing on 17 August 2012 had been frustrated, that the parents&#8217; counsel had only been able to take instructions on a limited basis using an interpreter provided by the children&#8217;s solicitor, and that the parents were declining to continue the agreement made at court on 17 August 2012.</p>

ALS was unable to find replacement interpreters in time. The order made by His Honour Judge Scarratt contained a recital that the parents&#8217; right to a fair trial of the local authority&#8217;s application for the removal of the children into foster care required the matter to be adjourned.</p>

Only at 2pm on the day before the hearing, 6 May 2014, was the court informed by Capita that no interpreters were available for the hearing. This was done by an automatically generated email which included the words &#8220;We apologise for any inconvenience caused&#8221; &#8211; a banal and formulaic statement hardly reflecting the fact that a failure to provide interpreters, particular in a case such as this, causes much more than &#8220;inconvenience&#8221; to all concerned, not least to the anxious parents. The timing of the sending of this email was, I am told, in accordance with an agreed protocol. That may be, but, for reasons which will become apparent, it does not seem to me to affect Capita&#8217;s liability, nor does the fact, as I was told, that court staff have access, by way of a web portal, to the current status of any booking at all times after the booking has been made.   </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;For immediate purposes there are three points demanding notice. The first is that, according to Ms Facchini, the contractual arrangements between Capita and the interpreters it provides do not give Capita the ability to require that any particular interpreter accepts any particular assignment, or even to honour any engagement which the interpreter has accepted. The consequence, apparently, was that in this case the two interpreters who had accepted the assignment (one on 14 and the other on 17 April 2014) later cancelled (on 5 and 1 May 2014 respectively). The second is that it is only at 2pm on the day before the hearing that Capita notifies the court that there is no interpreter assigned. The third is the revelation that on 7 May 2014 Capita had only 29 suitably qualified Slovak language interpreters on its books (only 13 within a 100 miles radius of the Royal Courts of Justice) whereas it was requested to provide 39 such interpreters for court hearings that day.&#8221;</p>

[Capita] has no exclusive call on their services.

This means that [Capita] has to fill booking requests to pay its staff and meet its running costs.

In Q2 2012, Capita&#8217;s overall &#8216;success rate&#8217; in providing interpreters requested by courts and tribunals was 92.4%. After a dip, coinciding with Capita&#8217;s reduction in the mileage rate paid to interpreters, the overall success rate had climbed again to 93.4% in Q4 2013. For civil and family cases the success rate in 2013 was lower, at 89.8%. What is striking, however, is the markedly lower success rate in relation to the provision of Slovak interpreters, only 77.7% in 2013, which was &#8220;reflected in the complaint rate which is amongst the highest of all language requests.&#8221; Indeed, &#8220;Of the 10 languages with most complaints in 2013, the language with the highest complaint rate was Slovak (8.7%). The majority of Slovak complaints came from tribunals where there was a 23.6 complaint rate.&#8221; In relation to the overall complaint rate, &#8220;In 2013, most complaints were in the South East (2,400) &#8211; 35.8% of all complaints reported.

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;We have reached that conclusion in the light of the following: (i) Courts have to alter times not to suit judges but to suit advocates and witnesses in cases to ensure that trials which are in progress proceed on time &#8230; In such a case it is essential that the strict obligations under the agreement are complied with by the company. (ii) The Crown Prosecution Service and, on many occasions, those instructed on behalf of the defence are paid out of the public purse. If a case cannot proceed then this has an effect on funds available to the CPS and to the Legal Services Commission who fund much of the defence work. The CPS lawyer and the defence lawyer will have lost the time that they could otherwise have spent. The loss to the public purse is real. (iii) Having efficient systems and good and reliable interpreters is expensive. A contractor cannot be allowed to maximise its profit or reduce its loss in the context of court proceedings by not having in place the best systems and the best interpreters. It cannot transfer its costs of failing to do so to the CPS or the defence. (iv) As the company is providing an integral part of the state&#8217;s obligations, then it must discharge that obligation for the reasons we have set out. (v) Taking, therefore, this wider public interest into account, a court is entitled to view successive non-attendance of an individual interpreter or successive failures in systems as amounting to serious misconduct, thus rendering the company liable for the costs thereby incurred to the CPS and the defence.&#8221;</p>

Plainly in the ordinary run of cases where the party is pursuing or defending the claim for his own benefit through solicitors acting as such there is not usually any justification for making someone else pay the costs. But there will be cases where either or both these two features are absent. In such cases it will be a matter for judgment and the exercise by the judge of his discretion to decide whether the circumstances relied on are such as to make it just to order some non-party to pay the costs. Thus, as it seems to me, the exceptional case is one to be recognised by comparison with the ordinary run of cases not defined in advance by reference to any further characteristic.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, neither of these arguments, whatever their factual merits &#8211; which I am in no position to evaluate &#8211; really bears upon anything I have to decide. It is for Capita to decide what arrangements it chooses to make to enable it to perform its agreement with the Secretary of State. That is a matter for Capita, and how it decides to operate does not, in my judgment, affect anything I have to decide. Consistently with the analysis in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case, the key question at the outset is simply whether or not Capita has fulfilled its obligations under the agreement. If it has, then that is that. If it has not then, subject only to force majeure, that is likewise that. Its pursuit of the largest profit it can make out of its agreement with the Secretary of State is of itself no basis for making Capita liable in costs for failure (if there is failure) to perform its contractual obligation. Liability is to be determined in accordance with the principles as I have set them out. Nor, on the other hand, is Capita to be exonerated from a liability in costs which would otherwise attach to it merely because of the nature of the arrangements it has put in place with its contractors. The only relevance of any of this is the point, with which I respectfully agree, made by Sir John Thomas P in para 41(iii) of the judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case, set out in paragraph 32 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other matter is this. There was a certain amount of discussion before me as to whether Capita&#8217;s obligation to provide an interpreter is dependent upon it having been given reasonable notice and, if it is, as to what amounts to reasonable notice. The point does not in fact arise for decision because on any basis Capita was given more than adequate notice of the need for interpreters at the hearing on 7 May 2014. I propose to say only this. It is clear from the analysis in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case that Capita is required to provide interpreters not merely 24 hours a day but also at what may be very short notice. Notice will in the nature of things often be a matter of hours at most rather than days. But there may come a point at which, given the circumstances of the particular assignment, the notice given is so short as to be meaningless. Suppose, for example, that at 10.00am the court at Llangefni (on the Isle of Anglesey) were to inform Capita that it needs an interpreter in Slovak for a hearing starting at 10.30. Would Capita be in breach of its obligations? This is a matter to be decided another day when the point arises. But without, I emphasise, deciding the point one way or the other, I have, as indicated (see paragraph 39 above), given Capita the benefit of the doubt in relation to the 37 minutes&#8217; notice it was given of the hearing on 9 August 2012.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Turner seeks to avoid the conclusions at which Mr Howard would have me arrive. In the first place he submits that, as a matter of principle, Capita is not liable to an adverse costs order. The argument has two major limbs.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_48">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, he submits that any failure by Capita to provide interpreters is a matter to be dealt with, for what he calls policy and practical reasons, as a matter of contract between Capita and the Secretary of State, and not by the court. Otherwise there is, he suggests, a risk, if not a certainty, that the court will be interfering improperly in contractual arrangements entered into by the State, without having the ability or information to take proper account of potential political, economic or commercial factors. For example, he says, a perceived failing on the part of the contractor may be a consequence of the bargain that the State has made, for good commercial reasons, and the contractor should not be exposed to greater or additional penalties than are provided for expressly under the relevant contractual arrangements. In a commercial arrangement such as this there should, he says, be no obligations over and above those which exist under the contract. Otherwise, he submits, one arm of what he calls the State justice system will be able, in effect, to supplement unilaterally the contractual arrangements that have been carefully negotiated with another arm of the State justice system and, moreover, to do that without the ability to take proper account of all relevant economic and commercial actors that exist on both sides of the contract. The appropriate way to deal with perceived problems in the operation of the agreement between Capita and the Secretary of State is, he says, by ongoing monitoring and review, including by Parliament. In support of this submission he drew attention to, and placed much reliance on, the provision in the agreement for set-off in relation to &#8216;service credits&#8217; which was referred to in para 27 of the judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The short answer to this, in my judgment, is provided by the decision in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case from which, despite his endeavours, Mr Turner cannot escape. Without further elaborating what I have just said, I draw attention to the fact that in para 30 of the judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case, Sir John Thomas specifically addressed the question of the financial adjustment and, as we have seen, said in terms that it was &#8220;simply an adjustment of moneys due [and] did not in any way affect the obligation to provide interpreters on each occasion.&#8221; To this I should add two observations. The fundamental task on which the court was embarked in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case was to identify what the relevant agreement meant as a matter of construction and, in the light of that, to determine whether there had been a breach of contract. That is, quintessentially a function of the court, so Mr Turner&#8217;s reference to political, economic or commercial factors takes him no further than it would in any breach of contract case. Moreover, and to address head on another of Mr Turner&#8217;s concerns, there is, as I have already made clear, no question of the court exercising the jurisdiction being invoked by Mr Howard unless it is first established that there has been a breach of contract by Capita. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, Mr Turner submits that jurisdiction to make an adverse costs order against a non-party is, on the authorities, confined to three classes of case: (a) cases where the non-party has &#8216;maintained&#8217; the cause of one of the parties by funding that cause; (b) cases where the non-party has a direct interest in the subject or object of the litigation; and (c) cases where the non-party is a lawyer to one of the parties who has improperly, unreasonably or negligently caused costs to be wasted. Linked with this, is the submission that in any event the jurisdiction in a case such as this can be exercised only if there has been, to use the terminology of the wasted costs jurisdiction, improper, unreasonable or negligent conduct. In the course of his oral submissions, Mr Turner extended his analysis to include within the jurisdiction to make an adverse costs order cases where, as he formulated it, there is a <span style="font-style:italic">direct </span>obligation to the court <span style="font-style:italic">under legislation </span>(including subordinate legislation). Examples would include, he submitted, a local authority directed by the court to produce a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref> report and, because of the provisions of the relevant rules of court, an expert witness.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Up to a point I can accept Mr Turner&#8217;s taxonomy &#8211; it is accurate <span style="font-style:italic">so far as it goes</span>. But there is nothing in any of the authorities to which Mr Turner directed my attention to suggest that his taxonomy is exhaustive and, in my judgment, it plainly is not. Consider, for example, the decisions in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly v South Manchester Health Authority</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] 1 WLR 244" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] 1 WLR 244</ref>, which cannot sensibly be fitted into even his extended taxonomy, and in <span style="font-style:italic">Phillips v Symes (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2004/2330" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2330 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2330 (Ch)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 WLR 2043" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 WLR 2043</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">X Local Authority v Trimega Laboratories </span>[2013] EWCC 6 (Fam), <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 2 FLR 232" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 2 FLR 232</ref>, where the basis of liability is not that identified by Mr Turner. The short answer to Mr Turner&#8217;s primary submission is provided by the decision in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case, which is directly in point, and to his subsidiary submission by the decisions in the <span style="font-style:italic">Globe </span>case and in <span style="font-style:italic">B v B</span>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Mr Turner submits that, even if he is wrong on everything else, the failure to provide interpreters on 7 May 2014 does not, in the particular circumstances, justify the order being sought by Mr Howard. As to that I can only repeat what I have already said and observe that, try as he might, Mr Turner was unable to gainsay any of the points set out in paragraph 39 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It follows, for the reasons I have given that it is just for Capita to be ordered to pay the costs incurred by the local authority in relation to the hearing on 7 May 2014, excluding, of course, those costs which would have had to be incurred in any event for the hearing which eventually took place on 15 May 2014. The local authority has prepared a schedule of those costs, showing, as revised, that they amount in all (inclusive of disbursements and the costs of the adoptive parents, who were being funded by the local authority) to &#163;4,207.46, inclusive of VAT. The details have been set out in the schedule, appear to me to be reasonable and, except as to whether VAT should be included, have not been subjected to any criticism, either as to principle or quantum, by Mr Turner. </p>

Those costs, detailed in the same schedule, and represented in large part by Mr Howard&#8217;s fees amount in all to &#163;11,719.90, inclusive of VAT. Again, these costs seem reasonable and, subject only to his point in relation to VAT, are not challenged by Mr Turner.</p>

The costs payable by Capita to the local authority therefore amount to &#163;15,927.36, inclusive of VAT, and &#163;13,338.15 exclusive of VAT. There will accordingly be an order that Capita pay the local authority within seven days the sum of &#163;13,338.15 in respect of the costs of the hearings on 7 May 2014 and 14 November 2014.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority seeks in addition the sum of &#163;1,102.50, exclusive of VAT, incurred by it since I sent the judgment to the parties in draft. These costs are the fees of Mr Howard (i) considering and advising on the draft judgment, (ii) drafting a response to Mr Turner&#8217;s observations on the draft judgment, including in relation to the VAT issue, and (iii) settling submissions in response to Mr Turner&#8217;s application for permission to appeal (see below). Mr Turner&#8217;s response is that Capita should not be required to pay any of these fees. I agree. None of these, in my experience, is normally treated as giving rise to additional costs. This was not, I should make clear, a case where the parties were directed by the court to file lengthy post-judgment submissions. In the usual way they were invited to file <span style="font-style:italic">brief </span>submissions on any matters arising from the draft judgment, which they did. As to the fees claimed under head (i) I fail to see any basis on which the losing party should have to pay costs which, as I understand it, were incurred in giving advice on the judgment and, moreover, for work done <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>Mr Turner&#8217;s observations on the judgment were to hand. In relation to items (ii) and (iii), if it is appropriate to think in such terms, and I doubt that it is, it is to be noted, as Mr Turner points out, that although the local authority &#8216;won&#8217; on the question of permission to appeal (see below) it &#8216;lost&#8217; on the question of whether VAT was payable. I decline to order Capita to pay any of these further costs. And, in order to avoid what might otherwise become an argument on costs without end, I make it clear that I do not propose to entertain any further argument (not that any has been forthcoming) as to what would be the further costs of the costs of the costs. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Turner seeks permission to appeal. His primary argument, in effect a reprise of the submissions which I have rejected, is that there is a real prospect of success within the meaning of CPR 52.3(6)(a). Mr Howard begs to differ, submitting that my decision is securely founded on and an entirely proper application of the principles in the <span style="font-style:italic">ALS </span>case and the <span style="font-style:italic">Globe </span>case. I agree with Mr Howard and refuse permission on this ground. Mr Turner submits in the alternative that the case falls within CPR 52.3(6)(b).
