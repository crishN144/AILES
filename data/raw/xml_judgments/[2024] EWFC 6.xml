They own a large house in London where the wife still lives; they own a sizeable apartment in city Y which the wife occasionally still visits but otherwise it stands vacant.  Since the breakdown of the marriage, the husband has travelled extensively for business; in 2020, he gave the address of the parties&#8217; city Y apartment as his &#8220;permanent residence in city Y&#8221;, and maintained at that time that he was &#8220;based in a hotel in the UK for now&#8221;.  For the calendar year 2023, I was shown a spreadsheet which revealed that he spent approximately 90 days in England and a broadly equivalent number of days in another foreign country (&#8216;country Z&#8217;); he spent a little over 50 days in city Y and the rest of the year visiting about a dozen other countries. When in England he now stays in a rented part-furnished apartment in London (the second such apartment which he has rented in the last year); when in city Y he stays in a rented flat (not, contrary to his witness statement filed in support of this application, in the flat which the parties own), and when in country Z I am told that he principally stays in hotels.  Among other investments, the husband also has an interest in a property in another foreign country (&#8216;country A').  This background narrative is relevant to my ruling on the husband&#8217;s &#8216;residence&#8217; (see </span>&#167;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">48 below).</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Glaser disputes that the contempt in this case is deliberate in the sense that it is &#8216;defiant&#8217; or &#8216;wilful&#8217;.  He points to the fact that the husband sought to negotiate informally with the wife in 2022 and early 2023 in order to defer the payments given the stated downturn in his fortunes, before making the application for a stay and variation.  He points to the fact that the wife has relative financial buoyancy at present; he argues vigorously that this is not a &#8220;last resort&#8221; case.</p>

She emphasises that the wife is not seeking the payment to her of the interest at this stage. She seeks only the preservation of that sum pending the outcome of the husband&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Barder </span>application.  The wife does not relish the prospect of having to seek to enforce payment of the interest in the event that the 2021 order remains intact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, on the facts I am satisfied that the husband is in contempt, in the sense that he has not honoured two of the lump sum orders; I further find that the contempt is continuing, albeit by the order which I shall make now, the wife will not be pursuing enfor<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">cement of the payment of the outstanding lump sums.  I am not satisfied that there is a clear impediment to justice, as things currently stand, by this contempt, nor am I satisfied that it is proportionate to the &#8216;problem&#8217; to make such an order given what I know of the relative financial positions of the parties.  I accept that the husband sought to engage the wife directly and later her solicitors in the spring of 2022 and into 2023 in relation to the current difficulties; he has also continued to pay the wife&#8217;s maintenance without missing a payment. His defaults on the lump sum payments have ostensibly been explained, and he has himself sought to bring his non-payment to the court.  At the hearing in July 2024, I will need to undertake a proper investigation of the husband&#8217;s </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Barder</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> claim, and insofar as the supervening event was not foreseen, the apparent impact which the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Barder </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">event has had on his financial portfolio.  I am not convinced that it is right to restrict the husband&#8217;s access to court by requiring him as a condition of pursuit of his claim, to place c.&#163;750,000 into the frozen account. There is a risk, it seems to me, that such an order may lead ultimately to injustice.&#160;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I mentioned above (see &#167;9), during the marriage and since the breakdown of the marriage, the husband <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">has travelled extensively for work.  During the marriage he was largely based in city Y; at no time in the earlier proceedings did he assert that he was habitually resident in England.  I am led to understand that he does not pay tax here.  In the last calendar year, he spent about one-quarter of the year in this country, and for the remainder of the year he was abroad.   There is very little evidence which supports the contention that the husband is &#8216;resident&#8217; here &#8216;permanently&#8217;, nor that he treats London as his &#8216;settled&#8217; or &#8216;usual&#8217; place of abode; he has specific reasons to be here (seeing his children and doing business) and the impermanent nature of his accommodation (part-furnished short let) suggests a somewhat transient presence.  In his written evidence in support of his applications and in response to those of his wife he has not asserted, either strongly or at all, that London is his usual or permanent home.  While in 2023 he spent a marginally greater number of nights in this country than in any other single country, this does not of itself translate into a finding that he was &#8216;resident&#8217; here.  All of the husband&#8217;s assets are held off-shore.  For the purposes of considering this application, it is not necessary for me </span>to declare where precisely the husband <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> resident; it is sufficient for me to conclude, as I do, that it is not in this country, and that he is therefore &#8216;<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">resident out of the jurisdiction&#8217;.

It seems to me that there is a &#8216;real risk&#8217; that the wife will not be in a position to enforce any order for costs against the husband should she be successful in claiming the same, and/or that the route to enforcement would be crowded with obstacles.</p>

Mr Glaser emphasised the lack of liquidity of the husband&#8217;s assets.  I was presented with some very crude descriptions and calculations of the husband&#8217;s assets, his personal expenditure, and other outgoings.  The figures were in many instances rounded off to a significant extent; there was some challenge to the items in the asset schedules, and the valuations, but I am not in a position to resolve the disputes. There are enormous mortgages on the city Y and London properties which need to be serviced over the next five months (at least); these properties need to be maintained for the benefit of both parties.  The husband must of course fund his own legal expenses.  Mr Glaser urges me not to condemn him to a point where he &#8220;only has US$500,000 to his name&#8221; between now and the final hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband nonetheless claims not insignificant sums on his own personal expenditure (US$600,000 per annum); he rents an expensive apartment in city Y for his own use, notwithstanding that he owns (and services a sizeable mortgage on) a property there which stands vacant for extensive periods in the year, which suggests a somewhat bounteous approach to his personal expenditure.  He rents at not inconsiderable expense an apartment in London, while choosing to stay in hotels in country Z.  On his own case he currently has access to approximately US$2.2m in liquid capital.</p>

I note that the husband&#8217;s costs to date are c.&#163;330,000. Making an adjustment for litigation uncertainties, and potential reduction on detailed assessment, I find that the husband should provide the sum in this regard of &#163;480,000, reflecting overall a deduction of approximately 25%.  I shall require the sum of &#163;300,000 to be added to the frozen account into which the US$6m is shortly to be paid within 14 days of the date of this order (or within 7 days of the creation of the account if later);  the balance of &#163;180,000 shall be paid by 28 March 2024.  </p>

Currently, five court days are set aside for the hearing of the husband&#8217;s application; the parties will almost certainly need to give (at least short) oral evidence, as will &#8211; in all probability &#8211; some or all of the four experts whose reports are already before the court.  Given the need for judicial reading time, and judgment writing time, I do not believe that there will be sufficient time within the five days also to consider in appropriate detail the husband&#8217;s application for variation of the periodical payments.  Furthermore, and in any event, it seems to me that there would be a value for the parties and the court in knowing the capital position (post the <span style="font-style:italic">Barder</span> hearing) <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> moving to the question of possible variation of the periodical payments; the husband&#8217;s ability to pay maintenance, and the wife&#8217;s ability to meet her own outgoings, will inevitably depend upon the capital resources available to them.</p>

The size (and indeed, from counsel&#8217;s descriptions, the content) of these appendices will be indigestible to the court in such a short hearing.
