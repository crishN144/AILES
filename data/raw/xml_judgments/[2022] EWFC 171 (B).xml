Their parents are Mr K and Mrs K.  They were married, so they share parental responsibility for the children.  They separated on 19 August 2017.  There were divorce and financial remedy proceedings in 2017 and 2018 and then these Children Act proceedings began in 2019.

Following the parents&#8217; separation, the children initially remained in the family home with their mother and had staying contact with their father.  In early 2018, A refused to go to contact.  The twins continued to have staying contact.</span></p>

He asked the court to order the children&#8217;s mother to cease her campaign of parental alienation and to order restorative solutions to remedy the severe effects of the parental alienation so that his relationship with his children could be healthier and more normal.  He wanted the children to spend every other weekend and half the holidays with him and for there to be flexibility taking into account work commitments. </span></p>

He said that he had threatened to take her to court and then she made life even more difficult.  That is not correct.  He said that mother is, again, preventing consistent access to the children and has again, suddenly without cause or explanation, &#8220;dictated that I cannot have our twins overnight again.&#8221;  I now know that an explanation was given.  He failed to mention in his application the events of the previous weekend in relation to C.  Up to then, the twins had been staying regularly with their father.</span></p>

He said mother regularly raised financial issues with the children and then he spoke to them about it.  He said that an urgent hearing within forty-eight hours was required and he claimed a MIAM exemption.</span></p>

Then the case was reallocated to District Judge Capon (as he then was) and the FHDRA took place on 26 February 2020.  The safeguarding letter from Cafcass contained serious allegations made by mother.  Domestic abuse was raised as an issue and directions were given for a fact-finding hearing, for there to be a list of allegations, responses, and statements.  Police disclosure was ordered.  It was agreed that indirect contact would take place three times a week.  The parents agreed that the children would not be exposed to adult issues between the parties, that they would not post on social media or internet sites any reference to these child arrangement proceedings and that, save for an emergency, the form of communication between themselves should be written communication and WhatsApp messages.  &#160;B and C were to spend time with their father on alternate weekends, either on Sunday between 10.00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. with an agreed third-party adult present, or on Saturday at a contact centre.</span></p>

He gave directions for further witness statements and for the father, who was in person, to send to the court his questions for cross-examination.  At the fact-finding hearing on 24 and 25 August, Judge Capon made a number of findings against the father and he directed Cafcass to prepare a s.7 report.  Father appealed to the Circuit Judge who dismissed the appeal on 9 April 2021.  Father appealed to the Court of Appeal.</span></p>

He had not seen the children since 25 March.  At a final hearing on 28 October and 25 November, Judge Capon found that mother had a reasonable excuse for breaching the previous court order for contact.  He considered the evidence of the parents and the Cafcass officer and he made an order for the children to live with their mother and to have monthly indirect contact with their father.</span></p>

I have also considered the President&#8217;s guidance on fact-finding hearings of domestic abuse in private law proceedings dated 5 May 2022.  The Court of Appeal set aside the fact-finding judgment and remitted the matter for a Circuit Judge to decide whether a fresh fact-finding was required.  The then designated Family Judge appointed a guardian pursuant to r.16.4, directed the parents to attend a Separated Parents Information Programme, which they have both done, gave further case management directions, and listed the case before me. </span></p>

Having considered Practice Direction 12J and the submissions made to me, I limited the issues for determination at the rehearing.  The mother applied for permission to appeal my decision.  She was refused permission to appeal by Sir Jonathan Cohen on 12 August.  On 2 December, I gave further directions and settled the ground rules for this hearing.  Father has provided his questions in writing.  I explained the procedure to him.  As these proceedings pre-date the Domestic Abuse Act, I have dealt with cross-examination and counsel for the guardian followed up on matters which he felt should be explored to assist the court and the family.  I also allowed father to provide further questions in cross-examination.  For the sake of completeness, I should add that the Supreme Court refused the mother&#8217;s application to appeal from the Court of Appeal.</span></p>

The children had regular unsupervised staying contact with their father from August 2017 when the parents separated until early 2018, in the case of A, and until December 2019 in the case of the twins.  The difficulties within the parents&#8217; relationship prior to their separation would not assist the court in deciding what contact is in the children&#8217;s best interests now.  The issues are whether father inappropriately chastised the children; whether he exercised coercive and controlling behaviour to the mother in and surrounding contact; whether he displayed emotionally dysregulated behaviour in the presence of or towards the children; whether he abused or intimidated the children; and/or whether mother has alienated the children from their father.</span></p>

I have regard to all of the evidence in the context of all of the other evidence.  I have to survey a wide canvas.  I have evidence from a number of sources.  Some of it is hearsay and I take that into account.  The parents&#8217; evidence is of the upmost importance.  It is essential that the court forms a clear assessment of their credibility and reliability.  Each parent considers that the other parent is not telling the truth about some of the events.  I bear in mind that witnesses can lie for many reasons but also that their recollections of events may vary.

I am aware that the definition has varied over time and that not all professionals in this field would use the term &#8220;alienation&#8221;.  Cafcass helpfully reminds me that &#8220;alienating behaviours present themselves on a spectrum with varying impact on individual children which requires a nuanced and holistic assessment&#8221;.  They use the term &#8220;alienating behaviours&#8221; to &#8220;describe circumstances where there is an ongoing pattern of negative attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours of one parent or carer that have the potential or expressed intent to undermine or restrict the child&#8217;s relationship with the other parent.  It is one of a number of reasons why a child may reject or resist spending time with one parent post-separation.&#8221;  Cafcass considers the child&#8217;s unique experiences and they look at the whole picture.  In this case, I have looked at all of the evidence and considered the whole picture.</span></p>

He described an occasion in early 2020 when father was angry because B did not want to go to Portsmouth and he shouted at mother that there was a court order and then he forcefully put B into the car.  In cross-examination, grandfather said he had seen that.

Father made great criticisms of grandfather for not remembering dates which was unfortunate in the circumstances.  On her own evidence, paternal grandmother has not shielded the children from the difficulties between the adults.  She made it plain that she dislikes gated communities.  She said that, &#8220;One time, when we were taking the children back to their mother, B told us that he knew the code but was not allowed to tell us so [we] would not be able to get in.&#8221;  She thought this was a burden for the children.  My view is that she could have reassured B that it did not matter or even praise him for being good in not giving out the code.

She then made an issue of the fact that mother pointed out a caf&#233; across the road.  Having seen the photographs, that caf&#233; may even have been nearer, although that is not the point.  Separated parents often make arrangements for handovers at a gate, the end of the road or at a service station with CCTV, for example.  If the parents handle it in a child sensitive way, it is not an issue.  Grandmother has her own views about gated communities.  She should not push them on to the children.  Towards the end of her evidence, grandmother was more reflective and accepted that it was her perception about the gates.  However, father and paternal grandmother made an issue of the gate in front of the children and then father said that having to collect the children from the gate created fear.  He engineered a problem and then he tried to blame mother for it.  That is not the only time he created a problem over the gate.</span></p>

Grandmother&#8217;s allegations about hostility at contact were not very specific.  She gave the impression that words were had on all sides but she blamed mother and grandfather for it.  She suggested that grandfather had referred to the children as his children, which I find unlikely.

When counsel for the guardian asked about the occasion of the car boot sale pick up when she suggested A was held by her grandfather, she backtracked and did not say that A was prevented from going forwards.  I do not think A was being prevented.  I think grandmother was trying to support her son but the reality is she was not able to support his case when it came down to details rather than generalities.  Regrettably, she saw nothing wrong in their failure to tell mother about the incident where C had blood in her urine. Father is very critical of the mother for not providing him with information about the children yet his failure on that occasion led to C being distressed and the breakdown in contact; father did not mention that on his C100.  The children stayed with him for the weekend at the start of December 2019.  C went to the toilet and there was some blood in her urine.  She expected her father to tell her mother.  She was upset because her mother did not know what had happened.   Father said he was going to tell the mother once he got back to Portsmouth.  He said he did not want to talk about it in front of the children.  I pause there to say that he now says C did not want him to.  C told her mother who spoke to the GP and then the local authority became involved.  That led to mother saying contact would be visiting contact and father made his application to the court.  In my judgment, father or grandmother had several hours in which they could have messaged mother and they chose not to.  </span></p>

Even now, A does not lock the door when she goes into the bathroom.  Of her recollection that father was rough with the children on occasions, she accepted that we all parent in different ways.  She accepted that there was one occasion when A had overheard them disparaging father.  She regretted it, as did mother.  I found her measured, willing to see other points of view, and accept where mistakes had been made.  I do not think she was exaggerating.  Father thinks a lot has been made of a few incidents but grandmother rightly said that what happens to children can be cumulative.  He makes a lot of one mistake by mother but thinks that his cumulative mistakes should be ignored.</span></p>

For example, &#8220;he planned structured activities, stimulation, provided appropriate levels of supervision, enforced appropriate boundaries of behaviour, and resolved sibling rivalry and excitement.  He has been observed to demonstrate appropriate emotional warmth, share his times equally between the children, and provide an opportunity for the children to express themselves.

In the first assessment, one of the children said that mum&#8217;s new boyfriend (that is father in these proceedings) is mean to him.  Another child said he was a nice guy.  He said his mum had told him not to talk about what is going on at home at school.  He said that he would like his mum and [father] in this case to get along better.  When they argue, they shout a lot.  He explained that [father] tells his mother to shut up and his mum asks [father] to leave her alone and does not.  The children&#8217;s mother said that she and [father] have arguments but that was her issue.  Those comments had a very familiar ring to them.</span></p>

The child said his mum and [father] &#8220;were arguing last night and threw the PlayStation&#8221;.  The child said something about the police.  The teacher asked if he had told his teacher or another adult in school about this and she clearly heard the child say, &#8220;No.  They would be so angry.  I&#8217;m scared.&#8221;</span></p>

His mother seemed to be saying it was her fault.  [Father] said it was a once in a blue moon argument but the social worker noted that verbal conflict and arguments had arisen on a number of occasions previously.  Father in his oral evidence minimised those incidents and he deflected blame on to his current partner, or on to the mother in these proceedings and that is a pattern of his behaviour.  Mother in these proceedings said in one of her statements that she thought it was because of her that father shouted at the children, and in her oral evidence she said that the way the father&#8217;s current partner played things down was familiar because that is what she did too.  In my judgment, responsibility for the way he treats people lies with father.  Two partners and their children have all described similar experiences.</span></p>

Had he been patient, it could have all been sorted out.  For more than two years, staying contact had taken place.  It was usually on father&#8217;s terms.  In February 2019, mother had suggested they stay in Cambridge because of the weather.  Father refused.  The father suggests he could not keep the children entertained for a day in Cambridge, but he sometimes returned them even after just a few hours.  Grandfather had offered his flat for father to stay in with the children and he refused.  On more than one occasion, father decided to return the children home early and expected mother to leave work and be there.  He did that even from Portsmouth; that is evidenced in the messages.  It was his choice to cut down the time the children spent with him. Mother is right that the father was controlling and dictated when he would see the children. </span></p>

In fact, I know from their evidence that there was an order for maintenance pending suit of about &#163;3,800 a month.  Father only paid &#163;680 and mother did not stop the contact.  She was asked about the time just after the parents separated.  She said she had asked father not to see the children until they had worked out what they were going to say.  She suggested counselling.  He started seeing them three weeks or so after he left and she did not think it was as long as a month. </span></p>

In 2019, she said the children stayed for nine days with their dad in Portsmouth and they found it difficult.  She referred to the handovers when she was almost having to manhandle the children to the gate and father would grab them and put them in the car.  It was around that time that she said they had to step back and take the process slowly.  She thought if they went for the day and had a fantastic time, they could build it up again.  She did not stop contact.  I put to her father&#8217;s position that she was dictating all of the arrangements.  She said she did not feel like that.</span></p>

There were two occasions though when she was working and she could not just walk out of work and she was not in a position to turn down work.  He refused to keep them and, in the end, she had to cancel work and come home.  I have seen the messages.  Instead of having a good time with the children, father was bringing them back early to inconvenience the mother.  One time, the children were upset and worried because they had got back before her and they said daddy had said she could not be bothered and would not be there.</span></p>

He took the children to the home that he was sharing and then he sent A up to play with the children even though that was not what A wanted.  He said he felt it was time to introduce her.  The children were upset and he was putting pressure on A.  This is nothing to do with mother.  It was to do with what he wanted.  With 2020 hindsight, he accepted he could have done it a better way.  He said it is irrelevant now but it is not irrelevant for A.  He still maintains that mother is alienating the children from him and yet the rift with A was solely caused by his actions.  The children were pleased to see him when they first saw him.  They did not see anything wrong with their paternal grandfather being present.  They did not have a sense of fear but he created it.  None of that was down to their mother.  He forgets that A was an 8-year-old child and he thought her views should be disregarded.  He has spent years wrongly blaming mother.  He showed limited insight when he gave his evidence about how things could have been handled better but that insight did not last.</span></p>

Within a few weeks, the children were seeing their father and both parents agree the children were pleased to see him.

Father has parental responsibility and there were no restrictions placed on his exercise of it.  He should have been kept informed and consulted.

I would like the guardian to meet with the children and to assist the court on whether contact could be safely managed so that the children can have a relationship with their father through direct contact and not suffer further harm.

Father has been signposted to courses to help him gain insight and address his behaviour and I would urge him to take them.  I know the guardian will consider the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings but their emotional needs and their father&#8217;s ability to meet them and the risk of harm are also important in this case.  I would be grateful for assistance from the counsel on how much time the guardian needs.  In the interim, the indirect contact will continue.</span></p>
