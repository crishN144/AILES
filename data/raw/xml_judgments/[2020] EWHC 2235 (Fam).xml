On 15 December 2016, Haddon-Cave J ordered the Husband to pay the Wife &#163;453,576,512 by way of financial remedies consequent upon their divorce. The Husband has not voluntarily paid a penny of that award and, to date, enforcement has realised only about &#163;5 million. The litigation between the Wife and the Husband (alongside the other Respondents) is now concerned with the enforcement of the debt owed to the Wife by the Husband.

This is a without notice procedure in which the Wife was not involved: she has only seen copies of the redacted application and the redacted judgment because they have been exhibited in these proceedings.

Similarly, in his March 2018 judgment, Haddon-Cave J found, amongst other matters, that the transfer of the Yacht by Qubo 2 to Straight was undertaken with a real and substantial purpose, namely to place these assets beyond the reach of the Wife&#8217;s claim as part of a wider pattern of conduct by the Husband designed to put his assets out of the reach of the Wife. These transactions formed part of the Husband&#8217;s continuing &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">deliberate and dishonest campaign to avoid his liabilities</span>&#8221; pursuant to the judgment of 15 December 2016 [paragraph 79]. </p>

In this context, I observe that the Respondents have filed no evidence to support an alternative contention, namely that they received around US$1 billion of assets (the Artwork, the Yacht and the Monetary Assets) innocently and without notice of the Husband&#8217;s dishonest scheme.

That sworn declaration is wholly at odds with a file note of a meeting between a lawyer, Mr Kerman (representing the Husband), and Dr Schurti/Dr Blasy on 20 July 2016 which has recently emerged in the Liechtenstein criminal investigation. This file note records that both Dr Schurti and Dr Blasy had been told before any transfer of assets that the Wife had started divorce proceedings in England a few months after the Husband became a billionaire through the sale of Northgas. The Wife contends that competent professionals (who are also lawyers) would have appreciated that the Husband was seeking to put his assets beyond the Wife&#8217;s reach in the context of divorce proceedings and would not have taken nearly US$1 billion of assets without making proper inquiries about the claims being made to those assets in the divorce proceedings. The inference is that the Respondents knowingly participated in the Husband&#8217;s schemes. </p>

Professor Dr Zollner also lectures at the University of Liechtenstein on courses concerning corporate law, foundation law and trust law. With respect to Liechtenstein criminal law, the Wife relied on the evidence of Professor Dr Wolfgang Brandstetter. Since 1988 Professor Dr Branstetter has been a professor of criminal law and criminal procedure law at the University of Vienna. He practised as defence counsel in Austria before embarking on an academic career.

It was open to doubt whether section 121 protected the interests of anyone other than the trust, and whether anyone other than the beneficiaries and, potentially, the settlor had standing to initiate a prosecution. A secret was protected only if it served a legitimate interest. Dr Wenaweser agreed that the protection of secrets was relative to avoid the misuse of secrecy, and thus it was necessary for the trustees to weigh up and balance the interests in play. It was noteworthy that the category of cases in which disclosure might be justified was not closed, so section 121(5) could be construed broadly. Disclosure to third parties could be justified in extreme situations, for example, in relation to the rights of an unborn child. In cross-examination by Mr Willan, Dr Wenaweser accepted that disclosure to the Wife might be a legitimate private interest if the disclosure of secrets stemmed from a comprehensible and recognisable motive according to a law-abiding person. However, that had to be interpreted narrowly otherwise it would defeat the professional secrecy obligations altogether.  </p>

Dr Wenaweser drew my attention to the most recent version of the Vienna Commentary on Criminal Law (applicable in Liechtenstein) which stated that, where there were conflicting duties arising in two jurisdictions, the trustees must comply with domestic law. The threat of committal in another jurisdiction would not provide a defence to the unlawful disclosure of information in Liechtenstein.  </p>

That would, however, put them in a very difficult position because they would have to decide whether the disclosure of information in such proceedings would be a valid defence if a prosecution was brought against them. If a judgment were made against them in those proceedings, it would not be directly enforceable in Liechtenstein so they would have an opportunity to defend themselves in subsequent proceedings in Liechtenstein. I infer that his evidence was that trustees would not disclose information to defend proceedings abroad and thus expose themselves to a possible private prosecution when all they needed to do was file a disallowance claim against the enforcement of a foreign judgment in Liechtenstein. </p>

He agreed with Mr Willan that, if a director received a foreign judgment, what they had to do was to consider it and decide whether, as a prudent man of business, the sensible course was to fight the judgment and relitigate the issues (taking into account the prospects of success and the risks to which they would expose the establishment by not complying with the order), or whether to accept it and pay it. Given that the Liechtenstein legal system did not recognise and enforce foreign judgments, Dr Wenaweser noted that the prudent man of business would consider whether the outcome of the litigation in Liechtenstein would be the same if the matter was relitigated in that jurisdiction. If that were the conclusion, it would make no sense to force relitigation in Liechtenstein as this would incur unnecessary costs. The key issue was not whether the liability was enforceable in Liechtenstein but whether a prudent man of business would pay, this being the question of judgment for the directors. The business judgment rules undoubtedly applied to establishments according to Professor Dr Brandstetter. Although Professor Dr Zollner told me that this rule would not apply to a decision to transfer assets to the Wife because this was a matter of law rather than judgment, I prefer the evidence of Professor Dr Brandstetter and Dr Wenaweser on this issue given the former&#8217;s knowledge of the relevant criminal law and the latter&#8217;s experience as a practising lawyer in Liechtenstein. </p>

In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SAS v WPL</span> the court was concerned with whether an anti-suit injunction against SAS (an American company) should be continued. That injunction restrained SAS from taking steps to obtain orders from courts in the United States requiring WPL (a UK company) to assign debts owed to WPL from its customers either now or in the future and to turn over to a United States Marshal payments from customers which it had already received. Those orders would apply to debts owed from WPL customers anywhere in the world except the United Kingdom. The dispute between these two companies had a long history including an action brought by SAS against WPL in this country in which SAS&#8217;s claims were dismissed; a decision by WPL to submit to the jurisdiction of the court in North Carolina and to fight the action there on the merits; a judgment in favour of SAS from the North Carolina Court; an attempt by SAS to enforce the North Carolina judgment in this jurisdiction which failed; and a judgment from the English court in favour of WPL which SAS had chosen to ignore. The Court of Appeal decided that the widely drawn injunction prevented SAS from seeking an order for the assignment of debts due from WPL customers in the United States. These were debts situated in the United States and there was no good reason why the English court should seek to prevent SAS from enforcing the North Carolina judgment against United States assets of WPL. To do so would itself represent an exorbitant exercise of jurisdiction by the English court contrary to the principles of comity. However, the court granted a menu of injunctive and other relief with respect to debts due from WPL customers elsewhere and in this jurisdiction. Males LJ gave the leading judgment. </p>

She alleged that in December 2016 Cotor transferred monetary sums from an account at UBS in Switzerland to an account at LGT Bank in Liechtenstein and that, thereafter, transfers were made to five Lichtenstein trusts (Genus Trust, Arbaj Trust, Longlaster Trust, Ladybird Trust and Carnation Trust) of which Counselor and Sobaldo are trustees.

Those proceedings seek relief in respect of the transfers to Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 of the Artwork and, initially, the Yacht. Those proceedings cannot result in any relief being granted against Counselor or Sobaldo in respect of the Monetary Assets. </p>

Substantially, the same factual, legal, and evidential issues fell to be considered in both this court and the court in Liechtenstein. The Wife&#8217;s assertion of a civil claim against Counselor and Sobaldo in the Liechtenstein criminal proceedings was also relevant because, ultimately the Wife sought substantially the same relief both here and in Liechtenstein. There was plainly a risk of inconsistent findings and/or decisions in the two jurisdictions, that risk arising regardless of the identity of the parties in the two sets of proceedings.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">Further, it was inherently appropriate for the Liechtenstein court to determine the relevant issues as the dispute between the parties ultimately concerned assets in Liechtenstein held by Liechtenstein entities under Liechtenstein law. Counselor and Sobaldo had been advised that they would require a binding judgment from the Liechtenstein court before they would be permitted to transfer any assets to the Wife. Considerations of comity strongly favoured a stay because the court should not exercise its powers exorbitantly in respect of assets located abroad. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0in">The Wife submitted that the central pillar of Counselor and Sobaldo&#8217;s argument - that there were already parallel proceedings in Liechtenstein which sought the same or substantively the same relief and gave rise to a risk of inconsistent judgements - was misconceived. There were no such parallel proceedings as the English and the Liechtenstein proceedings sought different relief against different parties in respect of different transactions. The proceedings in Liechtenstein could not result in a judgment which awarded the Wife any of the relief which she sought in the present proceedings. Furthermore, English and Liechtenstein courts would be applying different laws and considering different grounds for granting relief. There was no useful purpose to be served in waiting for judgment from Liechtenstein. </p>

If anything, that factor weighed in favour of proceeding to judgment in England as soon as possible so that the Wife might start the process of enforcement, if that proved to be necessary. In any event, a judgment from this court would provide substantial and legitimate benefits to the Wife. </p>

First, it would be undesirable to hear the proceedings against Temur in November 2020, but then hear the closely related claims against Counselor and Sobaldo separately and at a later date. That was a recipe for inefficiency and inconsistent judgements. Second, the Wife would be exposed to substantial disadvantages if she were required to litigate in Liechtenstein, including the risk of having to relitigate whether she was entitled to financial remedies from the Husband. </p>

The possibility of inconsistent findings can also be a powerful reason in favour of a stay even where the defendant was not party to the foreign proceedings such as not to be bound by them (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Curtis v Lockheed Martin UK Holdings Ltd</span> [2008] 1 CLC 219 at [17]). The authorities indicate that it makes good commercial sense for the court to have regard, where appropriate, to the orderly resolution of the dispute as a whole, if necessary, by granting a temporary stay. Minimisation of the risk of inconsistent decisions and the avoidance of unnecessary duplication and expense is amply supported in the case law. </p>

That is also the basis of the Liechtenstein proceedings. The same alleged schemes of evasion are advanced in both sets of parallel proceedings. </p>

The Liechtenstein proceedings contain allegations about the transfer of the Monetary Assets into the Liechtenstein trusts. They also contain a claim in respect of the transfer of the Monetary Assets to Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 in late 2016. Mr Willan submitted that it was now known from recent inspection of files (I infer obtained via the Liechtenstein criminal investigation) that no Monetary Assets were transferred to Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 so that part of the Wife&#8217;s claim was effectively redundant. If that is correct, steps should be taken without delay to amend the Wife&#8217;s claim in the Liechtenstein proceedings. Though the transfers of assets to Qubo 1 and 2 feature heavily in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.423</ref> proceedings, I note that they are matters about which Haddon-Cave J has already given judgment.  </p>

The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.423</ref> proceedings seek to recover the Monetary Assets.

Thus, the Liechtenstein court might be able to determine whether the transfers of the Artwork and the Yacht to Qubo 1 and 2 were intended to defraud the Wife without making any factual determination about the transfer of the Monetary Assets. This court has already determined that the Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 transfers were intended to defeat the Wife&#8217;s claim so inconsistent findings by the Liechtenstein court about those matters will have no traction in this jurisdiction. Whilst the Liechtenstein court might make findings about the Monetary Assets even though that is apparently no longer a core issue in those proceedings, that would not, on its own, necessarily justify a stay of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.423</ref> claim.     </p>

The Wife&#8217;s claim is, however, made pursuant to two English statutory provisions because, on her case, the transfer of the Monetary Assets was intended to frustrate this court&#8217;s orders and to deny her the remedies to which she was entitled under English law. The fact that the assets are held in Liechtenstein does not mean that her claims are governed by Liechtenstein law. This court must first determine whether the Wife is entitled to the relief she seeks based on the facts and the applicable English law principles. If she is, the court must then exercise its discretion as to the relief which would then be appropriate in circumstances where the assets are located outside the jurisdiction. In this case, where this court has already found the Husband to have engaged in a dishonest scheme of evasion by moving assets abroad to defeat the Wife&#8217;s claim, a devolution of the responsibility for the primary determination of the Wife&#8217;s entitlement to a court in Liechtenstein, applying different legal principles, would run counter to the interests of justice.  </p>

It is crucial to note that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SAS v WPL</span> is not authority for the proposition that this court cannot determine liability against the respondent who has submitted to this court&#8217;s jurisdiction but whose assets are situated abroad. However, the enforcement of this court&#8217;s eventual orders arising from the determination of liability may be circumscribed in the manner described in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">SAS v WPL</span> if those assets are situated elsewhere and where recognition and enforcement is not available in Liechtenstein where the assets are situated. I do not accept that determination of the liability under English law of Counselor and Sobaldo to the Wife should be abandoned merely because an outcome in the Wife&#8217;s favour might present her with enforcement difficulties in this jurisdiction and elsewhere. In fact, I would expect &#8211; as comity requires and as anticipated in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Joujou v Masri</span> [see paragraph 67 above] &#8211; the court in Liechtenstein to have regard to this court&#8217;s view on the issues in this case in the hope that this perspective might assist the Liechtenstein court in its judgment of the matter. </p>

There was thus no practical sense in continuing with the English proceedings.

First, it would entitle the Wife to obtain a payment order against the Liechtenstein trusts in summary proceedings. Even though it seems virtually certain that Counselor and Sobaldo will file a disallowance claim, the Wife may take other steps to enforce her entitlement such as applying for injunctive relief by way of an antisuit injunction. A judgment of this court would also confer procedural advantages in Liechtenstein on the Wife in that she would not be required to make a deposit of CHF 1-3 million simply to commence proceedings there. In that regard, I note that, were I to accede to the submissions of Counselor and Sobaldo, the Wife would indeed be required to commence new proceedings in Liechtenstein. That would, in fact, create parallel proceedings as the Liechtenstein Qubo proceedings would, on any factual analysis, not determine the issue of the Wife&#8217;s entitlement to relief against Counselor and Sobaldo in respect of the Monetary Assets.  </p>

At trial it is inevitable that there will be an investigation of the passage of the Monetary Assets from UBS in Switzerland to Liechtenstein and it is unrealistic to suggest otherwise. There is also no good reason to stay the proceedings against Temur. In fact, a stay of these proceedings involving Counselor and Sobaldo would be a recipe for considerable procedural inefficiency in the management and adjudication of the Temur claim, giving rise to a real risk of inconsistent judgments.  </p>

The court knew or had reason to suppose that the assets were either in Liechtenstein or out of the jurisdiction. An application pursuant to r. 9.9A was not appropriate. The Applicants sought to invoke r.4.1(6) as they relied on evidence as to Liechtenstein law which was not before the court when it made the order. With respect to the March 2018 order, the provisions made pursuant to the IA could be varied pursuant to r. 4.1(6). However, the same submissions made with respect to the December 2016 order also applied to the March 2018 order. With respect to the August 2019 order, FPR r. 4.1(6) applied.  </p>

The orders made against them would require them to act in ways which would be contrary to Liechtenstein law and would expose them to a real risk of prosecution under the criminal law of Liechtenstein. The expert evidence of Dr Weneweser to that effect should be accepted. Further, considerations of comity favoured the proposed variations. They gave effect to the flexible approach that the court should adopt in relation to these orders. The orders could not be enforced in Liechtenstein against Liechtenstein entities and thus the court should not maintain orders which were otherwise futile. The Spruch from the Liechtenstein Court had made clear that no assets could be transferred to the Wife without a final and binding judgment of the Liechtenstein Court.  </p>

The court had jurisdiction to set them aside pursuant to r. 9.9A but that power could not be exercised in this case as none of the established grounds for reviewing a financial order were satisfied. However, the orders could not be set aside under the MCA alone. An order made pursuant to the IA could only be challenged by way of an appeal. If the court had any jurisdiction outside FPR r. 27.5 (application to set aside judgment or order following failure to attend), it should be exercised by analogy to r. 27.5 and should only be exercised in the most exceptional circumstances.

In doing so, the court would need to consider amongst other factors (a) its interest in making the order, (b) the extent of the risk in practice of a breach of foreign criminal law and of prosecution and (c) comity &#8211; including the strong expectation that a foreign criminal court will not seek to impede orders made here to unravel dishonest schemes directed at its process.

PD9A paragraph 13.5 makes clear that an application to set aside should only be made where no error of the court is alleged. If an error of the court is alleged, the correct route of challenge is an application for permission to appeal. PD30A paragraph 4.1B makes clear that an application to set aside pursuant to r. 9.9A would be appropriate where no error of the court was alleged on the materials that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">were before the court at the time the order was made</span>&#8221;.

Thus, careful reading of these recently inserted provisions demonstrates that there is no reference in PD30A or in PD9A to other rules which might provide a procedural route for the setting aside or variation of final matrimonial remedy orders. Thus, it is highly doubtful on the strict wording of the FPR that the use of r. 4.1(6) is appropriate to set aside a final matrimonial order since the coming into force of r. 9.9A and the insertion of paragraph 4.1B in PD 30A on 3 October 2016.   </p>

The position was much the same with respect to the March 2018 order. Paragraph 9 was made pursuant to s. 24(1) of the MCA and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 423</ref> and 425 of the IA.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">I find myself troubled by the nature of these two orders and the implications thereof for the correct procedural route to determine the application for set aside and variation. Absent any error of law being alleged, the correct route for a final financial remedy order is an application to set aside pursuant to r. 9.9A. That approach has the merit of simplicity as these orders were made within financial remedy proceedings consequent upon the breakdown of a marriage. However, a key component of both orders is the application of the IA, but the final orders made pursuant to that jurisdiction do not fall within the meaning of FPR r. 2.3(1). The particular circumstances of this case have resulted in these final, hybrid orders which, I do not envisage, will be the types of orders common in most financial remedy proceedings. I have decided that I should look first to the jurisdiction pursuant to r. 9.9A and then, only insofar as it is necessary to do so, apply the jurisdiction (if any) to set aside the orders made under the IA. That approach has the merit of logic given the nature of the proceedings in which the orders were made and I am also satisfied that it will be vanishingly unlikely that the application of either route will produce inconsistency of outcome in this case. That may not be the same in other cases.  </p>

It was formally served on 4 January 2017 and served again, through Liechtenstein judicial channels, on 14 June 2018. Qubo 1 took no steps to challenge the order in this jurisdiction. Instead, it took a deliberate stance that it would seek to prevent the order being relied upon in Liechtenstein, rather than engaging with the merits of the English proceedings. It only applied to set aside the judgment against it on 28 November 2019, nearly 3 years later. I do not accept the submission made by Mr Brodie QC that the Applicants only appreciated the need for variation when faced with the committal applications. His submission was unclear as to exactly when the Applicants realised the need for variation though I suspect it was a great deal earlier than at the hearing before Mr Justice Mostyn in November 2019.  Leaving aside the question as to the Applicants&#8217; knowledge of the final orders, they are entities with access to expert legal and financial advice. The suggestion that they did not apply for a variation of the English orders because they did not appreciate the need to do so until at the earliest May/June 2019 (when the Wife applied to commit Qubo 1 for breach of the December 2016 order) and at the latest November 2019 is wholly unpersuasive.  </p>

In fact, the existence of the final English orders has allowed the Wife to challenge the Applicants in the other jurisdictions to which the assets were transferred thereby incurring cost to them. If the Applicants were convinced the proceedings in this jurisdiction were, as Dr Schurti described, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">fake proceedings</span>&#8221;, it would have made commercial sense to have applied at the earliest opportunity in this jurisdiction for permission to appeal or to vary or set aside the orders causing the Applicants so much trouble in litigation elsewhere in the world.    </p>

In that regard, I wholly endorse the reasoning of Roberts J in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">US v SR</span> (see above) at paragraphs 48-52. The circumstances in which variation of an executory order will be permitted are constrained by the need to demonstrate a significant change in circumstances since the order was made, such that it would be inequitable to hold to the terms of the original order. This case is far removed from the circumstances in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">US v SR</span> where the terms of the original order were impossible to implement as originally envisaged because of the near collapse of the Russian property market.  Here it is wholly possible for the Applicants &#8211; or better, the Husband (for they are his alter egos) &#8211; to transfer the Yacht and the Artwork to the Wife.

Moreover FPR r. 27.5(3) must apply in the special circumstances where a party fails to attend a hearing. The provisions of that rule must be read conjunctively, that is, the Applicants must satisfy all the criteria in that rule. They &#8211; or more, correctly, the Husband - cannot as they/he failed to act promptly and had no good reason for not attending the hearings. Whether they had a reasonable prospect of success at the hearing is thus not a matter which I need consider as it cannot trump the other criteria in r. 27.5(3)(a) and (b).  </p>

Given that the first affidavit filed on behalf of the Applicants, supported by voluminous expert evidence, is dated 15 October 2019, I can safely infer that, at this stage, Counselor and Sobaldo had already instructed English lawyers to oppose the existing committal proceedings. However, despite being (a) notified of the freezing order promptly, (b) formally served with the freezing order on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>September 2019, and (c) provided with a copy of the draft judgment from the without notice hearing on 27 September 2019, Counselor and Sobaldo did not appear at the return date.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">By her application notice dated 15 November 2019, the Wife applied for disclosure from Counselor and Sobaldo in support of her claims under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/423" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 423</ref> IA and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.37</ref> MCA. Both entities are likely to hold documents relevant to the proceedings which relate to the establishment, assets and administration of the Liechtenstein trusts which received the Monetary Assets. Such documents are likely to show, for example, how and for what purpose the trusts were established; what control the Husband retains of the trust assets in practice; and who has received payments out of the trusts. The Wife seeks a direction for standard disclosure within the meaning of FPR PD21A para. 2.1 and will submit to a direction giving reciprocal standard disclosure. This will ensure that documents relevant to the proceedings are disclosed. The Wife also seeks an order for specific disclosure pursuant to FPR PD21A para. 2.4 requiring a reasonable search for the classes of document identified in paragraph 12(b) of the draft order accompanying her application. The categories of documents sought are, in broad terms, (a) trust accounts, bank statements, instructions and decisions for each of the trusts, (b) communications with the Husband, Temur, Mr Kerman and/or Mr Devlin from 2015 to date relating to the transfer of the Monetary Assets and the Husband&#8217;s use of the Liechtenstein trusts, and (c) documents showing what has become of the Monetary Assets. </p>

This court has a strong and legitimate interest in requiring the disclosure of documents to fairly determine the proceedings. Counselor and Sobaldo should not be permitted to participate in the proceedings and deny the claims against them while simultaneously refusing both the court and the Wife access to the information and documents in their possession which would be necessary to test those denials. The Wife contrasted their position with that taken by Straight in the Marshall Islands proceedings. There, Dr Schurti put forward a witness statement in which he gave considerable evidence about the Simul and Navy Blue Trusts; how they came to be established; and their dealings with assets. The Wife submitted there was a strong impression that the trustees were picking and choosing when it suited them to reveal information and when it suited them to rely on professional secrecy to hide the truth. This should not be permitted. </p>

The Wife submitted that the risk of a prosecution or conviction for violation of professional secrecy was very low. In fact, in this context, the risk was even lower because Counselor and Sobaldo also had a legitimate private interest in being able to defend these proceedings so as to avoid the trusts being made subject to what they contend would be an unjustified liability; and they could not realistically defend the proceedings without giving disclosure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Wife rejected the submission that directions for disclosure had become unnecessary in these proceedings because she would be able to obtain the relevant information from the criminal file. That was a misconceived submission because, if the Wife already knew the information from inspecting the criminal file, then the trustees could comply with their disclosure obligations without committing any offence under Liechtenstein law because a person does not &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">reveal</span>&#8221; a secret by telling the other person something which they already know. Accordingly, if the trustees were correct that the Wife could find all the information which they had been ordered to provide in the criminal file, there was no basis for not ordering disclosure because the trustees could comply with it. In addition, the Wife submitted that it was doubtful she would be able to obtain all the necessary information from the criminal files. Whilst the review of the files which had recently been made available to her was ongoing, it appears that the criminal files contain significant gaps. For example, critical documents, such as the trust deeds themselves, are not on the files; the criminal files appear to contain almost no records of the communications between the Liechtenstein entities and the Husband/his representatives (it being noted that such documents must exist because the trustees could not have paid out vast sums to the Husband without some communication); the criminal files do not appear to contain a full analysis of the relevant bank accounts; and finally, new schemes were emerging from the criminal files - for example, the existence of the Goosefish Trust - about which almost no information was available. </p>

In any event, Temur had pleaded that he was unable to admit or deny what the Husband received from the Liechtenstein trusts which could only be because he denied being privy to the arrangements for such transfers. </p>

It was further submitted that, given the proceedings in Liechtenstein commenced on 19 September 2019 by the Wife, it was inappropriate for this court to make orders for disclosure about assets in Liechtenstein in respect of which the Wife had herself applied to the Liechtenstein court for substantive relief. This court should not make orders in respect of assets in a foreign jurisdiction unless there was clear evidence that such an order would likely be enforced by the foreign court and it was common ground that any English disclosure order would not be enforceable in Liechtenstein. Any such orders would be exorbitant in terms of jurisdiction and would have impermissible effects on the entities under Liechtenstein law. </p>

First, are orders for disclosure directed at Counselor and Sobaldo necessary in order to dispose of the proceedings justly and fairly? Second, if they are, should I exercise my discretion to order such disclosure in respect of Liechtenstein-based entities holding the assets in dispute in Liechtenstein? The answer to that second question will require me to take account of the real - in the sense of the actual - risk of prosecution in Liechtenstein and to balance that factor against the importance of the documents of which disclosure is ordered to the fair disposal of these proceedings. </p>

That conclusion has not been challenged by Counselor and Sobaldo, both of whom have chosen to submit to this jurisdiction and to involve themselves in these proceedings. In those circumstances, their denial of the Wife&#8217;s claim should properly be accompanied by the disclosure of material which would allow their denials to be tested and evaluated by this court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Practically speaking, disclosure from Counselor and Sobaldo is necessary because they alone hold a complete set of documents from which this court would be able to discern how and for what purpose the trusts were established, the control which, in practice, the Husband still retained of the trust assets, and to whom payments were made from the trusts. I do not find the submission that disclosure is unnecessary because the Wife can obtain the relevant material from other sources to be persuasive.

Further, in answer to the disclosure order I made at the conclusion of the hearing in May 2020, Temur has asserted that he does not possess a single document of relevance to the activities of the trusts. For completeness sake, the availability of documents within the material produced by Mr Kerman under subpoena in December 2016 is also limited. Mr Kerman was only ordered to produce certain categories of documents relating to Cotor&#8217;s accounts at UBS and LGT Bank with the consequence that he did not disclose documents relating to the Liechtenstein trusts. </p>

Disclosure of professional secrets might be justifiable where secrecy is being used to hide assets or conceal wrongdoing from a third party who required that information to pursue their civil rights. In that respect, I adopt the cautious approach advocated by Dr Wenaweser to the interpretation of the recent Liechtenstein Supreme Court case which permitted disclosure of business secrets in the face of apparent but unproven impropriety to enable the contribution claim to be brought in connection with foreign proceedings (see paragraph 46 above). </p>

Though Mr Brodie QC suggested that, if the trustees breached their obligation of professional secrecy, the Husband would be a man with a big grudge and likely to seek to hold them to account, his own case was that there was no evidential basis for that assumption and, so far as the evidence reveals, the Husband was not the named settlor who engaged the services </p>
