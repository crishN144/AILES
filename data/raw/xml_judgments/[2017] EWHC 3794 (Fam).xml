You breached the injunction order on two occasions.  I have also found that you are in breach of the undertaking that you gave to the court on 12&#160;December&#160;2016 and the reporting restriction order that was made by the court on the same date.</span></p>

I had made an injunction order against you on 13&#160;December&#160;2011.  That was an order prohibiting you until further order, whether by yourself or encouraging others, from making any publication of court papers and the public law proceedings relating to your children and not to allow copies of the papers or details specific to the proceedings as set out within them, to come into the possession of any unauthorised person.  There also provided at paragraph&#160;two that if documents in relation to the proceedings came into your possession, you would deliver them up to the Local&#160;Authority within three working days.</span></p>

You then made a further application to discharge the order which came before His&#160;Honour&#160;Judge&#160;Murdoch QC on 24&#160;April&#160;2014.  The orders that I have made were made in my capacity sitting as a deputy high court judge as was the order made His&#160;Honour&#160;Judge&#160;Murdoch QC on 24&#160;April&#160;2014.  He dismissed your application to discharge the injunction order, but he did vary the order to permit publication by you of information which is permitted by Rule&#160;12.73(1)(a) and (c) and Rule&#160;12.75 of the Family&#160;Procedure&#160;Rules&#160;2010 and the practice direction 12G supplementing those rules.  Your application to the Court&#160;of&#160;Appeal for permission to appeal the order of His&#160;Honour&#160;Judge&#160;Murdoch was refused on 28&#160;July&#160;2016.</span></p>

Whilst you accepted that you had made the postings complained of by the Local&#160;Authority on Facebook, you put forward a number of reasons as to why you said that you were not in contempt of court.  You said that you were entitled to publish the material because the care proceedings had concluded.  You said that you were also entitled to publish the material because you were pursuing a complaint against the Local&#160;Authority, as permitted under the Family&#160;Procedure&#160;Rules and the third point argued on your behalf was that you did not have the necessary guilty intent and were not therefore in contempt because you genuinely considered that you were entitled to publish the material.</span></p>

I did, back in July adjourn the matter specifically to give you the opportunity to get some public funding and legal representation today but you tell me that you did speak to your previous solicitors and they told you that you would not be granted public funding but you said that you are not sure that is the real reason why they were not willing to act for you, that you said that you have not consulted any other solicitors and you have confirmed to me that you are content to proceed without legal representation today.</span></p>

When the matter came before the court on 12&#160;December&#160;2016 it was not possible to conclude it then and it had to be adjourned part-heard and regrettably it could not be relisted until 2&#160;March&#160;2017.  You offered, through your counsel, to give an undertaking to remove the Facebook post concerning your children by 13&#160;December&#160;2016 and not to publish any further material and you agreed to be bound by those promises until 2&#160;March&#160;2017.  You completed a form of undertaking which contained the statement which read that you understood the undertaking that you had given and if you broke any of the premises then you could find your assets seized or you could be sent to prison for contempt.  On the same date I made a reporting restriction and the Local&#160;Authority applied, on 28&#160;February&#160;2017, for you to show why you should not be committed to prison for breach of the undertaking and for breach of the reporting restrictions.  I found that as alleged you had breached the undertaking by not removing any material from Facebook and that you had continued to post material late into the proceedings on 13&#160;December&#160;2016, 22&#160;December&#160;2016 and 20&#160;February&#160;2017 and I found that you had also posted material that reported on the proceedings, namely on 13&#160;December&#160;2016 and on 20&#160;February&#160;2017.</span></p>

You make it clear that your view had never changed for the past seven and a half years and that your view is that your children were wrongly taken from you and you tell me that you are not prepared to remove any of the postings that you have made and that you do not regret anything that you have done.  You say that you stand by the fact that you were pursuing a legitimate complaint that you were entitled to do.  You say that you love your children and that you have been denied freedom of expression.  That is only mitigation in as much as it displays your sincerity but does not provide the excuse for the way in which you have behaved.</span></p>

It is clear from the documentation and the evidence that I have considered, that one of your children has been caused anger and distress by your behaviour, and one of the postings that you made contained deeply personal information about that child.  It is also an aggravating feature that you have deliberately targeted social workers and their partners and foster carers and publication of the Guardian&#8217;s report, which again contained personal and distressing matters, an extremely serious matter that the court cannot and will not ignore.  </span></p>

They wish to make it clear to the court however, that they have no wish to see you sent to prison.  They acknowledge that you have been traumatised by the loss of your children and that you have always been sincere but misguided in your views that you have been wronged by the Local&#160;Authority but they point out that you have been given every opportunity to take material down but you have not done so despite your promise to the court that you would.  It is also part of the background to this case that at or around each of the hearings you have made further postings and you have made five new posts since the matter was last before me, namely on 20&#160;July&#160;2017, 3&#160;August&#160;2017, 21&#160;August&#160;2017, and 24&#160;August&#160;2017.  I make it clear that I am not sentencing you for those matters but they are part of the overall background to the case.</span></p>

You have demonstrated a complete lack of respect for the authority of this court.  The injunction order was breached repeatedly and the Local&#160;Authority were limited to relying on 10 breaches so as to make the hearing manageable, but as the Local&#160;Authority pointed out at previous hearings in fact there have been more breaches than that.</span></p>

The apology that you gave to the court at the hearing last December and your undertaking to remove the postings and not to repeat them has turned out to be extremely hollow and the court regards the breach of the undertaking on the 13&#160;December&#160;2016, namely the day after the hearing on 12&#160;December&#160;2016, as being almost immediate and flagrant.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In all the circumstances of the case I have concluded that only a custodial sentence is appropriate.  In passing sentence I have had careful regard to the principle of totality and the sentence that I pass on you is the shortest sentence that is commensurate with the seriousness of the breaches and taking into account the mitigation and all the circumstances of the case.  The sentence that I impose on you firstly for the breaches of the injunction order dated 13&#160;December&#160;2013 as varied.  There are 10&#160;breaches.  On breach one, I sentence you to three months&#8217; imprisonment.  On each of the other breaches numbered two to ten, I sentence you also to three months&#8217; imprisonment but that will run concurrently.  For breaching the undertaking that you gave to the court on 12&#160;December&#160;2016, by failing to remove the material from Facebook and making a further entry on 13&#160;December&#160;2016, I sentence you to three months&#8217; imprisonment consecutive.  For the breach on 22&#160;December&#160;2016 and 20&#160;February&#160;2017, for each of those breaches I impose three&#160;months&#8217; imprisonment but that will run concurrent.  For posting material on Facebook that reported on the proceedings on 13&#160;December&#160;2016 and 20&#160;February&#160;2017, I make no separate penalty.  The total sentence imposed on you is therefore one of six&#160;months&#8217;&#160;imprisonment.  </span></p>

You could have absolutely no complaint if I sent you directly to prison today.  I do, however, take into account the mitigation that has been put forward by you today and the fact that these proceedings have been far more protracted than is usual.  I am just about persuaded that I can properly suspend the sentence of imprisonment and I am going to suspend it for a period of 12&#160;months on condition that you comply with the terms of the injunction order dated 13&#160;December&#160;2011 as varied on 11&#160;June&#160;2012 and 24&#160;April&#160;2014.</span></p>

If you do not comply with the terms of the suspended order that I make today then the matter will be brought back to court and if any further breach is proved then the sentence of six months&#8217; imprisonment will be implemented.  If that happens you will have only yourself to blame and you will have to take responsibility for it.  That concludes my sentencing remarks.  I am going to direct that a transcript of my sentencing remarks be obtained at public expense and that order will be made accordingly.</span></p>
