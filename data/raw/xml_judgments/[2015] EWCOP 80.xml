Where the court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the patient lacks capacity in this regard, the court may take the decision as to what course of action is in the patient&#8217;s best interests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question in this difficult and finely balanced case is whether C has the capacity to decide whether or not to consent to the life saving treatment that her doctors wish to give her following her attempted suicide, namely renal dialysis.  Without such treatment the almost inevitable outcome will be the death of C.  If the treatment is administered the likelihood is that it will save C&#8217;s life, albeit that there remains an appreciable and increasing possibility that C will be left requiring dialysis for the rest of her life.  C now refuses to consent to dialysis and much of the treatment associated with it.  She is supported in that decision by her family, and in particular her two elder daughters G and V.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within this context, and by reason of a concern on the part of her treating clinicians that C lacks capacity to decide whether or not to consent to dialysis, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (hereafter &#8216;the Trust&#8217;) has applied to this court pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 15</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> for a declaration that C lacks capacity to make decisions about her medical care and treatment.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the evening of Friday 13 November 2015, having considered the evidence filed in this matter and having heard oral evidence from three psychiatrists and C&#8217;s daughter G and the submissions of counsel, I decided that, on balance, C does have capacity to decide whether or not to consent to dialysis.  In the circumstances, I dismissed the application of the Trust.  I now set out my reasons for coming to that conclusion.  This matter was heard in open court.  There is a reporting restriction order in force which prohibits the publication of certain information likely to lead to the identification of C as being the subject of an application with respect to serious medical treatment, including the identity of the doctors and other medical professionals treating C.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C is a person to whom the epithet &#8216;conventional&#8217; will never be applied.  By her own account, the account of her eldest daughters and the account of her father, C has led a life characterised by impulsive and self-centred decision making without guilt or regret. C has had four marriages and a number of affairs and has, it is said, spent the money of her husbands and lovers recklessly before moving on when things got difficult or the money ran out.  She has, by their account, been an entirely reluctant and at times completely indifferent mother to her three caring daughters.  Her consumption of alcohol has been excessive and, at times, out of control.  C is, as all who know her and C herself appears to agree, a person who seeks to live life entirely, and unapologetically on her own terms; that life revolving largely around her looks, men, material possessions and &#8216;living the high life&#8217;.  In particular, it is clear that during her life C has placed a significant premium on youth and beauty and on living a life that, in C&#8217;s words, &#8216;sparkles&#8217;.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">With respect to youth and beauty, her daughter V states that just as C has never seen herself as a mother, she has never seen herself getting old.  Upon being diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2014 when aged forty-nine V relates that C expressed the view that she was &#8220;actually kind of glad because the timing was right&#8221;.  It is recorded in C&#8217;s medical notes that she did not want to discuss the benefits and risks associated with chemotherapy but was &#8220;keen not to have any change in size or deficit that will affect her wearing a bikini&#8221;.  She refused to take medication prescribed for the disease because &#8220;it made her fat&#8221;.  There appear to have been no concerns expressed regarding C&#8217;s capacity in this context.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C&#8217;s preoccupation with not getting old also manifested itself in other ways. Upon learning that her daughter G was pregnant C&#8217;s reaction was, says G, one of anger in circumstances where this meant she would be a grandmother and made her feel &#8220;past her sell-by date&#8221;.  Within the foregoing context, in her statement V relates that C has often said over the years that she wanted to &#8220;go out with a bang&#8221; and has been firm in her conviction that, with regard to growing old, she &#8220;just would not let it happen&#8221;.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C&#8217;s emphasis on money, material possessions and &#8216;living the high life&#8217; is also well established by the evidence in this case.  From the history of her four marriages provided by V it would appear that C has, over the course of those four marriages, considered a downturn in the financial fortunes of her husbands an entirely reasonable ground for moving on and has taken requests that her spending be curtailed or limited to be unreasonable.  The value that C places on wealth and possessions is further demonstrated by her statement to V that, her fortunes having suffered a downturn in recent times, she does not want to &#8220;live in a council flat&#8221; or to &#8220;be poor&#8221;.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite her patent faults C is dear to her daughters.  V relates that she and G have learnt to accept their mother for who she is: complexities, seeming contradictions, blind spots, self-centred and manipulative behaviour, excruciating honesty and all.  V tells me that she has accepted that there is no point in trying to make C a &#8216;typical mother&#8217; in the same way she could not have been a &#8216;traditional wife&#8217; to her four husbands.  She is who she is says V and summarises the position as follows:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.27in">&#8220;My mother&#8217;s values, and the choices that she made have always been based on looks (hers and other people&#8217;s), money, and living (at all costs) what she called her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">sparkly</span>&#8221; lifestyle&#8230;her life was, from her point of view, a life well lived.  I have never known her express regret, or really to take responsibility for anything, including the choices she has made&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Over the past year the progress of C&#8217;s life has, sadly, followed a trajectory that has moved away from what she terms her &#8220;sparkly&#8221; lifestyle.  As I have already noted, C was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2014.  She underwent a lumpectomy in January 2015 and radiotherapy in March 2015, with treatment concluding in May 2015.  C has said that, understandably, this placed her under some stress.  In August 2015 C experienced the acrimonious breakdown of a long term relationship.  This also resulted in the loss of her business and the financial security attendant thereon, the loss of her home and the generation of significant debt.  C was also the subject of arrest and criminal charges arising from an incident that occurred during the breakdown of her relationship.  This situation is described in the report of Dr R as exposing C to &#8216;back to back psycho-social stressors&#8217;.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 7 September 2015 C attended V&#8217;s house and asked where her Veuve Clicquot was.  Later that day C attempted to commit suicide.  The attempt was premeditated and planned.  C went to a beach and took sixty paracetamol tablets with champagne.  The attempt was not successful (C later told her daughters that she &#8220;royally cocked it up&#8221;).  When C awoke she became worried about the pain that she might suffer and called her general practitioner who advised her to call an ambulance.  She was admitted to a local hospital for urgent care and subsequently transferred to King&#8217;s College Hospital on 29 September 2015.  Whilst at the local hospital V relates that C stated that she would try to kill herself again and that she was adamant that she wanted to die.</p>

In summary, as a result of her paracetamol overdose C suffered an injury to her liver and an acute injury to her kidneys.  Since admission to hospital C has, consequently, required renal replacement therapy.  That therapy was provided initially by a &#8216;filtration&#8217; machine and thereafter by intermittent haemodialysis for four hours three times per week.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Following a period of intensive treatment after the overdose, C made slow but progressive improvement in her liver function.  However, an improvement in her kidney function has yet to occur with her kidneys showing no signs of significant recovery.  Dr L is clear that the ongoing care of C is now predominantly supportive in nature save for the essential requirement of kidney dialysis.  The anticipated duration of that treatment is from a minimum of six weeks up to a maximum of several months.  As at 6 November Dr L was of the view that the outlook for C&#8217;s kidney function was unclear but that, generally, her doctors anticipated a recovery in due course.  Dr L described the view regarding C&#8217;s kidney function on that date as &#8216;cautiously optimistic&#8217;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In a statement dated 9 November 2015 Dr S observes that the &#8216;overwhelming majority&#8217; of people who suffer an acute kidney injury as a result of a paracetamol overdose recover independent kidney function, usually within four to six weeks.  However, he further notes that in circumstances where C is now nearly nine weeks from her overdose, arriving at a confident prognosis is made more difficult.  In C&#8217;s medical records Dr S is recorded as informing C on 5 November 2015 that her prognosis remained unpredictable and that, even were the damage to her kidneys to be potentially reversible, the prognosis would remain uncertain.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his statement Dr S explains that the most likely explanation for the current state of C&#8217;s kidney function is a combination of paracetamol related kidney injury, severe liver injury and several episodes of infection requiring antibiotic treatment, and that the most likely outcome remains that C will recover independent kidney function over the course of several months.  Dr S however makes clear that it is possible that C has sustained irreversible damage to her kidneys in the form of cortical necrosis.  The way to establish definitively whether this is the case for C would be to perform a kidney biopsy.  At present however this is a high risk procedure due to C having abnormal blood clotting levels as a result of her liver injury.  A kidney biopsy will become less risky as C&#8217;s liver recovers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr S states that C may well be left with an element of chronic kidney damage.  Within this context, if C recovers kidney function to the point where she does not need renal replacement therapy then Dr S would expect C&#8217;s kidney function to have minimal effect on C&#8217;s ability to continue as she had prior to the overdose.  However, if C does not recover kidney function Dr S is clear that she would require regular renal replacement therapy in order to stay alive.  The options for such replacement therapy would be a continuation of the haemodialysis that C currently has, peritoneal dialysis or a kidney transplant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In an updating statement dated 11 November 2015 Dr L opines that C&#8217;s prognosis &#8220;remains excellent with survival fully anticipated&#8221;.  Dr L records that restoration of C&#8217;s liver function to normal is anticipated within a four to six week period.  Dr L further records that C&#8217;s kidney function has still yet to recover but anticipates an 85 to 95% chance of this occurring having regard to the progression seen in a large majority of similar cases.  However, like Dr S, Dr L acknowledges that, with the passage of time, the likelihood of full recovery diminishes.  Dr L estimates that if C is not fully recovered within a period of three months, later recovery is unlikely, with the chances of delayed restoration after three months estimated at less than 20%.  In such circumstances C would require long term renal replacement therapy. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr S makes clear that if C does not have further dialysis and continues to have minimal kidney function, she will become progressively unwell as levels of potassium and acid in her blood increase to dangerous levels.  These levels will typically become life threatening between three and seven days following the last haemodialysis session.  If C drinks during this period then she will also endure fluid build up on her lungs and insufficient oxygen in her bloodstream as a result.  The risks of a sudden cardiac event or deterioration will increase after more than three days without dialysis.  If C&#8217;s kidney function remains poor and she passes very little urine, it is likely that C will die within five to ten days of having no dialysis.  C would become progressively drowsy and possibly confused after several days although a sudden cardiac arrest and death is possible at any point.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Were doctors to have to force C to receive dialysis against her consent Dr S makes clear that this would be a significant undertaking.  He states that were doctors to attempt to administer dialysis to C in circumstances where C took measures to try and stop such treatment the treatment would immediately become unsafe for C (and potentially for medical staff).  In such circumstances, Dr S makes plain that in order to dialyse C against her will she would need to be sedated with that sedation being heavy enough to render her, essentially, unconscious for the duration of the dialysis.  In order to achieve this safely the procedure would need to be undertaken in a high dependency setting.  There are, of course, risks associated with heavy sedation, including respiratory depression and low blood pressure which may in turn necessitate further intervention including intubation and ventilation.  Finally, Dr S states that a person seeking to avoid dialysis may remove the dialysis tubes when able to do so, resulting in the need to insert a dialysis tube into a large vein each time and under sedation.  There is a risk of bleeding and infection each time this is done, which risk is significantly increased in C given her abnormal clotting.  There is also a risk of damage to veins, thereby increasingly restricting venous access.  Dr S opines that the minimum frequency of dialysis in this context would be once every five days, although the risks of a sudden cardiac event or deterioration increase over time after more than three days without dialysis.</p>

That would be to put the cart before the horse or, expressed another way, to allow the tail of welfare to wag the dog of capacity.  Any tendency in this direction risks infringing the rights of that group of persons who, though vulnerable, are capable of making their own decisions.  Many who suffer from mental illness are well able to make decisions about their medical treatment, and it is important not to make unjustified assumptions to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

Dr R was concerned that C&#8217;s capacity to &#8220;weigh in the balance the risks and benefits of accepting/refusing treatment&#8221; was compromised by &#8220;very rigid thinking style and her distorted cognition such as black and white thinking and catastrophic thinking e.g. that she will forever require dialysis and will never recover to a stage where she can live an independent life again&#8221;.  Within this context Dr R concluded that C was unable to use or weigh information relevant to the decision being made.  It is important to note that later on 29 September 2015 C changed her mind and consented to dialysis (which I deal with in more detail below);</p>

Dr R was concerned that the main driver of C&#8217;s decision appeared to be her categoric belief that the timescale given to her for recovery had passed.  C considered that this meant she would not recover and did not want a lifetime of dialysis.  Within this context, Dr R concluded that &#8220;She is unflinching in her belief about this.  I think this could be significantly influenced by her personality traits and as such are affecting her ability to use and weigh evidence presented to her thereby affecting adversely her ability to make a capacitous decision.&#8221;  </p>

In his report dated 6 November 2015 Dr R records his conversation with C on 5 November as follows &#8220;C states she remains adamant that she does not wish to continue with dialysis treatment.  The reasons, as she tells me, are that she has never wanted to have it (despite many weeks of engaging), she has acquiesced rather than engaged enthusiastically.  Now she finds it painful, exhausting and she has had enough.  She states she knows she will die as a result of not having it.  She believes herself to have the capacity to make this decision&#8230;she also appears to have taken a very concrete categorical cognitive position around the inevitability of death despite her treating doctors&#8217; view of her prognosis.  She believes she has no hope of recovery as she is now through the period of expected recovery as described to her.  She is unflinching in her belief about this.&#8221;  Within this context, Dr R concluded &#8220;This unexplained and seemingly irrational decision is not met with significant using and weighing demonstrably ending with a capacitous but objectively assessed unwise decision.&#8221;</p>

However, whilst Dr R considered it risky to make a diagnosis during the acute phase of a medical condition, he is satisfied that C&#8217;s symptoms are &#8216;in fitting&#8217; with a personality disorder.  Within this context, Dr R acknowledged that the question of whether a particular person has a histrionic or narcissistic personality disorder, as opposed to simply a very strong or difficult personality can be an area of some controversy and said that there are no validated tools in this area to ascertain a baseline of &#8216;normal&#8217; in the context of diagnosing personality problems.</p>

Overall, Dr R opined that the rigid, &#8216;black and white, cognitive position that, in Dr R&#8217;s view, is preventing C from reaching what he describes as &#8220;a balanced, nuanced, used and weighed position&#8221;, can be explained by the thinking associated with the dysfunction of disorders of personality in C.</p>

Professor P believes that C is exhibiting what he describes as a &#8220;petulant&#8221; response to a lack of timely recovery. In oral evidence the Professor reiterated that the evidence of C&#8217;s inability to use and weigh comprises her inability to project herself into the future and her insistence that the future is not what the medial assessment says it will be.</p>

On balance however, Professor P favoured the conclusion that C&#8217;s alleged inability to use and weigh information relevant to the decision in question, and specifically information concerning her future prognosis, is a product of a personality disorder.</p>

Dr Stevens&#8217; report however contains no account of the process by which he reaches that conclusion or his reasons for doing so.  Nor does Dr Stevens&#8217; report contain a clear and detailed account of the questions he asked C in order to assess her capacity in this respect nor the answers she gave.  A short adjournment to secure Dr Stevens&#8217; contemporaneous notes of his assessment did not result in any greater illumination.  Further, during the course of examination in chief it became apparent that the one direct quote from C that Dr Stevens does set out in his report (and one which suggests C clearly accepts that she has a positive prognosis and has weighed it in her decision) occurred after C had been medicated with oxycodone (a synthetic opiate).  This was not mentioned in Dr Stevens&#8217; report.  Overall, Dr Stevens&#8217; report failed to evidence rigorous adherence to good practice when assessing capacity as set out in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> Code of Practice, and in particular Paragraph 4.49.

First, they give a clear picture of the information that C was being given concerning her prognosis in the period leading up to her refusal of further medical treatment.  Second, the medical records give a picture of how C treated that information when it was provided to her.

On 25 September 2015, when C stated that she could refuse dialysis, would refuse dialysis and would move to a hospice, the notes make clear that C&#8217;s capacity to refuse treatment was queried but that she was deemed competent to refuse treatment at that time.  The day before C refused treatment for the first time on 29 September 2015 it was considered that C appeared to have capacity (although she was noted to be intermittently encephalopathic).  On 18 October 2015 Dr K (SHO) considered that C displayed capacity when expressing her wish to forgo further treatment and to move to a hospice.  On 19 October 2015 Dr V recorded that C displayed signs indicative of capacity (understanding, weighing up, retaining and repeating information) although capacity was not clear cut.  On 2 November 2015 Dr N took the view that C appeared to have capacity but noted that a psychiatric review was required.  As noted above, thereafter both Dr R and Professor P took the view that C lacked capacity to decide whether or not to undergo dialysis.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;margin-right:0.27in">&#8220;As I have said above, my mother would never have wanted to live at all costs.  Her reasons for trying to kill herself in September and for refusing dialysis now are strongly in keeping with both her personality and her long held values.  Although they are not reasons that are easy to understand, I believe that they are not only fully thought through, but also entirely in keeping with both her (unusual) value system and her (unusual) personality.  Her unwillingness to consider &#8216;a life she would find tolerable&#8217; is not a sign that she lacks capacity; it is a sign that what she would consider tolerable is different from what others might.  She does not want any life that is on offer to her at this stage.  Put bluntly, her life has always revolved around her looks, men, and material possessions: she understands that (as put to her by Professor [P]) other people have failed relationships, feel sad and continue living, but for her, as she has said, she doesn&#8217;t want to &#8216;live in a council flat&#8217;, &#8216;be poor&#8217; or &#8216;be ugly&#8217; (which she equates with being old).  As is set out in the notes, she truly means it when she says &#8216;I have lost everything this year&#8217;, and that being the case, she doesn&#8217;t want to accept any of the options on offer to her as &#8211; as she sees it &#8211; an &#8216;old grandma&#8217;, even were her kidneys to fully recover.  &#8216;Recovery&#8217; to her does not just relate to her kidney function, but to regaining her &#8216;sparkle&#8217; (her expensive, material and looks-orientated social life) which she believes she is too old to regain.  Again, the references in the notes to her talking about being &#8216;sociable, hosting parties and going out with the girls&#8217; are fitting: to those who know her well, her entire identity has been built around being a self-described &#8216;vivacious and sociable person who lives life to the full and enjoys having fun&#8217;&#8221;.</p>

C was recorded by Dr O (Liver SHO) as being clear in her understanding that without dialysis, adequate nutrition and treatment of her liver she would die and, within that context, as being able to take in the medical advice and fully understood the risk of refusing treatment.  Following interventions from her father and a friend on 29 September, C changed her mind and consented to treatment.  It is clear from the medical records that C appears, with the assistance of her father and her friend, to have undertaken an exercise of using or weighing information as it is recorded that an hour was spent talking to C about her grave medical condition, her chances of recovery, and her prognosis for the future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is also evidence before the court of C expressly acknowledging her positive prognosis and weighing the same.  On 3 November 2015 V recalled that in deciding not to continue with treatment following the MDT meeting on that day C &#8220;had clearly used the time to consider the prospect of having what Professor P described as a &#8216;tolerable life&#8217;, and decided that, although with the more optimistic prognosis, it required some thought, she still did not want to live.&#8221;  More generally V was clear in her evidence that C &#8220;repeatedly told us that she didn&#8217;t care whether her kidneys improved or not, and that she had thought about it, and that she wanted to die regardless.  She &#8211; in the full knowledge that it was entirely possible that she might make a full recovery &#8211; said that if her kidney function improved, and she were discharged, that she would &#8216;throw [herself] under a train&#8217;&#8221;.  No party sought to suggest that V was mistaken in her recollection of these conversations.  On 10 November 2015 C told Dr Stevens that &#8220;I know that I could get better; I know that I could live without a health problem, but I don&#8217;t want it&#8221;.  Dr Stevens states in his report that she &#8220;made very clear to me that she understands and has retained the information that her liver is making a good recovery and that her kidneys are recovering, albeit more slowly, such that her doctors wish her to undergo thrice weekly haemodialysis for some months to come.  C also understands and has retained the information that her doctors expect her kidney function to recover such that haemodialysis can be discontinued at some point in 2016 and that her medical quality of life can be expected to improve thereafter.&#8221;  Whilst there are difficulties with Dr Stevens&#8217; report overall, I am prepared to accept that his recording of what C said to him is accurate, and indeed no party suggested otherwise.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in my judgment it is important to place these statements by C in their proper context.  In particular, they must be placed in the context of the other occasions, as summarised in the preceding paragraphs, when C has acknowledged her positive prognosis and weighed the same either tacitly or expressly. Thus, for example, whilst Dr R considered that on 29 September 2015 C was compromised by &#8220;very rigid thinking style and her distorted cognition such as black and white thinking and catastrophic thinking e.g. that she will forever require dialysis and will never recover to a stage where she can live an independent life again&#8221;, as I have noted, on the same day C was recorded by Dr O as being clear in her understanding that without dialysis, adequate nutrition and treatment of her liver she would die and, within that context, as being able to take in the medical advice and fully understood the risk of refusing treatment.  Further, C was recorded as appearing to have capacity on that date.  Likewise, whilst telling Dr R on 10 November that &#8220;there is no hope &#8216;a tiny sliver of hope&#8217; as she put it today, that she will get better&#8221; she told Dr Stevens on the same day that &#8220;I know that I could get better; I know that I could live without a health problem.&#8221; In this regard I recall G&#8217;s evidence that her mother&#8217;s response to professionals will, in G&#8217;s experience, depend on whether she considers them to be &#8216;on her side&#8217; (part of her &#8216;charm team&#8217; as C styles that group) or not and that Dr R was not considered to be part of that &#8216;team&#8217;.  </p>

When on 20 October 2015 C is recorded as stating that she does not want a life dependent on dialysis and of poor quality and apparently dismisses the medical opinion that she has every chance of making a good recovery and leading a fulfilling and normal life, she had the day before been told by Dr V only that there was a &#8220;possibility she may&#8221; get better and a &#8220;possibility she could&#8221; return to a degree of normality.  Whilst On 3 November 2015, when C again refused dialysis, Dr R was concerned that the main driver of C&#8217;s decision appeared to be her categoric belief that the timescale given to her for recovery had passed and that C considered that this meant she would not recover and did not want a lifetime of dialysis, the day before C had been told by Dr N that that no-one could predict how long it would take to recover and no one could tell for sure to what level of function she would recover.  On 5 November, when Dr R was concerned that C was stating that &#8220;she believes she has no hope of recovery as she is now through the period of expected recovery as described to her.  She is unflinching in her belief about this&#8221;, according to the medical records Dr L appears to have told C that dialysis <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> not be a permanent situation and Dr S confirmed to C that there was no evidence of recovery so far and, accordingly, the prognosis was still unpredictable and remained uncertain even if the damage was potentially reversible.</p>

Thus, on 9 November 2015 C told Dr R that she knew what the doctors were doing and were not angry with them, as they were just trying to save her life but she did not wish to be saved.  As I have noted, C told Dr Stevens on 10 November 2015 that &#8220;I know that I could get better; I know that I could live without a health problem, but I don&#8217;t want it&#8221; and that &#8220;she had thought a great deal about her medical condition and that, despite appreciating that she has been given a good prognosis, she remains steadfastly determined to die as soon as possible.&#8221;   Later she told the representative from the Official Solicitor that &#8220;They are doing their best to do everything they can for me and unfortunately that is not what I want&#8221; and &#8220;I know they need to save lives.

C has, on a number of occasions, given very clear reasons for not wishing to continue her treatment.  These reasons include the risk of a life lived on dialysis, the risk of long term disability, exhaustion with treatment and her wish not to endure further weeks or months of the same, her wish not to continue to endure the symptoms and pain associated with treatment, the risk she will not be able to attain her former lifestyle, her desire not to get old and lose her appearance and her wish to attain her original goal of ending her life.  </p>

I pause to note that, in the context of the information given to C regarding her prognosis as summarised in Paragraphs 83 to 85 above, these fears on the part of C cannot be considered irrational.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Within the foregoing context, I am satisfied that it is not the case that C has undertaken the decision making exercise in relation to dialysis solely on the basis of a concrete or &#8216;black and white&#8217; view taken in respect of her prognosis but rather on the basis of placing in the balance many factors relevant to the decision.  That C considers that these factors outweigh a positive prognosis and the chance of life that it signals may not accord with the view that many may take in the same circumstances, and indeed may horrify some.  However, they do in my judgment demonstrate C using and weighing information relevant to the decision in question when coming to that decision.  </p>

In circumstances where the Trust concedes that C meets the other criteria comprising the &#8216;functional test&#8217; I am satisfied that C is not <span class="legdslegrhslegp2text" style="color:#000000">a person unable to make a decision for herself</span> for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 3(1)</ref> and, accordingly, does not lack capacity to decide whether or not to accept dialysis.  </p>

It is right to record that, as I observed at the conclusion of the hearing, had I been satisfied that C was unable to use and weigh information in the manner contended for by the Trust, I believe I would have had difficulty in deciding that this inability was, on the balance of probabilities, because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.  Whilst it is accepted by all parties that C has an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain, the evidence as to the precise nature of that impairment or disturbance was far from conclusive.  Further, and more importantly, with regard to the question of causation, and in particular whether what was being seen might be the operation of a personality disorder or </span>simply the thought processes of a strong willed, stubborn individual with unpalatable and highly egocentric views the evidence was likewise somewhat equivocal. However, as I say, I need say no more about this in light of my conclusions as set out above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I of course bear in mind that my decision does not accord with the considered opinions of two very experienced psychiatrists.  Whilst I have some concern that Dr R in particular set the test for capacity too high in this case in looking for C to demonstrate significant using and weighing of information demonstratively ending with a balanced, nuanced, used and weighed position, the fact that I have differed from Dr R and Professor P is in large part a product of this being a finely balanced case in which a number of reasonable interpretations of the information available are possible.  In reaching my decision I must survey all the available evidence (see <span style="font-style:italic">PH v A Local Authority </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2011/1704" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCOP 1704" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 1704 (COP)</ref> at [16]).  In the final analysis, and having had the benefit of surveying the entirety of the information available to the court I have come to a different interpretation of the finely balanced evidence to that favoured by the two psychiatrists, to both of whom I am grateful for their considered and extremely helpful evidence.</p>

However, as set out at the beginning of this judgment, a capacitous individual is entitled to decide whether or not to accept treatment from his or her doctor.  The right to refuse treatment extends to declining treatment that would, if administered, save the life of the patient and, accordingly, a capacitous patient may refuse treatment even in circumstances where that refusal will lead to his or her death.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The decision C has reached to refuse dialysis can be characterised as an unwise one.  That C considers that the prospect of growing old, the fear of living with fewer material possessions and the fear that she has lost, and will not regain, &#8216;her sparkle&#8217; outweighs a prognosis that signals continued life will alarm and possibly horrify many, although I am satisfied that the ongoing discomfort of treatment, the fear of chronic illness and the fear of lifelong treatment and lifelong disability are factors that also weigh heavily in the balance for C.  C&#8217;s decision is certainly one that does not accord with the expectations of many in society.  Indeed, others in society may consider C&#8217;s decision to be unreasonable, illogical or even immoral within the context of the sanctity accorded to life by society in general.  None of this however is evidence of a lack of capacity.  The court being satisfied that, in accordance with the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, C has capacity to decide whether or not to accept treatment C is entitled to make her own decision on that question based on the things that are important to her, in keeping with her own personality and system of values and without conforming to society&#8217;s expectation of what constitutes the &#8216;normal&#8217; decision in this situation (if such a thing exists).   As a capacitous individual C is, in respect of her own body and mind, sovereign. </p>

My decision does no more than confirm that in law C is entitled to refuse the treatment offered to her for her benefit by her dedicated treating team.  Nothing I have said prevents them from continuing to offer that treatment.</p>
