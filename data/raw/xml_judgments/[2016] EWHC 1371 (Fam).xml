NH&#8217;s older half-sister (now aged 27) resides in Canada.&#160; NH's father is RH (hereafter &#8220;the father&#8221;).  He has played no part in his life and has played no part in these proceedings.   NH is related to BD, a public figure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 5 April 2016 NH absconded from the Royal Courts of Justice immediately prior to a directions hearing listed on that date.   In consequence, on 5 April 2016 I granted a free standing port alert order in respect of NH.   In light of the suspicion that NH would head for the Zimbabwean Embassy, the local authority contacted the Embassy and the Deputy Consul confirmed to the social worker that the Embassy would notify the local authority if NH or his mother attended there.  In circumstances where NH&#8217;s passport was held to the order of this court, in addition to making a port alert order in respect of NH I respectfully requested the Zimbabwean Embassy not to issue replacement travel documents for NH. Responsibility for serving the freestanding port alert order on the Police and the National Ports Office lay with the local authority.  That order was duly served by the local authority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 April 2016 the court was informed by the local authority that NH had indeed made his way to the Zimbabwean Embassy where he was joined by his mother.  Upon being so informed I made a collection order in respect of NH out of hours, making clear to the local authority that it would not be possible to execute that order within the environs of the Embassy.  Responsibility for serving the collection order lay with the Tipstaff and the collection order was duly served by the Tipstaff on the Police and the Ports Office.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The order of Keehan J of 12 April 2016 directed that NH attend the hearing on 22 April 2016 by way of video link from within the Zimbabwean Embassy.  Arrangements were made for a secure video link, including the delivery of a secure laptop to the Embassy.  Upon the link being made it was clear that the mother was present with NH and I permitted her to participate in the hearing via the same video link.  Subject to technical difficulties the link worked tolerably well and allowed me to ascertain from NH his position, and that of the mother on the matters then in issue before the court.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Regrettably, towards the very end of the hearing the mother became increasingly upset and abusive.  During a protracted verbal tirade, which took place in front of NH and which the court was unable to halt, the mother accused those in the court room (including me) of wanting to sleep with her son and made various other derogatory comments.  When it became clear that, despite repeated requests that she desist, the mother was intent on continuing to disrupt the progress of the hearing I terminated the video link.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application by NH&#8217;s solicitors to come off the court record was essentially unopposed.  Whilst Ms Lucey on behalf of the local authority sought to caution the court on the issue of potential delay being introduced to the proceedings, the local authority did not seek to oppose that application in circumstances where NH did not wish his solicitor to act for him and refused to speak or to and give instructions to his solicitor.  Within that context, I considered it inevitable that the application must succeed and granted permission to Mr Reed to come off the court record as acting for NH.   I reserved judgment on the questions of whether NH should be permitted to act in person in the care proceedings and to have the services of a McKenzie friend and whether the local authority should have permission disclose certain documents to the Zimbabwean Embassy, the mother opposing that course of action. Whilst I was considering my judgment on those issues however, events moved on significantly.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27 April 2016 the local authority informed the court that the mother and NH had left the Zimbabwean Embassy.  Notwithstanding the existence of the port alert order of 5 April 2016, the collection order of 8 April 2016 and the request that the Embassy refrain from issuing replacement travel documents to NH, the court thereafter became aware on 3 May 2016 that NH and his mother may have manged to leave the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  On 4 May 2016 the mother sent three photographs to the court depicting herself and NH, one outside an airport that appeared to be the international airport in Harare and two outside what appears to be the mother&#8217;s property in Harare.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In light of these developments, on 3 May 2016 I listed the matter before me on 5 May 2016 to consider the current position in this case and the appropriate way forward in respect of the same in light of the fact that the mother had apparently managed to abduct NH from the jurisdiction of England and Wales.</p>

In light of certain matters which I set out below when dealing with the background to this matter, there is an issue as to whether the application to discharge the reporting restriction order is an application made by NH of his own volition or an application made by, or under the influence of the mother.  </p>

I was, by chance, the duty judge on that evening and I granted the without notice application for a collection order in respect of the NH.  It was, of course, not possible to execute the collection order in the Embassy.  The Tipstaff served the collection order on the Police and the National Ports Office.</p>

In particular, the Embassy agreed to the attendance of a mental health professional and a social worker on 19 April 2016 with a view to assessing NH&#8217;s welfare. The mother however refused to permit those professionals to see NH.  </p>

In broad terms, on one side of the stalemate the mother sought to ensure that NH did not go back to the hospital in which he was receiving treatment for his mental health but instead travelled to Zimbabwe as she had always intended he should.  On the other side the local authority sought to ensure NH continued to receive treatment and to ascertain NH&#8217;s wishes and feelings independent of what it considered to be his mother&#8217;s malign influence with a view to determining whether its care plan providing for NH to be placed in Canada remained appropriate.   </p>

He however refused to consent to any assessment in relation to either his mental health or his wishes and feelings.  As I have noted, both the local authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian were concerned that the substantial change in NH&#8217;s wishes and feelings was born out of pressure from his mother.   </p>

Namely, that his mother had not abused him, that the English court had no jurisdiction in respect of him, that the orders controlling the manner in which his mother gained access to certain documents should be discharged, that the interim care order should be discharged and that he should be permitted to travel to Zimbabwe.  During the video, NH is seen to be reading from a pre-prepared note.  Whilst this is not of and in itself concerning, I note again that his list as recited in the video mirrored the themes that have pre-occupied his mother throughout the proceedings, in particular the question of the abuse allegations, the question of jurisdiction and the question of what the mother terms (and which NH likewise termed) a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">document restriction order</span>&#8221;.  </p>

During the course of this hearing the social worker spoke to the mother by telephone during which telephone conversation the mother confirmed that she was in Harare with NH.  By a Position Statement dated 21 May 2016 the local authority informed the court that the social worker spoke to NH via Skype on 16 May 2016, from which conversation the social worker satisfied himself further that NH is likely to be in Zimbabwe.  </p>

It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided upon the basis of rival generalities. An intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary before the ultimate balancing test in terms of proportionality is carried out.

It moves Bentham over and over again. &#8220;In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice&#8221;. &#8220;Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial&#8221;. &#8220;The security of securities is publicity&#8221;. But amongst historians the grave and enlightened verdict of Hallam, in which he ranks the publicity of judicial proceedings even higher than the rights of Parliament as a guarantee of public security, is not likely to be forgotten: &#8220;Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. Of these, the first is by far the most indispensable; nor can the subjects of any State be reckoned to enjoy a real freedom, where this condition is not found both in its judicial institutions and in their constant exercise.&#8221; I myself should be very slow indeed (I shall speak of the exceptions hereafter) to throw any doubt upon this topic. The right of the citizen and the working of the Constitution in the sense which I have described have upon the whole since the fall of the Stuart dynasty received from the judiciary &#8211; and they appear to me still to demand of it &#8211; a constant and most watchful respect. There is no greater danger of usurpation than that which proceeds little by little, under cover of rules of procedure, and at the instance of judges themselves. I must say frankly that I think these encroachments have taken place by way of judicial procedure in such a way as, insensibly at first, but now culminating in this decision most sensibly, to impair the rights, safety, and freedom of the citizen and the open administration of the law.&#8221;</p>

The applications purporting to be from NH that were issued in the period subsequent to 15 March 2016 demonstrate a pre-occupation with matters that have been of consistent concern to the mother rather than to NH.  In the period subsequent to 15 March 2016 NH&#8217;s previous strongly held wishes and feelings regarding his future underwent a complete reversal.  However, at the hearing on 22 April 2016 NH was unable in my judgment to articulate his wishes and feelings outside the narrow list he was reading from, which list again concentrated exclusively on the mother&#8217;s concerns.  Whilst I am not in a position to make a definitive finding regarding the authorship of the application to discharge the reporting restriction order, in my judgment these matters mean that I must be very cautious when considering what weight to attach to the fact that it is NH&#8217;s name on the application in balancing the competing rights in this case.</p>

However, whilst it is the case that there is material on the internet concerning this matter, that material is relatively limited in its ambit, does not commonly identify NH by name and has not, it would appear, been the subject of extensive comment or wide dissemination through &#8216;sharing&#8217;.  In the circumstances, in my judgment further publication of information identifying or capable of identifying NH, would result in further and significant interference in the Art 8 right to respect for privacy of NH and his mother by way of intrusion notwithstanding that there is already some information in the public domain.  </p>

Within this context, it would in my judgment be wrong to allow the fact that information has been placed in the public domain in breach of a reporting restriction order to be thereafter set up as a justification for discharging the reporting restriction order that has been thereby breached.  </p>

The balancing exercise is significantly complicated in this case by the fact that there is a possibility that the 16 year old subject of these proceedings (who has litigation capacity according to the last assessment of litigation capacity available to the court) wishes to divest himself of the protection of the reporting restriction order, and by the fact that the question of whether the reporting restriction order should be varied or discharged impacts on the Art 8 rights of a public figure who is not a party to these proceedings, has not been the subject of comment by the court and who has not made representations on the issue of reporting restrictions.  </p>

I am however also satisfied that NH&#8217;s identity should remain anonymised within that reporting.  I am satisfied that it is proper to continue to protect his identity by reason of the fact he remains a vulnerable and emotionally fragile young man who, on the information available to the court, is still receiving treatment for his mental health and by reason of my enduring concern that the application to discharge the reporting restriction order has not been instigated by NH.  Whilst it is the case that there is already information in the public domain from which NH could be identified, in my judgment that is not in this case a reason to abandon the restriction on identifying him in circumstances where there is a relatively low level of material on internet, much of it not naming him, and where the risk of jigsaw identification can be guarded against using the appropriate rubric at the head of the court&#8217;s judgment and the appropriate terms in the reporting restriction order.  </p>

In addition to the risk that the publication of that fact will lead in short order to the repeated identification of NH in the press, the fact that BD is a well-known figure and is covered in the press in other respects does not constitute sufficient reason for interfering in the Art 8 rights of NH or BD in circumstances where he is not party to proceedings, is not involved in any way in the matters which are the subject of the proceedings and where his conduct and standing has not been called into question within the proceedings.  The fact that the press may wish to comment on the fact that a relative of BD is the subject of care proceedings does not constitute a public interest justification in the legal sense capable of overriding the Art 8 rights of BD or NH.</p>
