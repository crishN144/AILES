First, I must decide whether or not anyone did deliberately tell lies.  If I find that they did, I have to ask myself why they lied.  The mere fact that a witness tells a lie is not in itself evidence as to the ownership of the Group.  A witness may lie for many reasons.  They may possibly be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">innocent</span>&#8221; ones in the sense that they have nothing to do with the ownership of the Group.  For example, they may be lies to bolster a true case; or to protect someone else; or to conceal some other disreputable conduct unrelated to the issues I have to decide; or out of panic, distress or confusion. </p>

Mr Pointer QC and Mr Webster who appear for the Applicant, Meera invite me to draw an adverse inference from this failure.  They rely on the case of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Wisnieswki (a Minor) v Central Manchester Health Authority</span> (1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> April 1998) for the proposition that a court may be entitled to draw adverse inferences from the absence and/or silence of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in the action.  If the court is willing to do so, such inferences may go to strengthen the evidence adduced by the other party or to weaken the evidence adduced by the party who might reasonably have been expected to call the witness.  There must, however, be some evidence, however weak, adduced by the other party on the matter in question before the court is entitled to draw the desired inference.  In other words, there must be a case to answer.  The court must, however, consider the reason advanced for the absence of the witness.  If the court is satisfied as to that explanation, no adverse inference can be drawn.  If something short of a full explanation is given but there is an explanation, even if not wholly satisfactory, the potential detrimental effect of the absence or silence may be reduced or nullified.  Mr Scott QC, who appears for Sarla submits to me that there is a satisfactory explanation for her absence.  </p>

He argues that all he needs to show is that Sarla and Ahuti hold the shares either on trust or as nominee for Ashish.

The bare trustee is purely passive and &#8220;bare&#8221; or naked of active duties decreed by the settlor/transferor.  Mr Pointer points to a number of instances of this family admitting/asserting that individuals or entities hold assets as nominee/bare trustee for the true owner but, in any event, he says that, if he needs to show sham, this is a sham.  </p>

Jagdish started a women&#8217;s fashionwear business, again initially run from market stalls.  The lure of Africa, however, proved strong.  In 1993, the family returned to Rwanda and set up a small trading business, getting their stock from Dubai.  It appears to have been very successful but, tragically, within months, the Rwandan genocide took place in 1994.  I have no doubt that this period was extremely traumatic for everyone involved.  They managed to escape but at a heavy cost both emotionally and financially.  For the second time, the family lost everything.  They moved to Kenya and then Uganda. Bravely, Jagdish commenced a business supplying fuel to Rwanda before starting a retail business in Uganda buying local goods and selling them through Exim (U) Ltd.  Soon, the business started to import goods from Dubai.</p>

In particular, he was importing and selling computers, including one to his Headmaster.  The family, with some reservations, agreed to set him up in business and the sum of $5,000 was provided as seed-corn capital from various sources.  In 1996, he founded his first company, an IT business in Uganda called RAPS (U) Ltd.  The initials were those of various family members, namely Rona, Ahuti, Prateen (his birth name) and Sarla.  A number of other companies were later formed, including Riley Packaging (U) Ltd, which manufactured cardboard boxes.  Although they started in a small way, the businesses grew rapidly to become a very successful African based conglomerate.</p>

These were Riley Packaging, owned as to 25% by Ashish and 25% by Jagdish and RAPS Uganda Ltd (the sale of technology and related products).  There is no doubt that Jagdish&#8217;s business, Exim did not go into Mara.  Ahuti&#8217;s interests in Trio and Computerworld did not go in either.  It does equally appear that Ashish&#8217;s 49% interest in RAPS Middle East, an administrative business, also did not go in.  It is unclear what happened to three other businesses, namely Kensington Real Estate LLC (a real estate brokerage in Dubai), Kensington Africa (Uganda) and Kensington Global Investors Ltd.  One possibility, not canvassed in argument, is that any business established in Dubai as an LLC could not go into the new structure due to the need for a local 51% shareholder.  In any event, it is clear that Ashish&#8217;s two main businesses did go in and nothing else went in initially.  Moreover, his subsequent entrepreneurial activity was undoubtedly conducted via Mara in its broadest sense.  I was shown an organogram showing the up to date position.  The structure is exceptionally complicated with around sixty different entities.  There are numerous different levels of company split between holding companies and subsidiaries.   </p>

Inspire Corporation SA was set up through the vehicle of the RBH Foundation as a holding company with bearer shares.  However, the Respondent understands that Ahuti Chug&#8217;s husband required her to stop being a shareholder because his own business was in financial difficulty.  The Respondent&#8217;s father, Jagdish Thakkar agreed to stand as a shareholder in place of Ahuti Chug.  However, the Respondent&#8217;s father also wanted there to be an additional younger shareholder because of his and Sarla Thakkar&#8217;s ages.  The Respondent&#8217;s father wanted the Respondent to hold the bearer shares on the basis that Ahuti was beneficially entitled to them.  There is no documentation in relation to this as it was a family arrangement.  On 25 July 2012, Ahuti Chug&#8217;s husband died suddenly and unexpectedly.  Thereafter, along with the Respondent&#8217;s mother, Ahuti transferred the assets of Inspire Corporation SA to the newly formed Inspire Holdings Group Limited.  The Respondent does not have and never has had any legal or beneficial interest in Inspire Holdings Group Limited and is not a director and never has been.&#8221;</span></p>

She said that this arrangement was hidden from the family lawyer, Nitin Saujani, because she was worried about confidentiality as they had a number of mutual friends.  She added that Mara originated from various businesses started by Sarla and Jagdish and, in 2008, they sought to transfer part of their beneficial interests to the younger generation.

He did, however, indicate that he was prepared for Mara to be treated, for this litigation alone, as being a resource available to him to the extent of one-fifth.

She refers to the birth of her daughter on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 1998, so she is now aged 18.  Ahuti says she moved to Dubai in May 2000 and withdrew from business at any visible level due to pressure from her husband.

After the death of her husband in 2012, her interest did not have to be secret.  By giving the shares to her and her mother, Sarla, &#8220;the old guard&#8221; and &#8220;the next generation&#8221; were both represented.  Her father, Jagdish and Ashish did not have an interest although they regarded the business as being &#8220;for the family as a whole&#8221;.  She and Sarla were chosen as they were regarded as safe investors whereas Jagdish and Ashish were risk takers.  The current structure, therefore, maintained the equilibrium.  Ahuti did not return full-time operationally to Mara until November 2014.  Ashish remains the front man but all decisions are taken jointly with Jagdish and Sarla as the ultimate decision makers and controllers.  She said that her mother would not file a statement nor attend court.  She is not in the best of health and finds the proceedings distasteful.</p>

Having said that, I am not sure this takes me any further in relation to determining who is the beneficial owner of Mara.

He is the entrepreneur and the money maker. I accept that this also means that he could lose money but that is an occupational hazard for such businesses.  Without the risk of losing money, the businesses would never make money in the first place.  He was asked why Ahuti did not put her business into Inspire Panama.  He knew very well what Mr Pointer QC, for Meera was asking him but initially he did not answer referring to the property crash in Dubai not happening until after February 2008.  He then said that Inspire Panama was &#8220;more set up for future projects than existing ones&#8221;.    He was asked about putting two companies in Ahuti&#8217;s company Midas whilst her husband was still alive.  All he could say was that it was a temporary measure and they did feel it was risky. They did not get advice as to whether Ahuti&#8217;s husband&#8217;s creditors could enforce against Midas, which is very surprising if this was a genuine concern.  I asked why Mara&#8217;s interest in the two companies could not have been put in his name, as he had originally had shares in Mara Investment Partners Ltd.

He was asked about the 11% of the shares in Mara Online that were in his name but held beneficially for his cousin.  He told me about various conflicts of interest.

He then said it was his mistake.  <span style="font-weight:bold"/>He was then taken to the Minutes of the same Board on 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012 which used identical wording as to this aspect.

Whilst she gave her evidence in a dignified and calm manner, she certainly did not come over as a leading player in Mara in the way that her brother had.  She told me she knew she had an interest in RBH but they did not discuss percentages.  She said things were very fluid.  She later said she knew there were three parts and Ashish was holding her part.  She accepted that, for a time in 2012, she held shares in two companies for Ashish via her structure Midas, even though her husband was still alive. She said that Midas was a new company and she did it as it was advantageous to the family.  She was asked about what else Midas held.  She told me it had a couple of real estate investments in the United Kingdom but, when it was put to her that these were vulnerable to her husband&#8217;s creditors, she told me she was not sure when the investments took place although she later said she thought they were in 2012 to 2013 but she did not remember the dates.  I find this evidence surprising as she must have known whether they were before or after the death of her husband.   </p>

She then said that the shares in Mara BVI were split between the two households but were not held for Ashish.  The family discussed the structure after her husband&#8217;s burial ritual at the end of August/beginning of September.  She postulated that the family may have been more generous to her &#8220;knowing her situation&#8221;, which I assume referred to her husband&#8217;s death and her responsibility for her daughter.  </p>

He answered numerous questions on the basis that he could not recall or he did not know.  It is extremely odd that he was not able to answer so many questions if he genuinely is the patriarch of this family and the active Chairman of Mara, as has been presented to me.  I initially had difficulty in deciding whether he was deliberately refusing to answer, was so nervous that he could not answer (as suggested by Mr Scott QC for Ahuti and Sarla), genuinely unable to remember or very uncomfortable at having to lie.  I do not find that he was so nervous that he was unable to answer as he did answer some questions.  It follows that, either he was lying to me or he is certainly not a fully participating Chairman of Mara as suggested by the Respondents.  I will return to whether or not he was lying later in this judgment. </p>

Initially, he could not recall Ashish&#8217;s position in the Mara Group.  He did not recall if he was a director.  He said he did not interfere in his, Ashish&#8217;s business.  He then told me on numerous occasions that he could not recall pretty fundamental business details, including the ownership of Mara Global Technology.  He was taken to a print out of his loan account with Mara Group showing large sums of money being received from and going to RAPS Middle East LLC and Mara Global Technology LLC.  He was quite unable to provide any details about either company.  Mr Pointer suggested that RAPS Middle East LLC must be a Dubai company and therefore have a sponsor.  He accepted that would be the case but then could not name the sponsor. Earlier, he had been asked whether Ashish had any position in Mara.  He told me he did not know.  When pressed, he said he could not recall if Ashish was a director.  He was asked about Ashish&#8217;s income and he said he did not ask him and he did not &#8220;interfere in his business&#8221;.   </p>

It is very difficult to get any information.  Indeed, the Regulations were not produced into this litigation until the middle of 2016 by Swiss lawyers.  Mr Chamberlayne on behalf of Ashish accepted in his closing submissions that the whole purpose of a Foundation is to keep family arrangements private.  There was absolutely no reason to hide Ahuti&#8217;s interest if it was genuine.   Her husband&#8217;s creditors would never have found out.  I do not know whether or not there was any merit in the argument that the family solicitor, Mr Saujani should not know.  I did not have the benefit of hearing from him and solicitors are required to keep their clients&#8217; affairs confidential.  But, even if there was some genuine fear in that regard, Mr Saujani did not have to be the Protector and the information required to draft the Regulations could have been given direct to those administering the Foundation in Switzerland.   </p>

But even if that is not correct, there is no doubt that Mara Investment Partners Ltd and Mara Africa Holdings were both put into Midas whilst her husband was still alive.  This shows that it was untrue to say that it would be &#8220;financial suicide&#8221; for her to have an interest in Mara Panama via the Foundation.  It is no wonder she distanced herself from that statement at the commencement of her oral evidence but it was, of course, too late. Ashish and she had no concern about putting assets into companies she owned so they certainly would not have had reservations about her having an interest in Mara Panama via the Foundation.  To say that the assets were placed in Midas only for a short period really does not answer the point at all.</p>

Initially, there was no reference at all to this arrangement either in the Form E or the first answers to questionnaire.  There was just a bland assertion that Ashish had never had a legal or beneficial interest in Mara Group Holdings Ltd.  Ashish&#8217;s third replies were thoroughly misleading in numerous respects. The Foundation was not set up by Sarla and Ahuti as claimed.  Ahuti&#8217;s husband cannot have required her to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">stop being a shareholder</span>&#8221; because she never had been.  Although the reply then said that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the Respondent&#8217;s father, Jagdish agreed to stand as a shareholder in place of Ahuti Chug,&#8221; </span>it is the family&#8217;s case that Jagdish was a beneficiary in his own right so it is impossible to see how he could ever have stood as a shareholder for her.  It is right that the explanation then goes on to say that Jagdish &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">wanted there to be an additional younger shareholder because of his and Sarla Thakkar&#8217;s ages.  The Respondent&#8217;s father wanted the Respondent to hold the bearer shares on the basis Ahuti was beneficially entitled to them</span>&#8221; but I reject that statement as being palpably untrue.

I can see how she might have been subject to pressure from creditors but I cannot see how her having a share in a business via a Foundation can have worsened the situation.  I consider she would have been just as susceptible to pressure if she had a very significant interest in the Mara Group held for her by her brother as she would have been if it was held for her direct in the Panamanian structure.  Moreover, if it is indirect pressure from creditors of which she was concerned, I do not see why it would automatically end on her husband&#8217;s death. </p>

I regret to say that I consider the whole thing to be palpable nonsense and simply manufactured for this case to attempt to explain why Ashish was listed as a first beneficiary in the Regulations.  It follows that I find I have been repeatedly lied to by all three Respondent Thakkar witnesses, which has extremely serious consequences for the rest of their evidence. I had been even told in the written documentation that Sarla and Jagdish are the ultimate decision makers and controllers of Mara when this was demonstrably false even before Jagdish&#8217;s evidence.  I find that these falsehoods explain Jagdish&#8217;s dreadful presentation as a witness.  He was simply uncomfortable lying.  Turning to Sarla, I recognise that she is not in the best of health but I accept Mr Pointer&#8217;s submission that she could have filed a statement and then applied for it to be admitted pursuant to the Civil Evidence Act. Alternatively, she could have given evidence from Dubai.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that she did not attend as she was not prepared to lie to this court.  That is to her credit although it is not to her credit that she has still instructed her lawyers to fight this case on the basis that the interest was held for Ahuti.   </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I now turn to my findings as to what was the actual position whilst the shares were held in the Panamanian Structure.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that the first set of regulations was never properly executed by the Foundation Council.  I find that the completed document would have emerged if there had been one.  In one sense, this shows just how lax procedures were in relation to such offshore structures at the time. It also shows that caution has to be exercised before placing too much reliance on those documents that do exist.  It is abundantly clear that it did not bother Ashish or anyone else that there were no regulations.  I am satisfied that this is because he is equally lax about the structures that he uses.  I need only give two examples.  He was more than happy for Ahuti&#8217;s company Midas to hold Mara Investment Partners Ltd and Mara Africa Holdings Ltd in the summer of 2012 even though nobody was suggesting that Midas (or Ahuti) took the beneficial interest in these companies.  He was happy to hold shares in Mara Online for his cousin.  I am satisfied that this is because there is a very high level of trust between the various family members so they know they are safe doing things in this way.  I have never been able to understand exactly why there is such a desire to distance oneself from ownership of assets but I find it clearly exists in this family.  It may in part be tax related.  It may in part be fear of creditors.  It may be a precaution against future divorce proceedings. It may be a combination of all three and other concerns, genuine or otherwise.  It undoubtedly exists however and is abundantly evident in this case.</p>

It is quite clear that both Jagdish and Sarla would defer entirely to Ashish.  If Ashish said that he wanted all the shares transferred to him, that is what would have happened.   There were no Regulations but, even if there had been, they could be changed at the drop of a hat, as happened in 2012.

The clearest guide to the true underlying picture is to be found in what would happen on the death of the last survivor of the first beneficiaries.  If Ashish had not changed the structure by then, it was not Ahuti or Rona or their families who would benefit.  It was Ashish&#8217;s family.  The draft includes as the first named &#8220;second beneficiary&#8221; his wife as to 50%.  The other 50% was for his children, not Rona or Ahuti&#8217;s children.  At the time of this draft, Ashish was engaged but not married.  He did not have children.

The Foundation&#8217;s Council had absolutely no problem in agreeing them.  This is the way such structures run.  The only substantive changes relate to the second beneficiaries, effectively after Ashish&#8217;s death.  This time, Meera is named as a beneficiary as to 25% of the income as well as maintenance of living standards, housing and living expenses.  Ashish&#8217;s children are to be entitled to 50% of the foundation&#8217;s assets and interest.  So 75% is for Ashish&#8217;s side of the family.  Rona and Ahuti are to be entitled to 12.5% of the foundation&#8217;s assets as well as maintenance of living standards, housing and living expenses that may occur.  </p>

He could have given assets to his sisters or to his parents but he would decide.  It would be tempting for a judge to say that the 12.5% interests in favour of Rona and Ahuti indicate that 25% of this Foundation was held for them but I consider that would not be right.  I have formed a clear view that these Regulations were, in effect, Ashish&#8217;s will.  It was what was to happen to his assets after his death.  Until then, he would do as he pleased.  After his death, his wife would get 25%; his children 50% and his sisters 12.5% each.  Like a will, it could always be changed but it was for him to decide.  The Foundation was held for him as the true beneficial owner.  He had created the assets.  He had placed them in this Foundation.  He directed operations and told the world, rightly, that it was all his.  I so find. In doing so, I reject the written evidence of the Respondents that it was initially Jagdish and Sarla&#8217;s assets that went into Mara.  It was not.  The assets were Ashish&#8217;s assets. </p>

Ashish did not wish to divest himself of the beneficial ownership of this business in 2012 to his mother and sister.  He merely wanted to deal with the KYC issues.  Mara went on exactly as before.  He has not been running this business for the sole benefit of his mother and sister.  That was a blatant lie.  He has been doing it for himself.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I therefore find that this was a nominee or bare trust situation.  I have already noted that such a structure was not new to this family.  Indeed, the Respondent Thakkars&#8217; tried to convince me that the previous arrangement with the Foundation was exactly this in reverse.  It does not lie in their mouth to argue that it was the position up until 2012 but it cannot possibly be the position since then.  The legal title changed but the beneficial interests remain the same. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">If I needed any support for the proposition that Sarla and Ahuti hold the shares as nominees/bare trustees, I find it in Jagdish and Ahuti&#8217;s own evidence.  Both said that the shares were split &#8220;between the two households&#8221; meaning one half for Ahuti and her daughter whilst the other half was for Sarla, Jagdish and Ashish.  Mr Pointer asked Ahuti if she was saying that was one-half for the two separate parts of the family and she said that was correct.  She added that her half would be for her and her daughter.  The other half would be for her mother and father. She was asked if this included Ashish and she said that would depend on her mother.  I do not want to be unfair to her but she was essentially confirming this was a trust arrangement, just a different one to the one alleged by Meera.  I reject Ahuti and Jagdish&#8217;s evidence as to this but I find that, in reality, they do not remotely think that the legal title is the end of the matter.  </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I reject the suggestion that I have to find that this was a sham to reach this conclusion.    There are numerous examples of an individual or entity holding an asset as nominee or on trust for another without it being a sham.  If that was the case, the arrangement by which Ashish holds shares in Mara Online for his cousin would be a sham and that is clearly not the case.  I have made it clear that I accept entirely that the Foundation structure was not a sham, yet it held the assets for Ashish.  The same is true of this second structure.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Scott says that it is different because there was a declaration to the BVI authorities that the beneficial interests lay with Sarla and Ahuti.  He points to the affidavit sworn by the Managing Director of Trident, Mr Goodman in the BVI confirming his understanding that the beneficial owners were Sarla and Ahuti.  In this regard, I remind myself that, although I have not heard from Sarla, I am dealing with a witness, Ahuti who I have disbelieved on her oath.  I am quite satisfied that, in so far as Sarla and Ahuti told Mr Goodman that they were the beneficial owners and allowed him to complete forms to that effect, they were not being frank with him just as they have not been frank with me.  However, I am equally satisfied that, if it was necessary for me to so find, the document submitted to the BVI authorities satisfies the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Snook</span> test for sham.  The declaration to the BVI authorities was a document that gave the appearance of creating a beneficial entitlement which was different from the actual beneficial entitlement.   </p>
