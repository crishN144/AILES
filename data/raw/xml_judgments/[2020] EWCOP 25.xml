He states that the diagnosis of senile dementia was made in September 2015 by the local Memory Clinic.  He assessed OT on 26/3/2019 when &#8220;she had no understanding of her poor physical and mental health and I made an immediate referral to Social Services&#8221;. </p>

KKL was itself incorporated in 1948 and provides services focussed on will writing, executorship and lasting powers of attorney as well as a pastoral service which includes home visits and help with making personal arrangements for care either directly or by referral to its network of contacts. </p>

There appears to have been conflict between GY and KKL, with each accusing the other of financial abuse of OT.  It is common ground that there are suspicious transactions amounting to in excess of &#163;40,000 on OT&#8217;s bank statements and the suggestion that these transactions are evidence of financial exploitation of OT by a former carer (it is unclear to me whether this is alleged to be GY herself or someone else).  I am told that the police investigation into earlier possible abuses has been closed.  It appears that a referral was made by the police to Trading Standards in respect of KKL but I do not know what, if anything came out of that investigation. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is fair to reflect, therefore, that the background context is one in which both GY and the Social Worker had expressed suspicion of KKL&#8217;s motives and surprise at what was felt to be persistent attempts to access OT when she was vulnerable and apparently incapacitous &#8211; in particular with a view to obtaining from her authority under a Power of Attorney.  This suspicion was not unreasonable in the sense that neither the neighbour nor the Social Worker was aware of the history of involvement by OT with KKL whilst capacitous - involvement which is demonstrated by the making of three successive Wills appointing KKL as executors.  The first of these Wills goes back to 2005, some 10 years before OT&#8217;s diagnosis of senile dementia.  Secondly they were likely unaware of KKL&#8217;s pastoral aims and the way in which these aims had been delivered in respect of NE and OT over some years and thirdly they might rightly consider any attempt to persuade OT to enter into a power of attorney misplaced at the time.  It was with this background together with the other matters that SAH sets out in her statement at paragraph 12 that prompted the referral to Ms Harrison.   </p>

Appreciating some licence for advocacy given that this is taken from Counsel&#8217;s skeleton argument this is nevertheless (literally) factually wrong (this element of the order is printed in exactly the same uppercase print as the other orders sought in the application) and reflects standard wording within the templates produced by the Court of Protection.  It is perhaps right to say, however, that where the deputy is a partner in the solicitors&#8217; firm whose fees stand to be agreed it might be wise for them to agree either to stay within the fixed regime or to have an assessment or, if appropriate, for the court to restrict the licence to agree costs in a similar way. </p>

He referred me to just one page of that bundle which was a position statement filed on behalf of his own client in which there is an account of a meeting between KKL and Ms Harrison in which KKL were handed a copy of Claire Louise King&#8217;s statement dated 27 August 2019 which they had not previously seen &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">She [i.e. Ms Harrison] realised that this has disadvantaged KKL.  This added to the already tight deadline as KKL received notice from the court of next Wednesday&#8217;s hearing with a copy of Judge Bell&#8217;s order in the DX only on 19 November.  We therefore asked the Respondent on 21 November to join KKL in a joint application for an adjournment of next Wednesday&#8217;s hearing but this was rejected with the Respondent claiming it was unlikely to succeed</span>.&#8221;  I do not consider this to be evidence of aggression and I am surprised that it was cited to me in support of this contention. </p>

It is argued on behalf of KKL that considerable weight should be given to this factor as it is evidence of OT&#8217;s trust in KKL to manage her affairs after her death.   That trust was not just expressed once but on two further occasions when the will was adjusted.   KKL points to authorities in which the appointment of a family member as executor is taken to be evidence of the trust the testator had in that person.  I agree that ordinarily this would be a matter of significance and one which would ordinarily weigh in favour of the person so chosen. </p>

Three were acting in the same roles for both organisations in 2016 and where other roles had changed the predecessors had acted as trustees for JNF and KKL at the same time.  One person had been appointed as a trustee of JNF and a director of KKL on the same day in April 2017.  The regulator comments that this is &#8220;striking given that the two organisations are separate legal entities.&#8221;  They add &#8220;Finally, we note that JNF have engaged with us on behalf of KKL when we asked them to provide information to assist our investigation.&#8221;  Pausing there, it is submitted by Ms Sarah Harrison that the same confusion has arisen in these proceedings where KKL and JNF have been used almost interchangeably.

The evidence of the <span style="font-weight:bold">pastoral</span> relationship between KKL and OT is contained to an extent in her statement and in the statement of DG dated 17 January 2020.  He first visited OT in 2013.  Exhibited to his statement is evidence of either visits or conversations in April 2013, August 2015 (when OT seems to have confused KKL with her Housing Association) and March and April 2019 (leading to this application in May 2019).  It appears that in addition to this KKL sends birthday cards to its clients.  Exhibited to CA&#8217;s statement is evidence of advice being given in relation to the burial plot together with a visit to the sisters in January 2018. </p>

In engaging with OT about Jewish festivals or bringing her gifts of traditional food I fully accept from the evidence that the staff of KKL have brought OT pleasure on their visits.   I cannot imagine why such interactions between KKL and its clients and generous benefactors to JNF UK would not be pleasant and warm but I have struggled to reconcile the <span style="font-weight:bold">evidence</span> with the submission made on KKL&#8217;s behalf that they had a &#8220;close relationship&#8221; with OT or that &#8220;many pastoral visits&#8221; had been undertaken over the years&#8221; let alone the &#8220;warm and friendly relationship that existed between OT and CA and DG, and how much she valued and enjoyed their visits to her&#8221;. </p>

This is relevant to her values, and to her wishes for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1975/63" uk:canonical="1975 c. 63" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> but the evidence simply does not allow me to accept the submission that they should be treated &#8211; in particular where there is clearly potential for a conflict of interest as I have found &#8211; as if they are family or close friends of OT.   </p>

The difficulty with preferring KKL to Ms Harrison on this basis is their lack of independence from JNF UK.  A solicitor or accountant who knows their client well from years of managing their personal affairs is clearly an appropriate deputy but would be expected to maintain independence.  It would be unthinkable and a clear breach of their code of conduct to facilitate the writing of a Will or to act as deputy or executor of a Will under which they stood to gain. </p>

In particular, in respect of the latest Will I have no evidence either way in relation to how KKL satisfied themselves of OT&#8217;s capacity in the light of her diagnosis by then of at least 2 years standing let alone any contemporaneous evidence to show how KKL sought to protect OT, themselves or JNF UK from any potential conflict of interest.   </p>

It is a fact that this would be their first deputyship although I am told that they hold Powers of Attorney for many people.  I <span style="font-weight:bold">have</span> discerned some inexperience in their approach to these proceedings including their failure to comply with PD9B in relation to the notification of other people who have an interest and their misconceived views on elements of Ms Harrison&#8217;s application in relation to costs.  Their evidence in relation to moving OT to a Jewish care home does not disclose an understanding of the collaborative approach which would have to be taken to such a decision.  Ms Harrison on the other hand is an experienced Court of Protection practitioner who although also inexperienced in acting as a deputy herself is a member of a team acting in over 70 deputyships. </p>

Nothing in Mr Arkush&#8217;s submissions addressed those points to my satisfaction.  The undertaking offered was certainly not enough to reassure me that OT&#8217;s interests could be adequately protected if KKL were appointed as OT&#8217;s deputy.  On the other hand by requiring an assessment of Ms Harrison&#8217;s costs if they exceed the fixed rate regime I can mitigate or even eliminate any concern arising from her relations with Clarion solicitors in respect of this application. </p>
