This case, like the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Liverpool </span><span style="font-size:14pt">case, concerns an application which has been made to the Court of Protection in relation to a young adult, P, who is now aged just 20.

It is an articulate and eloquent document, which sets out very clearly their view and case that arrangements should be made, and funded, so that P can live at home with his family.  </span></p>

When the question is reformulated in that way, which is all that resolution of this case requires, I answer it &#8220;no&#8221;.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">At the outset of, and during the first part of, the present hearing, the Secretary of State for Education and her counsel, Miss Joanne Clement, strongly submitted that I had been wrong to reach that reason, and that the Children&#8217;s Homes Regulations 2001 SI [2001] No. 3967, and in particular regulation 17A, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">do</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> apply to the case of a person who is accommodated in a children&#8217;s home even if the person concerned is no longer a child.  Although there is no provision in the Interpretation Regulation (regulation 2) to extend the words &#8220;child&#8221; or &#8220;children&#8221; beyond their normal meaning in the law, namely a person under the age of 18, Miss Clement contended that, wherever the words &#8220;child&#8221; or &#8220;children&#8221; appear in those regulations (and they pervade them), they must, in fact, mean any person, whether child or adult, who is accommodated in a children&#8217;s home.  She submitted that there is what she called &#8220;a presumption against absurdity&#8221; and that it would be absurd if the protection afforded by the regulations ceased at the moment a person, who was, in fact, being accommodated in a children&#8217;s home, attained the age of 18.</span></p>

There are many powers, duties and responsibilities which, in practical terms, are no less needed for the protection of a person aged 18 plus one day than for the protection of  a person aged 18 less one day; but the fact is that in many instances the law does draw a very sharp line at the moment of attaining the age of 18.  The impact of that line could often, as in the present situation, be characterised as arbitrary, but not, I think, as absurd.  If an instrument, including a regulation, employs the words &#8220;child&#8221; or &#8220;children&#8221; without any express definition, then, in my view, it would require a very clear necessary implication before the word could be held to include also someone who is an adult.  </span></p>

She did so, because it is clear from section 22 of the Care Standards Act 2001, pursuant to which the regulations were made, that the power to make regulations, itself, draws a distinction between children and adults.</span></p>

The recital does not refer to exercise of the power conferred by section 22(5)(b).  That omission must patently have been deliberate.  In other words, when making the regulations in 2001, the Secretary of State deliberately did not make provision as to the control and restraint of adults, which would have been pursuant to section 22(5)(b).  </span></p>

If the Secretary of State now considers that the ambit and protection of the regulations should be extended to include an adult, she already has power under section 22, including section 22(5)(b), to lay amending regulations before Parliament to that effect.  In view of the concession that I have just described, they would be amending regulations, not merely regulations made &#8220;for the avoidance of doubt&#8221;, as earlier suggested in paragraph 53(1) of Miss Clement&#8217;s skeleton argument dated 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2014 for this hearing. </span></p>

The focus in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Liverpool</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> case was entirely upon the impact of that regulation.   In the present case, however, as the issue formulated by District Judge Bellamy indicates, reference has been made also to the National Minimum Standards for Children&#8217;s Homes issued by the Department of Education in April 2011 (&#8220;NMS&#8221;).  The NMS did not feature at all in the argument in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Liverpool</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> case, except for the references in the email from Mr Kevin Brooks of the Treasury Solicitor, which I quoted at paragraph 18 of my judgment in that case.  In the present case, however, the Secretary of State for Education and Miss Clement have placed heavy emphasis on them.  The NMS are published pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14" uk:canonical="2000 c. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Care Standards Act 2000</ref>, and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23</ref> (1A) provides that the standards &#8220;... may, in particular, explain or supplement requirements imposed in relation to an establishment or agency by regulations under section 22.&#8221;   By <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/14/section/23/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(4)</ref>, the standards shall be taken into account in the making of decisions by the registration authority; and the wide and potentially severe ambit of such decisions is clear from sections 20, 20A and 22B.  </span></p>

There is nothing in either the legislation, or the regulations, or the NMS which has the effect that a children&#8217;s home, which is not an approved secure children&#8217;s home, is &#8220;unable&#8221; to deprive a person of his liberty.  To the contrary, regulation 17A contemplates that, when there is no alternative method of preventing injury to any person (including the person who is restrained) or serious damage to the property of any person, restraint may be used, provided it is proportionate and no more force than is necessary is used.  </span></p>

Such restraint may involve a deprivation of liberty as now understood and, in my view, the unqualified proposition in paragraph 4 of the guidance that there is no purpose to be served in seeking an order of the Court of Protection goes too far.  So, accordingly, does the proposition in paragraph 6 and the summary in paragraph 13 of the guidance.  In my view, there can indeed be circumstances in which the Court of Protection may authorise a children&#8217;s home or residential special school to impose restraint which amounts to a deprivation of liberty, and the guidance is mistaken in suggesting that the effect of the NMS is necessarily to prevent the court from doing so.</span></p>
