MQ appeared and immediately helped me to make a plan of action, moved into the house and, within less than a year, she and her brothers, who have building experience, had transformed it. Soon after that, I moved in with her and vacated Property B, which was the house I had been living in with P for the previous three years or so.</span></p>

This I bought for her last year. I consented to spend no more than </span><span class="st" style="font-size:12pt">&#8364;100,000.

She had a bad temper and this was occasionally directed at me, as it was to the rest of her family. Her temper has improved a great deal over the last year or so. She is certainly a forceful and assertive woman. Whether she bullies me or not is a matter of opinion. She does it caringly though and has never used physical violence of any kind.</span></p>

There has never been any suggestion or expectation of marriage on her part, while P lives. In my email, I said that, if a civil partnership with MQ had been mentioned, it was merely because she needed a passport. Without a passport she is severely inconvenienced living in Spain and I naturally wanted to help her. She has always known it would not happen during P&#8217;s lifetime because while P is alive I am already married.</span></p>

But that was a long time ago and since then there has been a theft of money and broken promises. Remember, after being thirty years with one person, I was unprepared for someone new in this department and was briefly taken in. I would say I have learned my lesson in such matters now and am much less innocent. I would never be taken in this way again.&#8221;</span></p>

We are all on the same side. I have been open and honest in all my dealings with everyone concerned. I wish to continue to do this but also wish to continue to be involved in my wife&#8217;s affairs. I have devoted nearly 35 years of my life to her and for her relations to gang up against me like this is shocking and outrageous. For her family to seek to exclude me is upsetting. I therefore ask the Court of Protection to prevent this from taking place and instead to propose a situation where we share responsibility, for instance her sister taking responsibility for her accounts in England. I am happy to discuss any decisions that need to be made for my wife fully with her daughter and sisters to ensure all of their wishes are taken into account.&#8221;</span></p>
