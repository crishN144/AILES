	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The central issue in this case is whether P has capacity to make decisions about her care and contact with others. There is no issue that P suffered significant trauma in her early life within her family and, possibly, later involving others. The consequences of this on her mental and psychological health have been significant. She has at times been detained under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (MHA) and has had extended periods in specialist placements. More recently she has been living in her own home, with care and support provided or arranged by the local authority and the Integrated Care Board (ICB) in accordance with MHA.</p>

At the start of this hearing P made an application to discharge the Official Solicitor as her litigation friend as the expert, Dr Camden-Smith, had concluded that P had litigation capacity to conduct these proceedings, save when she dissociates. P&#8217;s solicitor and Ms Butler-Cole KC considered P did have litigation capacity. As a result, I discharged the Official Solicitor as P&#8217;s litigation friend. P attended the hearing with support and remained in court for most of the hearing.</p>

She remained in the care of her mother and was removed from her care before she was a teenager. P went to a residential school for girls. After leaving school she had specialist support for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). In her mid-twenties she was admitted to a therapeutic community for people diagnosed with a personality disorder. During her time there P reports being groomed to take part in a sexual relationship with a male staff member. In her twenties P was able to secure a job but continued to self-harm and had a number of hospital admissions when her diagnosis was Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) (now known as Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, EUPD). P made attempts to take her own life.</p>

ZX initially said the account of her family history in the s49 report would have come from P although recognised that later in the report it was said P had no or limited memory of her childhood, so he agreed the history could have come from other reports which are not listed.</p>

ZX said whilst these risks were connected with DID they are also a result of P&#8217;s childhood trauma. When asked about the risks of physical or sexual abuse and the evidential foundation for that he said P&#8217;s different identities had reported different abusive experiences in relation to the family and others, he said he did not know who makes up these groups although there is some consistency of stories related to Y religion. He considered there was nothing to suggest this was fictitious or not a current concern and had featured in what he described as his recent contact with two of P&#8217;s other identities when they talked of the WiFi being switched off and the front door being left open. In his view some of P&#8217;s identities have been trained to do certain things.

However, in therapy [P&#8217;s] altered identities have demonstrated a level of consistency in what they are reporting in respect of alleged current abuse, which leads us to believe third-party abuse is likely to be orientated to the present rather than the past. As noted in the s49 report, on many occasions medical examinations have not been provided or permitted and so an opinion on the possible causes of injuries may not be able to be determined in all cases&#8217;.</span> ZX said that in his experience P is able to make the distinction between what happened in the past and the present. He said P&#8217;s identities describe the abuse happening now but give no more details in terms of location. He recognised P could be reliving the past but did not think so due to the way the past and present is distinguished. ZX said he had recently been given a leaflet by P and was going to pass that on as it raised safeguarding issues. ZX agreed P is not in a position to know the full extent of what is being alleged by her other parts, so that makes it hard for P to weigh that up. In answer to Ms Butler-Cole KC, ZX agreed that P was not aware of any current abuse risk until psychotherapy started and that treatment is being provided to P on the basis that there is a group there intent on causing P harm. He agreed P finds it difficult if she considers she is not being believed. In  particular, as a psychotherapist he believes what P reports but the public bodies may consider something has not been established. He agreed with Ms Butler-Cole that whether the abuse group is real or not there are times when P feels unsafe, P reports that and requests more support.</p>

Ms S considers one of the reasons why care packages have broken down is that P feels the care workers are not doing what they are required to do, she will send the care workers to the kitchen for long periods which causes difficulties for them both. Ms S acknowledged there are real difficulties in providing overnight care due to the conditions put down by P about how the care workers should behave (not go to the toilet, not make a drink etc). Ms S considers there is a lack of awareness by P of how her behaviour impacts on the carers. Ms S agreed there was a tension between what the local authority can provide and what P wants. Ms S would welcome more active participation by the mental health team.</p>

Ms S agreed the reduction had not been implemented, the plan is to do so over the next 8 weeks and agreed it would have flexibility to provide periods of 24 hour care if the need arose, in consultation with the ICB. Ms S said she considered the local authority role under the Care Act is to build peoples strengths to be as independent as possible and to build up autonomy. Ms S agreed there was no assessment under s 117 MHA to reduce P being re-admitted to hospital and agreed that needs to be done, she hopes with more involvement of the mental health services.</p>

The periods of loss of capacity are concrete, discrete, easily identified and follow a predictable pattern. Therefore it would be eminently workable for a care plan to be in place in which support workers simply ask P &#8216;Is [J] present&#8217; and then follow a care plan for when she isn&#8217;t. There may well be periods in which this doesn&#8217;t work or in which [J] herself still acts in a way that may be risky or unwise, however, [P] is willing to accept this level of risk in balance for the increased quality of life (and therefore recovery) that independence will give her.&#8217;</span> Dr Camden-Smith felt that contact with others could be dealt with in the same way.</p>

There is currently no evidence that [P] is placing herself at risk online other than by potentially contacting the abuse organisation. In so far as she is contacting the abuse organisation, it is not known how she is doing this, as scrutiny of her phone by carers and therapists has not found evidence of this (although it is thought likely that it is happening)&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her written response to further questions Dr Camden-Smith said she was not aware of any case law or guidance as to how to assess capacity in someone with DID. She said her approach was a pragmatic one in which she considers Z to be the primary identity and therefore any decisions taken by identities other than Z are taken when Z is not consciously present. <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;If [Z] is not consciously present, then she cannot be said to have capacity at that material time, irrespective of the identity and knowledge of any of the other identities. Thus, the approach I have taken is that only [Z] can have capacity, and therefore any assessment of capacity can only be undertaken with [Z].&#8217;</span> A little later she states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;[Z] has lived with the consequences of trauma and dissociation her whole adult life, she is aware there are risks when in an dissociated state and that the biggest risks are that of self-harm and potential death and abuse by others&#8230;the analogy I have used is of someone in alcoholic blackouts &#8211; they cannot remember what happened at the time of the blackout, but they are aware of the consequences&#8230;in my opinion it is not necessary to know the details of what happened during that period, it is sufficient to know what led to the period of lack of awareness and what the consequences were or may be. So someone with alcoholic blackouts would not have capacity at the time of being intoxicated, but would potentially have capacity when sober to make decisions about, for example, using alcohol.&#8217;</span> Dr Camden-Smith recognised the issue regarding capacity is a legal one but states <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;It is my opinion that [P&#8217;s] capacity fluctuates, however there is a counter argument that the periods of change of identity are frequent and unpredictable enough for it to be considered that she lacks capacity.&#8217;</span> She said she deferred to CDS regarding the DID diagnosis.</p>

Dr Camden-Smith has no doubt P is distressed, there are periods when she dissociates and she divides it between when P is Z and when she dissociates. P is the first person she has met with DID in over 20 years of practice. She said that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;mainstream psychiatrist thinking is it is part of dissociation attached to trauma part of PTSD&#8217;</span> and is highly sceptical of any claims as to how many people are said to have DID. She expressed concern that CDS is a charity with no outside input from a doctor, in her view what is lacking is psychiatric orthodoxy to ground some of the assertions. P is hugely vulnerable and Dr Camden-Smith does not believe there are other identities, she considers there is a dissociative state. Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s concerns is that DID is a self- perpetuating diagnosis; there is little benefit in getting better. P has had four years of therapy and CDS report six years lay ahead. Dr Camden-Smith knows that P is very aware of the scepticism regarding DID. What is required is a &#8216;critical friend&#8217; as CDS and the local authority are not equipped to discuss this with P. In her view it is plausible that some of what is being said is not real but P may still be abused. Dr Camden-Smith did not think P was lying.</p>

Dr Camden-Smith acknowledged  that it is difficult to know whether P is dissociating and accepted that they should not ask &#8216;Do I have Z present ?&#8217;. In her view Z is able to fully understand she puts herself at risk, it is not necessary to know the details. The question for a carer could be changed to &#8216;Are you dissociating?&#8217; which would be demonstrated by her inability to weigh information. She accepted that if it is frequent and unpredictable that may support a more longitudinal view regarding capacity.</p>

She agreed with Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s evidence that P&#8217;s presentation is more consistent with someone who has experienced severe trauma and has CPTSD and dissociation. Ms S said that the symptoms of hyperarousal and dissociation are more consistent with what she had observed in the past. Ms S continued in the email <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the description of hyperarousal would in my view fit with the behaviours that are present when [P] is involved with the care and the high levels of distress, frustration and dissatisfaction that is experienced by [P] when receiving care.&#8217;</span> She agreed with Dr Camden-Smith that when P dissociates, it is part of P and not another identity and that dissociation is not a linear state. Also, that P behaves in this way as a result of trauma and CPTSD. When P dissociates at home the records suggest she will go to her room and P does not pose a risk to herself during this time, on the contrary P reports this is useful to her. Ms S considers that on the infrequent and rare occasions when P puts herself at risk from harm related to going out or seeking out people and then having some form of physical and possible sexual injuries this would not constitute a lack of capacity on a longitudinal basis. Ms S considers, if required, the powers under s 5 MCA could be used to support P at times when staff are aware of that risk. Ms S went on that she did not consider anticipatory declarations would be workable as the carers cannot be expected to determine whether P has dissociated or, if she has, whether that means she necessarily lacks capacity.</p>

The mental health service involvement has been limited to an annual appointment with P&#8217;s clinical psychiatrist and no involvement from the mental health service in the regular ongoing meetings, other than by a case manager, who has no clinical responsibility. Mr Hallin submits this has put the local authority in an invidious position and that the key to unlocking greater stability is the greater involvement of the mental health team.</p>

The local authority accept the evidence of Dr Camden-Smith that P has capacity about care, support and contact with others and contend that the suggested possibility that she might in the future dissociate or suffer from such dysregulation so as to lose capacity does not prevent her from making decisions about her care, support and contact with others on a day to day basis, as she currently has capacity. The local authority do not accept Dr Camden-Smith&#8217;s evidence that when P dissociates she loses capacity. According to CDS P dissociates every day but not always loses capacity. They submit it would be virtually impossible to expect domiciliary care workers to be able to know when P has dissociated and input is required from orthodox mental health treating clinicians on the ground to assist as to diagnosis and care planning. The involvement of Dr A, the treating psychiatrist, appears to be no more than an annual review and there is no evidence that CDS have been providing ongoing evidence to Dr A.</p>

So, Ms Butler-Cole submits, the person concerned will have to wait until they lose capacity and the statutory body&#8217;s plans have been implemented against their capacitous wishes, and then somehow apply to the court.</p>

Whilst the local authority and ICB have joint duty under s117 MHA to provide after care services to P on the information this court has seen, which I acknowledge may not be the complete picture, there has been virtually no effective engagement by the Mental Health Trust and the CMHT.  There has been no clinical input from them for a number of years apart from an annual appointment with Dr A, which appears to lack any effective engagement with CDS or the work they are undertaking with P. For the last five years CDS have effectively been left to manage the situation with no external more orthodox mental health input, not even in the role of critical friend. Over this extended period there is no evidence of any effective engagement between CDS and the Mental Health Trust.  As far as the court is aware the Mental Health Trust are invited to all meetings concerning P but have attended none in any clinical capacity or demonstrated any effective knowledge or understanding of the decisions made in those meetings. The local authority have, in effect, been left shouldering the responsibility alone.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence establishes that the risks P has put herself at have decreased significantly in number, although the seriousness of the individual risk remains high. There have been three occasions in the last year when there is evidence that P has left her home during a period of dissociation and returned complaining of injuries to herself. When she is not dissociated P recognises the seriousness and significance of this risk and agrees there should be a crisis plan in place so steps can be taken to prevent her putting herself at such risk, such as to prevent tampering of the internet (so the Ring doorbell remains working) and of her being followed and/or prevented from leaving the property.</p>

In particular, at those times she is unable to properly weigh the relevant considerations, understand the significant risks and make decisions to keep herself safe which she recognises need to be made when she does not dissociate and has capacity.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in">I accept the submissions of Ms Butler-Cole and Mr Karim that there is jurisdiction under s15 MCA that enables the court, in principle, to make anticipatory declarations. Such declarations, if made, are not dependent on P lacking capacity at the time such a declaration is made as s15 (c ) refers to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;the lawfulness or otherwise of any act done, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">or yet to be done</span><span style="font-style:italic">, in relation to that person&#8217; </span>(emphasis added), clearly referring to a future event. The reference to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;that person&#8217; </span>is to a person whose capacity has been determined under s15(a) or (b), which includes a declaration as to whether a person has or lacks capacity to make the decisions referred to in s15 (a) and (b). So, a declaration under s15 (c) is not dependent on a declaration of present incapacity, as submitted by Mr Hallin, as both subsections (a) and (b) envisage positive declarations of capacity. The heading to Part 1 of the MCA is only a guide, at best, and there are other provisions in this part of the MCA which concern those with capacity (e.g. ss22 and 24 MCA).</p>

The court will need to carefully consider the underlying principles of the MCA which is to protect and, where appropriate, make decisions for those who lack capacity in relation to a matter, but take all necessary steps to preserve the autonomy of those who have capacity. In <span style="font-style:italic">The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust</span> Lieven J refused to make such a declaration as there was nothing more than a &#8216;small risk&#8217; that the woman might lose capacity which was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;insufficient&#8217;</span> to justify an anticipatory declaration, it risked the woman&#8217;s autonomy being overridden and there were other ways of managing the situation, such as inviting the woman to enter into an advanced declaration or relying on necessity.</p>

Dr Camden-Smith accepts that could be difficult and whilst her evidence that P lacks capacity when she dissociates has the superficial attraction of simplicity it would, in my judgment, be virtually impossible to work in practice. There is evidence that supports the position that on many occasions when P may be said to dissociate she would not be making relevant decisions and is able to manage the position by taking steps herself, such as going to her bedroom. There is reference in the evidence to looking at when she acts in an unusual way, in a heightened state of arousal or puts herself at risk, however that could cover a myriad of different situations and it is recognised would be difficult for domiciliary care workers to assess in circumstances where P&#8217;s Article 5 and 8 rights are affected.</p>

Using this framework will have the advantage that decisions are taken contemporaneously both as to capacity and best interests, having up to date information on matters such as P&#8217;s wishes and are more appropriate to guard against such infrequent occasions as in this case. I recognise that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s5</ref> and 6 may not have been intended to provide a complete catch all means by which carers can implement a care plan and are arguably more designed to provide protection from liability for carers to carry out certain but not all tasks, but on the particular and unusual facts of this case that legal framework better provides for P as it has the advantage of decisions being made contemporaneously, particularly where, as here, the risks being guarded against happen relatively infrequently so need to be considered in the context of an extended time frame. I fully take into account the submission that by making an anticipatory declaration it could provide more certainty for carers but there is nothing preventing the crisis plan including the same information, whether or not an anticipatory declaration is made, as, in effect, the carers or others are going to need to be making the same capacity assessment whether a declaration is made or not.</p>
