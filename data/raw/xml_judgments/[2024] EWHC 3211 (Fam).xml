HMCTS began digitalising divorce petitions in that year, and over the next few years it became the norm, first for the litigant in person, and then for solicitors to apply on the divorce portal for a divorce. When the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2020/11" uk:canonical="2020 c. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Divorce, Dissolution and Separation Act 2020</ref> (&#8220;DDSA 2020&#8221;)_was introduced on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> April 2022, all divorces were to be managed digitally which meant that nearly all individuals and solicitors applied using the online portal, and the tiny minority of people who sent in their applications by paper had their applications scanned onto the online system. Since April 2022, just under 10,000 divorces a month have been issued and dealt with on the portal.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The DDSA 2020 introduced a major change in divorce law in England and Wales as it swept away the concept of fault, and, in all but a tiny minority of cases, the ability of a respondent to defend or delay the divorce or dissolution application. The DDSA 2020 introduced substantive changes to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>&#8221;) so that, in relation to divorce, either party, or both together, could apply to the court for a divorce order, which dissolves the marriage, on the ground that the marriage has broken down irretrievably; the court dealing with the application must take the statement made by the applicant or applicants that the marriage has broken down irretrievably to be conclusive evidence of such and make a divorce order. Whilst removing the need to prove any of the facts previously required to support the ground of divorce, the DDSA 2020 introduced a period of time for the parties to reflect on the decision to divorce, as well as to seek to agree the necessary arrangements for any children and for their finances; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/1/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(5)</ref> as amended by the DDSA 2020 stipulates that an applicant or applicants cannot confirm that they wish the divorce application to continue, and apply for a conditional order to be granted, until a period of 20 weeks has elapsed from the start of the proceedings, which is the date of issue according to paragraph 7.6 of Practice Direction 41G of the Family Proceedings Rules 2010, as amended (&#8220;FPR&#8221;).</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The procedure to be followed for applications under the DDSA 2020 was set out in a new Part 7 of the FPR. In essence, an applicant or applicants initiates the process by uploading information onto the portal which forms the basis of the divorce application. Staff at the Courts and Tribunals Service Centre (&#8220;CTSC&#8221;) then check the application, deal with any fee that has to be paid, issue the application and produce a document which constitutes the divorce application which is then served on the respondent (unless it is a joint application). We are confident that none of the 79 cases would have been issued on the day they were submitted: there is usually a period of between some days and a few weeks when cases wait to be issued. In these cases it was more likely to be weeks rather than days because of the volume of cases which needed to be issued in the first weeks following the introduction of the DDSA as many people had delayed applying for divorces under the old fault based system in the months leading up to April 2022. In standard cases, which all of the 79 cases were, the first time any judicial consideration of the application takes place is at the point of the application for the conditional order, when the legal adviser considers the case and, if all is in order, certifies that the applicant or applicants is or are entitled to a conditional order of divorce and directs that the application be listed before a judge for the making of that order.</span></p>

The district judges make the conditional orders which are then sent out by the CTSC but the district judges are not expected, and do not have the time, to consider the individual cases. The applicant or applicants can apply to make the conditional order final on the portal once six weeks has expired from the making of the conditional order; the making of a final order is an administrative process, not involving a judge or a legal adviser in a standard case.</span></p>

This is because of the period of reflection introduced by the DDSA. All of the 79 couples with whom we are concerned were granted conditional orders, and then final orders, after waiting for the 20 week period.</span></p>

In the 79 cases with which we are concerned, the applicants all submitted their applications on the first anniversary of their marriages, in other words, a day early. The divorce portal was meant to prevent such a thing occurring but, as the evidence of Jason Latham, Development Director at HMCTS, sets out, a validation error in the system allowed such applications to be made from 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> April 2022 until the fault was discovered in November 2022. In November 2022 a judge identified one case which had been submitted a day early and alerted HMCTS. The computer system was fixed and the particular case was dealt with, but HMCTS did not interrogate the system any further to see if any other case had been commenced erroneously in the same way. It was only in mid-April 2024, when a legal adviser found another case which had been submitted a day early and referred it to a judge who in turn alerted HMCTS, that a proper search was undertaken and 96 cases were identified which had been submitted a day early. It appears that after the &#8220;fix&#8221; had been applied in November 2022, another 4 cases were issued; in these cases the applicant or applicants had provided an incorrect date of marriage; this was identified by staff at the CTSC who inserted the correct date of marriage but then failed to notice that the applications were premature and allowed the applications to proceed. The other 92 cases (apart from the two spotted by the judge and the legal adviser) had been submitted and issued between April 2022 and November 2022.</span></p>

The 79 cases now before the court are the ones where final orders had been made; the parties in these cases were also written to but as final orders had been made, the Lord Chancellor has made the present application. It is of note that if HMCTS had conducted a proper investigation in November 2022 when the problem was first drawn to their attention, it is likely that none, or almost none, of the 79 cases would have had final orders made and the present application would not have been necessary.</span></p>

Contrary to the application of the Secretary of State, the Tribunal had not imposed a prohibition on unpaid work, but, after the hearing, the Secretary of State nevertheless made that prohibition. The question for the Supreme Court was whether the Government can lawfully act in a manner which is inconsistent with an order of a judge which is defective without that order first being varied or set aside. The unanimous judgment of the court was given by Lord Reed PSC. The significance of the relevant part of the reasoning is Lord Reed&#8217;s analysis of an act or decision being held to be legally defective. At paragraph 31, he said that &#8216;even where a court has decided that an act or decision was legally defective, that does not necessarily imply that it must be held to have had no legal effect&#8217;. Examples given by Lord Reed included cases where &#8216;the result of treating the decision as legally non-existent may be inconsistent with legal certainty or with the public interest in orderly administration; it may, indeed, result in administrative chaos, or expose innocent third parties to legal liabilities (as where they have acted in reliance on the apparent validity of the unlawful decision)&#8217; &#8211; a description which has a direct application to the 79 cases that are before this court.</span></p>

It is clear from these authorities that these circumstances are limited. They are limited because a decree absolute is a declaratory judgment which conclusively determines a person&#8217;s marital status. In addition to the parties, all public authorities and all other individuals are entitled to rely on the declaratory effect of the decree. This can have significant consequences across a wide range of issues including, for example, the right to marry. To take that example, if a prior decree absolute were set aside, any subsequent marriage would be void under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 11</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>.&#8217;</span></p>
