The B&#8217;s are British born citizens and temporary (non-immigrant) visa holders living in the United States. They are parties to these proceedings.

Following discussions outside court yesterday and today the mother&#8217;s position is that she does not oppose the court making care orders in relation to each of the children, she is aware the plan for LO is for him to be adopted by DB and KB. As Ms Farrington explained, on the mother&#8217;s behalf, this was a very difficult decision for her to reach. She realistically acknowledged she was not in a position to care for the children, and having had the opportunity to discuss matters with DB and KB outside court she was satisfied that the family ties between the children would be maintained. All the other parties and the court recognise how difficult this decision has been for the mother, she is to be commended for putting the children&#8217;s needs above her understandable wish for the children to be returned to her care.</span></p>

First, the delay of 10 months in issuing proceedings after the mother agreed to the children being accommodated in December 2014. They should have been issued in early 2015.  Second, further delays since the proceedings started, mainly through failures by the LA to comply with court orders for the filing of evidence. These delays are inexcusable, they have prevented effective plans being made for the future care of these young children in a timeframe that meets their needs.</span></p>

Further directions were made, which resulted in the statement from Ms Walker, the interim team manager of the fostering team with the LA, dated the 3 November. She had arranged a face time meeting with the B&#8217;s together with Ms Paterson a social worker with the LA adoption team. In their discussions with the B&#8217;s on 19 October they had been able to verify the information within Ms Harrison&#8217;s connected person&#8217;s assessment as being accurate. Ms Walker confirmed in her statement that neither she or Ms Paterson had any reason to doubt the accuracy of the information contained in her report and they supported her recommendations regarding the suitability of the B&#8217;s being able to care for LO.

LO&#8217;s placement with them would not sever LO&#8217;s links with his birth family, but maintain, foster and enhance his links with his birth parents, siblings and grandparents. The B&#8217;s have amply demonstrated their suitability to provide long term care for LO through their commitment to this process and their participation with the detailed assessments that have been undertaken to date which all recommend their suitability to provide a long term home for LO. The reports, done both here and in the US, make repeat reference to their parenting characteristics including their &#8216;realistic&#8217;, &#8216;grounded&#8217;, &#8216;thoughtful, &#8216;non-judgmental&#8217;, &#8217;dependable, &#8217;respectful&#8217; and patient interaction with children; their emotional resilience, their energy and commitment to LO and that they remain fully involved with their English extended families thereby preserving LO&#8217;s existing attachments and identity. Such care is essential for LO&#8217;s welfare and no other option can provide the necessary care and support for LO throughout his life.  It is recognised, due to the physical distances involved, LO&#8217;s direct contact with his siblings and mother will be reduced to seeing them on the two occasions they visit the UK each year, LE and LY&#8217;s visits to the US from 2018 and there will be regular skype contact in the intervening period.       </span></p>

Their strong ties to this jurisdiction remain through their frequent contact with family and friends and the support they provide, their regular visits here and their obvious strong links they retain with this jurisdiction. Their focus has remained on their family, social and cultural ties here and there is no evidence of those links being cut or that they have formed an intention to permanently and indefinitely reside in the US. They have described in their statement their joint wish to be buried in England, which is consistent with the evidence the court has about them retaining their strong links here and still regarding England very much as home.</span></p>

His welfare requires him to be in a placement that will safeguard his welfare throughout his life. The B&#8217;s offer such a placement, they will provide him with the security and stability he needs and, importantly, will retain his links with his birth family in a way that supports his identity and stability even though direct contact with his siblings will be less frequent. I agree with the evidence from Mr Heller as to the immigration applications that should secure LO&#8217;s ability to live with the B&#8217;s in the US, and the submissions made on their behalf by Ms Cronin that they can in due course make an adoption application here.</span></p>
