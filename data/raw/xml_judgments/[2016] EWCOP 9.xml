The &#163;60,000 property he is alleged to have purchased was inherited by Alma from her brother, and it should be inherited by his wife when Alma dies. Colin said he&#8217;s spoken to a solicitor who advised him he does not need to account to the Public Guardian because he has a joint account with Alma which predates her LPA. I advised Colin that he has to account to the Public Guardian when requested and that he needs to provide evidence to support what he is saying. He said he hadn&#8217;t had time to collect everything. He said he had spoken to the care home and they would write a letter to say he provides personal allowance.

Colin failed to account to the Public Guardian for his actions since he became Alma&#8217;s attorney despite repeated requests and extensions. This is not acceptable and the Public Guardian cannot therefore obtain an accurate understanding of how substantial funds have been used by Alma by reason of Colin&#8217;s inaction. Colin lives a great distance from Alma (circa 260 miles), infrequently visits, and is difficult to contact by telephone. His assertion that he has &#8220;kept in contact with the home&#8221; is at odds with the home&#8217;s evidence to the Public Guardian.</p>

Upon his appointment as Alma&#8217;s attorney, by continuing to have a &#8216;mixed account&#8217;, Colin breached his duty to keep Alma&#8217;s money separate from his contrary to paragraph 7.68 of the Code and has behaved in a way that is not in Alma&#8217;s best interests in breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.
