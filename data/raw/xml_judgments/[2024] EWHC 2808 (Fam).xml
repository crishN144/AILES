There is an ongoing dispute between the parties as to what the applicant knew about this and whether she agreed to it.

It engages Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights: that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. However, whilst expressed in absolute terms, it is accepted that the Court must always consider the necessity and proportionality of any protective measures pursuant to Article 3, paying close regard to any competing Convention rights and interests which are also engaged: in this case M&#8217;s Article 8 right to respect for her private and family life, as well as her Article 9 right to freedom of religion. The Court observes at this point the highly draconian and interventionist nature of the order to which M has been subjected: amounting to a worldwide travel ban for 14 years. </span></p>

M wants to travel with her family and friends and to be able to undertake religious obligations in Saudi Arabia. The lack of a passport has made it difficult for her to apply for college, start driving lessons and to obtain employment. The Mother says that M feels the restrictions imposed on her are unfair.

However, the maternal grandmother&#8217;s actions, and the Mother&#8217;s claimed ignorance of the FGM, have to be viewed within a cultural context whereby FGM was the cultural and societal norm for the maternal grandmother and not something considered illegal or abhorrent in Yemen. Culturally within Somali communities, circumcision was something that grandmothers would commonly arrange if a child was under their guardianship and care, without consultation or discussion with the family, including the child&#8217;s mother. As Ms Nur, the independent social worker, helpfully explained, it was not something that would be spoken about between family members following the procedure. It was considered private information and a taboo subject for discussion. Children would frequently be told not to speak about it. The Mother&#8217;s lack of knowledge of her daughters having been taken for FGM by maternal grandmother looks less improbable when properly viewed within that context.  Ms Nur also gave firm evidence that the fact a child had been subjected to FGM would not necessarily be apparent to a mother on physical inspection. With 30 years&#8217; experience in the field, Ms Nur would not be confident she could identify a child had been subjected to FGM without examination by an appropriately qualified doctor. </span></p>

Risk is dynamic. The issue is whether cultural changes within Somalian communities; the extensive educational work and campaigns around FGM both in this country and abroad; the Mother&#8217;s direct engagement in that work; and M&#8217;s own education generally and specifically with respect to FGM, her clear views on the issue and increasing capacity to self-protect, have shifted the risk.

Ms Nur was thus confident M had a comprehensive grasp of the health-related risks. M also refuted to Ms Nur that FGM was religiously mandated; indeed, she expressed the view it was inconsistent with the teachings of the Quran. M was also clear it was a criminal offence in this jurisdiction and must not be normalised. She described talking openly with her sisters about FGM and about their experiences. She was able to identify sources of help if any attempts were made to coerce her into the practice outside this jurisdiction. It was thus Ms Nur&#8217;s view that M had a strong, informed stance on the issue and presented as independent, confident and well versed in her rights, and fully able to advocate for herself.</span></p>

But any protective orders imposed by the State which restrict an individual&#8217;s freedoms and liberties must be based on an informed and evidence-based analysis of the risk the orders are intended to protect against.

Similarly, she has not documented her conversations with the family members she did speak to, possibly an older sister and M&#8217;s younger brother. Those discussions are clearly relevant given her position that the risks to M emanate from pressure within &#8216;the family&#8217;. The beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and quality of the relationships within M&#8217;s immediate family are thus of direct relevance to the assessment of risk.

Having received the report of Ms Nur, it should have been clear to the social worker that her assessment of risk, even if well-intended, had been erroneously based on assumptions and misunderstandings about Somali culture, the practice of FGM within Somali communities and thus the current risks to M. Those errors were clearly and robustly reiterated by Ms Nur in her oral evidence. Sadly, however, there is no evidence that the social worker has at any point in this process, including during this final hearing, engaged in any professional reflection and reconsideration of her position having received and heard the evidence of Ms Nur. Indeed, during her oral evidence, JS continued to perpetuate her errors and misunderstandings regarding FGM in Somali communities to justify her own preferred assessment of the risk. That was despite JS frankly accepting that this is her first FGM case, in contrast to Ms Nur, a jointly instructed independent social worker with 30 years&#8217; experience in the FGM space. JS could give no proper reasoned basis for why the Local Authority did not defer to the views and recommendations of Ms Nur, other than they just wanted to keep M safe. </span></p>

The Local Authority have given no proper consideration to those fundamental matters. The significant impact of the current restrictions on M is acknowledged, but they are not weighed and balanced in the overall decision-making. M&#8217;s Article 8 and Article 9 rights are not identified as such, and the necessity and proportionality of the ongoing restrictions are not assessed in light of the presenting level of risk and the countervailing interference with M&#8217;s competing rights and freedoms.

M was made subject to a draconian open-ended order with no mechanism for review. The reality is that the Local Authority were not continuing to work with the family, and the case was closed. They did not signpost the family to any educative work or support, did not undertake any further assessments, and did not undertake any process for regular review.  The family therefore had no other option but to apply to the court and seek review of the order when M wished to travel abroad. Far from this being a risk factor, they acted entirely properly. </span></p>
