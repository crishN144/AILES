	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father was born in 1951 and is now aged 63.  The mother was born in 1960 and is therefore now aged 53.  The parties met in 1984 at a time when both were married to other people.  The father was then living in Kent, and the mother in Glasgow.  The father suggested a relationship with the mother, but she apparently declined.  The following year the mother separated from her husband and moved to live in Andorra for three years.  Then in 1988 she travelled to Australia where she stayed for nine months, during which time she met another man, hereafter  referred to as X.  In 1989 she returned to Scotland and her marriage was dissolved.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Later that year the parties met again in Scotland and shortly afterwards started a relationship.  At that stage the father was the owner of a company, a substantial property in Kent, Z House, and an island in Scotland.  He had recently separated from his wife by whom he had two daughters.  At first the parties lived at Z House and spent every other weekend on the Scottish island.  The mother worked for the father&#8217;s company. In January 1992 the father experienced financial difficulties, the company went into liquidation and the island was sold.  Thereafter the parties continued to live together at Z House in Kent, with the mother continuing to work for the father. In oral evidence before me, the mother said that, although their lifestyle was not quite as it had been before the island was sold, it was still &#8220;very privileged&#8221;. In 1994, with the father&#8217;s support, the mother embarked on a course training as a nutritionist.  Meanwhile the mother had used monies received following the sale of her former matrimonial home to purchase a flat in Glasgow. She and the father stayed there occasionally until 1996 and thereafter the flat was let. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 18th April 1997, the mother gave birth to a daughter, hereafter referred to as &#8220;S&#8221;, in Kent.   Shortly afterwards the relationship between the parties began to break down.  The mother alleged that the father was violent towards her. In August 1999, she told the father that she was taking S to her parents in Aberdeen. According to the mother, the father threatened to destroy her and her family, and told her that he had put things in place with a hit man. Believing herself to be in danger, the mother took S away from Z House with the assistance of the police and flew to Scotland where they stayed with the maternal grandparents.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the mother&#8217;s case that, fearing that she was still not safe, she then decided to take S to Australia and flew there on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August on return tickets. On the same day the father issued an application in the Tunbridge Wells County Court under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> seeking orders for parental responsibility, residence and contact.    On 27th August that court made an order for the disclosure of information as to the whereabouts of the child and the delivery of S for staying contact with the father.   Meanwhile, the mother had engaged solicitors in Australia who made an application for a child protection order in the court in Townsville, Queensland. She had earlier made contact with X and on her arrival in Australia they resumed their relationship.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 3rd September 1999, the father applied to the High Court under the Hague Child Abduction Convention.  The proceedings in the Tunbridge Wells County Court were subsequently transferred to the Principal Registry of the High Court.   On 6th September, the father made an application in the Queensland Court for the equivalent of prohibited steps and residence orders pending the return of the child to the United Kingdom.  The mother filed affidavits in the Australian proceedings expressing a wish to remain in Australia.  In reply, the father filed an affidavit stating that he would support S on her return to the United Kingdom and would assist the mother financially.   On 16th September, the judge in the Queensland Court ruled that the best place for "the complicated issues" to be determined was in the English court.   The mother undertook to return S to the United Kingdom within two weeks and, on the basis of that undertaking, was granted residence of S pending their return.  Thereafter, orders were made in the English court prohibiting the mother from removing S from England and Wales upon return to the jurisdiction, and directing her to hand over her passport to her solicitor on arrival at Heathrow.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 1st October 1999, the mother and S arrived back from Australia.  By a further interim order in the High Court dated 4th October, the mother was permitted to take S to Scotland until the final hearing of the father's applications on the basis that she and the child lived at the maternal grandparents&#8217; home.  The order further provided, however, that there should be regular contact between the father and S for periods of ten days every three weeks. Subsequently, the parties filed affidavits in the English proceedings - the father seeking a residence order whereunder he and S would live together in Z House in Kent, the mother expressing a wish that she and S should remain in Scotland with the maternal grandparents.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In November 1999, unbeknownst to the mother, the father applied for and received new passports for himself and S using a false name,  On 1st December, pursuant to the order of 4th October, the mother flew with S from Aberdeen to Gatwick to deliver the child to the father for the purposes of a ten-day period of staying contact.  Seven days later, however, the father and S left England under the false passports on the Eurostar bound for Paris and from there flew to Australia later that day.  Thus, when the mother arrived at Gatwick a few days later to collect S in accordance with the agreement between the parties, there was no sign of S or the father.   The police were alerted and <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> location and freezing orders were made in the High Court.  On 17th December, S was made a ward of court and a direction was made that the father should return her to the care of the mother forthwith. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> The police established that the father and S had travelled to Australia under the false passports.  On 23rd December, the mother applied to the England and Wales Central Authority to invoke the Hague Convention to secure the return of S to this country. On 30th December, the mother's passport was released by the court to enable her to travel to Australia to assist in the location and recovery of the child and she duly flew to Australia on 1st January 2000.  It is her case in these proceedings that she received substantial financial assistance from her own mother to enable her to travel to Australia. </p>

Six weeks later, on 16th February, S was recovered by the Australian police in Melbourne and reunited with the mother.  The father was arrested and detained as an illegal immigrant into the country.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 21st March 2000 the Family Court of Australia ordered that S be returned     to the United Kingdom. The father had maintained in those proceedings that, if S's habitual residence was Scotland, the Australian court had no jurisdiction to return her on the application of the Central Authority for England and Wales. The judge rejected this argument holding that "it would be a clear violation of the spirit of the Convention if what I see as a technical argument were to succeed and thereby to prevent the court from returning the child to the United Kingdom if the circumstances for doing so are otherwise established."  The father duly filed a notice of appeal against the order for return, and pending determination of the appeal the mother and S remained in Australia.</p>

On 26th May, the father's appeal against the order for the return of S to the United Kingdom was dismissed with costs. On 3rd June, the father's appeal to the Australian Refugee Review Tribunal to allow his application for refugee status and a visa for S in Australia was dismissed.  He remained in custody. On 12th June, the mother and S left Australia for Heathrow. On the following day the mother attended before Black J. (as she then was) in the High Court where an order was made that S should remain a ward of court.   It was further ordered that S should remain in the care and control of the mother.  Non-molestation orders were made against the father and further orders were made relating to his dealings with and communications with S and the mother.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother was called as a witness in the Australian criminal proceedings against the father.  On 16th May 2001, she was therefore granted permission to remove S from the jurisdiction of England and Wales for the duration of the father's criminal trial in Australia.  On 16th October 2001, the father was convicted on both counts of incitement to solicit the murder of the mother and X in Australia and on 7th May 2002 was sentenced to terms of 6 years and 18 month imprisonment in respect of those charges.  Further police investigations in Australia led his being charged with another offence of incitement to solicit the mother's murder.   Meanwhile, on 15th February 2002, Mr. Justice Kirkwood had granted the mother permission to remove S from the jurisdiction "temporarily for at least 18 months".  The destination of the mother and S was not disclosed either to the court or to the father at that stage and remained undisclosed for ten years. In fact, as is now known, they moved to Australia and have lived there ever since.</p>

Subsequently, the father was convicted in respect of the second and separate offence of soliciting the mother's murder and received a further term of imprisonment of 12 years, with a minimum term of seven and a half years.   The father remains in custody in Australia. His estimated date of release is March 2018. He continues to deny the offences in respect of which he has been convicted.</p>

On 5th May 2006, a district judge in ancillary proceedings between the father and his former wife directed that the sum of &#163;302,619 should be paid to the ex-wife and the balance to the father.

On 21st January 2008 that application was adjourned by Singer J. to a date to be fixed "... on the provisional basis that the court has jurisdiction to proceed with the mother's application ... since the child's habitual residence at the time of the application was England and Wales."  Subsequently there were further hearings at which the application was adjourned further for various reasons.  On 22nd June 2009 Singer J. gave further directions in the proceedings, together with an order for interim periodical payments in respect of S in the sum of &#163;1,500 per month, such sums to be paid out of the frozen funds. On 23rd March 2010 Singer J. directed there should be a trial of the issue as to whether the court had or continues to have jurisdiction to entertain the Schedule 1 application and gave further directions as to the filing of affidavit evidence as to jurisdiction. The sum payable under the interim order was varied to &#163;1000 per month.  Shortly afterwards the father applied to the Australian Child Support Agency seeking an assessment of his liability to pay child support for S, thereby setting in train a process in Australia that ultimately included extensive court proceedings running in parallel to this case. In the interests of clarity, I shall set out details of the Australian processes in a separate section of this judgment.</p>

As in this country, an administrative assessment of child support liability may be generated on the application of either parent pursuant to a legislative formula. The scheme imposes a minimum liability on all parents regardless of their individual or comparative financial circumstances, although there is a discretion to reduce the assessment to nil in certain cases. Mr Kennedy quotes an observation in one text book (&#8220;Australian Family Law Handbook, Volume 3 &#8211; Child Support, para 1.5) that: &#8220;It is difficult to see that anyone could pass this test except perhaps the person confined to an institution where no money is ever given to them&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the application of the formula does not always lead to a just result, the scheme also provides for departure from administrative assessment in a range of specified special circumstances. Either party may seek a departure from the rate of support assessed administratively by Child Support by way of application to the family court. If such an application is made, and the court is satisfied it has jurisdiction, it must follow a three step process to satisfy itself that it is appropriate to make a particular departure order. First, it must be satisfied that, in the special circumstances of the case, one of the grounds for departure is listed in the statute exists. Mr Kennedy advises that, in this case, a court might be satisfied that an administrative assessment would result in an unjust and inequitable determination. He cites one authority in which a court ruled that, where a father was incarcerated and the mother was deceased as a result of his unlawful actions, the court found special circumstances justifying interference with the ordinary application of the child support formula: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Wade v Kaplan</span> [2007] FMCAfam 1100. Secondly, the court must then satisfy itself that the departure from administrative assessment would be just and equitable having regard to matters specifically listed in the statute. Thirdly, the court must be satisfied that a departure order would be &#8220;otherwise proper&#8221;. The orders that a court may make by way of a departure are specified in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/118" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 118</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and include an order varying the annual rate of child support. Mr Kennedy advised that the parties can apply for a departure order from the administrative assessment of child support for a retrospective period of 18 months (or longer with the leave of the court) but, importantly, not for any period before the date on which the child support assessment was made: <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Teal v Teal</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/>[2010] FamCAFC 120. </p>

Secondly, whereas the administrative assessment process does not provide for lump sum payments or other payments such as school fees, such sums can be ordered by a court in a range of circumstances. </p>

If an application is made for a lump sum order, the court will make an order if satisfied it will be just and equitable and will otherwise be proper, having regarding inter alia to the administrative assessment and any departure order. Mr Kennedy advises that, generally speaking, while the circumstances in which lump sum orders can be made are not limited, such orders are usually only considered in two situations, namely (a) where there are difficulties in enforcement of child support and/or (b) where the paying parent is &#8220;asset rich&#8221; and &#8220;income poor&#8221;. Mr Kennedy advises that the full court of the Family Court of Australia has observed that the provision of lump sum child support is not normally to be regarded as the preferred option: see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Pripic v Pripic </span>(1995) FLC 92-574. Mr Kennedy advises that there remains a debate in Australia as a result of conflicting judicial opinion about whether <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/123" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 123</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> provides an independent source of power to order child support otherwise than in the form of periodical payments, or whether an order may only be made in substitution for a periodic amount. He advises that, if an application were to be made for lump sum child support, it should be accompanied by an application for a departure from the administrative assessment. In answer to a request for further clarification Mr Kennedy confirmed by letter dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April that it was his view that the court does not have the power to make a lump sum order predating a child support assessment, even if the court resolved the conflicting judicial opinion as to the interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions by preferring the view that the statutory power to award a lump sum provided an independent source of power to order child support in the form of a lump sum.</p>

The judge declined to entertain the applications on the grounds, in summary, that (i) he was not satisfied that the mother and S were within the jurisdiction of Australia and it was pointless to make any order in the terms sought when the court had no ability to enforce the orders; (ii) the courts of England and Wales were seised of jurisdiction in proceedings in which the father was a party and had participated; (iii) S was a ward of court in the UK regardless of where she resides and these courts were vested with jurisdiction and (iv) notwithstanding that the order sought by the father in Australia were &#8220;relatively modest in form&#8221;, there was no reason why he could not instruct a solicitor in the UK to seek such orders in the English proceedings. The father filed notice of appeal against Barry J&#8217;s order.</p>

There is no evidence before me to indicate what that might be. However, given that the English proceedings are in an advanced state of preparation, are fixed for hearing in December and that there are significant assets under the control of that court to be dealt with as a consequence of those proceedings, the High Court in the United Kingdom is the convenient place in which those issues should be litigated.</p>

The judgment delivered by the Supreme Court, running to 223 paragraphs and 64 pages, describes the history of over 30 legal proceedings in Australia in which the father had been the unsuccessful plaintiff or applicant, falling broadly into three categories &#8211; immigration proceedings, applications relating to criminal proceedings against him and administrative decisions tribunals proceedings. These proceedings are, of course, in addition to the various proceedings brought by the father in the Family Court of Australia. The order made  by the Supreme Court prohibited the father from issuing proceedings in New South Wales, save for an ongoing interlocutory application in connection with a criminal appeal.<span style="font-style:italic"/>In his opinion, Mr Kennedy confirmed that the vexatious proceedings order of the New South Wales Supreme Court only applies to proceedings sought to be brought by the father under New South Wales legislation and in courts or tribunals exercising New South Wales state jurisdiction. It does not apply to proceedings initiated or sought to be initiated by the father in federal courts or tribunals, including the family law courts, or under Commonwealth legislation, which includes the Australian Family Law Act and the Australian Child Support Act. He added, however, the Commonwealth Family Law Courts do also have proceedings for dealing with vexatious litigants very similar to those exercised against the father in New South Wales.</p>

Strenuous efforts were made by the father&#8217;s solicitor, assisted by the office of the Head of International Family Justice and the international network judge in Australia, to facilitate the father&#8217;s direct participation at the hearing before me. Unfortunately, all these attempts came to nought. The hearing started with consideration of the preliminary issue of the father&#8217;s application for a stay. At the conclusion of the argument, I refused the application, indicating that I would give reasons for my decision at a later date. Those reasons are set out in the next section of this judgment. I then proceeded to hear the substantive application. The only witnesses who gave oral evidence were the mother and the maternal grandmother&#8217;s former accountant, AM. At the conclusion of the mother&#8217;s cross-examination, I adjourned the hearing to allow a note of her evidence to be agreed and sent to the father in Australia so that he could give further instructions to his lawyers. At the resumed hearing, the mother was recalled for further cross-examination on the basis of those instructions. After receiving final submissions, I reserved judgment. At the hearing, both parties were represented by leading counsel and junior counsel for the preliminary issue of the father&#8217;s application for a stay, although only junior counsel were retained for the substantive application. At this point I express my thanks to all the lawyers instructed in these proceedings &#8211; Mr Henry Setright QC, Mr. Stephen Lyon and their instructing solicitor Mrs. Sarah Judd on behalf of the mother, and Miss Susan Jacklin QC and Miss Caroline Willbourne and their instructing solicitor Mr. Alan Green.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to note that Miss Theis had an alternative ground for finding that she had power to grant a stay. By the time of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">JKN v JCN</span>, the EC had introduced another regulation, Council Regulation (EC) 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Matrimonial Matters and in Matters of Parental Responsibility (&#8220;Brussels II Revised&#8221;). It is notable that Brussels II Revised contains, in Article 15, a power akin to the principle of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> whereunder the courts of a Member State having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter may, if they consider that a court of another Member State, with which the child has a particular connection, will be better placed to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interests of the child, stay the proceedings and take steps to request the other Member State to assume jurisdiction. Brussels II Revised was relevant to Miss Theis&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">JKC v JCN</span> because of the terms of the statutory provisions governing jurisdiction in divorce cases in section 5(2) of and paragraph 9 of Schedule I to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45" uk:canonical="1973 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973</ref>. Paragraph 9 provided a statutory power to stay proceedings in favour of parallel proceedings in another jurisdiction save where the proceedings were &#8220;governed by the Council Regulation&#8221;. Miss Theis held, (at paragraph 149(ii)), that it was neither necessary nor desirable for the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> doctrine to be extended to Brussels II Revised. She further held (at paragraph 149(iii)) that the natural and preferable construction of &#8220;proceedings governed by the Council Regulation&#8221; in Schedule I paragraph 9 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/45" uk:canonical="1973 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref> refers to the position where there are competing proceedings in another Member State and that the court's discretion to stay under paragraph 9 remains in place where the competing proceedings are in a non-Member State. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Theis&#8217;s decision that it was neither necessary nor desirable for the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> doctrine to be extended to Brussels II Revised was approved in October 2013 by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mittal</span>. In that case, a husband started divorce proceedings in India in 2009. Over two years later, the wife filed her own petition for divorce in England. The English court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition under Article 3 of Brussels II Revised. However, Bodey J at first instance stayed the wife&#8217;s petition on the grounds that India was the more appropriate forum. His decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. At paragraph 37, Lewison LJ concluded that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> had little to do with the case. It was concerned with a different convention regulating jurisdiction in a different field of activity. However, whilst endorsing Miss Theis&#8217;s interpretation of Brussels II Revised, the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mittal</span> found it unnecessary to be drawn into the wider debate considered in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">JKN v JCN</span> on the extent to which <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> applies to Brussels I (and thus to the 1968 Convention). When I adjourned this case in May 2013, knowing that an appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mittal</span> was due to be heard later in the year, I had anticipated that the Court of Appeal would consider that question. In the event, it did not arise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It should be noted that, in 2011, the Regulation (EU) of 18 December 2009 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions and Cooperation in Matters Relating to Maintenance Obligations (&#8220;the Maintenance Regulation&#8221;) replaced Brussels I in respect of the jurisdictional rules in maintenance cases. Furthermore, in January 2015, Brussels I will be replaced by Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council of 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>December 2012 on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (provisionally known as &#8220;Brussels I Recast&#8221;). These new instruments are couched in somewhat different terms from the earlier instruments. As Lewison LJ has pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mittal</span> (at paragraph 38), &#8220;flexibility is now part of the policy&#8221;.

The jurisdiction for this court to entertain the mother&#8217;s application is derived from that Convention.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, they point out that the jurisdictional rules in the Convention applicable to maintenance cases are found in Article 5(2) as well as Article 2. Thus, in matters relating to maintenance, a person may be sued either under Article 2 in the courts of the country in which he or she is domiciled or under Article 5(2) (a) in the courts for the place where the maintenance creditor is domiciled or habitually resident or (b) if the matter is ancillary to proceedings concerning the status of a person, in the court which, according to its own law, has jurisdiction to entertain those proceedings, (unless that jurisdiction is based solely on the nationality of one of the parties). Miss Jacklin and Miss Willbourne submit that Article 5(2) therefore gives the court the discretion to refuse jurisdiction where the maintenance creditor is domiciled or habitually resident in another contracting state. Further, Article 5(2) gives the court the scope to apply its national law to determine jurisdiction, including, they submit, the power stay proceedings in favour of a more convenient forum. Although Australia is a non-Contracting State, they invite the court to apply Article 5(2) &#8220;reflexively&#8221;. </p>

The rigid application of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> here would lead to injustice, and would amount to a breach of the father&#8217;s rights under Article 6 of ECHR. </p>

There is therefore no issue as to the &#8220;reflexive&#8221; application of the second limb of Article 5(2). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Does the existence of alternative bases for jurisdiction in Article 2 and the first limb of Article 5(2) allow the court a discretionary power to determine the jurisdiction or merely invest the maintenance creditor with the right to select the court in which to start proceedings? In this context, it should be noted that that in some jurisdictions maintenance proceedings may be started by the debtor as well as the creditor. Indeed in this case it is the father that has started proceedings in Australia (where both parties are now habitually resident) for an order against himself. There is thus a prospect, as in this case, that each parent may start separate maintenance proceedings in different jurisdictions. Where such proceedings have been started, an application of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> is little guarantee of the certainty which propelled the ECJ to its decision. The prospect of two sets of proceedings continuing, doubling the costs and leading potentially to two irreconcilable judgments, is hardly consistent with certainty, nor, it might be thought, with other fundamental principles such as expedition, economy, proportionality and fairness. I therefore agree with Miss Theis&#8217;s insightful observation in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">JKN v JCN</span> that the reasoning that underpins <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> is not incompatible with retaining the discretionary power to stay proceedings where there are parallel proceedings in a non-Member State, particularly where those proceedings have been brought by the defendant.  Where parallel proceedings are ongoing in a non-Member State, certainty may often only be achieved if the court stays its own proceedings. </p>

As the Court of Appeal has recently emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mittal</span>, the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> was restricted to a narrow refinement of only one of two questions referred by the English court. It was plainly not the intention of the ECJ, advised by the Advocate-General, to expound upon the law beyond what was strictly required to resolve the issues arising in that case. Given the narrow ambit of the decision, coupled with the manifest advantages the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> as a case management tool, as increasingly recognised by subsequent European instruments, there seems to me to be little merit in extending the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Owusu</span> decision to the circumstances arising in this case.</p>

It was the mother&#8217;s submission that the father had adopted what her counsel described as a &#8220;scorched earth&#8221; policy, demonstrated for example by the great efforts he has made to achieve assessments and orders from the Australian agency and court in the sum of nil with a view, it is said, to confounding the mother&#8217;s legitimate claim in this country. Australia could not therefore be characterised as the more convenient forum if being proposed for purely tactical reasons. </p>

However quick the Australian court could move to determine the issue, it could not conclude the matter as quickly as this court which was about to start the substantive hearing. Any application for a stay on grounds of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> should have been made at a much earlier stage. The fact that it was being taken so late in the proceedings, at the start of the substantive hearing, was another example of the father&#8217;s tactical approach to this litigation. </p>

The Australian proceedings have come about purely as a result of the father&#8217;s actions, which the mother asserts are merely tactical. Nonetheless, the fact is that those proceedings have been stayed by Aldridge J and his decision has been upheld on appeal. Mr. Setright and Mr. Lyon therefore submitted that a stay in the English proceedings would perpetuate a litigation impasse. </p>

She was available for cross-examination. The father&#8217;s representatives were equipped to conduct that cross-examination. In so far as his absence impeded this process, the court could adjourn it to allow further instructions to be obtained from Australia. </p>

That country does not have jurisdiction to entertain a claim for financial provision for the period 2000 to 2010. It was suggested by Miss Jacklin and Miss Willbourne that the court should disregard this because the mother was responsible for the delay in bringing forward her claim during this period. That argument may be relevant to quantum of any provision awarded. It does not negate the argument that the mother has a claim for provision covering that period in this country which she cannot pursue in Australia.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the application for a stay was made at a very late stage. As a general rule, applications for a stay on grounds of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> should be made at an early stage of the proceedings, to avoid unnecessary cost and delay. Part 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules requires an application for a stay to be made within 14 days of the acknowledgement of service (<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Texan Management Ltd v Pacific Electric Wire and Cable Co Ltd</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/jcpc/2009/46" uk:canonical="[2009] UKPC 46" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKPC 46</ref>) although that time may be extended in appropriate circumstances (<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">CNA Insurance Co v OD Inc</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2005/456" uk:canonical="[2005] EWHC 456 (Comm)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] EWHC 456 (Comm)</ref>). In this case, the issue was not finally considered by the court until 14 years after the proceedings were commenced, at the start of the final hearing of the substantive application. The application for a stay was made prior to the hearing before me in 2011 but not argued at that hearing. At that stage, it would have been difficult for the court to rule on the question because the mother&#8217;s whereabouts were unknown to the court and the father. It was not until the concession made in May 2013, that the mother and S were living in Australia, that it became common knowledge that all parties were living in that country and had been so for over ten years. It could therefore be argued that the delay in pursuing the application for a stay should not be laid at the father&#8217;s door. Nonetheless, the fact that the application was only being considered at start of the substantive hearing was manifestly relevant. Evidence had been filed. Considerable costs had been incurred. As Mr. Setright submitted, the case was &#8220;ready to go&#8221;. A stay at this very late stage would have added to what has already been an extraordinary delay. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S.1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> requires the court, in any proceedings in which any question with respect to the upbringing of a child arises, to have regard to the general principle that any delay in determining the application is likely to prejudice S&#8217;s welfare. Strictly speaking, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(2)</ref> does not apply in this case because, under s.105(1), &#8220;upbringing&#8221; does not include the maintenance of the child. But even though the court is not &#8220;required&#8221; to have regard to the principle set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1(2)</ref>, the court is entitled to have regard to that principle when considering an application for proceedings about the maintenance of a child. The overriding objective under the Family Procedure Rules 2010 is that the court should be enabled to deal with cases justly, and this includes, inter alia, ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly.</p>

It is probably true that an Australian court might have been better equipped to obtain and evaluate some aspects of the evidence. But I did not consider that this court was incapable of reaching a fair conclusion on the evidence available. Whilst an Australian court might be better able to assess the minutiae of the parties&#8217; financial position, I did not consider that this court would be so handicapped by a paucity of evidence to prevent justice being done. This court had sufficient evidence to enable it to determine the Schedule I application, applying the approach laid down by English case law discussed below. The fact that the Australian court may have some advantages in this respect did not, in my judgment, outweigh the enormous disadvantages that would arise were this court to stay the proceedings and require the mother to engage the Australian court, where the proceedings started by the father have of course been stayed on the grounds that the English court is the better forum. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, while I accepted that conducting the trial on behalf of the father presented considerable challenges for those representing him, I did not consider that they were insuperable. He was able to give instructions, and to file such evidence as he wished. I concluded that a fair cross-examination could be effected by adjourning the hearing after the mother had given evidence to enable an agreed note of that evidence to be prepared and sent to the father in Australia so that he could comment and then permitting the mother to be recalled for further questioning at the adjourned hearing. Furthermore, it seemed to me that the conduct of a trial in Australia would also present difficulties, not only for those representing the father but also for the mother, given the very great concerns about her security. I also considered there was force in the submission made on her behalf that, given the father&#8217;s approach to the litigation in both jurisdictions, there was a high likelihood that he would continue to be resistant and obstructive at every stage.</p>

For several years she cohabited with X, and with financial assistance from her mother invested in a succession of properties with X. About two years ago, however, she and X ceased cohabiting, and X paid out her interest in their jointly owned property which she utilised to buy a mortgage-free property in her own name where she and S now live. She remains on good terms with X, but says that she does not plan to live with him again, and is not receiving any financial support from him. Apart from some contribution from X during their period of cohabitation, the mother says that her sources of financial support during the past 12 years have been, first, loans from her mother, secondly, rental income from the Glasgow flat, thirdly, since 2010, the payments made under Singer J&#8217;s orders and, latterly, a small earned income from part time work amounting to no more than about &#163;5000 or &#163;6000 per annum. The mother says she has been unable to work as a nutritionist because of the fear that this would lead to the father discovering her whereabouts which remains an abiding fear for the mother, as she described vividly in her evidence to which I will return below. It was a matter of very considerable concern for the mother, and for the court, when it emerged that the father&#8217;s lawyers are in possession of information as to her location, including photographs.</p>

First, she submits that the claim is grossly exaggerated with a view to achieving for the mother as large a capital sum as she can. She contends that the mother has calculated the claim by simply attributing to the father the entire claim costs of bringing S up to date and beyond, to the end of tertiary education. Miss Willbourne submits that there is no indication to the extent at which the mother considers she is able to contribute to S&#8217;s costs herself. </p>

She accuses the mother of inordinate delay in prosecuting her claim, in particular between 2003 and 2008. In addition, Miss Willbourne contends that the mother has failed to give adequate disclosure of her own financial position both in terms of evidence as to past income and expenditure and also as to her capital. Miss Willbourne submits that this lack of documentary evidence is inexcusable and should lead the court to be circumspect about the financial claims now made. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, Miss Willbourne says that the father does not accept that the maternal grandmother has ever had sufficient funds to pay the money claimed in the schedule. Even if she did have such funds, the father does not accept that the monies paid to the mother have been &#8220;loans&#8221; but, rather, contends that the sums were paid by way of gift, or alternatively advanced inheritance. Miss Willbourne submits that the father is in difficulty in challenging the mother&#8217;s case by the fact that the grandmother has not given direct evidence at this hearing. The grandmother&#8217;s accountant, AM, has given evidence, but Miss Willbourne submits that his testimony is an inadequate substitute. She submits that this compounds the unfairness of the way in which the mother has pursued her application. Miss Willbourne makes further submissions as to the genuineness of the mother&#8217;s case concerning the alleged &#8220;loans&#8221; which I shall consider below. </p>

The father contends that the mother has been living with X for over ten years and has been financially supported by him.

She submits that it is unreasonable for the father to be expected to pay for private school fees. In addition, it is submitted that it is premature for any order to be made as to university costs, given the uncertainty as to S&#8217;s future plans. It is contended that the better course would be to adjourn this aspect of the case to be dealt with by the courts in Australia. </p>

Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 does, however, require the court to have regard &#8220;to all the circumstances&#8221;. In my judgment, the father&#8217;s conduct in this case, in particular his convictions for two offences of inciting the mother&#8217;s murder, is plainly relevant.

Having read her statement and listened to her in the witness box, I fully accept the mother&#8217;s evidence on this point. I have no doubt that she is genuinely fearful of the father and that this fear has circumscribed her life, and that of her daughter, for the last fourteen years. Her anxiety was evident throughout the hearing, and in particular on two occasions &#8211; when describing to me in outline what the father had done by way of incitement to murder her on the second occasion and, secondly, when it became apparent in the course of Miss Willbourne cross examination, through the production of recent photographs obtained by or on behalf of the father, that he is, or may well be, aware of her current location. </p>

If the father had not incited others to kill the mother, and not been sent to prison for most of S&#8217;s childhood, he would in all probability have been able to pursue a career which would have enabled him to support S in enjoying the sort of comfortable lifestyle which the father and mother enjoyed in earlier times. Furthermore, the mother would have been able to pursue her career as a nutritionist and make some substantial contribution to S&#8217;s support. Instead, he has been incarcerated for the past fourteen years, and she has been living the life of a fugitive, unable (as I find) to work in her chosen career and forced to rely on her parents, and for a period X, for financial support.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is correct that the mother has delayed pursuing her application for several years, but in my judgment no real criticism attaches to her in respect of this. In this respect, the father&#8217;s conduct is, as in so many respects in this case, the overriding factor. The criminal offences, and his pursuit of the mother, put her in an impossible position. Furthermore, his incarceration from 2000 onwards removed any prospect of his being able to pay anything towards S&#8217;s upkeep out of earned income. It was only when the ancillary relief issues in his own divorce proceedings had been resolved that a fund crystallized against which the mother could direct her claim. The delays since 2006 are attributable to the father&#8217;s delaying tactics and to regrettable delays within the court process itself, rather than any significant fault on the mother&#8217;s part. </p>

It is asserted that the mother is in reality leading a life different to that which she makes out. The mother&#8217;s principal argument in response to this assertion once again relates to the father&#8217;s conduct. Because of the perceived danger that he will discover her precise whereabouts, and make a third attempt to kill her, the mother has had to be extremely circumspect about disclosure. It is suggested that she has used this as pretext for concealing her true financial position. Having heard her give evidence, however, I reject the suggestion. I find the mother to be a plausible, honest and compelling witness. Her fear of the father is palpable. Furthermore, I accept her evidence as to her financial position. I do not believe that she has only disclosed limited material simply at of a desire to conceal a more advantageous financial position than she admits to. Accordingly, I reject any suggestion that the mother has conducted this litigation in an unfair fashion.</p>

The real reason for his seeking a backdated assessment was that he assumed it would be assessed at nil, and that he would be able to use his assessment in some way to defeat the mother&#8217;s claim in this court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother asserts that her only assets are her flat in Scotland, providing a small rental income, and her property in Australia. The history of her property dealings in Australia is set out in her statement in these proceedings at paragraph 29. In 2002, she purchased her first property jointly with another person, who she did not directly name but whom I assume to be X. Her contribution to this purchase was &#163;19,000 provided by her mother (as to which, see below). In 2006, another house was purchased jointly by the mother with X. She made direct financial contribution towards the purchase, although she carried out work on the property. In 2007, a third property was purchased jointly with X to which she again made no financial contribution. At that stage, the first property purchased in 2002 was sold and all of the mother&#8217;s interest in the process of sale was invested in the third property. In 2011, the second property purchased in 2006, was sold and the mother&#8217;s share of the proceeds of sale was again invested in the third property. In 2011, X bought out the mother&#8217;s interest in the third property for A$170,000. Using this sum, the mother was able to purchase a property owned solely by her and occupied solely by herself and S. The current value of the property is worth approximately A$200,000. The mother therefore asserts that she has no other interest in another property in Australia. In oral evidence, she said that she thought it likely that her name was still on the legal title of the third property, although on her account she has no beneficial interest therein. </p>

This is, undoubtedly, a broad brush approach, but I observe that the figure for the current year (&#163;11,390) tallies approximately with the mother&#8217;s estimate for the cost of keeping S. Using those figures, Mr. Lyon has carefully prepared a table setting out an annual breakdown in two periods (1) from 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2002 to 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July 2008, totalling &#163;37,535.98, and (2) from the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2008 until S&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2015, totalling &#163;59,940.15. I accept that this is an approximate but sufficiently accurate estimate of the costs of S&#8217;s upkeep during those periods, although the comparison is complicated by the fluctuation in the exchange rate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ordinarily these costs should be borne by both parents. In deciding on the quantum of provision to be made by the father, I have regard to the factors in paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the income, earning capacity, capital resources and needs of both parents. In this case, the father is not working but has a substantial capital fund from which he can make a sizable contribution. The mother has skills and qualifications, but her earning capacity and income have been severely restricted, I find, by the circumstances in which she lives as a result of the father&#8217;s conduct. Furthermore, she has no capital save for her home in Australia and the flat in Glasgow which gives her a small rental income. In the circumstances, I conclude that it is only right that the father should bear the principal responsibility for meeting the costs of looking after S during the whole of the period from 2002.</p>

She has flourished in private education and is on course to go to university. The cost of her final year, including some extras, will be in the region of A$25,000 (equivalent to approximately &#163;13,716).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother further seeks financial support from the father to cover the cost of S&#8217;s university education in Australia. She has produced evidence that shows that S is of a level of academic ability to apply for and attend university. In her statement, the mother states that she has obtained comparative costs for universities in Australia. As an illustration, exhibited to her statement is an expenses guide for the University of Queensland showing that the ongoing monthly expenses for a single student living on campus would be in the region of A$20,000 for the 36 weeks of the academic year. In addition, the student would incur living costs for the rest of the year. For a student living off campus, the costs are estimated as being in the region of A$16,500 for the 36 weeks, or about A$23,000 for the whole calendar year. In addition, there will be expenses on books and travel to and from home which the mother calculates at about A$3,000 per annum. A further exhibit shows the approximate annual fees for courses at that university, which range from just under A$6,000 to just under A$10,000, depending on the course. The length of the courses ranges from four to five and a half years. Figures for Monash University in further documents exhibited to the statement are slightly higher. The mother puts the total costs for a five-year course, including living costs, academic fees, books and other equipment, and the cost of running a car and also allowing for inflation, at slightly over A$250,000, equivalent to about &#163;137,500. Her primary claim was for a lump sum in that amount, but in evidence she agreed to a periodical order. </p>

On behalf of the father, Miss Willbourne supports this idea. She submits that the mother&#8217;s claim is &#8220;top dollar&#8221;, and that it would be wrong for the court to make an order without more evidence as to then options in Australia, both for the type of tertiary education available and as to the means of meeting the costs. Miss Willbourne submits that it would be wrong in principle to award any sum for university education in the absence of more evidence as S&#8217;s intellectual ability and educational progress, or about cost. Alternatively, even if the court accepts the evidence that has been produced as to S&#8217;s educational ability and prospects, it would, submits Muss Willbourne, be wrong to make any order under this heading, several months before it might occur.</p>

With respect to Miss Willbourne, I consider that this is precisely the right point at which to make a decision. S needs to know where she stands. Applications need to be made in the next few months to ensure that S is able to start at university in February 2015, which is the beginning of the academic year in Australia. The history of this litigation shows that it is highly likely that any application in Australia would not be determined before S starts at university. I accept the mother&#8217;s assertion that, unless this court makes an order under this heading, there is a substantial risk that S will be unable to go to university.</p>

It is possible that S will obtain a part-time job, but any money she earns is unlikely to be more than incidental pocket-money. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In all the circumstances, I have concluded that the father should pay financial provision for the period of S&#8217;s university in the following manner. First, there should be a lump sum of A$4,000 (&#163;2,200) to cover initial costs. Thereafter, periodical payments should be in the sum of A$22,500 per annum, adjusted annually in line with the Australian retail price index, from S&#8217;s 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday until she completes her university education. In addition, the father should pay the university fees on presentation of the invoice at the start of each semester. I direct that a sum sufficient to meet the entirety of these future payments for maintenance and university fees be transferred from the Z House fund to the mother&#8217;s solicitor and held by her to meet the payments as they fall due, with any residual sum transferred to the father when S completes her university education.</p>

There can be no objection to the former, estimated at &#163;880. As to the latter, I have considered whether it is a reasonable sum to include by way of financial provision for a child. The mother has produced figures for the cost of a five-year-old car ranging from A$9,300 to A$12,000. Given that this order is designed in part to cover her university years, and bearing in mind all the other circumstances of this extraordinary case, I have concluded that it would be reasonable to order the father to contribute &#163;5000 for the cost of a small car for S.</p>
