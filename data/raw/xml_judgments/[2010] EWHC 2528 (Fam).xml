	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case, a District Judge in the County Court is in the midst of hearing care proceedings relating to a young woman, A, who was born on 23 October 1993, and who is thus rising 17.  Pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/31/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> &#8220;no care order or supervision order may  be made with respect to a child who has reached the age of 17&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;. It is therefore imperative that the care proceedings relating to A are completed before she is 17, and they have been carefully time-tabled to ensure that this is so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What has brought the matter to this court is a discrete issue of disclosure, which the District Judge has transferred to the High Court for resolution. In the event, after I had heard oral evidence  from the relevant witness, the bar was unanimous that disclosure should be made. That, accordingly, was the order which I made on 5 October 2010, with a proviso that there should be no onward disclosure by the parties beyond themselves, but with disclosure to the police being deferred to be dealt with by the District Judge hearing the care proceedings. As the point is nonetheless an important one, I reserved my reasons, which I now give.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I need to make it plain at the outset of this judgment; (a) that I am imposing reporting restrictions for the purposes of this hearing (this judgment is being written anonymously); and (b) that nothing in it is designed in any way to influence the outcome of the decision which the District Judge will make prior to 23 October 2010 in the County Court.  Miss Kate Hudson, for the local authority in the case, made it clear that she would be pursuing the application in relation to A who, on the local authority&#8217;s case, is at risk of  &#8220;honour&#8221; based violence if a care order is not made. A, it appears, currently wishes to return to live with her parents. Whether or not there should be a care order, and whether or not A returns to live with her parents are not issues before me, and this judgment will deal exclusively with the question of disclosure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter arises in the following way. A was born of parents who originate from Pakistan. She has, however, spent her entire life in the United Kingdom, and is a British subject, as are her parents.   She is the fourth of her parents&#8217; five children. The local authority commenced care proceedings on 23 February 2010. Prior to that date, A, at her own request,  had been accommodated since 3 December 2009.</p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reason for the care proceedings has its origins in the fact that A has formed a relationship with a young man, whom I will call AF. A&#8217;s parents disapprove of AF, who, like A was brought up in England, but whose parents  originate from Bangladesh. There has also been a series of incidents which concern the local authority, and which I propose to summarise.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> In September 2009, A was found close to her home by a member of the public. Her hands were tied together, and she had a piece of broken glass with her. She was in a state of extreme distress. The member of the public concerned made  a &#8216;999&#8217; call, as a result of which the police attended the scene. A was reluctant to give any information to the police, and told them that she had  tied her hands herself. She did, however, tell them that there was domestic violence at home with her father being abusive towards her mother. In oral evidence to the district judge the officer concerned said that A had said words to the effect that her parents were always getting at each other. </p>

The two brothers were arrested, and there are pending criminal proceedings  against them. These were to be heard prior to the determination of the care proceedings, but they have now been put back to  December 2010.  It is not suggested that A or her parents had any direct connection with this incident. </p>

At times she has expressed  fears of going home: at others she has expressed a wish to do so.  Latterly her wish to return home has become more fixed, and she has been having contact with members of her family (not all of it known to, or agreed by the local authority).</p>

(It has since been renewed administratively).Amongst other directions, the judge directed a case management conference on 17 August 2010, and also ordered an honour related abuse assessment from an expert to be filed by 14 July 2010.

It was also directed on 29 September that the expert&#8217;s second report should be disclosed to the parties&#8217; legal advisers, the parties having given irrevocable instructions not to impart the information contained within it to their respective clients.</p>

The author read all the documents and had interviews with all the participants in the proceedings, including A and AF. The interviews are reported in considerable detail. The expert concludes that A  is not at immediate risk of forced marriage, but recommends that the FMPO remains in place. The expert also expresses the view that  a legal framework of protection should remain in place for both A and AF until the criminal proceedings are concluded &#8220;and a comprehensive follow up review of (A&#8217;s) circumstances is undertaken&#8221;.</p>

A could not see what they were doing but A could hear them &#8220;giggling&#8221; and she knew that her mother &#8220;was up to no good&#8221;; (b) that A had also seen her mother talking to this man; (c)  that A  had witnessed regular domestic violence in the family home; there had been arguments between her mother and her father and the latter had accused the former of having an affair;  (d) that on occasions her father had gone out and got drunk, and that her mother sometimes refused to allow her father back into the house. This, she said, made things worse; and (e) that she gives an explanation for her own behaviour by &#8220;pushing the boundaries&#8221; to test her mother&#8217;s reaction.</p>

A elaborated on this theme to the expert who recorded that she had told the police about the domestic violence and AF.</p>

Apart from the pressure on AF to withdraw his statement, they told the expert that AF; (a) had stolen his sister&#8217;s passport and arranged to have it sold; (b) that AF had stolen up to &#163;20,000 worth of gold from three members of his family, which he had then sold for cash; (c) that the family was seriously contemplating sending him to Bangladesh; (d)  that he had a serious anger problem and would break things in the house; (e)  that he owed all his friends money; and (f) that he had been involved in shoplifting and an arson attack at the local Mosque.</p>

A had clearly spoken to C, and  C reported to the expert what A had said.  As Miss Hudson made it clear that the local authority was not minded to rely on what C had said.

The fact that it was being discussed in the community would put the family in a very difficult position, The family was going through a very difficult time. A, the expert thought,  felt responsible, and the expert worried for  A&#8217;s safety. However, the expert found it  difficult to say how dangerous disclosure would be. People had  been killed for less.</p>

The expert&#8217;s view was that  what A was trying to do was to bring the family back together. She was attached to her family, but feared the family&#8217;s reaction both because much of the information was coming from her and because it was in the public domain. The information needed to be well managed and controlled.</p>

That was also the submission of the other parties. Miss Hudson accepted that none of the information was of direct relevance to the threshold findings sought by the local authority, and accepted that, on its face,  it appeared that A&#8217;s father had been aware of the assertion made about her mother, and that his response had been controlled, and had not affected A&#8217;s welfare. So far as the disclosures by AF&#8217;s family were concerned, they appeared both to justify A&#8217;s parents&#8217; concerned about him. They were, in addition, matters which A needed to know about (if they were true) and they might well in any event, come out in the criminal proceedings. Finally, as Miss Hudson was not minded to rely on C, there was no reason why what C had said to the expert should not be disclosed.</p>

Experts in Children Act cases cannot receive information &#8220;in confidence&#8221; from anybody.  All relevant information must, normally, be shared with the other parties and the court. It is for this reason that the expert&#8217;s report will invariably be disclosed whatever it says.  The  duty of the expert is to be objective and wholly free from bias in favour of one party or the other.
