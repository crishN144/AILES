She is the only child of the Applicant mother (&#8220;the mother&#8221;) and the Respondent father (&#8220;father&#8221;); the parties are married but separated.  The mother is a Bulgarian national, with indefinite leave to remain in this country; the father has dual Bulgarian and British nationality.  Both parents have lived in England for many years.  The mother and Maria are currently in Bulgaria, while the father is in London. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The confusion, and lack of discipline and focus, in the case was illustrated, indeed compounded, by counsel appearing before me on 3 November who filed position statements which addressed principally (indeed the document prepared by Mr Russell Steadman, who was then acting for the mother, exclusively) an application for the father&#8217;s committal to prison for breach of earlier orders; this was not in fact the application which had been listed for hearing.  Moreover, although Ms Villarosa had filed a position statement for the hearing on 3 November on behalf of the father (focusing on the proposed committal but dealing with other matters), very shortly before the hearing was due to begin, the father <span style="font-style:italic">personally</span> filed and served a second lengthy and detailed &#8216;Position Statement&#8217; of his own, replete with new matters of evidence.  Given the significance of its contents, I permitted the document to be filed; Mr Steadman understandably applied for an adjournment for the mother to file a response, which was opposed by Ms Villarosa.  Given this further unfortunate twist, but recognising the need to grapple with the issues in this case, I granted a very short adjournment, restoring the matter before me today (6 November 2020) for further submissions and decisions.  </p>

On 18 December 2019, the father travelled to Bulgaria; it had originally been planned that the mother and Maria would travel with them, but they did not, and followed on 29 December 2019.

She denied that any further physical assault had occurred since the summer. [The mother] declined support from Safecore and also asked that the father not be contacted as she felt that this would put her at risk of further domestic abuse.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother&#8217;s case now (contrary to the impression given to the social worker &#8211; see [8] above) is that this trip to Bulgaria was only ever intended to be a holiday, and she expected that she and the father would return to London together on 5 January 2020.  Shortly before the due date for the return, it is agreed that the father revoked his authority for Maria to travel, and he filed this revocation with the Bulgarian border police.  The mother believes that the father took this step in order to oblige the mother and Maria to remain in Bulgaria, and thereby strengthen his case that the Bulgarian courts should deal with the divorce proceedings which by then he intended to launch; she believes that he saw a financial advantage to himself in the Bulgarian courts dealing with the divorce.  The father&#8217;s case is that the mother chose not to return, having planned to base herself in Bulgaria; further, or alternatively, he felt that the mother was emotionally unstable and revoked his agreement for her to travel in order that the mother would engage with the court process in Bulgaria.   </p>

On 4 February 2020, the father applied for a divorce (and child arrangements and financial relief) through the Bulgarian Court.  Confusingly, on 21 February the English Court issued a second divorce petition on the mother&#8217;s application (bearing the same case number).  The mother claims that the Bulgarian divorce proceedings have not been served on her, a fact disputed by the father who points out that the mother applied successfully on 16 March 2020 within the Bulgarian proceedings for those proceedings to be transferred to her local court. The father has confirmed, by an Answer filed in England on 16 March, his intention to defend the English divorce proceedings on the basis of the divorce proceedings in Bulgaria; the English divorce proceedings have therefore currently been stayed. </p>

While I fully understand that, on the evidence presented by the mother at the without notice hearing on 16 March 2020, it may well have been in Judd J&#8217;s mind that, absent such an order, the father may not engage in, or attend court for, these proceedings, I am satisfied that the father has now shown that he is actively engaging and participating in the proceedings, and that such an order is no longer necessary to secure the father&#8217;s active engagement. </p>

The father has lived in the UK for over 10 years; he became a citizen in 2016.  The father co-owns a property in London, he has a career in the UK in a secure and senior position on a permanent full-time contract with the National Health Service.  His employer has confirmed that he has not given notice to terminate his employment.  The assertion that the father has told the mother that he wishes to work and/or establish a new family in Germany is not supported (unlike many other allegations in this case) by any corroborative evidence.  </p>

A more effective and legitimate form of compulsion will be the renewal of the order made by Judd J requiring him to execute the necessary documents, buttressed by an <span style="font-style:italic">effective</span> penal notice, and a time-limit for compliance (see [46] below).

I consider that, on her return, the mother should self-refer to the Children&#8217;s Services department of the local authority which had supported the family previously (see [6] above), so that they may be aware of the new family situation.  While I am conscious of the travel history in 2018/2019, I am not satisfied that this constitutes &#8216;yo-yoing&#8217; between the two jurisdictions; nor is reason to believe that Maria will &#8216;yo-yo&#8217; between the two jurisdictions now.  The father has not previously mentioned Maria&#8217;s heart condition notwithstanding his lengthy and detailed statements.  Maria travelled between England and Bulgaria five times in the first two years of her life without health incident; I cannot help but feel that if this had been a real and genuine concern, he would have raised it in one of his documents &#8211; indeed, I consider that it would have been a point of importance for him.  </p>

It seems to me that stranding Maria and her mother in Bulgaria is only likely to increase the difficulties for the father in having meaningful contact with his daughter.  Given the current travel restrictions and quarantining requirements between the two countries caused by the coronavirus pandemic, should the father travel to Bulgaria now or over Christmas as he plans, he would have to dedicate a large proportion of his trip for self-quarantining before he could meet up with Maria.  By contrast, if Maria were to be returned with her mother to this jurisdiction, then (after a period of quarantining here) he would be able far more easily and readily to spend time with her thus removing one clear obstacle to the restoration of their relationship.  This not insignificant benefit to the father, and to Maria, was neither addressed nor acknowledged anywhere in his submissions; surprisingly, and contrary to the father&#8217;s stated concerns about alienation, I was told by Ms Villarosa that the father is &#8220;happy to wait&#8221; to see Maria.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother is likely, as Mr Clark acknowledges if not concedes, to have considerable difficulties in proving beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the passport order was served on the father (21 March 2020), the father&#8217;s Bulgarian passport and Maria&#8217;s British passport were &#8220;in [the father&#8217;s] possession or control&#8221;. It is accepted that the father <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> at that time hand over his British passport and his Bulgarian ID card which raises a reasonable inference that had he had possession of these other travel documents he would have handed them over.  Furthermore, as I have indicated above, the father has in fact provided evidence (see [18] above) of his inability to comply with the order in relation to these documents; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Arguments arise on the facts of this case about <span style="font-style:italic">lis pendens</span>, complicated by the fact that in England two petitions have been issued (bearing the same number) one before and one after the issue of divorce proceedings in Bulgaria.  The father appears to have issued child arrangements proceedings in Bulgaria in early February 2020 with the petition, whereas the mother issued wardship proceedings only on 16 March 2020. There is also plainly a dispute between these parents as to where Maria is habitually resident.  The father&#8217;s case is that the mother and Maria have been permanently, and habitually, resident in Bulgaria since March 2018, visiting this country only sporadically in that period.  He refers to the fact that the mother last left this country on 29 December 2019 with &#8220;five heavy bags of luggage&#8221; having told the local social services department that she was &#8220;not planning on returning to the UK&#8221; (see [8] above). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The mother&#8217;s case, in summary, is that England is the court first seised of the divorce, and that Maria is habitually resident in England, and has been all of her life.  Her absences from this country have been occasioned by the need to obtain family support during Maria&#8217;s early infancy, and to offer respite from the alleged abuse from the father.  In computing her periods of actual residence in England, she invites the court to ignore the period since January 2020, given that she has been unable to leave Bulgaria without the father&#8217;s permission. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">As I have mentioned above, there is concurrent family litigation in the two jurisdictions; I regard it as necessary to clarify precisely what applications and issues are before the Bulgarian Court, when they were issued, and how far they have proceeded.  I am keen to avoid duplication of judicial decision-making, and to achieve clarity vis-&#224;-vis the Bulgarian courts on the issue of habitual residence and/or primary jurisdiction.  In this regard, during the course of the hearing, I made contact with the International Family Justice Office (IFJO) to establish whether the Hague Network Judges could possibly liaise over these issues in accordance with the guidance 'Direct Judicial Communications' ('DJC') published by the Hague Conference on Private </p>
