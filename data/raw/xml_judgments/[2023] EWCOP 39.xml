Dr H made himself available to give evidence, at short notice, in order to answer the questions raised by the family. The family suggested that Mrs VA was aware of their presence and displayed physical responses such as moving her eyes and crying at appropriate times. I found Dr H to be measured, kind and entirely willing to engage with the family&#8217;s enquiries. Mrs VA&#8217;s level of consciousness has been referred to as &#8220;vegetative state&#8221;. Dr H, who has not appeared before me before, spontaneously volunteered that he did not like the term. I agree with him and have said so in previous judgments. It is a phrase that, to my mind, provokes inevitable distress and resentment. It is an uncomfortable term to apply to a human being. Mrs VA is at the lowest end of the spectrum of a profound disorder of consciousness. Nothing further requires to be said. </span></p>

However, he very properly recognised that an absolute answer to this is, and probably always will be, impossible. It cannot be tested, it requires the disproval of a negative. Dr H was prepared to say and without hesitation, that there may be some vestigial capacity to experience both distress and sensory pleasure which may endure after conscious awareness has been lost. This is important, not least because it validates the family&#8217;s experience of their mother at the end of her life. </span></p>

She is, at this stage in her life, vulnerable. She told me she has nowhere to live and is moving from place to place at the moment. Her grief is almost palpable. </span></p>

As I have commented to Mr Fullwood, who acts on behalf of the Trust, I have not found the logic which underpinned the basis for those apparently equal alternatives, easy to identify in either the written or oral evidence. The change in the Trust&#8217;s position has, unfortunately, reinforced the family&#8217;s general resistance to the hospital. </span></p>

In summary, it is said that Mrs VA would not wish to be extubated and that ceilings of care and DNACPR order are not appropriate. She states that she will be in Saudi Arabia on the date of the hearing but is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;willing to be contacted at any time to provide any further clarification&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">That language, which was reflected in MA&#8217;s oral evidence, crystalises a misunderstanding in this family that the nature and extent of their mother&#8217;s treatment is somehow within their gift or authority. It is not. Mrs VA has lived a full, courageous and busy life. Her present incapacity does not infantilise her. An instinctive response to look after an elderly mother does not mean that the mother&#8217;s autonomy may be taken away from her. The family&#8217;s role, as they have come to understand in this hearing, is to help the Court understand, to the extent that it is possible, what Mrs VA would want in her present circumstances. This can now only be understood by endeavouring to understand Mrs VA&#8217;s character and personality, what she may have said, if anything, in contemplation of her current situation. The code by which she has lived her life. </span></p>

Dr C clarified that Mrs VA&#8217;s brain is in a process of atrophy. She is generally weaker and her muscle tone and function is also deteriorating. She does not require mechanical ventilation or treatment in ICU. She is receiving room level oxygen and can breathe independently. Her challenge is that she has a weak cough which could be managed effectively with deep suctioning via tracheostomy on the ward. Self-evidently, that is an intrusive procedure. Dr C, in common with all the other doctors, is clear, for reasons to which I have already alluded that treatment of any kind is, and has been for some time, futile. It is also burdensome.</span></p>

The first 24 hours would be key. If Mrs VA managed, this would permit the potential for her to be moved to a room, off the ward, for further care. If it were not successful, she would need medication to limit her secretions, less intrusive suctioning and this might not be successful. To confront the reality, it might lead to her death. As the doctors have made perfectly clear, Mrs VA is dying. Her children struggle to accept this and hope for reversal of their mother&#8217;s medical fortunes. </span></p>

Each case will be both situational and person specific. In this respect there is a striking resonance both with the framework of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> and the jurisprudence which underpins it. The forensic approach is 'subjective', in the sense that it requires all involved, family members, treating clinicians, the Courts to conduct an intense focus on the individual at the centre of the process. Frequently, it will involve drilling down into the person's life, considering what he or she may have said or written and a more general evaluation of the code and values by which they have lived their life.</span></p>

She qualified as a midwife and brought up six children, largely on her own. She was plainly a focused and determined woman. All the family agreed, with smiles that were rare in this sad case, that MA, the eldest daughter, was most like her mother. That had become obvious, even before it was articulated. MA regularly intervened, out of order, notwithstanding that she was appearing remotely from Saudi Arabia. At one point, it was she and not me who decided in which order the family should give their evidence. I emphasise that I was amused and not in any way offended. Even she realised she was being rather bossy. Her manner, her style, her strength of character, her eloquence and intelligence brought a great deal of her mother into this courtroom. </span></p>

The siblings nodded in agreement as she advanced her argument. In this family however, the siblings have various degrees of identification with their culture and/or religion. MA, who appeared in niqab from Saudi Arabia plainly has a much stronger identification with her Muslim faith than the other siblings, who have different lives and experiences. Mrs VA was also quite eclectic. V particularly remembers her enthusiasm for &#8220;Songs of Praise&#8221;. This sense of responsibility and deep-seated belief in their duty to their mother has, in my judgement, paradoxically, diverted their focus onto what they think might be the right thing to do and not, as it should be, what is in their mother&#8217;s best interests. </span></p>

Each of these children return their mother&#8217;s love fulsomely. As they have matured, they told me that they have appreciated how incredibly strong and independent she was. She embraced the UK but remained a &#8220;proud African woman&#8221;, as MA described her. Part of that pride involved having a strong sense of privacy. She found particular solace in the space of her own home. V lived there until his early 30s. He told me, in a gentle way, that he had struggled to break free. </span></p>

It could happen to anybody and the experience of this Court is that many do have such conversations. Increasingly, people make Advance Decisions setting out what their wishes would be.

Even then, her wishes and feelings would not be determinative. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Mrs VA is dying. She has a chance of doing so in the relative privacy and peace of the ward, perhaps even in a nursing home. With luck her children may share that privacy with her. Within the narrow ambit of what can be done, this is a not insignificant change for her. Extubation, palliative care focusing on giving Mrs VA the best quality of life, at the end of her life, is, I find, what is in her best interests. Accordingly, I grant the declaration sought by the Trust. It is important that I emphasise that the Official Solicitor who has attended personally throughout this hearing supported the Trust&#8217;s application, having heard all the evidence. </span></p>
