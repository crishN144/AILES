The younger child, Z (a boy), was born in October 2021. The Mother (&#8220;M&#8221;) says that the relationship, from a very early point, was characterised by the Father (&#8220;F&#8221;) being abusive. She records in her witness statements many instances of him being angry, aggressive and controlling of her. The F, as will become clear below, accepts that he was at times angry and verbally abusive, but places much of the responsibility for this on the M&#8217;s behaviour. </p>

The F was arrested and then released on bail. The F has been charged but the case has not yet reached trial. The M obtained an ex parte non-molestation order, which was made a final order by agreement on the basis of the F making no admissions and no findings being made. </p>

The case took, as is sadly common, a very slow procedural course. A safeguarding letter was served by Cafcass on 29 June 2022 in which they recommended that &#8220;the Court list this matter for consideration to be given to a fact find.&#8221; On 21 November 2022 the parties were directed to file witness statements and responses and the matter was then listed for a hearing on 19 January 2023 to determine whether a fact finding hearing was necessary.</p>

The Magistrates ordered that a fact finding hearing be held to determine the physical abuse allegations only; that the M file a Scott Schedule setting out no more than 5 allegations of physical abuse; the F to file a response; the M was directed to file the recordings she had of conversations with the F. Neither party asked the Court to determine the other allegations. </p>

The F&#8217;s solicitors then questioned the need for a fact finding hearing in the light of the admissions that the F had made. These admissions are set out in the F&#8217;s response to the Scott Schedule and in his witness statement. It is worth noting that the admissions are highly caveated because although the F accepts that he used vile and aggressive language to the M and in front of the children, each admission is then rapidly followed by the suggestion that this was caused by the M&#8217;s unreasonable behaviour. Perhaps more importantly than the F&#8217;s admissions was the fact that the M had placed before the Court a large number of recordings and transcripts of the conversations that had taken place between the parents. </p>

Mr Vine accepted that the first four Grounds went to a case management decision, and therefore required that the Court gave an extension of time. However, he submitted that the fifth Ground, based on the Magistrates having made findings against the M, was a final decision and not a case management decision, and therefore no extension of time was required.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view this is a misunderstanding of what a case management decision is. The decision of the Magistrates was that it was not necessary to hold a separate fact finding hearing, and rather that the case should proceed to a final hearing. That decision is undoubtedly a case management decision. They did not purport to &#8220;find facts&#8221; as some kind of separate determination. I will consider below the degree to which in many private law cases it is possible or useful to draw a bright line division between fact finding and best interests considerations.  But, in any event, the Magistrates were not purporting to &#8220;find facts&#8221;, but were merely indicating that there was quite sufficient evidential material upon which Cafcass could produce a s.7 report with recommendations. </p>

Cafcass routinely has to weigh and analyse evidence in making recommendations. The Court does, in appropriate cases, make findings of fact which, certainly in public law, are treated as binary. But Cafcass officers weigh and analyse the evidence put forward by parents on a daily basis and that forms part of their assessment of the best interests of the children. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The next issue is whether time should be extended. The Appellant&#8217;s Skeleton submitted, without authority, that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Denton v TH White Ltd.</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/906" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 906" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 906</ref> does not apply in the Family jurisdiction, but Mr Vine accepted there is no authority for such a proposition. Plainly, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Denton</span> and its predecessor <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mitchell v News Group Newspapers </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 WLR 795" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 WLR 795</ref>, were cases under the Civil Procedure Rules (&#8220;CPR&#8221;) and not the Family Procedure Rules (&#8220;FPR&#8221;). There are additional considerations under the FPR, namely the interests of the child as set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. Albeit, the interests of the child will not be a &#8220;paramount&#8221; consideration, because this is not a welfare based decision, those interests remain a highly relevant matter in any decision under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. However, it is important to remember that the interests of the child may pull in different directions when it comes to non-compliance with the FPR. The interests of the child, both in general and in this specific case, are strongly in favour of minimising delay and dealing with cases efficiently. Therefore the stricter and more rigorous approach to issues of non-compliance set out by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Denton</span> is, in general, strongly in the interests of the children in Family Court proceedings.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;We consider that the guidance given at paras 40 and 41 of Mitchell remains substantially sound. However, in view of the way in which it has been interpreted, we propose to restate the approach that should be applied in a little more detail. A judge should address an application for relief from sanctions in three stages. The first stage is to identify and assess the seriousness and significance of the &#8220;failure to comply with any rule, practice direction or court order&#8221; which engages rule 3.9(1) . If the breach is neither serious nor significant, the court is unlikely to need to spend much time on the second and third stages. The second stage is to consider why the default occurred. The third stage is to evaluate &#8220;all the circumstances of the case, so as to enable [the court] to deal justly with the application including [factors (a) and (b)]&#8221;. We shall consider each of these stages in turn identifying how they should be applied in practice. We recognise that hard-pressed first instance judges need a clear exposition of how the provisions of rule 3.9(1) should be given effect. We hope that what follows will avoid the need in future to resort to the earlier authorities.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Here the default was serious in the sense that it was a failure to lodge the originating application, the appeal notice, within the time allowed under the Rules. However, the period in issue was quite short. A failure to lodge an appeal in time is in my view a serious or significant default because such time rules go to the fundamental discipline and finality of litigation. A party is generally entitled to assume that once the time for filing an appeal is past, then the order which has been made is final. This is rather different from a failure to lodge a particular document, such as a skeleton argument or witness statement on time where the proceedings are themselves in order and ongoing. However, the time period in issue here, 7 days, was short. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second stage is the reasons for the default, see [29]-[30]. The reasons advanced here are that the solicitor did not realise that this was a case management decision and therefore that the time period was 7 days; and that counsel, despite repeated &#8220;chasing&#8221;, failed to produce the attendance note. In a CPR case, such failure by lawyers would not generally be considered a good reason for failure to comply, see the White Book para 3.9.16. However, it is at this point that there is a material difference between many civil cases and Family cases. In civil cases the potential to recover damages/financial compensation from the party&#8217;s lawyers at least in part compensates for the default of the lawyers. However, given the nature of the issues, there is unlikely to be financial compensation for default in Children Act cases.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view the consequence of this is that where the default is solely the fault of the litigant&#8217;s legal advisors then that is more likely to lead to relief from sanction in a Family case than in a civil case. This does not, of course, mean that default by lawyers will necessarily result in the court granting relief. </p>

In practice there has been detrimental impact because the effect of the appeal has been to extend proceedings by many months. However, that is in large part because of delays in the court process. Further, the reason for the failure to lodge in time was that of the lawyers and not the M. Given all those factors together it is appropriate to extend time. </p>

As discussed at paragraphs 36&#8211;41 above that does not, however, mean that in every case where there is an allegation of, even very serious, domestic abuse it will be either appropriate or necessary for there to be a finding of fact hearing, so much is clear from the detailed guidance set out in paragraphs 16&#8211;20 of PD12J and, in particular, at paragraph 17:</span></p>

The process will inevitably introduce delay and postpone anything other than an interim determination of issues relating to the child's welfare, which is contrary to the statutorily identified general principle that any delay in resolving issues is likely to be prejudicial to a child's welfare (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>). Further, the litigation of factual issues between parents is likely to be adversarial and, whatever the outcome, to have a negative impact on their ongoing relationship and ability to cooperate with each other as parents. It is therefore important for the court, in every case where fact-finding is being considered, to take time to identify the welfare issues, to understand the nature of the allegations, and then to consider whether the facts alleged are relevant to those issues and whether it is, therefore, necessary for the factual dispute to be determined.&#8221;</span></p>

To require a court to go through such a process would be highly onerous, and to a considerable degree a &#8220;tick-box&#8221; exercise.  The duty on the court is to consider whether a fact find is necessary and proportionate, and to have regard to PD12J, including the matters in paragraph 5, and apply the relevant caselaw. The Appellant accepts that the Magistrates were advised both as to PD12J and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">K v K</span>.

A fact find is only justified if it is necessary for determining the welfare outcomes for the children. On the facts of this case the Court had plentiful material on the parents&#8217; past conduct. Both parents, presumably with the support of their lawyers, have put in 100s of pages about what had happened in the relationship, much of it of very little forensic value to the issue that is actually before the court. The Magistrates were in my view entirely correct to conclude that they did not have to have a hearing to make findings of fact about this past conduct. In particular they had transcripts of communications between the parents, which could not be disputed, and which gave them sufficient understanding of the parents&#8217; conduct to determine the welfare outcomes for the children. </p>

The holding of separate fact finding hearings, and the concept of findings of fact being &#8220;binary&#8221; emerged from public law cases. In public law cases under Part IV of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, it will often be necessary to make findings of fact before threshold is crossed, see (inter alia) <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse)</span> 1996 AC 563.

The neat categorisation of truth and untruth and hard binary facts, often sits uneasily with the reality of failed relationships.
