As a result, not wishing to be over familiar or disrespectful in any way but to ensure clarity, we have referred to the family members by their first name, and where appropriate by the European name.  Thus the Applicant has been referred to as G, the First Respondent as K and the deceased variously as E: (he was also known as Et in the papers).  I propose to continue to use the relevant first names in this Judgment to maintain as much clarity as possible.</p>

He had a number of children, including three sons.  He, his immediate family, and in particular his three sons occupied the compound.  E&#8217;s father was the middle son.  He became Chief J.

Much has been made of this part of the form and his crossing out of &#8220;is&#8221; leaving &#8220;was&#8221;, and it is said on behalf of K and A this is indicative of there having been a divorce.  That is not confirmed as he fails to define his marital status leaving it open.  He failed also to cross out &#8220;he&#8221; when describing &#8220;his wife&#8221;, and he gives a date of birth which bears no resemblance to her stated age of 90 in August 2012.

Had he been born in 1926 he would have been 77.  Likewise, if G was born in 1935 as E stated she would be 78 and not 93 as she stated in evidence.  I was able to see G on a video link.  She clearly is elderly, but the link was poor and added to difficulties in considering and assessing her age.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Polygamy is, or was, very much accepted by the Igbo.  E&#8217;s own father had 25 wives, and various family members who gave evidence supported this by saying that he was a half-brother to E, or the son of a half-brother to E.  Given his background E would have been very aware that polygamy was permitted and accepted in Nigeria.  This is a matter which I have borne in mind when considering the evidence.</p>

The issue was raised during the hearing.  However, Dr Joseph Ichongiri, the jointly instructed expert in Igbo customary law relating to marriage and divorce, dispelled any doubts and confirmed that in his opinion there was no doubt, and accepted there had been a valid marriage between E and G.

As such she would be expected to sit on the ground on a mat during the ceremonies and to receive visitors.  It would be normal to cut or shave her hair, and wear black mourning cloth.  A number of DVDs were produced of a ritual burial ceremony for E in March 2009.  There has been much debate over the DVDs, and clearly they have been edited in various ways.  In any event as the ceremonies took place over several days they could not have shown everything.  There is a short clip of G sitting on a mattress covered with a mat, propped up against a wall with a pillow.  Her daughters say this represents her role as chief mourner, and &#8216;first wife&#8217;.  She has not had her hair cut, and is not wearing black.
