When he was 6 years old, he suffered a brain injury as a result of a road traffic accident.  His childhood and adult life have been characterised by involvement in risky, impulsive, reckless and dangerous behaviours; in adulthood, this has often been aggravated by alcohol consumption and gambling.  The reports and statements carry further, worrying, descriptions of aggression and violence, inappropriate sexualised conduct with others, occasional opportunistic criminal acts, and absconding behaviours.  He has received psychiatric services under the <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19" uk:canonical="1983 c. 19" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MHA 1983</ref></span> on and off all his adult life (his first admission to psychiatric inpatient services was when he was aged 17).   </p>

He appealed unsuccessfully against the imposition of this order in January 2019.  He now lives in supported living with two (or possibly three) others, all with mental health needs; he has his own bedroom and he shares his communal living area.  He regularly fails to adhere to the basic principles of living in a therapeutic community; AS continues to challenge the structure and boundaries in his current placement.  Given the vulnerabilities of the other service users, and AS&#8217;s particular propensities, he is supervised at all times when socialising with them.  Without the CTO, he would not be able to live in supported accommodation; the professionals working with him feel that this environment ensures that his behaviour is regulated effectively, and helps to achieve reasonable stability in his mental health. </p>

My note of AS&#8217;s own account of this incident is as follows: &#8220;A couple of weeks ago, I went out.  I went out on my own.  I asked for my mobile phone, and the person on shift would not let me have it, so I went out, and the person [member of staff] followed me, and to the bus&#8230; to the university in Sunderland, and I went to Newcastle.  When I left the house, I did not have my mobile so I could not contact anyone, it was as if they did not care.  My mobile is kept in the office.  I was in Newcastle all day, walking about, and I did report into the police station in Sunderland, to let the police know that I was out and about on my own.  I got back at 6pm in time for my evening medication.  I had left at 8.30am that day.  The carers were not happy that I had left.  I was being followed &#8230;. the police said I was fine.&#8221; </p>

That said, however, it is much more difficult to imagine a case where someone has litigation capacity whilst lacking subject-matter capacity than it is to imagine a case where someone has subject-matter capacity whilst lacking litigation capacity. Whilst it is not difficult to think of situations where someone has subject-matter capacity whilst lacking litigation capacity, and such cases may not be that rare, I suspect that cases where someone has litigation capacity whilst lacking subject-matter capacity are likely to be very much more infrequent, indeed pretty rare. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that only in unusual circumstances will it be possible to conclude that someone who lacks subject-matter capacity can nonetheless have litigation capacity.&#8221; </p>

These conditions interact and most surface-level symptoms are manifestations of one or more of these conditions&#8230; There are also a number of general factors, related to one or more of the above conditions, which influences AS&#8217;s capacity in numerous areas. These are: AS&#8217;s concrete thinking which limits his ability to think hypothetically leaving his understanding based on direct experiences only.  AS often becomes quickly emotionally aroused and his inability to manage his behaviour at these times also prevents him thinking clearly or weighing information, the affect needing to burn itself out before he becomes cognitively receptive again.&#8221; </p>

However, in terms of his personality, he remains very fixated on his own needs, is impulsive and unable to delay gratification and can quickly become emotionally aroused and physiologically agitated often by minor provocation, across various situations and in relation to multiple individuals.  The overall picture therefore is of a highly variable, changeable and difficult-to-manage individual due to a complex mix of problematic personality traits, learning disability &#8230; some frontal lobe damage (impairing panning and emotional selfmanagement) and the recently raised possibility of mental illness (bi-polar disorder).&#8221; </p>

She listened to AS&#8217;s &#8216;evidence&#8217; in court; she listened to the brief evidence of the social worker in relation to the unaccompanied visit out of his supported accommodation, and she read counsels&#8217; position statements.   While the conclusions which she had reached, and set out in the written reports, have been overtaken by events, there is, in my judgment, still material of value within her evidence-gathering and analysis.   She highlighted the relevance of the approach set out at #1.4.19 of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence and Care Guidance on &#8216;Decision Making &#8230;&#8217; which had : </p>

When I looked at my reasoning in relation to care, I realise that I have over-emphasised his ability to look at care plans and the specifics, and they only work because they are held together by staff being there 24/7.  AS does not understand that as a concept in relation to his overall well-being.  AS is very concrete in his thinking, and very focused on immediacy, and he struggles with the overarching structure and the nebulous; partly his resistance and partly his lack of ability to understand.  He cannot consider the consequences of deterioration&#8230; he can focus on the practical but not otherwise. One piece of relevant information would be his understanding of <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> having the care.
