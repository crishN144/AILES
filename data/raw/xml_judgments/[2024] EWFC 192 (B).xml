She is the first child of Ms R and Mr Q.    It was agreed half way through the hearing that A prefers to be called A and that is how I will refer to her in this judgment.    A was made the subject of a Care Order and a Placement Order on   20.4.2022.   The two applications before me are  for the Placement Order to be discharged,  an application dated 8.9.2023 and brought by the LB Lewisham  who hold the Placement Order,    and an application  for A to be adopted.     The applicants for A &#8216;s adoption are Mr and Ms X ,  and theirs is a private application,   in other words,   A has not been placed by the LB Lewisham  with Mr and Ms X pursuant to the Placement Order;     rather,   Mr and Ms X are the foster carers who have cared for A since she left hospital,  and who now wish for her to become their child.    I gave permission to Mr and Ms X to apply to adopt A    on 20.11.2023 and their application is dated 20.11.23.         Mr and Ms X are a British couple of Caribbean heritage.</span></p>

I allowed these to come in to save time.   Also I think on the fourth day LB Lewisham  provided a report from Kirsty Dunne,   the systemic therapist working with Mr Q,  and A it appeared,    on the work she has done so far.</span></p>

Her first child lives with his father.     Her third child B lives with Mr Q ;   her fourth child by another father is the subject of a Care Order and a Placement Order.     There are various assessments of Ms R,   not all of which reach the same conclusions but for the purposes of this hearing it can be summarised that A&#8217;s mother had a significant learning disability so that at times the Court of Protection have made decisions for her,    and that she also has autism and traits of an emotionally unstable personality disorder.      The Local Authority did not think that Ms R could raise a child,  even with support,  and thus the Local Authority commenced care proceedings when A was born;     much less was known about Mr Q and both parents were assessed during the proceedings.    A is Mr Q&#8217;s first child.</span></p>

Mr Morson flagged up the possibility that Mr Q&#8217;s skills were greater than how he was able to talk about and present them,  but concluded:   &#8220;&#8220;Mr Q cannot provide safe good enough care at present for A due to concerns regarding his poor parenting knowledge and skills that go beyond those that would be expected for a first time parent.&#8221;</span></p>

I found that he, along with Ms R,  put A at risk on the day of her birth,   and that he was unable to prioritise A over Ms R at an incident in August 2021 when Ms R became angry at contact.      I found that he was in a loving relationship with Ms R but that he lacked the parenting skills at that time to care for A and that &#8220; his dishonest attitude gets in the way of him working with professionals and accessing the help he will need to make the necessary changes. He has been unable to make the very difficult decision, which would have been to break with Ms R with a view to being considered as a potential carer on his own. He presents himself to the court both as a man living on his own but also as a man who intends to live with Ms R and A and the new baby. He cannot see the difficulties. He has not accepted, when speaking with the guardian quite recently, that Ms R has the difficulties we know</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:16pt">It is common ground that adoption of A by Mr and Ms X was in the Local Authority&#8217;s contemplation from the beginning of those proceedings and Mr and Ms X were aware of this and very interested.    In the judgment I mention that A&#8217;s current foster carer wished to adopt A,  and possibly the new baby whom Ms R was carrying at the time.   Soon after the conclusion of A&#8217;s proceedings,   Ms R gave birth to B on 7.7.2022,   also Mr Q&#8217;s child.   The Local Authority commenced care procs on 10.7.2022 and when B left hospital he was placed w Mr and Ms X where he was cared for along with A .     Again,  the Local Authority were open with Mr and Ms X that they hoped that they would be able to adopt B alongside A.      Mr and Ms X were approved as adopters but this plan never got to matching panel;     it was at this point that Mr Q separated from Ms R .     Mr Morson prepared a further assessment report in September 2022 on Mr Q  on his own.   He found that Mr Q had taken in very little of the detail of the issues which Mr Morson had found Mr Q needed to address in his previous reports.    However,  Mr Morson believed that the parental relationship was over;   he again identified a disconnect between Mr Q&#8217;s observed parenting skills and his ability to answer questions designed to explore his understanding of parenting.      He was still concerned about Mr Q&#8217;s ability to take on board professional advice due to his tendency to challenge any contradictory feedback almost as a default position. He concluded that there needed to be further work done and recommended a residential unit,  which is what happened next.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:16pt">Mr Q was placed in a residential unit with B and he excelled there.    When B&#8217;s case came to final hearing,   it was agreed that there was no need for any public law order,  and the court made a Child Arrangements Order to Mr Q on 16.3.2023.     The LA then decided to commission an assessment outside proceedings as to whether Mr Q could parent both B and A and this was carried out by Ms T at the Meliot Centre and was positive.   It was very much an assessment of the ability of Mr Q and his sister Ms P with whom he was living to care for the two children together,  though the assessor comments that in her view Mr Q could parent both on his own.   It is dated 19.5.2023.    The Local Authority made this application nearly 4 months later,    applying to revoke the Placement Order.   Their initial plan had been to move A to Mr Q without going to court first.</span></p>

LB Lewisham and Mr Q both agree that A should continue her relationship with Mr and Ms X in such circumstances and that the court could and probably should make a contact order.   LB Lewisham  do not agree with Dr Willemsen&#8217;s proposals for contact and suggest visiting contact between A and Mr and Ms X about 3 times a year,  such contact to be in the presence of Mr Q .    LB Lewisham  does not agree with Dr Willemsen&#8217;s opinion that the transition to Mr Q should be extended to 6 weeks and prefer that this happens in 4 weeks.    Mr Q&#8217;s Position Statement says that he supports contact taking place with Mr and Ms X as recommended by professionals.</span></p>

The key application for them is their own adoption application which I gave them leave to make on 20.11.2023.   They needed leave because  they had not been able to give formal notice to the Local Authority of their intention to apply to adopt A 3 months before making their application.     That was all dealt with in November 2023 and the two applications have run alongside since then.     If I make the adoption order to Mr and Ms X ,   the Placement Order ends automatically pursuant to s21 (4) (b) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002;    the Care Order on A would also be ended by the making of an Adoption Order pursuant tos46(2)(b) of the ACA 2002.      Mr and Ms X agree that A should continue to have contact with her father and the paternal family if she is adopted by them and are proposing monthly staying contact together with an additional contact for Mr Q on his own.   It is common ground that there should be a contact order.</span></p>

I would then make a CAO to Mr Q which would serve to discharge the current Care Order on A and section 1 of the CA 1989 applies with A&#8217;s welfare being my paramount consideration.

I would apply S47 and S52 of the ACA 2002.    These decisions must be made with s1 of the ACA 2002 in mind and A&#8217;s welfare throughout her life is my paramount consideration.   If I make an adoption order  I could then make an order arranging for A to have contact with her father pursuant to S8 of the Children Act 1989,  and applying S1 of the Children Act1989.

Such further limitations entail the danger that the family relations between a young child and one or both parents would be effectively curtailed. For these reasons, measures which deprive biological parents of the parental responsibilities and authorise adoption should only be applied in exceptional circumstances and can only be justified if they are motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to the child's best interests."</span></p>

In identifying the child's best interests in a particular case, two considerations must be borne in mind: first, it is in the child's best interests that his ties with his family be maintained except in cases where the family has proved particularly unfit; and second, it is in the child's best interests to ensure his development in a safe and secure environment. It is clear from the foregoing that family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and that everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, where appropriate, to "rebuild" the family. It is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing. However, where the maintenance of family ties would harm the child's health and development, a parent is not entitled under Art 8 to insist that such ties be maintained.</span></p>

The court has not previously set out an exhaustive list of such factors, which may vary depending on the circumstances of the case in question. However, it observes that the considerations listed in s 1 of the 2002 Act broadly reflect the various elements inherent in assessing the necessity under Art 8 of a measure placing a child for adoption. In particular, it considers that in seeking to identify the best interests of a child and in assessing the necessity of any proposed measure in the context of placement proceedings, the domestic court must demonstrate that it has had regard to, inter alia, the age, maturity and ascertained wishes of the child, the likely effect on the child of ceasing to be a member of his original family and the relationship the child has with relatives."</span></p>

Foster carers will seldom expect permanence and, indeed, will have been trained so as to be able to support the child moving on if required to do so in time. Whilst undoubtedly foster carers and fostered children may achieve a fondness for each other, the establishment of a firm and secure attachment is not one of the primary aims of the placement, in contrast with adoption. One of the principal benefits of adoption is to achieve a secure, stable, reliable, permanent, lifetime placement for the child in the adoptive family as the adoptive son or daughter of the adopters.</span></p>

At the earlier time when a placement order is being considered, that side of the balance, which must now accommodate the weight to be afforded to the child's place within the adoptive family, simply does not exist. The balance at the placement stage, therefore, naturally tilts towards a family placement where the relatives have been assessed, as these grandparents have, as being able to provide good, long term care for a child within their family. At the placement order stage, the other side of the scales (against a family placement) are likely to be populated by factors such as the risk of harm and the need to protect the child. The question of harm to the child occurring as a result of leaving their current placement will normally not arise as a factor at the pre-placement stage given that such a child is likely to be in temporary foster care and will have to move in any event either on to an adoptive placement or back to the natural family.</span></p>

The circumstances that may contribute to what amounts to a child's 'status quo' can include a whole range of factors, many of which will be practically based, but within that range the significance for the child of any particular relationship is likely to be a highly salient factor. The focus within CA 1989, s 1(3)(c) is upon the 'likely effect on' the child of any change.

However she told me that she also advised A&#8217;s previous social worker in respect of the transition plan which was put forward &#8211; but none of us have seen &#8211; in June 2023.    She sets out in her statement of   17.5.24         the steps LB Lewisham  have taken to implement the advice of Dr Willemsen.  Ms Dunne, Systemic Family Practitioner at Lewisham&#8217;s Meliot Centre was engaged to provide weekly family therapeutic support with Mr Q,  planned for 24 weeks,   with a view to help Mr Q develop insight into A&#8217;s emotional needs and her potential feelings of loss and the impact this may have on her behaviour&#8211; it started in April I believe and Ms Nash spoke of progress with Mr Q.     Her interpretation of what she terms Mr Q&#8217;s reluctance to acknowledge loss and adversity in his own life,   and A&#8217;s experience if she loses her primary attachments is as follows:    &#8220;there has been to some extent a coping strategy as he has had to navigate an unfamiliar state intervention in his life within a different cultural context to that in which he grew up. His commitment to proving that he can meet A&#8217;s needs within her birth family has made him understandably anxious about focusing on past adversity and potential future difficulties.&#8221;</span></p>

I asked Ms Diaz at the end of the evidence to find out if that was the case and indeed it was.   I conclude that Ms Nash was using an inappropriate approach to transition planning,  an approach which failed to take into account many things,  in particular that A would be moving from what she had been raised to consider was her long term family to the care of a parent with whom she was already very familiar but with whom she had never lived.</span></p>

Otherwise,  if there was to be an order she proposes a visit involving A and all the adults three times a year.     In this she is disregarding the view of Dr Willemsen who recommends staying contact with Mr and Ms X to maintain her relationship with them.   She sets out that she thinks it would be problematic for Ms X to maintain contact between A and her birth father if there is an adoption and points to the current difficult working relationship.  She is much more sympathetic to Mr Q in relation to the same issue,  saying:</span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:16pt">&#8220;Mr Q appreciates the care and commitment which Ms X and Mr X have given A since birth and the depth of her attachment to them as her secure base for her all-round development. He is increasingly attuned to the loss A would experience if separated from Ms X and Mr X, and to their ongoing significance in her life both now and in the future if she moves to his care. Even in the oppositional arena of court proceedings he has been able to acknowledge that Ms X is a good person, and when informed last October that Ms X had applied to adopt A he understood that this was because she had fallen in love with his daughter. Nevertheless, he has experienced the removal of his child into foster care, and now also has to contest an adoption application, so it is understandable that he may have struggled previously to appreciate the benefits to A of ongoing direct contact with Ms X and Mr X if A comes to live with him.&#8221;</span></p>

However,   when it was raised at the hearing on 10.6.2024 that Mr and Ms X &#8216;s lawyer wanted to see any case notes relating to such conversations,    it appears that it was then that Ms Nash thought it appropriate to discuss with Mr Q and Ms P his dishonesty in the previous proceedings.

Ms Nash however candidly admitted in her evidence that she knew that the plan was to place A with Mr Q and she did not at any point apply her own assessment.   This is one of the remarkable things about this case:    the adherence by the  four social workers,  three of whom have given evidence, to the LB Lewisham line without at any point in their written evidence considering A&#8217;s welfare and needs in a holistic way.    In their oral evidence they were to a greater or lesser extent able to see the benefits to A of staying with Mr and Ms X but were not prepared to revisit their recommendations.   </span></p>

For example,   Ms Nash and her colleagues explained that Mr Q&#8217;s dishonesty in the first set of proceedings could be put down to his lack of understanding as a new arrival,  indeed an overstayer, in this country of how things worked;    the fact that A showed herself to be less relaxed in his care was put down to the presence of observers,  rather than to his struggles to build a relationship with her.

This was despite the social worker learning from Mr and Ms X that A was very interested in aeroplanes and that Mr and Ms X wanted to take her on one to stimulate that interest.   Mr and Ms X then asked if they could take A on a plane to Edinburgh instead but when Mr Q objected,  it was the Local Authority decision to refuse to allow the prospective adopters to take A to Scotland because,  as Ms Nash accepted, they wanted to support the father&#8217;s position in every way.

In Ms Nash&#8217;s statement,  and in the emails which were finally disclosed between her and Mr Q and Ms P  ,   it became apparent that Ms Nash was of the view that the difficulties between the adults at handover were caused primarily by Mr and Ms X ;    a careful analysis of the primary evidence however showed that this was not true and that Mr Q,  maybe for understandable reasons,   struggled to be polite or friendly with Mr and Ms X .     Ms Nash opined that A was not affected by Mr Q and Ms P  examining her and putting in the contact book on each occasion of contact any marks or bumps.    However,   the primary evidence was clear that A was indeed affected by this,  with her sleep disturbed,  and she was very conscious indeed of what her father and aunt were doing and was worried about it.</span></p>

I cannot rely on her professional opinion in this complex case however for many reasons:     she has not done the work I would have expected to be done before preparing the Local Authority&#8217;s main statement in this case as I have already set out;   she has not done it since;    she has not considered all the evidence;    she has accepted the Local Authority&#8217;s position and at no point appears to have considered whether it is the right position for this little girl;     Ms Nash told me that the statement contained her view;    I am not sure that I accept that : - if these are her views then it is not possible to understand how she formed them other than applying a simplistic and misunderstood version of the law which is that if a child has a birth parent who can care for her,  that is where she should be;   overall she has not acted fairly or considered A&#8217;s best interests in a holistic way;  I do not think she knows this child.</span></p>

Ms Rogers&#8217; statement says as follows:   Ms Khan had been A&#8217;s IRO for 2 years to May 2024 and had full knowledge of A&#8217;s case and situation.    Ms Khan reported her observations of A in her foster placement where she found her confident and bubbly;  the nursery said she was happy and sociable and functioning above her age.  On 8.4.2024 Ms Khan observed A in the care of her father and aunt and found her to be subdued and anxious.    She noted that B appeared happy with good attachment to his father and aunt.   Ms Khan recorded that she held concerns about Mr Q&#8217;s capacity to meet A&#8217;s emotional needs,  particularly in respect of any loss and trauma she may experience,   and noted a strained relationship between Mr and Ms X and the Q and P family.</span></p>

She always greets me with a huge smile on her face and gets very excited to share her toys and books and very proud to show her bedroom. Therefore, I was really sad to see a subdued and withdrawn A  when I visited her at her dad's house to observe their interaction on 8th April 2024. Although it was clear she recognised me as gave a little smile but did not interact with me at all during the whole hour I was there. She appeared anxious and nervous and sat on her dad's lap most of the time apart from when she was in a high chair to eat lunch (around 2.45pm) - sausage, baked beans and few broccoli, which she ate very little of and only just nibbled. A  did not speak or make any noise and kept very little eye contact. She did not engage with any play activities or interacted with B despite dad trying his best to encourage her. Even when B tried to snatch her lolly or a toy she was holding, A  did not protest or got upset. She was watchful of her aunty and I noted her cling to dad more when she came in the room.   I observed aunty to be doing most of the practical tasks, such as making A 's lunch, giving her a lolly and writing in her communication book.&#8221;</span></p>

When remaining with Mr and Ms X, A may, as she grows older, wonder why she does not live with her father. It would be a difficult to answer question, certainly now that her brother, B, is placed with their father. She could have an experience, a disappointment, that there was a life she could have led but did not. These are complex feelings, against a background of an early separation from both her father and her mother. Keeping the biological line intact will help A in her sense of identity and of reality. In this scenario Mr and Ms X formed a &#8211; important &#8211; bridge from A&#8217;s birth to her placement with her father.    On the other hand, the argument of biology, I thought, stood in the way of thinking about the serious consequences of a transition for A from Ms and Mr X to Mr Q.  As the social worker points out should A stay with Ms and Mr X: A will maintain a relationship with someone she knows as her primary caregiver and maintain a strong and stable attachment.  There will be a significant loss of this relationship and attachment when A moves from Mr and Ms X to Mr Q. The strength of the attachment of A with Mr and Ms X was also noted in the LAC Chair&#8217;s report. &#8220;</span></p>

I am not sure if this would be referred to as harm but rather, I would refer to the child&#8217;s adaptation that can cause her significant emotional distress because of not understanding the transition that is taking place.    A is not three years old, and gaining an understanding of her experience is difficult, although it is clear she is more anxiously attached to Mr Q.  I am concerned that she may need to adapt to a (paternal) narrative that is positive without there being adequate attunement to what she has lost. Mr Q, as stated, would like A with him, because he is the biological father; he does not fully appreciate that A has parents, in her mind.  When he says she has two fathers, for example, that is his perception, not A&#8217;s.   There is a risk that her trauma following the transition is not addressed and becomes repressed or dissociated, not unlike, I think, the manner in which Mr Q has not worked through some of the difficulties in his life.  A will develop  not necessarily like her father,  but the consequences of not being able to work through some of difficulties she will encounter when she moves to the father may have an adverse impact and her emotional wellbeing. As stated, I think she may feel alone, when she had an experience of being attuned to her needs by Ms X and Mr X. It is difficult to know how this adverse impact may affect her adolescence and adult life, because she received good care in the first three years of her life, while also having suffered the loss of her mother, and then Ms X and Mr X.&#8221;</span></p>

He said his default position is that A should be with him and he was not sure that he can do it.   On the other hand,  his deep love for A can compensate.  He was encouraged by how Mr Q had managed B&#8217;s transition to him,  though he recognised that the circumstances were very different.  He thought there were cultural issues at play because  it would be unheard of in Igbo culture for someone else to look after your child.     Dr Willemsen was concerned as to how A will manage and confirmed that the risks for A were low self esteem,  a fragile sense of self and high anxiety.     On the other hand,   adopted children have a higher level of mental ill health though in this case there was less risk because  of the very good care and attachment.    He did not think the identity issues should be underestimated &#8211; such existential questions carried a risk in terms of mental health and personality,  though recognised that contact as proposed by Mr and Ms X would help to reduce the risk.</span></p>

He recommended that the psychotherapeutic work with A should start a couple of months after she was moved to allow a new routine to be established.    He thought that the move should not be delayed whilst Mr Q did more work.   He reiterated his view that there could be a move and thought the main argument against this was that A saw Mr and Ms X as her primary carers but he thought there were the beginnings of an attachment to Mr Q .

The narrative which Mr and Ms X had given A to date was appropriate and he had confidence in them providing a fuller one as A grew older.    He agreed that it was unusual in this type of case for the proposed adopters to be offering more contact than the professionals were proposing and he did not doubt that Mr and Ms X find contact important.    He was confident that Mr and Ms X would allow A to grow up as a child with two families.     He agreed that Mr and Ms X would provide as much mitigation as possible for the risks he had identified relating to possible confusion as A grew into her adolescence.   He said he had come down on balance in favour of biology, as he put it,   but he agreed he did have reservations as to whether Mr Q could deal with A&#8217;s trauma,  and as to whether B could adapt to A joining the family.    It was encouraging though that he had attuned to B.   He said that if Mr Q did not allow contact with Mr and Ms X to continue she would experience a loss and the loss would be forgotten. </span></p>

It was apparent to me that Mr Q did not understand some of his own statement and I have already given my view about this aspect of the conduct of this matter by his solicitors.     Mr Church asked Mr Q about his discussions with Mr Morson,  the parenting assessor in B&#8217;s proceedings and Mr Q told me that he had not thought more recently about the reasons why A was not placed with him in 2021- 2022.      It was pointed out to him that he had given Ms T an inaccurate account of the court&#8217;s reasons when she assessed him in 2023 but he told me that he had read the judgment.     He told me that he accepted the judgment but that there had been changes because  at the time he was new to this country and did not know a lot.     </span></p>

Mr Q told me that he had been talking to his legal representative on a separate telephone call at the same time as he was talking to Mr Morson.   He said he did not know at the time that this was wrong.    He also continued to deny that he had been trying to give Ms R the right answers during her online interview with Mr Morson and told me he was trying to calm her down.     He then appeared to accept that this was what he had been doing and told me that he did not know at the time how things worked in this country.</span></p>

I remain concerned that Mr Q is still prepared to be dishonest however.    The relevance in this, I find, is that this is likely to have implications with how he works with professionals,  through any transition process and beyond.   In addition,   I do not think he is always able to put A&#8217;s actual needs as opposed to his perception of her needs before his own needs as I have not seen sufficient evidence that he is able to see her as an individual as opposed to his biological daughter.</span></p>

She lists injuries and marks which she says she and Mr Q have found on A and refers to their frequency but then says that she and Mr Q fully appreciate the care given to A by the carer. She makes allegations against the Children's Guardian including the bizarre one that the Children's Guardian said that she and Mr Q looked horrible when they arrived at the contact centre,  an allegation which I completely dismiss. </span></p>

She repeated several times that she meant no criticism of Mr and Ms X or of the Children's Guardian whilst at the same time standing by the many criticisms in her statements.      I concluded that it was indeed her intention to try to make the court believe that Mr and Ms X were not careful carers of A, whilst trying to come across as cordial towards Mr and Ms X.   She had come with a clear plan in mind as to what she wanted to say and was not that keen for the questions to get in the way of that.    She said it was true that she and her brother arrived at the contact centre and met the Children's Guardian for the second time and the first words the Children's Guardian said to them were &#8220;you look horrible&#8221;.     I reject this.   It makes no sense to me at all that a professional woman who has devoted so much time to A and B&#8217;s cases would speak in this way,  and of course the Children's Guardian denies it.   Mr Q does not refer to this in his evidence and was given every opportunity by Mr Church for the CG to add to his account of that meeting but did not.</span></p>

Most if not all of the emails which have been disclosed between Mr Q and P and Ms Nash for example were written by Ms P :  she told me she wrote what her brother wanted her to write but in my judgment it is much more likely that Ms P devised each email albeit the siblings would have discussed them.

It emerged during the full SGO assessment in January 2023 that Ms P had married the man in August 2022.    I do not accept that Ms P did not regard this as a real marriage because  there had not yet been a traditional marriage between the two.

He explained that they had not wanted to meet with Kirsty Dunne as they only had a little information about what that work was ,  but it appeared to be to prepare A and Mr Q for a transition into Mr Q&#8217;s care and they had not wanted to contribute towards a transition before the court had made such a decision;   he feared that work would have to be done with A to undo that work,  if the decision was that A should not move to Mr Q.</span></p>

She gives me a very good picture of a delightful child, confident and happy in her home,  nursery and out and about.  She expresses worry at what she has read about how differently A presents when with her father even though A has been having three times a week contact with Mr Q since December 2023 (2 x a week from June 2023),  including in Mr Q&#8217;s home.</span></p>

She tells me how she has helped move babies to their birth families or to permanence outside the family,  and that adoption has been considered previously.  They cared for B from 3 weeks of age to 4 &#189; months and have kept B in A&#8217;s mind since he moved to his father&#8217;s care.    When A was placed,  and I do not think this is in dispute, this was on the basis that the plan was that they would adopt her.   The minutes of the LAC reviews support this.    Indeed the report of the chair of the review for the April 2024 meeting refers to A having been placed with a foster to adopt plan by the Local Authority and that both Mr and Ms X have been through the adoption assessment and are now approved.      In September 2021 they were told that the care plan was very likely to be adoption and were asked to make an expression of interest.   They were also told in the same meeting that Ms R was pregnant and that the baby&#8217;s care plan would also be adoption.   In Nov 21 they registered their interest in adopting A and her unborn sibling.        Their approach thereafter changed as they then started to think of A as their daughter, and this increased after the Care Order and Placement Order were made in April 2022.</span></p>

She sets out that the Local Authority has been satisfied that A is receiving an excellent standard of care from Mr and Ms X .      In the Children's Guardian&#8217;s view,  the only risk she can see to A if A remains with Mr and Ms X is the possible emotional impact of having been adopted when she becomes older.     She thinks that this risk would be reduced as Mr and Ms X are fully supportive of regular ongoing contact with the birth family.</span></p>

She is a child with great potential for a happy and successful and fulfilled life.      Unlike the vast majority of children who come before this court in public law proceedings,   A has never experienced any harm,   though she did experience being separated from her mother and father when she was 5 days old which Dr Willemsen factors into his assessment and had a bad experience when very young when both parents behaved very poorly at contact,   when Mr Q was holding her.</span></p>

The evidence is  that it is extremely likely that A will suffer great distress if she is moved and that this will amount to trauma and that this will cause her emotional harm in the short and medium term.     She would lose those people she regards as her parents,  and also the regular interaction with people she regards as her close family;    she would lose all aspects of her current routine, including the nursery she attends,  the swimming pool she goes to, her home.      The impact of having her attachments cut in this way may be life long.     In the short term she would be likely to express her distress in various ways including challenging behaviour.      The emotional harm may be exacerbated by feeling alone and in a void if her father is unable to cope with her trauma.</span></p>

That is both because  of Mr Q&#8217;s love for and commitment to A ,  but also because  I think it extremely unlikely that Mr Q would let professionals know how badly things were going if that was the case,  and he would never ask for A to go back to Mr and Ms X .     However A is already at the age of 3 a child who is articulate and who will want and need to talk about her feelings.    What is very clear from all the evidence and from all professionals&#8217; and Mr and Ms X observations of Mr Q is that he finds talking difficult:  he is guarded,  the professionals say and that is how he comes across in the witness box.   He is also reserved.     He is not a person who finds talking about emotional matters easy.  Dr Willemsen thought Mr Q would engage but was unsure whether he would benefit from the work.</span></p>

Dr Willemsen thought the fact that B had transferred his attachment to Mr Q was a good pointer of future success.    B was only 4months old at the time.    If she cannot,  there will be long term consequences for her ability to form relationships.     I was struck by Ms X&#8217;s evidence that she worries how A will feel if she decides that Mr and Ms X have been lying to her up to now because  they told her that they will always be there for her.

This will bring many benefits to her in terms of identity and having self confidence in who she is.    She will be able to develop her relationship with her brother B and these are factors which could reduce the emotional harm caused to A in the long term.    Mr Q will have the assistance of Ms P who appears to have some more insight than Mr Q does into how it will be for A.   She will also at times be able to provide practical help and support and will concentrate on B when she is there so that Mr Q can concentrate on A .      I think that Ms P&#8217;s presence will make a positive contribution when she is there because Mr Q will be able to spend more time with A without B to distract his attention;  however in other ways I do not think Ms P can help;    my impression was that Ms P was the dominant character of the two and her evidence was disingenuous and,  I thought,   hostile to Mr and Ms X as well as being dishonest in parts.     I do not have confidence in her adhering to the advice Mr Q receives as it seems to me that she is likely to think she knows better.      The presence of B may assist in the long term but in the short term I think it will add to the risks to A&#8217;s emotional well being.    She is used to being the only child in her home,  as B is in his.    Their relationship is,  I find,  not well developed and A&#8217;s overtures to B are often rejected.   They play in a parallel way rather than together.   B is naturally jealous of having to share  his father.       I note that B sleeps in Ms P s room so it may well be that he will also not like to share Ms P s attention with A .     The evidence is that Mr Q sometimes struggles to manage both children during contact,  particularly when Ms P is not there and I therefore think it likely that he will struggle to manage both if he has two children to care for.    He has never taken two children out on his own into the community.      His reliance on electronic monitoring shows that his knowledge of child safety needs addressing urgently.</span></p>

The difficulty with that is,  for reasons which escape me completely,  the LA&#8217;s final position is that such contact should take place only 3 times a year.      There is no plan as to how or where that contact would take place.     Dr Willemsen and the Children's Guardian think there should be staying contact and Dr Willemsen ranged from saying that should be monthly to saying it should be 6 times a year in the holidays.

The mitigating factors are many however:    A would be raised in a loving family where adoption and her birth family are spoken about easily and comfortably.      The overwhelming evidence is that Mr and Ms X are very sensitive parents who are attuned to A&#8217;s inner world.     I have every confidence in Mr and Ms X providing meaningful contact with Mr Q,  my only doubt being how this will be managed in the early days with neither local authority having formulated any plans.     If A is spending time with Mr Q and B regularly,  including staying over,   she will,  in my judgment,  be much less likely than other adopted children to get confused in years to come about her identity or her place in the world.      As I also have every confidence in Mr and Ms X providing a true and age appropriate narrative to A about what has happened to her and why she is living with Mr and Ms X,   I also do not think A is much more likely to face the issues which Dr Willemsen is concerned about than any other child.     She is such a clever child who appears to be developing good emotional intelligence,   she is likely to ask the questions which Dr Willemsen is worried about,  but in my judgment she will get the answers she needs from Mr and Ms X ,  and will form her own view about the reasons for the court&#8217;s decisions.</span></p>

The fact that that is not the law has not troubled them.      Both authorities seem ill equipped to deal with a case where that basic tenet is challenged.      I fail to see how a placement which is seen as providing for all of A&#8217;s needs at a time when her father is judged as incapable of caring for her becomes a placement which will expose her to various risks because  her father is now judged as able to provide good enough care.</span></p>

They have ensured that A attends contact three times a week since December 2023 although the journey each way is 1 to 1 &#189; hours.   They have experience of working with birth families and most of all they are committed to doing the best for A and they are both convinced that that includes regular contact between A and her father and B.   They have offered more contact than Dr Willemsen has suggested because  they think it will benefit A to have individual time on her own with Mr Q .      I do not have confidence in either local authority doing what will be necessary in the early stages of contact after this hearing when there will need to be assistance to supervise the contact until peoples&#8217; emotions are less high,   and to assist Mr Q with the costs of travel to contact for example.    I believe the commitment on both sides for contact to happen however will mean that this difficult early period will be worked through,  somehow,   and that in time there will be a regular pattern of contact including staying contact.</span></p>

I find this submission incomprehensible.     It is much more likely that A will have contact with her extended birth family if she is living with her father.    The chances of her being confused by a false narrative by these relations is that much greater if she moves to her father.    If Ms Baruah for F is right and the extended family are in contact with A as she gets older and do give her a false narrative,   I am confident that Mr and Ms X will be able to talk this through with A and reinforce the narrative which they have given her.</span></p>
