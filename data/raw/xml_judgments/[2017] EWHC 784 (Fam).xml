	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Case Y</span>: Adopting the terminology I have used in previous cases, the problem in this case is very shortly stated. The Form PP was correctly completed. There is no Form WP in the clinic&#8217;s records. X and Y do not assert any positive memory of a Form WP. Ms Fottrell invites me to proceed on the basis that there is a Form IC, signed by both X and Y, in a form which, on the basis of my judgments in previous cases, suffices to entitle X to the declaration she seeks. The relevant declaration, signed by X, reads as follows:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I am the partner of [Y]. I acknowledge that she and I are being treated together &#8230; In consenting to the course of treatment outlined above, I understand that I will become the legal parent of any resulting child(ren) subject to the completion of the appropriate HFEA consent forms [see page 1, section 4 of this consent].&#8221;</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">That cross-reference is to Forms WP and PP. But for the inclusion of the words &#8220;subject to the completion of the appropriate HFEA consent forms&#8221;, there could be no question of this not being a Form IC sufficient to entitle X to the declaration she seeks. The only question is whether those words are fatal to the efficacy of the document for this purpose. In my judgment they are not. The document has to be read as a whole and, read as a whole, it is clear that both parties were signing a document which contemplated that X would be a parent. If X was not to be a parent, why sign the declaration at all? X is entitled to the declaration she seeks: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, para 63(iii).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Case AA</span>: Again, the problem is very shortly stated. The Form WP was properly completed. The Form PP contains two errors: first, Y&#8217;s name, rather than X&#8217;s, appears in section 1, and X&#8217;s name, rather than Y&#8217;s, appears in section 2; secondly, the declaration in section 5 has been signed by Y and not by X. However, and importantly, the consent box in section 3 has been ticked and the second page, which contains section 3, has been signed at the foot <span style="font-style:italic">by X</span>. Both errors are obvious. The first error, the transposition of the names, can be corrected by way of rectification: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re A</span>, para 47, <span style="font-style:italic">Re the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (Case G) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/729" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 729 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 729 (Fam)</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (Cases P, Q, R, S, T, U, W and X) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2016/2273" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 2273 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 2273 (Fam)</ref>, paras 17 (Case S) and 18 (Case T).

The Form WP was properly completed. In the Form PP, Y&#8217;s name, rather than X&#8217;s, appears in section 1, and X&#8217;s name, rather than Y&#8217;s, appears in section 2. However, the consent box in section 3 has been ticked, the second page, which contains section 3, has been signed at the foot by X, as has the declaration in section 5. The error is obvious. The transposition of the names can be corrected by way of rectification: see the authorities referred to in paragraph 11 above. X is entitled to a decree of rectification and the declaration she seeks.</p>
