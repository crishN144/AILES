C&#8217;s mother was understandably frustrated that plans were delayed, and was very concerned for C&#8217;s well-being. She says she was receiving messages from C, with graphic details about plans he had to end his life.  [C&#8217;s mother] withdrew her section 20 consent to the local authority accommodating C at all, and said that she would collect him that evening.  In her witness statement, [C&#8217;s mother] describes this as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8216;a moment of desperation&#8217;</span><span style="font-size:11pt">, arising from her deep concern for C, and feelings that no one had put anything in place to ensure C&#8217;s safety.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">In February 2022 the local authority moved C to Airbnb accommodation in the community, supported by agency staff. In order to keep C safe from harming himself, significant restrictions were put in place.  He was supervised by adults at all times and was not able to go out on his own.  Use of his phone and access to cash was monitored and sometimes restricted.  The local authority applied to the Court (as it had in April 2021) for orders which authorised the staff caring for C to interfere with C&#8217;s human right to liberty in these ways, if they considered it necessary to safeguard his welfare.</span></p>

Aged fourteen, he had to buy and prepare all his own meals while staff watched.  He was not seeing other children his own age.  Plans were made for C to do online school, but it was hard for him to do this in isolation, without support from a teacher sitting beside him to get the laptop set up (once it was returned to him) or to help with the lessons.  All the time, he was expecting news of a move to another placement.  It is a lot for anyone to cope with and he showed great strength of character during this time.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The local authority worked tirelessly to find a regulated placement which would meet C&#8217;s needs.  C&#8217;s social worker could not have worked any harder.  Over the course of seven long months, the parties came back to Court very regularly, to review the deprivation of liberty restrictions in place, and receive updates in respect of placements.  Each time a placement had not been found.  C&#8217;s social worker and team manager came to every hearing.  I directed the local authority&#8217;s head of service to attend one hearing for the purposes of a discussion about whether the referral system was working appropriately, whether consideration should be given to a bespoke long-term placement being set up for C, or whether any other options could possibly be explored.  Senior managers at the local authority held weekly meetings to review C&#8217;s situation.  The local authority recruited a specialist placement consultant, whose full-time job was to focus only on finding placements for C and the small number of other young people in its care who found themselves in similar situations, living in unregulated placements subject to significant infringements of their liberties, not in regular education, not seeing other young people, and awaiting news of a placement move.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">I do not think that the local authority could have worked any harder to improve the situation for C.  However, that cannot bring much comfort to C, who remained in the Airbnb for just under eight months.  C is a vulnerable young person who needed and deserved to receive much better care. As well as the difficulties of day-to-day life in the placement itself, the uncertainty about where he was going to live caused very significant additional worries for C.</span></p>

Often her interventions have led to the local authority making changes that have improved things for C.

In that event, either parent may well feel conflicted or under pressure to accommodate C, and withdraw their consent.  His parents love him and his relationship with them is incredibly important.  But both parents have struggled to manage the relationship when C is living in the household.  They have not been able to meet his needs, and as a result he and others in the household have suffered, or been at risk of, significant harm.  Should he return to the care of either of his parents at a time of placement breakdown, those risks would still be there.

An application for discharge of the care order could be made if needed.  By contrast, a change brought about by withdrawal of section 20 consent can happen in a sudden and unplanned way which is likely to bring with it disruption and confusion.  I appreciate that C&#8217;s experience under the interim care order has also included times where placements have come suddenly to an end, causing significant disruption, distress and uncertainty.

For example, when C was at [placement C], the carers contacted the local authority to ask them to intervene to ask C&#8217;s mother not to contact C after 9pm and not to reply to texts when C was heightened as it made it harder to calm C.  In June 2022 there was a violent incident involving C and his seven year old brother.

C needs to be settled into his permanent placement, so that he can receive the support required to enable him to manage his emotions in a safe way, to process his past experiences and start to recover from them, to build meaningful relationships with friends and family, benefit from education, and look to a future that will be much brighter and rewarding for him than the past few years have been.  </span></p>
