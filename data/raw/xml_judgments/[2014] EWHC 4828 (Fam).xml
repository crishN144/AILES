But he does not wish to return to her care.  What he wants to do is to return to Latvia to live with his maternal grandmother and his sister who is living with the grandmother.

She came here in May 2013 to see if she could create a life for herself and her son, leaving behind her daughter.  She singularly has failed to create a life.  She was in Lshire for nine months, during which time E only attended school for 56 per cent of the time.  She came to Nshire on 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'CG Times'">th</span><span style="font-family:'CG Times'"> April 2014, and it was in Nshire that the difficulties came to the attention of the social services.  However, he had not been registered in a school in Nshire nor had he been registered with a GP.  He was living in a rented room in somebody else&#8217;s home with his mother.  He had very little connection with this country.  He has not talked about friends.  It seems that the mother has no relative in this country.  The relationship she has with her partner/boyfriend has difficulties.  On the face of that, she called 999 on 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'CG Times'">st</span><span style="font-family:'CG Times'"> May 2014, and that E indicates that there is a difficult relationship.  </span></p>

It was transferred from the local county court to the High Court to consider the position.  The mother very much favours this court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Latvian court, and would say on two grounds: that mother and son are not habitually resident and have not been habitually resident in this country, in which case this court has no jurisdiction full stop; but even if I did think we had jurisdiction, under art.15 I should be requesting the Latvian court to take over as it would be in a better place to consider this case and it would be in the child&#8217;s best interests, given the connection with Latvia, given the fact that the Riga Orphan&#8217;s Court in Latvia has been involved with this family, given that it is now also indicated that it has assessed the maternal grandmother for the care of E, and that the Latvian authorities very much feel that a child should be placed with his relatives.  They do not consider our form of adoption as acceptable or an option.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times'">I have to consider, firstly, the habitual residence point.  Has E acquired habitual residence in this country since he came here in May 2013?  To answer that, I have to ask myself to begin with what are the mother&#8217;s views?  She wishes to go back to Latvia.  She came here to see if she could make a life over here.  I also have to ask myself whether there has been any integration of E into the society here.  I am clear.  I do not think habitual residence actually has been gained in this country.  The mother has led a bit of a transient life, as it has been described.  She has not found employment, she is not receiving (and not entitled to receive) benefits.  She has not established her own home.  She has not ensured that E should attend school or be formally registered in a school in the local authority area, and she has not registered him with a GP surgery.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times'">I do not think this court has jurisdiction.  However, if I am wrong and that I do have jurisdiction, I am clear, under art.15, that this is a case for the Latvians court.  They know this family already.  They have made enquiries of the grandmother.  It is where the child comes from.  They have the information readily available to them.  The mother very much wants the matter to be returned to Latvia.  That is endorsed by the local authority.  The guardian remains neutral.  The guardian says that, whatever I do, there should be no delay.  I endorse that too.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'CG Times'">So, in my view, under art.15, I would be making a request because the Latvian court would be in the best position to deal with the case and because it would be in the best interests of the child.  Fundamentally, this court does not have jurisdiction because the child is not habitually resident here.  I only refer to art.15 to underline my view, and sometimes judges are not always right but I think on this time it is a two-pronged approach and Latvia is the right place.</span></p>
