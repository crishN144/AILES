The mother makes extensive complaints regarding the conduct of the father in her second statement in these proceedings, which complaints range across the circumstances in which the parties marriage came to an end in 2012, the outcome of her divorce settlement by comparison to the father&#8217;s previous wife and historic allegations of physical and emotional abuse.  However, having regard to Ms Kirby&#8217;s careful and full written and oral submissions on behalf of the mother, the essence of the mother&#8217;s case resolves into two key situations that she submits will result for L in a grave risk of exposure to psychological harm or will otherwise place L in an intolerable situation were an order for summary return to be made.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">At the outset of this hearing, the mother also relied on the child&#8217;s objection exception under Art 13.  Having considered the report of the CAFCASS Officer in this case, the mother now no longer pursues that exception.  The mother confirmed at the hearing on 22 February 2019 that she sought to rely on L&#8217;s objection to returning to Israel and Ms Demery of CAFCASS accordingly prepared a report dated 22 March 2019.  However, the mother&#8217;s second statement dated that 5 March 2019 does not deal substantially with any objection raised by L.  Indeed, the statement expressly anticipates that L will say that she wishes to return to Israel (albeit the mother seeks to lay that view at the door of so-called parental alienation by the father).  Within this context, whilst Ms Kirby now seeks to characterise the use of the exception as &#8220;a secondary defence&#8221;, it is of concern that the exception was ever pursued by the mother.   </p>

In particular, Ms Kirby invited me to read and to have regard to the decision of Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">MB v SB </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/3719" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 3719 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 3719 (Fam)</ref>, the decision of Hayden J in <span style="font-style:italic">MB v SB </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/3721" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 3721 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 3721 (Fam)</ref> and also a decision of the Court of Appeal concerning the father. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It remained somewhat unclear during her submissions what exactly Ms Kirby invited me to draw from those previous decisions in the context of these proceedings, concerning as they do, in respect of the child abduction proceedings before Hayden J, a different factual situation involving a different mother and child and, in respect of the financial remedy proceedings before the Court of Appeal, a different cause of action altogether.  Pressed, Ms Kirby ultimately submitted that the decisions inform the court what type of man the father is, Ms Kirby asserting that the authorities to which I have referred show the father to be a &#8220;dishonest and cruel person who will put the war before the welfare of his child&#8221;.  By this rather emotive submission, Ms Kirby appeared to mean that this father will use litigation as a means of oppressing the mother without regard to L&#8217;s welfare.  Within this context, Ms Kirby submits that I am able to, and should rely on the findings she contends are contained in the judgments to judge the father&#8217;s character in circumstances where I have not heard evidence from the mother or the father in these summary proceedings. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">It is correct that in <span style="font-style:italic">SB v MB </span>[2014] 3719 (Fam) Hayden J concluded that the father was a man who struggled to empathise emotionally with those around him, particular his <span style="font-style:italic">former wife</span>, the mother, but also [<span style="font-style:italic">his daughter</span>]&#8221; (emphasis added).  However, it is equally clear that this conclusion was referable to the particular individuals involved in that litigation in the context of the breakdown of a specific relationship about which this court has no first-hand information.  Likewise, it is the case that Hayden J observed that &#8220;When speaking to <span style="font-style:italic">the mother</span>, the father could, I find, be more than terse, he was dogmatic, occasionally capricious, highly opiniated and sometimes, I am afraid to say, a bully&#8221; (emphasis added).  However, once again this conclusion is referable to the particular individuals involved in that litigation in the context of the breakdown of a specific relationship about which this court has no first-hand information. The same observation can be made in respect of each of the observations of Hayden J on which Ms Kirby relies in relation to his litigation conduct with his third wife.  I acknowledge that Hayden J concluded in (a case concerning an argument as to costs) that the father&#8217;s &#8220;dogmatic, occasionally capricious, highly opiniated&#8221; and sometimes bullying conduct characterised his approach to that litigation. However, once again, those conclusions were drawn in the context of <span style="font-style:italic">those </span>proceedings, arising out of a different relationship in the context of the breakdown of that specific relationship.  The same goes for observations made by McFarlane LJ (as he then was) in the Court of Appeal and certain comments said to have been made by Moor J and Roberts J (as recited by McFarlane LJ in the Court of Appeal judgment). </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Previous findings may, of course, be capable of standing, and often do stand as evidence in subsequent proceedings in an appropriate case.  However, I am satisfied to apply the highly fact specific judgments rendered by Hayden J in the unique context of proceedings concerning of the breakdown of the father&#8217;s relationship with his third wife and the resultant dispute with respect to their daughter, and by the Court of Appeal in the context of related financial remedy proceedings, to the father&#8217;s relationship with<span style="font-style:italic"> this</span> mother in litigation relating to <span style="font-style:italic">L </span>in the course of reaching my decision on the facts of <span style="font-style:italic">this </span>case would be to risk acting on assumption and prejudice and not on evidence.  Great caution must therefore be exercised.  In evaluating the father&#8217;s conduct in these proceedings, insofar as it is relevant to the Art 13(b) exception, the court must have regard primarily to the evidence in <span style="font-style:italic">these </span>proceedings, including the evidence it has before it regarding the conduct of the litigation in Israel concerning L and generally and any other relevant evidence regarding the conduct of the father. </p>

The parents&#8217; relationship broke down when L was approximately 18 months old.   The mother asserts that the last day the father and her were together was 23 May 2012.   The mother alleges that the father thereafter stranded her in Israel for the purposes of ensuring that she could not take advantage of the jurisdiction of England and Wales in the subsequent divorce.  The father denies this.  The father returned to reside permanently in Israel shortly after the mother.  In the circumstances, L resided in Israel from 2012 until her admitted wrongful removal on 6 November 2018. </p>

Beyond the mother&#8217;s bald assertion, there is no evidence before the court on which the court could properly assume a risk in this case that the father will act to alienate L from her mother.  Indeed, the evidence points in the other direction.  There is a clearly identifiable continuity between the opinion of Dr Goltlieb in 2016, who noted that L presented as very comfortable with both her parents, that there was &#8220;no withdrawal whatsoever&#8221; from either of her parents and a good connection with both, with no reservations noted, and the conclusions of Ms Demery in March 2019 that, having applied the CAFCASS tool &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Typical behaviours exhibited by a child where they have experienced alienating behaviours</span>&#8221;, Ms Demery could find no evidence that L had been influenced by either parent.  Further, L&#8217;s positive and loving relationship with her mother as identified by both Dr Goltlieb in 2016 and by Ms Demery in 2019 speaks against any campaign by the father to alienate her from her mother.  L is clear that she loves both her parents very much.  </p>

It must be based on an evaluation of the relevant admissible evidence that is before the court, albeit an evaluation that is undertaken in a manner consistent with the summary nature of proceedings under the 1980 Hague Convention.  The court does not simply assume, without more, the maximum level of risk contended for by the abducting parent.  Rather, the court examines the information available to it and, having considered that information, arrives at a reasoned and reasonable assumption as to the maximum level of risk having regard to the available evidence.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The position in respect to the first point is somewhat more complex, albeit I am satisfied that my conclusion is the same.  The evidence before the court plainly demonstrates that between 2013 and 2017 there was a high level of litigation between the parents in relation to both L and the financial consequences of their divorce.  In the circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that upon L&#8217;s return to Israel further litigation between the parents may ensue.  Indeed, the father has, in response to the mother&#8217;s abduction of L to this jurisdiction, commenced two actions in the Israeli courts (albeit he evinces an intention not to proceed with his application in respect of custody of L).  Further, it is the case that this court has information justifying the conclusion that the father is, financially, in a better position than the mother, to sustain any ongoing litigation.  In any event, having regard to the litigation history in this case, it may reasonably be anticipated that any litigation that continues in Israel following L&#8217;s return will, subject to the decisions of the courts in that jurisdiction, be relatively protracted.  However, in assessing whether further litigation regarding her welfare in Israel will lead to a grave risk of exposure to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place L in an intolerable situation, that cannot be the end of the court&#8217;s analysis.  </p>

However, in the context of the mother&#8217;s case regarding the impact of further litigation by the father in Israel, the point regarding the competent approach of the Israeli courts to the issue of L&#8217;s welfare is reinforced by observations made by Hayden J in one of the authorities to which I was referred by Ms Kirby, namely <span style="font-style:italic">SB v MB</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/3721" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 3721 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 3721 (Fam)</ref> at [2]: </p>

I observe, in passing, that there has been a parallel 'jurisdictional' issue pursued by the father in the Israeli courts.   It has been pursued there with what I have come to recognise as the father's hallmark vigour.  Following a resounding rejection of his application at first instance, a judgment that was highly critical of him personally, the points were pursued on to the Court of Appeal in Israel and eventually to the Supreme Court there.  That litigation has been entirely futile, on my reading of the respective judgments.  What is perhaps most reassuring however is the conformity both of principle and approach in the two country's respective Hague Convention jurisprudence.&#8221; </p>

Ms Demery is clear that L presented as a resilient child who impressed as intelligent and articulate.  She assessed L as being confident and assertive with a cognitive maturity commensurate, if not beyond her chronological age.  Within the context of the extensive litigation that has taken place in Israel, Ms Demery noted that L was able to give a considered description of her live in Israel and the United Kingdom and made no unfavourable comparisons between her parents, speaking of both positively.  In the circumstances, notwithstanding its extent and duration, there is no evidence to suggest that L has been emotionally harmed to date by the undesirable litigation between her parents such that the court could conclude that returning L to Israel would result in a grave risk of exposure to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place L in an intolerable situation.   </p>

To the contrary, notwithstanding the nature and extent of the litigation between 2013 and 2017 the mother, who has been the primary carer of L throughout that period, has succeeded in raising a happy, well balanced and confident child.  Indeed, whilst credit for this outcome must also be given to the father and to the wider family, there is no evidence before the court to suggest that prior to the mother abducting L to England, the mother was incapable of caring for Land meeting her needs. Rather, L was thriving at home and school enjoying her life in Jerusalem.  Ms Demery is clear in her assessment that: </p>

Beyond her bald assertion, there is no evidence that the mother suffers from any psychological or psychiatric disorder or emotional deficit.

As set I have set out in the foregoing paragraph, the evidence before the court demonstrates that, notwithstanding the nature and extent of the litigation between 2013 and 2017 the mother, as primary carer of L throughout that period, has succeeded in raising a happy, well balanced and confident child. Within this context, Ms Kirby herself asserts in her Skeleton Argument that &#8220;The mother has proven herself resilient against the great and persistent efforts made by the father to bring her down and to defeat her.&#8221;  This position is advanced by the mother notwithstanding the additional matters she seeks to pray in aid, namely her allegation that the father stranded her in Israel in 2012 and that there was sporadic physical abuse by the father towards her prior to their relationship breaking down that year, each of which allegations the father denies. </p>

Whilst it may well have been the case that a request by the mother that the father agree to the relocation of L to this jurisdiction would have resulted in a further protracted round of litigation in Israel, notwithstanding the period of calm that followed the parents&#8217; agreement in November 2017, the mother&#8217;s peremptory actions a year later were <span style="font-style:italic">certain</span> to lead to that end and have done so.

Rather, L is entitled to expect both her parents to prioritise her best interests by co-operating in respect of her welfare.
