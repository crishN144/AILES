	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">RCW is the prospective adopter of a child SB, a baby girl aged just 1 year.  SB was placed with RCW (under a placement order) in October 2012 by the local authority (which I shall refer to in this judgment as &#8220;LBX&#8221;).  As an urgent application, appearing in the urgent applications court on 8 February 2013, RCW sought an injunction and other relief under the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref></span> to restrain LBX from removing SB from her care; RCW had given notice to LBX of her intention to seek such relief in the applications list (as was, in my judgment, appropriate).  </p>

LBX had also prepared and had filed with the court a witness statement from Mr M (consultant social worker).  I heard detailed submissions from Mr Robin Barda on behalf of the Claimant, and Mr. Lee Pearman on behalf of the Defendant.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">On 3 February 2012 SB was born at 27 weeks gestation (weighing just 1 kg) at an NHS Hospital in London; almost immediately she was abandoned by her natural mother.  SB spent many months in intensive care in the SCBU, receiving specialist nursing care before she could be discharged.  She was named &#8216;S&#8217; by the nurses on the ward.  SB was born with a cleft palate, which will require surgical intervention in the near future.  Upon her discharge from hospital she was placed in foster care for a period.  LBX commenced care and placement order proceedings, and these were resolved without any material opposition at the Inner London Family Proceedings Court on 29 August 2012.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">On or about 8 October 2012, SB was matched with RCW, a single woman who works as a project manager for the National Health Service.  SB was placed with RCW some two weeks later.  The placement appears on all accounts to have been an extremely successful one.   According to Mr. M., SB &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">settled well into RCW&#8217;s loving care and began to form a secure and loving attachment with her&#8230;</span>&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">In late November/early December 2012, RCW began to notice a deterioration in her visual acuity.  She saw an optometrist, who referred her to her local hospital.  After a process of investigations, early in January 2013, she was diagnosed with a tumour on the brain.  The tumour was pressing on the optic nerve, and this required urgent surgery.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">By 4 January 2013, SB had had her home with RCW for 10 weeks; on this date it was therefore open to RCW to make an application for adoption (see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/42/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42(2)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref></span>).  In fact, on that very day, RCW went into hospital for the operation to remove the tumour from her brain.  In haste, RCW made arrangements, which were comprehensive and detailed, for SB to be cared for in her own home by a cohort of friends who rallied round RCW; the friends were all familiar to SB.  During RCW&#8217;s admission to hospital, which lasted just under three weeks, SB was a regular visitor to the ward; she attended at least every other day, accompanied by one of the friends. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The operative surgery was in one sense successful; the tumour, which was mercifully benign, was removed.  Unfortunately the surgery has left RCW without sight.  It is not yet known whether that loss of sight is temporary or permanent, and whether the optic nerve will recover from the trauma of the operation.  RCW informs me through her witness statement that the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">sudden loss of sight &#8230; has initially been put down to shock and swelling of the optic nerve</span>&#8221;.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">The witness statements filed by and on behalf of RCW make clear that since returning from hospital, RCW has been fully involved in the care of SB (feeding her and cuddling her), although, obviously, she has not been as engaged in some of the practical tasks as she had been prior to the operation.  RCW lives in the area of local authority LBY.  Although LBY offers RCW support, it appears that no integrated support package between LBX and LBY has been discussed, let alone implemented, in spite of requests from RCW for such intervention.</p>

It was argued forcefully that RCW is no longer able to offer this primary attachment because she will, through force of circumstance, now be reliant on friends and supporters to provide key care for SB.  In developing this point, Mr Pearman highlighted that SB had experienced a disrupted early life, with 3&#189; months in hospital and then 5 months in foster care before being moved to live with RCW.   In the circumstances, he argued, it was vitally important that SB does not suffer further disruption; this would be avoided, he maintained, by moving SB now from her current home to another home.   He argued that it is vitally important that SB forms a strong and secure emotional attachment to a primary care-giver now.  He drew on the evidence of the observation from 24 January 2013 (extract above).   Mr Pearman submitted that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">she [RCW] is unable to fulfil the role of primary caregiver because she does not have sight at present</span>&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">As outlined above, there is some uncertainty about the precise sequence of key events in the procedural history; specifically, it is unclear whether RCW&#8217;s application was indeed &#8220;made&#8221; before she received notice of LBX&#8217;s intention to remove SB.  On the information presented to me, there is a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> case that by the time &#8216;notice was given&#8217; to RCW by LBX she had already &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">made an application</span>&#8221; for adoption in relation to SB.  It is not necessary for me to determine whether &#8216;making&#8217; an application refers (at the earliest) to the point when the application is lodged with the court (i.e. taken in by the court office for processing), or (at the latest) when the application is formally issued by the court (and given a court number etc).  I would venture to suggest the former (provided that all of the paperwork is in proper order) given the unfairness which may result if the court is dilatory in processing the application. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">A decision to remove a child who has been placed with prospective adopters is a momentous one.  It has to be a solidly welfare-based decision, and it must be reached fairly.  LBX discussed its plans to remove SB from the care of RCW at two meetings referred to in the chronology above; the decision was made on 30 January 2013 and communicated to RCW shortly thereafter by telephone.  I have not yet seen the minutes of the planning meetings at which the decision to remove SB was made (it has been indicated that Mr M&#8217;s notes can be made available forthwith, and they should be).   But it is difficult to identify on what material LBX could truly contend that it had reached a proper welfare-based evaluation; there had been limited direct observation and assessment by that time, no apparent discussions with the friends and supporters, and little knowledge of RCW&#8217;s condition or, more pertinently, its likely prognosis.</p>

There is nothing in the statements before me which indicates that RCW&#8217;s specific views about her ability to care for SB for the future, her support network, or the impact of her condition on her life were sought or obtained; it does not appear that RCW was given any opportunity to make representations at the meeting.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Over the last few days and weeks, RCW has had to absorb the devastating consequences of the brain tumour, and the consequences of the operation, in making adjustments to her own life, and to SB&#8217;s.  In my judgment RCW has made entirely appropriate arrangements for SB&#8217;s care, at least in the short term, and, as LBX accepts, SB is and has been receiving good physical care.  I am not satisfied, on the information before me, that simply by virtue of her visual impairment RCW is unable to give appropriate level of emotional care to SB (as LBX assert).   Nor am I persuaded that it is contrary to SB&#8217;s emotional well-being for RCW&#8217;s friends to assist her in caring for SB in the weeks and months ahead; the enthusiasm and dedication of these friends  (quite apart from their experience in looking after children) cannot be over-stated. Whether this is indeed the optimal long-term care arrangement for SB remains to be seen; it may well be that the employment of a single support carer or nanny to assist RCW may be a better option for SB.  This is an issue which will surely need to be examined.  I note that when placing SB with RCW, LBX knew that RCW was a single woman with a full-time job, and that nursery care was ultimately going to be part of SB&#8217;s wider care regime.  Ironically, I note that when approving RCW as an adopter, the consultant social worker engaged by LBX to undertake the assessment had commented &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I was impressed with how seriously [RCW] had &#8230; [been] able to evidence the developments she had made in developing a more robust support system&#8230;.. These included living in with [RCW] if there was a difficulty in [RCW] being able to meet the demands of day to day care for a child</span>.&#8221; </p>

It was not fairly assessed on 24 January 2013 when the social worker visited RCW&#8217;s home so soon after RCW&#8217;s discharge from hospital.  LBX can only point to one example (from the visit on that day) where they maintain that SB&#8217;s needs were not being met.  </p>

One can only imagine the tumult of emotions which RCW must have been feeling on that day &#8211; joy and relief to be home and with SB; sickening anxiety and possibly despair at her new disability. </p>
