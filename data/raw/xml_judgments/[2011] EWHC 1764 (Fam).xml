The parties supporting the application seek an order that would preclude, amongst other things, the naming of various members of the family, including not only A, but also adult family members, including the mother of all three children who has been arrested on suspicion of murdering the two boys. The order sought is one that would apply contra mundum, that is to say it would be of general effect and bind any person having notice of it. </span></p>

She has given birth to three children &#8211; B, born [a date] 2006, J, born [a date] 2008, and A, born [a date] 2010. B was conceived as a result of a very brief relationship and his father has had no further involvement with the family. J and A have the same father, F, who met the mother in a psychiatric unit. Both the mother and F suffer ongoing long term psychiatric and psychological problems. The mother has cognitive difficulties and a history of depression and self harm.

When he was about one year old, B was placed with his maternal grandmother under a residence order. Thereafter, he had regular contact with his mother, and after their births, his half-siblings, J and A. Because of the mother's long-term problems, social services were involved with the family from the outset. J and A were placed on the child protection register in the category of neglect, and subsequently made the subject of child protection plans. </span></p>

When discharged from the psychiatric unit, she moved into in sheltered accommodation. A psychological report dated 24 May discloses that, in addition to her cognitive problems, she is suffering from a significant depressive disorder which "adversely affects her ability to interact with people, communicate with them, and answer probing or leading questions". The psychologist expressed the opinion that, in her condition, she would be unable to manage questions posed by the media, and would be likely to make false statements as a result of being in a highly suggestible state. The psychologist described the mother as being in "a state of extreme grief" and expressed concerns that prolonged pressure from the media may put her at risk of self harm. He concludes: "I cannot stress strongly enough how vulnerable [the mother] is at the present time". </span></p>

Police are currently awaiting the results of further tests to establish if their death should be treated as suspicious. A report has been submitted to HM Coroner. Following the deaths, police arrested a twenty-five-year old woman&#8230; on suspicion of murder.

	    <p style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The press interest also prompted the local authority to apply for a reporting restriction order. In support of this application, the allocated social worker filed a statement saying inter alia "that the publishing of any information which could identify A or her present or future placements, the fact of the care proceedings, or the detail contained within the care proceedings will be detrimental to A's welfare". The application was served on the media under the CopyDirect service in accordance with the President's Direction and CAFCASS Practice Note dated [a date] March 2005. On [a date] May, Her Honour Judge Sullivan QC, sitting as a judge of the High Court, made an order, paragraph 3 of which prohibited the publishing or broadcasting of (a) the name and address of A, her carers, any individual having day to day care of or medical responsibility of A, and any residential home or hospital or other establishment at which she was residing or being treated; (b) any picture of A, a carer or any such establishment, and, (c) any other particulars or information relating to A. The order was, however, subject to the qualification that such publication was prohibited "IF BUT ONLY IF [it] is likely to lead to the identification of the child as being the child of [the mother or father]". It should be noted, therefore, the list of persons whose identification was precluded did not at that stage include either the mother or the father or the maternal grandmother. The order also precluded any person from seeking information relating to the child from a list of named persons including the child herself, her foster carers, or any other carer. Again, that list did not include the mother, father or maternal grandmother. The order was subject to the proviso that it did not prevent the publication of information relating to a public court hearing, or information that was already in the public domain. The order was expressed as lasting for seven days and was duly served on the media in accordance with the President's Direction and CAFCASS Practice Note. </span></p>

It seemed clear to me, however, (and was accepted by representatives of the media) that the intention behind the order of 24th May had been to prevent any naming of the mother and father, and further that this aim was undermined by the retention of the public domain proviso in paragraph 7. I therefore deleted that proviso in the interim in order to give effect what was the plain intention behind Judge Marston's order of 24th May, whilst indicating, that by doing so, I was not giving any indication of the likely outcome of the contested hearing before me. </span></p>

Secondly, a short psychiatric report has been filed given details of the father's serious psychiatric condition. Thirdly, a report had been filed by the team manager of the local learning disability team giving details of recent incidents of self-harm committed by the mother, each apparently requiring hospital treatment, and said to have been precipitated by the mother's "distress around media intrusion". The report described how, in her current sheltered accommodation, the mother requires additional one-to-one support fourteen and a half hours per day, plus waking night support. Fourthly, the local authority social worker reports in a statement filed for the hearing before me that, as a result of the press articles, contact visits between A and her mother and grandmother have been cancelled on four occasions, to ensure A's safety and privacy. </span></p>

As he says, although some information will be manifestly well-known so that re-publication will have comparatively little effect, other information may be obscure so that re-publication could have a very significant effect. As he also says, whereas some information, once in the public domain, will stay there permanently, other information may in reality disappear from the public domain after time, in the sense that although it remains in a cuttings file or a database it never or hardly ever sees the light of day."</span></p>

In the subsequent seven years, with the growth of Youtube and Twitter, the internet has had an even greater effect than was anticipated. The range of information available to the public is infinitely greater than twenty years ago, but manifestly it does not follow that all that information can be described as being in the general public consciousness.

Moreover, with each exposure of personal information or allegations, whether by way of visual images or verbally, there is a new intrusion and occasion for distress or embarrassment &#8230;....

This is because stories about particular individuals are simply much more attractive to readers than stories about unidentified people. It is just human nature. And this is why, of course, even when reporting major disasters, journalists usually look for a story about how particular individuals are affected. Writing stories which capture the attention of readers is a matter of reporting technique, and the European Court holds that article 10 protects not only the substance of ideas and information but also the form in which they are conveyed: News Verlags GmbH &amp; Co KG v Austria [2001) 31 EHRR 8 &#8230;. This is not just a matter of deference to editorial independence. The judges are recognising that editors know best how to present material in a way that will interest the readers of their particular publication and so help them to absorb the information. A requirement to report it in some austere, abstract form, devoid of much of its human interest, could well mean that the report would not be read and the information would not be passed on. Ultimately, such an approach could threaten the viability of newspapers and magazines, which can only inform the public if they attract enough readers and make enough money to survive."</span></p>

The naming of the mother was likely to lead to the identification in the local area of A as her daughter, given the fact that they had the same surname and that both newspapers had reported considerable details about the family, in particular the addresses of both the mother and the maternal grandmother. Miss Judd further submitted that the photographs published would make it easier for the mother to be recognised and that, were she to be seen with A, for example at the contact centre, A would be identified as her daughter. The risk of such identification had led to the cancellation of a number of contact visits following the publication of the story in the local paper. Further publication of information and photographs would be likely to lead to further disruption of contact. </span></p>

The importance of preventing any interference in the reporting of alleged crimes outweighed the importance of any infringement in the private and family lives of the adults involved in such cases, save in exceptional circumstances. He argued that the only cases in which such an injunction has been granted were those cases, such as Venables, in which the applicant had been able to point not only to an interest in retaining privacy, but also a threat to lives. In other words, the circumstances engaged not merely the qualified right to respect for family life under article 8 but also the absolute right to life under article 2 or the absolute freedom from torture under article 3. Mr Wolanski submitted that the threats made in this case on the so-called Facebook hate page were not of a scale of substance to engage the article 2 or 3 rights. </span></p>

To my mind it is manifestly obvious that, in circumstances where two children have died there is a right to respect for private and family life. Furthermore, the lifestyle within the household, and the circumstances in which the children were being brought up, are clearly aspects of family life which in most cases are kept shielded from public gaze. Whatever the circumstances in which the children lived and died, the publication of reports in the press about the family is an intrusion, that is to say an interference with the family's rights under article 8 which can only be justified by the reference to the exceptions in article 8(2). I reject Mr Wolanski's submission that there was no expectation that the information in this case would remain private. The question is whether the right to respect for family and private life is outweighed in the balancing exercise. </span></p>

In my judgment, the fact that the statements made concerning the mother, or inferences derived from those statements, may be defamatory does not negate the need to adopt the approach set out by Lord Steyn in Re S, that is to say the process of identifying, scrutinising and balancing the human rights engaged in the particular case. As Tugenhat J explained in CTB in the passage cited above, the truth or falsity of the allegations is irrelevant because the modern law of privacy is concerned as much with intrusion as with confidentiality. It would be absurd if the right to respect for private and family life was not engaged by publications of untrue statements. As Buxton LJ observed in McKennitt v Ash (supra) "the defendant cannot deprive the claimant of his article 8 rights simply by demonstrating that the matter is untrue." Excoriation in newspapers may be intrusive whether the reports are true or false. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The publication of the articles in The Sun and the local paper were a clear interference with the family's article 8 rights. On the other hand, it is in the public interest for police investigations of serious crime to be fully reported providing such reports keep within the law, including the law of contempt of court. There are several reasons for permitting such reporting. First, in general terms, crime is a disfiguring feature in our society which needs to be exposed to public view so that society as a whole can address the many issues it raises. Secondly, the suspicious death of a child is a particular issue of public importance which warrants appropriate scrutiny in the media. Thirdly, during the course of a difficult and important criminal investigation, the police need all the help they can get. The publication of reports of the investigation may trigger memories amongst readers or viewers and lead witnesses to come forward. Television programmes such as "Crimewatch" have been broadcast for many years with that specific aim in mind. Accordingly, I reject Miss Judd's submission that the press did not have any role to play in the investigation. On the contrary, as the success of "Crimewatch" demonstrates, the media may play a key role in the identification, investigation and solving of crimes. Fourthly, it is in my judgment in the public interest for there to be publicity about cases when children who are known to social services sustain significant harm. The performance and efficiency of public services is a matter of fundamental public interest. </span></p>

A distinction can be drawn between, on the one hand, the information that children known to social services have died and that their mother has been arrested in connection with their deaths, and, on the other hand, intrusive reporting into the circumstances within the family home. The fact of the children's deaths, that the mother has been arrested, and the involvement of social services is information already widely reported nationally and locally, and to my mind this is a factor against the injunction now sought on behalf of the mother. These facts are widely known and the likely effect of any repetition on the mother's article 8 rights is to my mind limited so that the case for restraining republication is less strong. On the other hand, detailed accounts of life in the home have amounted to significant intrusion. To my mind, there is a stronger argument that re-publication of those details would have a significant impact on family members and would therefore amount to an interference with article 8 rights. </span></p>
