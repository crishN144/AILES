	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">These proceedings concern four children, Simon, Clare, Peter and Harry. The ages of the children range between 13 and 9. The children&#8217;s parents are LF (&#8216;the mother&#8217;) and JF (&#8216;the father&#8217;). Until December 2014 the children lived with their mother in Australia. With the mother&#8217;s agreement the children came to England to spend their (Australian) summer school holidays with their father. They should have returned to Australia on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January 2015. Before the date of travel the father indicated to the mother that the children wished to remain in England and that he would not, therefore, be returning them to Australia.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The mother now seeks an order for the summary return of the children to Australia. The father admits that his retention of the children was wrongful. However, he asserts that the mother acquiesced in the children&#8217;s retention in England and/or that the children object to returning to Australia and that in those circumstances the court should exercise its discretion to refuse to order their summary return.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I have not heard oral evidence from the parents. In her opening skeleton argument on behalf of the mother, Miss Jacqueline Renton said that &#8216;it may not be necessary to hear oral evidence from the parties in this case&#8217;. In the event, neither Miss Renton nor Miss Ashley Thain, who appeared for the father, sought permission to adduce oral evidence. Each parent has filed one witness statement. Much of the background history is not in dispute. In the narrative which follows I will identify those issues that are in dispute. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">After the separation the father rented a property in Australia near to the family home. He maintained contact by visiting the children in Australia, by Skype and by telephone. The mother says that initially his visits were frequent, may be 3 or 4 times a year but after a while they became less frequent. Whenever he visited he stayed in his rented property. The mother says that he always travelled business class. The father is silent on that issue.</p>

They spent three weeks staying with their father. The visit to England appears to have unsettled Clare. After their return to Australia, Clare began to say that she wanted to live in England.</p>

They arrived in England on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. The mother travelled to England with the children in order to visit a terminally ill relative. She returned to Australia on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. The father booked and paid for the flights including the mother&#8217;s flights. In an e-mail sent on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October the father told the mother that if she &#8216;wanted to stay longer over Christmas etc. etc. we can sort something out I&#8217;m sure.&#8217;</p>

This was not the first time she had received an eviction notice. She had previously received notices in February 2013 and July 2014.

He appears to have convinced himself that the mother was cohabiting. There is no evidence to support that belief.</p>

They returned to England on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. Text messages between the parents show that the mother was becoming increasingly worried about losing her home. The father reassured her. For example, on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January he sent a text to her saying, &#8216;I have emailed the bank my next commission payments and confirmation of when and I have also requested they extend the eviction for two weeks&#8217;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The father seeks to create a picture of the mother acknowledging her children&#8217;s wish to live in England and agreeing that they should do so. That is not the picture that emerges from a series of text messages which the parties have produced. The clear picture emerging from the text messages is of a mother who wants her children returned to her in Australia. On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January she wrote, &#8216;I am asking you to give us time back here so we can do things properly&#8217;. On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January she wrote, &#8216;The kids need to be back here&#8230;&#8217; In another text she says, &#8216;Pls bring them back&#8217;. And in another, &#8216;This has been their life&#8230;and they need to say goodbye to it&#8230;to see friends and places one last time and to get their citizenship&#8217;. In another she says, &#8216;Please bring them back, I need to be with them&#8230;&#8217; On 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January she wrote, &#8216;I want my children here, like you said you would.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There are also some texts in which the mother appears to agree to return to live in England. In one message she says, &#8216;I can understand they want to be near you. We will all move, that&#8217;s a given&#8230;&#8217; In another message she says, &#8216;I agree that they need both of us that&#8217;s why we are moving&#8217;. Such comments need to be read in the context of the totality of the text message exchanges. The totality of the text messages suggest that the father was putting the mother under intense pressure to bend to his will. He had total financial control. He also had the children in his care. Some of his texts were highly abusive.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">An earlier series of text messages exchanged in April 2014 reveal the extent to which the father may be prepared to go to get his children back to England. He says, &#8216;I hate you so much&#8230;The truly fair outcome in this is that you get on a plane and come back to the UK and allow me to be a dad&#8217;. In a later message he wrote, &#8216;I am sorry for everything, if you knew how much I wanted my family you would understand, if I took the kids away from you, you would say and do anything to get them back&#8230;&#8217;</p>

She also placed the family&#8217;s two dogs with an animal transport company in anticipation of them being sent to England. The parents&#8217; accounts relating to these issues are contentious. She says that the father insisted that the furniture be sent to England. He says that it was the mother&#8217;s decision to send the furniture to England. The mother says that until 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> January (the date when the children were due to return to Australia) she still harboured hopes that they would be returned. </p>

A friend of mine knew a retired High Court Judge in Australia and I asked him what I could do if the respondent failed to return the children to me. He mentioned the Hague Convention; he told me that if the respondent refused to return the children it was a criminal offence and that the federal police would get involved. He told me that he could get arrested for abduction. I was worried as I did not want the respondent to be arrested. He seemed troubled by the fact that I was on the verge of losing the family home as the respondent had told me he would not pay the arrears and that I had been served with an eviction notice. I had told him about the eviction date later in the month. I was very confused and did not know what to do. I was very upset. The retired judge seemed to suggest that I would need to go back to England because of the difficult circumstances my husband had put me in. He did not explain to me the mechanics of the Hague Convention but he did mention it as a way of getting the children back to Australia. I had no access to funds to get proper legal advice.&#8217;</p>

Until recently, when he began to put money directly into her bank account, he would send cash with the children when the mother had contact with them. It is not difficult to see that this would have been demeaning for the mother. By passing the money on via the children it will also have reinforced in their minds the fact that their mother was completely financially dependent upon their father. </p>

After undertaking a detailed review of the law in this area, Lord Browne-Wilkinson set out the following summary of the relevant principles:</p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.71in"><span style="color:#000000">&#8216;To bring these strands together, in my view the applicable principles are as follows. (1) For the purposes of article 13 of the Convention, the question whether the wronged parent has "acquiesced" in the removal or retention of the child depends upon his actual state of mind. As Neill L.J. said in </span><span class="Emphasis" style="color:#000000">In re S. (Minors) (Abduction: Acquiescence)</span><span style="color:#000000"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 F.L.R. 819" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 F.L.R. 819</ref>, 838: "the court is primarily concerned, not with the question of the other parent's perception of the applicant's conduct, but with the question whether the applicant acquiesced in fact." (2) The subjective intention of the wronged parent is a question of fact for the trial judge to determine in all the circumstances of the case, the burden of proof being on the abducting parent. (3) The trial judge, in reaching his decision on that question of fact, will no doubt be inclined to attach more weight to the contemporaneous words and actions of the wronged parent than to his bare assertions in evidence of his intention. But that is a question of the weight to be attached to evidence and is not a question of law. (4) There is only one exception. Where the words or actions of the wronged parent clearly and unequivocally show and have led the other parent to believe that the wronged parent is not asserting or going to assert his right to the summary return of the child and are inconsistent with such return, justice requires that the wronged parent be held to have acquiesced.&#8217;</span></p>

	      <p class="NormalWeb" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.71in"><span style="color:#000000">&#8216;&#8230;there may be cases in which the wronged parent has so conducted himself as to lead the abducting parent to believe that the wronged parent is not going to insist on the summary return of the child. Thus the wronged parent may sign a formal agreement that the child is to remain in the country to which he has been abducted. Again, he may take an active part in proceedings in the country to which the child has been abducted to determine the long-term future of the child. No developed system of justice would permit the wronged parent in such circumstances to go back on the stance which he has, to the knowledge of the other parent, unequivocally adopted: to do so would be unjust&#8230;</span></p>

Such clear and unequivocal conduct is not normally to be found in passing remarks or letters written by a parent who has recently suffered the trauma of the removal of his children. Still less is it to be found in a request for access showing the wronged parent's desire to preserve contact with the child, in negotiations for the voluntary return of the child&#8230;&#8217;</p>

Only when an English judge identified abduction as a possible issue and transferred the proceedings to the High Court did the father apply for the summary return of the children. The application was made 11 months after the removal. Dismissing the father&#8217;s application, Coleridge J said (&#167;[21]),</p>

But those are not a pre-requisite for the establishing of defence of acquiescence. What is important is that he knew he could bring proceedings for their return to France but he chose instead, by April 2007, to accept the situation of the children having returned to their home country. From then on it seems to me he acted in accordance with that decision and the mother cannot but have believed that he had accepted the situation which by then had arisen.&#8217;</p>

There are enough incidents in the report of the distress and general mayhem caused by the making of return orders that were foreseeably bound to provoke dramatic scenes. In these cases an option open to the judge is a meeting at which practicalities, consequences and reassurances can be ventilated. The judge sits above the family turmoil. The judge&#8217;s authority can be an influence for acceptance. Importantly a meeting gives the judge an opportunity directly to assess where the return order will lead if enforcement will be resisted. Dramatic (and by no means unknown) scenes such as the pilot refusing to take off without the children disembarking or children barricading themselves and threatening suicide cause profound damage to the principal actors and a great deal of disturbance to others in the cast or in the wings.&#8217;</p>

The court is entitled to take into account the various aspects of the Convention policy, alongside the circumstances which gave the court a discretion in the first place and the wider considerations of the child&#8217;s rights and welfare. I would, therefore, respectfully agree with Thorpe&#160;LJ in the passage quoted in para&#160;[32] above, save for the word &#8216;overriding&#8217; if it suggests that the Convention objectives should always be given more weight than the other considerations.

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and secondly, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of Art&#160;12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child&#8217;s views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child&#8217;s objections, the extent to which they are &#8216;authentically her own&#8217; or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child&#8217;s objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.</p>

As for the planning for the mother&#8217;s return, it was she who decided that the furniture be put in containers for shipping to England, not the father.

Following her arrival in England, in a telephone conversation with the father&#8217;s solicitor the mother is said to have confirmed that she intended to remain in England (although there is no witness statement from the solicitor). She issued an application for a child arrangements order with a view to increasing the amount of time the children spent with her. In her written statement in support of that application she had said that she was seeking to secure rented accommodation for herself and the children rather than continue to live with her parents. She also said that she was looking for work. It is clear from all of this that the mother had acquiesced in the father&#8217;s decision to retain the children in England. Having acquiesced, the mother was not then entitled to change her mind. And yet the mother did subsequently change her mind; that is why the children are so angry with her. She has not listened to them.</p>

Despite that, she made it very clear in her application that she wanted the children to be returned to Australia and that she intended to make an application through the Central Authority.

Although there is no detailed evidence before the court concerning the father&#8217;s financial position there is evidence which suggests that he is, financially, in a very comfortable position. He maintained the mother, four children and two dogs in their home in Australia for over seven years. For much of that time he also rented another property nearby which he used as a base for having contact with the children. He paid for the children to attend fee-paying schools. He was able to afford to travel to Australia three or four times a year. He paid for the children to visit England in January 2014 and again in November 2014. On the second occasion he also paid for the mother to travel to England to visit her terminally ill grandmother. Since the children have been living in England he has taken them on holidays which he himself accepts were &#8216;expensive&#8217; holidays. He has arranged for the children to take the entrance exam for a public school in England and has secured a place there for Simon beginning in September. On the very day I met with the children the father was installing a hot tub in his garden. The clear picture which emerges from this is that the father is a man of financial substance.</p>

Whilst I do not doubt that that was a cause of increasing irritation for the father (and was something about which he failed to take any appropriate steps to resolve) it was also a means by which he could exercise control over the mother, demonstrated most eloquently by the events surrounding his decision not to return the children to Australia in January. He promised the he would pay the mortgage arrears. He did not do so, choosing instead to spend his money on taking the children on an expensive 17-day skiing holiday.</p>

The text message exchanges to which I referred earlier, when taken in the round, do not paint a picture of a mother who has acquiesced in the retention of her children in England or of a free and considered choice by her to return to live in England.

It could be said, therefore, that the informal advice from a retired Australian High Court Judge was sufficient to fix her with knowledge that there were possible legal remedies available to her and therefore to start the clock ticking in terms of delay amounting to acquiescence. Once again, however, that knowledge, rudimentary as it was, needs to be seen in the overall context of the mother&#8217;s situation. She was being put under intense financial pressure by the father. The text messages clearly demonstrate the pressure she was under. That must have been obvious to the father. Whilst still clinging to the hope that he would pay off the mortgage arrears, she single-handedly had to take steps to empty her home before eviction. She was engaged in regular text message exchanges with the father in which she sought his cooperation and assistance in dealing with the property (which was not forthcoming), in which she repeatedly pleaded with the father to return the children (which he refused) and in which, on occasions, the father resorted to the use of abusive and hostile language thereby adding to the mother&#8217;s stress and distress.</p>

I accept that in principle that act could be interpreted as an abandonment of her right to seek the children&#8217;s summary return to Australia and an acceptance that the children should remain in England. It could amount to conduct which, in principle, could have led the father to believe that the mother was not asserting and/or not going to assert her right to the summary return of the children. However, in the particular circumstances of this case I am not satisfied that that interpretation of the mother&#8217;s actions would be appropriate. As I indicated earlier, the mother issued those proceedings as a litigant in person having paid for an hour&#8217;s advice from a solicitor. There is good reason to believe that the advice given was inappropriate and wrong. However, in my judgment the way in which the mother completed her application form saves her from what might otherwise be considered as acquiescence. In her application form she makes it plain that she seeks not only the return of the children to her care but also to be able to return them to Australia. Indeed, she makes it plain that she is not abandoning her right to issue Hague proceedings, saying in terms, &#8216;I am contemplating making an immediate application for the return of the children to Australia through the Central Authority.&#8217; It is clear that the Family Court did not respond appropriately to that indication in the mother&#8217;s application form. The mother&#8217;s application should have been transferred to the High Court. It wasn&#8217;t. It is also the case that within four weeks of issuing those proceedings the mother had completed an application form to enable ICACU to commence these proceedings.</p>

For the reasons I have already given, in my judgment, it does not. The totality of the history of events and communications over the period from November 2014 to April 2015 cannot be said to have led the father genuinely to believe that the mother was not asserting or going to assert her right to the summary return of the children such that justice requires that the mother be held to have acquiesced.</p>

They have been able to spend more time with the wider family (in particular with Molly) than had been possible under the previous ad hoc arrangements for international contact. The father has deliberately marginalised the mother. He has made contact difficult. To all of this must be added the fact that Harry appears to be labouring under the mistaken belief that a return to Australia would mean that he would not be able to see his father again. That mistaken belief could conceivably have been fostered by the father.

He said that he &#8216;was finding it a bit of a struggle at his new school&#8217;. He had had one good friend in Australia. Like Harry, Peter did not express any objections that related to Australia or to life in Australia. He has nothing negative to say about his mother&#8217;s care of him whilst living in Australia.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In her letter to her mother and during her meeting with me, Clare emphasised the importance for her of living amongst her wider family and friends. It is clear that she has a particularly strong wish to live with Molly. She makes the same points in the letter she wrote to the Judge. In my judgment these are an expression of wishes, feelings and preferences and not of an objection to returning to her country of habitual residence. I accept that in her discussions with Ms Adams Clare&#8217;s views were expressed with greater force than those of her brothers. I acknowledge that unlike her brothers Clare did make one negative comment about Australia saying that she &#8216;was actually quite lonely in Australia cos it was just me and my mum &#8211; the only two girls in the house&#8217;. However, other concerns she expressed are to do with financial issues which are more to do with the relationship between her parents than with living in Australia. For example, Clare is the one who has the most vivid memories of telephone arguments between her parents concerning money; she is the one who expresses concern about how they would survive financially if they returned to Australia. Clare is also the one who harbours the greatest degree of anger towards her mother for not listening to her. After careful thought and reflection I have come to the conclusion that notwithstanding the fairly low threshold requirement to establish a child&#8217;s objections, I am not satisfied that, in Convention terms, Clare does object to returning to Australia. </p>

In my judgment, the gateway to the exercise of discretion is not open. My findings on acquiescence and children&#8217;s objections have the inevitable consequence that there must be an order for the summary return of the children to Australia. However, for the sake of completeness and in deference to the careful submissions of counsel, I propose to set out the conclusions I would have reached on the exercise of discretion had the gateway to the exercise of discretion been open.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">For the father, Miss Thain submits that in exercising its discretion it is appropriate for the court to have regard to the fact that if the children were to return to Australia there are, at present, no arrangements in place for accommodation or for education. The children would be returning to uncertainty. Furthermore, if the children return to Australia then unlike the present position in England there will be no family support available to them other than the support of their mother. In terms of Article 13, these submissions could conceivably have been advanced in support of a contention that there is a grave risk that returning the children to Australia would place the children in an intolerable situation. Miss Thain conceded that in the circumstances of this case that would have been a deeply unattractive submission. She assured me that if, contrary to her submissions, I should come to the conclusion that there should be an order for the summary return of the children to Australia then the father will provide appropriate financial support.</p>

Prior to the father&#8217;s wrongful retention the children were happy and settled in Australia. The children came to England for an agreed holiday. To be allowed wrongfully to retain the children in England after an agreed holiday would risk significantly undermining the purpose and philosophy of the Convention. The father has engineered the present situation by his financial control of the mother. His actions are wholly reprehensible and should be condemned by the court. Had the father wished to challenge the status quo he should (as Ms Adams acknowledged) have issued proceedings in Australia seeking an order permitting him to relocate the children to England.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">All four children express a preference to remain in England. For Clare, in particular, that can properly be described as a strong preference. At the heart of the children&#8217;s position is the desire to be amongst their wider family and in particular to live with Molly. They also wish to remain in the primary care of their father. All of that is clear. There is, however, in my judgment, a serious issue about the extent to which the children&#8217;s views are authentically their own. Although Ms Adams was clear that the children did not appear to be expressing their views according to a pre-prepared script or to have been influenced by the father taking them on expensive holidays, there are factors which suggest that the children&#8217;s views have been coloured by their father. In her letter to her mother, Clare says that &#8216;My dad tells me the truth and tells me what is going on&#8217;. In discussion with Ms Adams she said that she was worried about how life would be if they returned to Australia &#8216;as she knew her mum had no money and her dad had paid for everything since they split up&#8217;.  In his letter to his mother, Harry expressed the belief that &#8216;if we go back to Australia we will never see our family again, if we go back we will never see our daddy.&#8217; Simon told Ms Adams that being around his dad &#8216;had a sense of everything being &#8220;better&#8221; and somehow easier&#8217;, an observation which could be an indication that he, too, is aware of the greater financial security when living with his father compared to the financial uncertainty and unpredictability of life with his mother.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Miss Renton submits that since their wrongful retention by the father the children have been living in &#8216;a bubble of respite&#8217;. I accept that submission. As a result of living in that bubble of respite there is a degree of artificiality about the way in which the children have arrived at their views. Their views have been coloured not by unhappy memories of living in Australia (either as a country or as a result of the care provided for them there by their mother) but by their comfortable existence living with their father and, as I find, by the climate he has created which is a climate based on negativity towards the mother and the subtle use of his wealth.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Although the exercise of discretion is not a decision-making process in which the welfare of the child is paramount, it is clear from the authorities that welfare is an issue to which the court may have regard when exercising its discretion. In this case these children had lived with her mother continuously for more than seven years from the date of separation until their wrongful retention in England in January 2015. It is clear that the mother had been the children&#8217;s primary carer throughout their lives until January 2015. I have noted Ms Adams&#8217; acknowledgment that none of the children expressed criticism of their mother&#8217;s care. In those circumstances an abrupt change of primary carer brought about by the wrongful act of the other parent is unlikely to have been compatible with their welfare. Even if I had concluded that the children do in fact object to returning to Australia, I do not regard it as self-evident that their objections, even if rational and cogent, are necessarily compatible with their welfare interests.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The father should have applied to the Australian court for permission to relocate the children to England. I have no doubt that he could easily have afforded the cost of such litigation. Instead of taking the honourable approach he has chosen to take the dishonourable approach. He has retained the children in England at the end of an agreed holiday. He has abused the power imbalance in his relationship with the mother, in particular by putting her under intense financial pressure. He has stood idly by as she has been evicted from her home. What he has been unable to do is to persuade this court that the mother has acquiesced in his wrongful retention of the children in England or that the expressed views of his children amount to &#8216;objections&#8217; in Convention terms. It follows, therefore, that there should be an order for the summary return of the children to Australia.</p>

I hope that assurance will be made good. For the mother, Miss Renton has indicated that if the court orders the children to return then divorce proceedings and an application for a financial remedy will be issued immediately and an urgent hearing sought to enable the mother to apply for maintenance pending suit. It may be that both of those routes will have to be pursued &#8211; negotiation alongside an application to the court. During argument there was mention of the court allowing a period of 4 weeks for the return to take place. However, I will hear further submissions before coming to a final view on that issue.</p>
