He was initially bailed with a condition that he could not reside at the family home; that condition was relaxed in February 2013, and he returned.  There remains a prohibition on JJ having any contact with TT.  In June 2014 JJ was charged with a number of serious offences against TT.  As he still awaits trial on those charges, I propose to say no more about them.</p>

The delay in making the application was not easily explained; I understand (in fact it was LT who volunteered this) that this arose because the social workers wanted to give MJ more opportunity to consider separation from JJ.</p>

Directions had previously been given on 13 December 2013 (DJ Batten) for the disclosure of police material generated during their enquiries, initially to the Official Solicitor acting for TT; the CPS and relevant police force objected to the wider disclosure of the material to the respondents until a charging decision had been made (possibly, it was said, until any trial, given that TT, WT and LT would all be witnesses).   Plainly, for as long as the police material remained withheld from the respondents, no effective preparation could be made for a fact-finding hearing.</p>

At that hearing the case took an unexpected turn; MJ and JJ (who were helpfully represented by counsel instructed by the Bar Council Pro Bono Unit) indicated that they intended to remain together as a couple, irrespective of the allegations &amp;/or the outcome of any trial of the allegations, and did not propose to offer TT a home, now or in the long-term.  Specifically, they conceded that:</p>

It was agreed that the issue should be adjourned for reflection and further argument; a plea and case management hearing in the Crown Court was to take place on the following day.  Counsel instructed for JJ indicated that he would discuss with counsel for the Crown whether enhanced reporting restrictions could be sought.  I adjourned the CPS application to 29 July, and after hearing limited argument, authorised limited disclosure of redacted material by consent.</p>

This question cannot properly be determined until steps have been taken to assist TT to acquire capacity by providing her with sex education, having regard to the provisions of <span style="font-style:italic">section 1(3)</span>.  It is accepted that this cannot properly take place until TT has given evidence in the criminal proceedings concerning her step-father.  For present purposes, I can confirm that there is reason to believe, for the reasons set out in &#167;28(iii) above, that TT lacks capacity to consent to sexual relations.</p>

If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When forming a view of MJ I bear in mind that she has participated in these proceedings, which must be extremely painful for her, unrepresented.  She has done so with considerable composure and respect for the court and the legal representatives.  When WT and LT gave evidence, I assisted MJ to ask her questions in cross-examination, essentially channelling them through me.</p>

This was WT&#8217;s evidence, and I accept it.  MJ is currently adamant that JJ is innocent of the allegations raised by her daughters; her inability or unwillingness to entertain the possibility that her daughters may be telling the truth is concerning.  She is jealous of TT&#8217;s relationship with WT and LT, and has spitefully attacked TT for consorting with them.  She has, at times, been shown to be thoughtless in her interactions with TT (such as the reference to prison at the meeting on 8 June 2014), but at other times, I find that she has been manipulative in speaking inappropriately with TT at times when she will have known that others will not be able to observe her behaviour. </p>

WT drew a clear causative link between the conflict generated by MJ and TT&#8217;s distress.  I thought that WT gave her evidence calmly, not criticising her mother unfairly.

MJ told me in her closing submissions at the end of the three day hearing: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I love her </span>(TT)<span style="font-style:italic"> and miss her so much.  I want to see my daughter</span>&#8221; (by which I understand, &#8220;want to see her as often as I can&#8221;).     LBX propose to increase the Saturday contacts in duration, and to offer a degree of flexibility as to the venue for the Wednesday contact.  This seems to me to strike the right balance between respecting TT&#8217;s wish for more time with her mother, while ensuring a degree of control on the arrangements.  As indicated above, there remains potential for the contact to be upsetting, and this needs carefully to be kept under review. The Official Solicitor has suggested a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">light touch</span>&#8221; to the supervision of TT&#8217;s contact with her mother.  In view of my findings as to MJ&#8217;s capacity to upset TT, and the potential for her to disrupt the placement, and particularly given the imminent criminal trial, I do not feel that I can authorise that sort of relaxation at this stage.</p>
