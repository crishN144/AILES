Although in this case the parties are male civil partners, the principles are equally applicable to all relationships where financial remedies proceedings are brought under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> or the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/33" uk:canonical="2004 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Partnership Act 2004</ref>. </p>

The question is whether the domestic abuse alleged in this case is potentially a relevant factor in financial remedies litigation, in circumstances where &#8220;conduct&#8221; is, in accordance with both statute and case law, only to be taken into account if it is of a highly exceptional nature.</p>

In my judgment, in furtherance of the overriding objective and FPR 2010 1.4, the court is entitled at that stage to make an order preventing the party who pleads conduct from relying upon it, if the court is satisfied that  the exceptionality threshold required to bring it within s25(2)(g) would not be met. The court should also take into account whether it is proportionate to permit the allegation to proceed, for a pleaded conduct claim usually has the effect of increasing costs and diminishing the prospects of settlement. Finally, the court should take into account whether the allegation, even if proved, would be material to the outcome.  </p>

The authorities clearly indicate that such conduct would only be reflected where there is a financial consequence to its impact. In one case the husband had stabbed the wife and the wound had impaired her earning capacity. The impact of such conduct was properly reflected in the discretionary disposition made in the wife&#8217;s favour. Mrs Miller alleged that Mr Miller had unjustifiably ended the marriage discarding her in favour of another woman. Therefore, she argued that Mr Miller should not be permitted to argue that their marriage was short. This argument was rejected by the House of Lords which held that the conduct in question, although greatly distressing to Mrs Miller, should not find independent reflection in the court&#8217;s decision.</span></p>

O points me to <span style="font-weight:bold">K v L <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/125" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 125" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 125</ref> </span>where the husband had sexually abused the wife&#8217;s grandchildren but (i) that is a Permission to Appeal report after a short, one sided hearing and therefore not ordinarily citable, (ii) although conduct was found to be relevant (unsurprisingly on the facts), it is not at all clear how it sounded in the overall award and (iii) there were plenty of other factors justifying the ultimate order (see para 14). In <span style="font-weight:bold">FRB v DCA (No 2) [2020] EWHC (Fam) </span>the wife&#8217;s conduct in allowing the husband to believe that he was the child&#8217;s biological father did amount to conduct that was inequitable to disregard (again, unsurprisingly). It is not hard to see how that may have caused the husband financial as well as emotional damage, as he paid for the child&#8217;s upbringing, but on the facts of that case the conduct in fact was not reflected in the award save as a counterweight to the husband&#8217;s non-disclosure. In <span style="font-weight:bold">Al Khatib v Masry [2002] EWHC 108</span>, where the husband abducted the children to Saudi Arabia and did not return them, the conduct was reflected in the award principally by reference to provision of a &#163;2.5m litigation fighting find for W to attempt to secure their return, which seems to me to be an example of conduct generated need. </p>

Furthermore, although it was argued that there had been no direct financial consequence on the wife, the original order was set aside because the wife had lost the opportunity of seeking a higher award which does seem to me of itself to have been at the very least a potential financial consequence; otherwise, why would the order have been set aside?</p>

In other words, they are taken into account by the court to the extent that they affect the distributive process under s23 and s24.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Even in those very rare cases where there is a possible financial consequence of the alleged conduct, the court must decide whether there is any need to litigate the allegations. It seems to me that in the great majority of cases, the impact on the alleged victim can and ordinarily will be taken into account by reference to the conventional criteria regardless of whether domestic abuse has in fact taken place. One example is behaviour which affects somebody&#8217;s earning capacity. Courts routinely weigh in the balance diminished earning capacity (and of course earning capacity is a specific consideration under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref>). It is hard to see why there would be any need to embark upon a lengthy and conflicted dispute about the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">cause</span> of the diminished earning capacity. What matters is reflecting the limited earning capacity in the overall award. Another example might be behaviour which leads to additional needs such as medical costs. Again, it is hard to see how a court will be assisted by detailed inquiry into the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">cause</span> of the need; what matters is the individual&#8217;s requirements and the extent to which they should be met going forward. In other words, I doubt very much that domestic abuse would have a material impact on the vast majority of cases, such that it needs to be litigated. </p>

Domestic abuse allegations are almost always disputed, and frequently met with cross allegations. Cases would need more hearings and longer time estimates. The need for Qualified Legal Representatives where the parties are litigants in person would expand dramatically. Applications for additional evidence (police, medical, psychiatric and so on) would ensue. Costs would increase markedly. It is hard to see how cases involving allegations of domestic abuse would settle before final hearing, given the charged nature of the subject matter.

The medical notes to which I have been referred demonstrate that for decades N has had a variety of experiences which have contributed to his mental state regardless of J&#8217;s behaviour. These include: a deeply troubled childhood, being diagnosed HIV positive, the death of a former partner, being separated from J for long periods while they were both pursuing their work commitments and the failure of his film projects, all of which contributed to long standing depression. It does not seem to me that the nexus between J&#8217;s behaviours and N&#8217;s mental health decline is &#8220;obvious&#8221; for there may have been many factors at play. The treatment was for depression generally, not for obsessive paranoia specifically, and to separate out the extent to which each factor affected N&#8217;s health, and J&#8217;s knowledge of how much of it was referable to his own actions, would be a highly difficult exercise. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">I consider the conduct argument to be disproportionate. It will considerably  add to the length of the case and the costs to no purpose. This is a highly contentious case. I reject the suggestion by Mr Kingscote KC that it will only take limited time; the 1500-page length of the bundle for this case management hearing, and the length of the parties&#8217; written and oral submissions on this point alone, point firmly the other way.  Factors such as the length of the relationship on either party&#8217;s case, the needs of N, the extent of J&#8217;s pre-relationship wealth, and the effect of the Partnership Agreement are likely to be far more influential.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the risk of lengthening this already over-long judgment, the magnetic feature of this case and, I suspect, in other cases where personal misconduct is alleged (i.e the first of the categories of conduct identified by Mostyn J in <span style="font-weight:bold">OG v AG)</span>, is that, in my view, the financial distribution can be fairly achieved by reference to all the other <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> criteria (and their equivalent under the Civil Partnership Act) without any need to take account of the conduct allegations, and conduct (even if found) would make no material difference to outcome. </p>
