	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Something of the background to these proceedings is set out in my interim judgment but it requires to be repeated and expanded here. The proceedings concern NB. She<span style="font-style:italic"/>came to live in the UK in 1985 and married her husband in 1992. The marriage was contracted abroad. When NB first came to live in the United Kingdom she did so without her husband (AU). There was a period in which the couple were separated whilst AU made an application for permission to enter the UK, but in May 1996 NB travelled abroad to return to live with her husband. Following a series of applications to the Home Office throughout 1997 the couple came, eventually, to live together here in London. They lived with NB's parents. A daughter was born a year later (1998).</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Mr Bagchi has taken me through some of the records in this case which illuminate the evolution of the couple's relationship. Though some of this is now historical, it identifies NB&#8217;s early attachment to and affection for her husband which continues to resonate in the more recent evidence. In a letter to the Immigration Appeals department, as long ago as March 1996, a clinical psychologist, Ms Suzanne Wilson, stated:  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.99in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">'I believe NB's experience of AU's absence is stressful due to her attachment and affection towards him which has developed during their periods together in [Country C]. In her daily life NB consistently demonstrates her intense attachment to her husband. She often says his name with affection. She repeatedly asks where he is and pleads that he should be with her. [NB] appears to understand the lasting nature of marriage, including that of marriage as a committed sexual bond between a man and a woman. It is my view that [NB] would be very unlikely to have such an affectionate attachment to her husband if this were not on a mutual basis and I therefore believe that her attachment can be taken as evidence of AU's positive attention and caring towards her when they are together'. </span></p>

There is no record of what it was that she said to the dentist, or at least none which has been presented to this court, but it is clear that it had something to do with the quality of her relationship with her husband and it was such as to give rise to a concern that she might be vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Very quickly, a programme was put in place focusing on sex education, relationships, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases as well as more general issues relating to NB's health.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Following this work, a further assessment was undertaken by a clinical psychologist to consider NB's range of understanding on those key issues. The conclusion of the assessment was that NB was unable to demonstrate an appreciation of why people got married, separated or divorced. It was concluded that she lacked the mental capacity to marry. In respect of her capacity to consent to sexual relations it was considered that she lacked an understanding of the association between sexual intercourse and pregnancy. Additionally, she lacked the ability to appreciate the link between sexual intercourse and sexually transmitted disease. Inevitably, it followed, that she could not link various forms of contraception to the concept of averting pregnancy. She did not have the capacity to retain information in relation to these issues. It was also considered that she was unable to communicate the concept of refusal of sex to her husband. That opinion appears to have been re-evaluated as further information came to light. These different facets of the test reflect the development of the applicable case law.

In a statement prepared by Laura Baker, dated 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2018, I am told the couple share a bedroom but sleep in single beds. NB uses betel nut which I am told is a stimulant and frequently causes her to wake through the night. AU&#8217;s approach is to pacify his wife and support her. Inevitably his disrupted sleep pattern has led to tiredness. Though he expressed a need to take a break and there was some discussion about a package of support, AU did not take it up. Ms Baker illustrated examples of NB exhibiting challenging behaviours when she is being encouraged to do something she does not wish to. From this it is now extrapolated that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;it is unlikely that NB is being forced in to a sexual relationship with her husband&#8217;;  </span></p>

Crucially, the question is whether she (or he) lacks the capacity to understand the sexual nature of the act. Her knowledge and understanding need not be complete or sophisticated.

Does the person have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature and character &#8211; the sexual nature and character - of the act of sexual intercourse, and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of sexual intercourse, to have the capacity to choose whether or not to engage in it, the capacity to decide whether to give or withhold consent to sexual intercourse (and, where relevant, to communicate their choice to their spouse)? &#8230; </span></p>

The entire tenor of the language of this judgment strikes me as emphasising the flexibility of the applicable tests, consciously eschewing a rigidity of approach. In this it strikes me as holding fast to the central tenet of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, which requires the focus of assessment to be centred upon an evaluation of the particular individual and a specific decision. The Code of Practice issued by the Lord Chancellor and to which judges must have regard (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/42/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 42(5)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>) makes it clear (at para. 4.4) that the assessment of a person's capacity must be based on their ability to make a specific decision at the time it needs to be made, and not their ability to make decisions in general: as it is often expressed in the Court of Protection, it is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;decision-specific&#8217;</span> (see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">PC &amp; NC v City of York Council</span><span/><span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/478" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 478" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 478</ref></span> at paras. 31-35).  </p>

In my judgment, the same goes, and for much the same reasons, in relation to capacity to consent to sexual relations. The question is issue specific, both in the general sense and, as I have already pointed out, in the sense that capacity has to be assessed in relation to the particular kind of sexual activity in question. But capacity to consent to sexual relations is, in my judgment, a question directed to the nature of the activity rather than to the identity of the sexual partner. </span></p>

It is difficult to see how it can sensibly be said that she has the capacity to consent to a particular sexual act with Y whilst at the same time lacking capacity to consent to precisely the same sexual act with Z. So, capacity to sexual intercourse depends upon a person having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature and character &#8211; the sexual nature and character &#8211; of the act of sexual intercourse, and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of sexual intercourse, to have the capacity to choose whether or not to engage in it, the capacity to decide whether to give or withhold consent to sexual intercourse. It does not depend upon an understanding of the consequences of sexual intercourse with a particular person. Put shortly, capacity to consent to sexual relations is issue specific; it is not person (partner) specific.&#8217;  </span></p>

Mr Sachdeva correctly pointed out that there is no necessary requirement that the civil (family) law and criminal law should adopt the same test for capacity to consent to sexual relations, though plainly the civil law's test of consent cannot derogate from the protections afforded to the vulnerable by the criminal law. So, it is at least possible to contemplate the civil law imposing a different and more demanding test of capacity. But, as Mr Sachdeva says, it adds clarity if the civil law and the criminal law do share the same test.  </span></p>

In this context both the criminal law and the civil law serve the same important function: to protect the vulnerable from abuse and exploitation (see further below). Viewed from this perspective, X either has capacity to consent to sexual intercourse or she does not.

My Lords, it is difficult to think of an activity which is more person and situation specific than sexual relations. One does not consent to sex in general. One consents to this act of sex with this person at this time and in this place. Autonomy entails the freedom and the capacity to make a choice of whether or not to do so. This is entirely consistent with the respect for autonomy in matters of private life which is guaranteed by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The object of the 2003 Act was to get away from the previous &#8220;status&#8221; based approach which assumed that all &#8220;defectives&#8221; lacked capacity, and thus denied them the possibility of making autonomous choices, while failing to protect those whose mental disorder deprived them of autonomy in other ways.&#8217; </span></p>

It is of course highly desirable that there should be no unnecessary inconsistency between them. However, capacity arises in different contexts. In the criminal law it arises most commonly in respect of a single incident and a particular person where the need to distinguish between capacity and consent may have no significance on the facts. In a case such as the present, however, capacity has to be decided in isolation from any specific circumstances of sexual activity as the purpose of the capacity enquiry is to justify the prevention of any such circumstances arising. There is of course no absolute distinction between capacity in civil and capacity in criminal law, it is merely that they fall to be considered in very different contexts and often, perhaps, for different purposes.&#8217; </span></p>

The lexicon of the law, perhaps even that of ordinary discourse, presents a challenge when seeking to distil the essence of the concepts in focus. With hesitation and some diffidence, it seems to me to be important to recognise and acknowledge, that in this interpersonal context, relationships are driven as much by instinct and emotion as by rational choice. Indeed, it is the former rather than the latter which invariably prevail. This fundamental aspect of our humanity requires to be identified and appreciated as common to all, including those who suffer some impairment of mind. To fail to do so would be to lose sight of the primary objective of the MCA. It would require a disregard of at least two decades of jurisprudence emphasising P&#8217;s autonomy. Moreover, it would seriously risk discriminating against vulnerable adults with learning disabilities and other cognitive challenges. </p>

In many ways, of course, instinct and emotion are the antithesis of reason. However, whilst they may cloud decision making, perhaps even to the point of eclipsing any calculation of risk, they are nonetheless central to sexual impulse. To establish an inflexible criterion to what may properly constitute &#8216;consent&#8217; risks imposing a rationality which is entirely artificial. </p>

Much of the applicable criteria concerning assessment of capacity, across a broad range of decisions, finds its way into this process via the conduit of expert evidence.

The application of that test in other cases is, however, a live matter as it is currently under consideration by Hayden J in London Borough of Tower Hamlets v NB </span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2019/17.html" style="font-style:italic"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2019/17" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCOP 17" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCOP 17</ref>.</a><span style="font-style:italic"> In that case the judge observed in his interim judgment (at [12]) that there was only one individual with whom it was really contemplated that NB was likely to have a sexual relationship, her husband of 27 years; and it therefore seemed to the judge entirely artificial to be assessing her capacity in general terms when the reality was entirely specific. He added (at [13]) that it might be that NB's lack of understanding of sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy might not serve to vitiate her consent to have sex with her husband. There was no reason to suggest that her husband had had sexual relations outside the marriage and there was no history of sexually transmitted disease. Hayden J has reserved his judgment on the issue. Another example would be a post-menopausal woman, for whom the risk of pregnancy is irrelevant. In IM (at [[75]- [79] the Court of Appeal held that, by contrast with the criminal law where the focus, in the context of sexual offences, will always be upon a particular specific past event, in the context of mental capacity to enter into sexual relations the test is general and issue specific. The argument before Hayden J in London Borough of Tower Hamlets v NB was presumably that the conclusion in IM does not preclude the tailoring of relevant information to accommodate the individual characteristics of the person being assessed. We heard no argument on these points and do not need to decide them on the present appeals since it was not contended by the OS that anything in Cobb J's guideline was inapplicable because of B's personal characteristics. The criticism of the OS is that parts (iii), (iv) and (v) in their present form are inapposite in all cases.&#8217; </span></p>

Most are made in the community by social and healthcare professionals. There is accordingly a public interest in the test being relatively simple and easy to apply. If the court were to suggest that in relation to certain individuals there would be no need to assess an understanding of the risk of pregnancy or of STIs (that is, components (ii) (iv) or (v) in the test articulated by Cobb J (and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in B), it is incumbent on the court to specify how those undertaking the assessment are to approach that preliminary question.&#8217; </span></p>

Mr Bagchi suggests that the Court should identify a category of individuals for whom pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease will not require assessment. Indeed, he goes further and asserts that it is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;incumbent on the Court to specify how those undertaking the assessment are to approach that preliminary question.&#8217;</span> This, in my judgment, is only likely to overburden the test and to introduce unnecessary technicalities.

Whilst the test can rightly be characterised as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;issue specific&#8217;</span>, in the sense that the key criteria will inevitably be objective, there will, on occasions, be a subjective or person specific context to its application.

The difficulty stems from the fact that even people in apparently happy and apparently monogamous relationships can and do have sexual encounters with others and are not always prone to tell the truth about it. In theory, this is as true of P as P&#8217;s partner. The material questions are likely to include:- </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is facile to seek to exclude P in some absolute way from future harm. Like the Family Court, the Court of Protection frequently evaluates risk. It may do so only on the basis of known facts. Thus, a monogamous marriage of some thirty years duration, where there is no history of sexually transmitted disease, is probably a secure base from which to predict that this is a very low risk for the future. It is in this context that </p>

One consents to this act of sex with this person at this time and in this place' [emphasis added]. The focus of the criminal law, in the context of sexual offences, will always be upon a particular specific past event with any issue relating to consent being evaluated in retrospect with respect to that singular event. But the fact that a person either does or does not consent to sexual activity with a particular person at a fixed point in time, or does or does not have capacity to give such consent, does not mean that it is impossible, or legally impermissible, for a court assessing capacity to make a general evaluation which is not tied down to a particular partner, time and place</span>. </p>

On a pragmatic basis, if for no other reason, capacity to consent to future sexual relations can only be assessed on a general and non-specific basis.&#8217; </span></p>

On the contrary, the preponderant evidence suggests that she is capacitous. This was foreshadowed in Mr Bagchi&#8217;s earlier submissions, referred at para 44 above (though I recognise that they were not structured around the test as now identified). The Local Authority may wish to consider a reassessment of NB&#8217;s capacity in the light of this judgment. This will, of course, depend on whether the marriage survives.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The Court of Protection deals with human beings who, for a whole variety of reasons, have lost or may have lost capacity. This may be temporary, permanent, fluctuating or limited to a constrained sphere of decision taking. A declaration of incapacity whether tightly circumscribed or expansive in its scope, should not impose sameness or uniformity. The personality and circumstances of the incapacitous are as rich, varied and complex as those of anybody else. All this requires to be taken in to account when evaluating capacity in every sphere of decision taking. As practitioners and indeed as judges we must be vigilant to ensure that the applicable tests do not become a tyranny of sameness, in circumstances where they are capable of being applied in a manner that may properly be tailored to the individual&#8217;s situation. To do otherwise would, for the reasons I have set out, lose sight of the key principles of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.  </p>
