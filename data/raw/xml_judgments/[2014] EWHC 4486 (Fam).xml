The media have made clear that it has no intention of naming them.  The issue is indirect identification.

The potential consequence would be to require HM Coroner to hold an anonymous inquest, to continue an inquest into the death of an unnamed child. &#160;If Mr Worthington were to be charged in respect of the death of Poppi or other allegations that have newly been&#160;made, those proceedings would have to be conducted anonymously unless that order was lifted.</span></p>

These are exceptionally tragic circumstances.  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">[Redacted]</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:12pt">  Mr Worthington says that naming him would destabilise his life.

The media does not seem to object to a restriction preventing them from naming Barrow-in-Furness.  I see that as a reasonable restriction at least at this point in time.  Naming Barrow-in-Furness risks the identification of the children still further as it is a small and rather specific community.  </span></p>

The matters urged on behalf of the children in particular persuade me to this view.  The children have been caught in a desperate situation which is not of their making.  I balance against that that they are now some distance away and that they probably will be for some time to come.  Time is important for them as it will allow the social worker, the Children&#8217;s Guardian and a psychologist to work with them.  But I am not persuaded that a blanket ban on the press will dependably protect them or that there is not a better way of working with them that may protect them in the interim.  </span></p>

In this case, decisions in respect of criminal proceedings are yet to be taken.  The Court cannot foresee and react to every possible development.

I have considered the risk to Mr Worthington but concluded that the risk to him is no greater than the risk posed to anyone else who is suspected to have carried out such actions.  The public and the local community have a right to make their own decisions in respect of Mr Worthington.</span></p>
