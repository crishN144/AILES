I expressed it thus: unless the court is satisfied on a probability scale of 50% or more that there would be a substantive award leave should not be granted.  The reasoning that led me to that conclusion was that it would be, I suggested, manifestly an abuse of language to suggest that there was either a substantial ground for making the claim or that the claim was solid, if it could be said that it was unlikely that it would succeed; or, put another way, if it was more probable than not that the claim would be dismissed.  That seemed to me to be the only logical definition that could be applied to the concept of &#8220;substantial ground&#8221;, as referred to in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.13</ref>.</span></p>
