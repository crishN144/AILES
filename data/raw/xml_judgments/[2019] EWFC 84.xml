This will involve a real and detailed consideration of (inter alia): the child's day to day life and experiences; family environment; interests and hobbies; friends etc. and an appreciation of which adults are most important to the child.  The approach must always be child driven.  I emphasis this because all too frequently and this case is no exception, the statements filed focus predominantly on the adult parties.  It is all too common for the Court to have to drill deep for information about the child's life and routine.   This should have been mined to the surface in the preparation of the case and regarded as the primary objective of the statements.  I am bound to say that if the lawyers follow this approach more assiduously, I consider that the very discipline of the preparation is most likely to clarify where the child is habitually resident.  I must also say that this exercise, if properly engaged with, should lead to a reduction in these enquiries in the courtroom.  Habitual residence is essentially a factual issue, it ought therefore, in the overwhelming majority of cases, to be readily capable of identification by the parties&#8230;.&#8217;   </span></p>

Article 9 provides that where a Contracting State that falls within the definition of Article 8 (2) (for example where the child has a substantial connection under Article 8(2)(d)) it can request the State with originating jurisdiction to authorise the former to instead exercise jurisdiction <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;to take measures of protection they consider necessary&#8217;.</span> The basis of such a request is that they consider that they are <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;better placed in the particular case to assess the child&#8217;s best interests&#8217;</span> (Article 9 (1)). The transfer of jurisdiction through this route requires the Contracting State to whom the request has been made to accept that request.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">They both recognise there are a number of factors that weigh against such a conclusion including the fact that the original purpose of the trip was temporary for the purposes of a holiday, there is no evidence of any plans being made for the trip to be longer term, all X&#8217;s family (save for two relatives here) remain in Country Y where X had lived all their life, the lack of information the authorities have here regarding the father&#8217;s role in X&#8217;s life and the extent to which he was exercising rights of custody. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The factors they submit that point to establishing habitual residence here include X&#8217;s wish not to return to Country Y, the reasons that underpin those views (namely their concerns regarding neglect, physical assault and limitations on their ability to explore their gender identity) and that X&#8217;s recent ambivalence about returning can be explained in the context of the loss of relationships within their family. In addition, X has settled into a family environment here with their current carers. Whilst there have been some recent difficulties with those relationships during a recent respite placement X has returned to the placement and continues to do well there. X attends school takes part in school related and other activities within the community and has established a degree of stability and integration in social and family life here. By remaining here, X has been able to continue to develop their relationship with the two family members who live here.    </p>

In the event the court is unable to conclude habitual residence was established then it was at the time of this hearing in accordance with the 1996 Convention. </p>

She is in Country Y and at some stage either prior to coming here (as X has recently suggested) or at least before she left decided X should remain here, as evidenced by taking their passport with her. In communications with her since she has not changed her position about this, although it has to be recognised she made no plans for X remaining here, in terms of their care or schooling. </p>

X has joined various extra-curricular activities which they have continued to attend, and their command of English has meant X does not require an interpreter to communicate with professionals within these proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Viewing the wide canvas of evidence available to the court I have reached the conclusion that X&#8217;s habitual residence was here in June 2019. In doing so I have carefully balanced the factors that point away from such a determination. My conclusion is reached for the following reasons. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">First, X&#8217;s wishes have remained consistent up until June that they did not wish to return to Country Y. X was able to rationalise those wishes with what they described as their experience of being cared for in Country Y which, according to them, placed them at risk of harm through the physical and emotional abuse X described by those who were caring for them. Additionally, X has felt able to discuss here factors relating to their gender identity that X is clear would not be open to them if they returned to Country Y. X was able to support that with a description of when X did the steps, X says, their mother took to seek to rid them of such explorative thoughts. Whilst there has, more recently, been some ambivalence about X&#8217;s views on returning to Country Y that needs to be considered in the context of their age, the loss of their family relationships and on a wider evaluation of the evidence about their wishes which continue to demonstrate a wish to remain here. Bearing in mind X&#8217;s age and circumstances the court can and should place some weight on their views.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Second, whilst the majority of X&#8217;s family members remain in Country Y and X was born and brought up there, X describes an unsettled life following their parents&#8217; separation and implicated many of the family members who would be available to care for them in Country Y in the mistreatment of X and their failure to protect X from such harm. In the circumstances of this case, the gravitational pull of X&#8217;s prior habitual residence in Country Y is less in circumstances where they describe such a fragmented lifestyle there, their abandonment by their mother in this jurisdiction, together with their own views about where their social and family environment were in June, namely here. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Third, whilst it is right there is no evidence of the mother prior to their arrival in early 2019, or during her time here, making any plans for X to integrate into society, education and other aspects of day to day life here and by leaving in the way she did, without apparent notice and taking X&#8217;s passport with her, she left X here with no plans for their future care. Since then the evidence demonstrates X has settled into a family environment here, enjoying the support provided by their settled foster placement, attending school, improving his/her English and attending a number of extra-curricular activities, as described in the evidence. The level of settlement X has experienced is supported by the way they have felt able to discuss on several occasions the issues that arise from their wish to explore their gender identity. Between March and June, the evidence demonstrates X&#8217;s circumstances have established a degree of stability and integration in social and family life here. </p>
