The documents and records suggest that it was a relationship interspersed with varying degrees of domestic violence by the father upon the mother which was from time to time, witnessed by C.

An important component of the plan for C to live in Rwanda is for the order I will make to be executed, recognised and registered in the Rwandan High Court. I have read the advice of Gemma Lindfield dated 19 May 2014, who advised on the procedure to be followed in Rwanda. The procedure will take 14-28 days after the date of filing of the necessary application. Accordingly there is some flexibility in the Transition Plan to accommodate the legal procedures in Rwanda. </p>
