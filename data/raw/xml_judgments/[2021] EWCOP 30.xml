I have heard and read the evidence of Dr S, a consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist; I have heard and read the evidence of Ms D, who is the Clinical Lead Nurse and Ward Manager at Kingsgate Hospital.  I have heard the oral evidence of KG&#8217;s two adult sons (AG and BG). I have read extensively into the bundle of documents (a pared down version of the full bundle, but still exceeding 420 pages) filed in the proceedings. One of the potential witnesses, Ms M, a registered mental nurse (KG&#8217;s named nurse), was unavoidably unable to attend to give evidence through ill-health.  After some deliberation, none of the parties proposed that the hearing should be adjourned to ensure that she could attend. </p>

He also told me that he disagreed with Ms M whose view was that KG displayed fluctuating capacity.  Dr S described KG&#8217;s presentation as indicating fluctuating levels of <span style="font-style:italic">engagement</span> not fluctuating <span style="font-style:italic">capacity</span>. Dr S expressed a concern &#8211; and notably, AG agreed with this assessment &#8211; that KG does not have the ability to weigh up the information relevant to his care and treatment. Dr S emphasised to me that KG has a real need to be compliant with his medication, and if he is not, he could become very seriously unwell again. </p>

Dr S, sensing the anxiety which lay behind the question, acknowledged the regrettable but commonplace stigma around dementia, and recognised that this diagnosis created different and potentially more difficult pathways for KG&#8217;s future care. However, Dr S was clear that it is crucial that KG&#8217;s probable dementia should not be ignored, and it should be monitored because if it progresses it has serious treatment and prognostic implications. In answer to further questions from BG, Dr S explained the implications of the diagnosis of probable vascular dementia on KG&#8217;s life expectancy. </p>

Up to this point, she told me, KG had generally tended to shut down, and was getting increasingly hostile to efforts to engage him in this regard; &#8220;he would stand up and tell me to get out of his room&#8221;.

In this regard, I particularly noted Ms D&#8217;s evidence that she tried to have the conversation with him about his future residence and care while watching a football match on the television, so that he would at least be settled and relaxed.  This was to no avail. She added: &#8220;I have tried all things in all ways; he shuts down on me and becomes quite distant&#8230; he gets irate and annoyed.  This is the most difficult case I have been involved with in relation to capacity&#8221;.

In clinical practice (inpatient settings) it has been the author&#8217;s experience that those detained in hospital particularly for lengthy periods are often unwilling to leave hospital having become familiar with and content with the care provided at their address. This familiarity and degree of content is such as to raise anxiety when discharged/transferred to another address is suggested. The reality for some individuals (this is a general observation and not meant to specifically apply to [KG]) is that moving to another address i.e. a community facility particularly in the absence of family/meaningful friends is a daunting/terrifying prospect for individuals as the only carers they will have in a community setting are professional carers. This is a general observation and cannot be concluded as that which might explain [KG]&#8217;s lack of participation in the examination.&#8221; </p>

Ms M was of the view that KG could pose a risk to himself and potentially others if he did not receive care support as outlined above; she added, importantly, that when KG has agreed to discuss his care and support needs it is evident that he has not been able to retain or use or weigh the more complex medical information in relation to certain aspects of his care and support (i.e. medication regime, diet control).  </p>

He feels that the professionals have failed to maximise his capacity with regards to the specific decision about his future residence. In a witness statement he expressed concern that KG may not be part of the final decision-making process, a concern which I hope I have dispelled by speaking directly and personally with KG before the hearing began yesterday. He expressed a clear and rational concern that KG has become institutionalised (see above), and needs help and support in recognising the benefits of the move.
