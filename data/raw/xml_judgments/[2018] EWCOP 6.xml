	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 4 March 2018 Sergei Skripal and Yulia Skripal were admitted to hospital in Salisbury. Tests carried out by Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down concluded that they had been exposed to a nerve agent.  Both Mr and Ms Skripal remain in hospital under heavy sedation. The precise effect of their exposure on their long term health remains unclear albeit medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree. </p>

However central to the application before me is the fact that on  14 and 16 March 2018 the UK government issued a formal invitation to the Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to send a team of experts to the United Kingdom &#8216;to assist in the  technical evaluation of  unscheduled chemicals in accordance with Article VIII 38(e).&#8217;  This in effect is to independently verify the analysis carried out by Porton Down.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The application came before me on 20 March 2018.  It was made on an urgent basis. The OPCW wished to collect samples in the near future. The evidence is that samples taken from living individuals are of more scientific value than post mortem samples. At present both Mr and Ms Skripal are critical but stable; it is not inconceivable that their condition could rapidly deteriorate. I heard submissions from the Secretary of State and from the Official Solicitor who was to be appointed the Litigation Friend of both Mr and Ms Skripal. The NHS Trust were neither present nor represented although they are a Respondent to each application. I was told that the NHS Trust were aware of the application and the evidence I have read from the lead treating clinician is that they do not feel comfortable going beyond their clinical role.  In effect the NHS Trust are therefore neutral on this application although they have confirmed that they will implement or facilitate any order that I make.  At the conclusion of the hearing I gave my decision and short reasons and now I set out that decision and reasoning more fully.</p>

Both Mr Eadie QC on behalf of the Secretary of State and Mr Sachdeva QC on behalf of the Official Solicitor submitted that the applications should be heard in private because of the potentially sensitive nature of the evidence and the need to protect Mr and Ms Skripal and other people involved in the proceedings. </p>

However the effect of PD4C 2.1 is to reverse that apparent &#8216;General Rule&#8217; by providing that the Court will ordinarily make an order under COPR 4.3(1)(a) for the hearing to be in public unless it appears to the court there is a good reason for not making the order. </p>

Given the nature of the issues raised in the case and the gravity of the situation I conclude that both Mr and Ms Skripal should be joined as parties and that the Official Solicitor should be appointed as Litigation Friend to each of them. <span style="color:#000000">As a result of my having appointed a Litigation Friend for Mr and Ms Skripal I raised the issue with the parties of whether this gave rise to any notification obligation pursuant to Articles 36 and 37 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963 as Ms Skripal is a  Russian national although Mr Skripal became a British national.  In the field of care cases in the Family Court the President gave some guidance on this issue in In </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Re E (A Child)</span><span style="color:#000000"> [2014] EWHC 6 (Fam).   Mr Thomas QC submitted that as there is no domestic implementation of Art 37 no obligation arises. He also questioned whether the court could be a competent authority.  He noted that the Convention is implemented by section 1 and Schedule 1 of the Consular Relations Act 1968  and that this does not include Article 37. I note that at paragraphs 41 and 44 in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Re E</span><span style="color:#000000"> (above) the President noted the issue in relation to the effect of Article 37 in public international and English domestic law. Mr Sachdeva QC drew my attention to the context in which the President offered the guidance and that it was guidance only for the purposes of care cases in the family court.  Both Mr Thomas QC and Mr Sachdeva QC also submitted that even if (and it is a very big if) that guidance could be transposed into the Court of Protection there was good reason for not imposing a notification obligation still less the other obligations the President identified in paragraph 47 of </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Re E</span><span style="color:#000000">. I am satisfied for the reasons set out above that there is no notification obligation in law on this court. The nature and extent of any good practice which might be followed in Court of Protection cases where a foreign national is the subject of an application may require consideration in another case.  In practice, the Russian consular authorities will be made aware of these proceedings because this judgment will be published. I do not consider it necessary to list the issue for the sort of further extensive argument that would be necessary to enable the court to determine if any good practice guidance should be given. </span></p>

Whether that will remain the case cannot be ascertained. I will not consolidate the applications but will at present direct that they be listed together. If separate considerations arise in respect of either Mr Skripal or Ms Skripal that will enable one application to be restored to court without the necessity of the other application being listed at the same time. </p>

He submitted that although there was little evidence before the court about Mr Skripal or Ms Skripal as individual persons there was nothing that should cause the court to consider either hold views which would suggest they would not want to get to the bottom of what had happened. Mr Sachdeva QC also noted that in this case at present it did not appear practicable or appropriate to seek the views of others who might be interested in the welfare of Mr Skripal (his mother perhaps) or Ms Skripal&#8217;s (perhaps a fianc&#233;).  In particular he emphasised that the detriment to either Mr Skripal or Ms Skripal was negligible; in particular in relation to the physical aspects of the taking of the samples but also the disclosure of medical records and the subsequent consequences of the investigation. </p>

The OPCW has a Technical Secretariat which amongst other roles provides technical assistance and technical evaluation to State Parties in implementing the CWC.  The CWC requires States to designate a National Authority to liaise with the Technical Secretariat (TS).  The UK requested assistance from the Technical Secretariat to obtain independent, internationally recognised expert identification of the nerve agent used. Their report on that and any other matter they consider appropriate will be of real importance for many reasons including in relation to the on-going criminal process, detecting and deterring any further attacks, allaying false rumour and in supporting the international response. The OPCW have agreed to visit to provide assistance in the week commencing 19 March 2018.  This is pursuant to Art VIII 38(e) of the CWC. The TS intends to obtain new blood samples, obtain and test some of the samples already taken and undertake DNA testing to match the new and existing samples. The OPCW TS has well established procedures dealing with obtaining samples, use, preservation and storage, maintaining chain of custody, confidentiality and destruction.    If the OPCW results differ from UK tests the UK national authority will be able to share them with clinicians to inform medical treatment. </p>

Section 2 imposes a &#8216;diagnostic threshold&#8217; which in this case is addressed by the medical evidence contained in the Forms COP 3 and the witness statement of a medical consultant involved in the care of Mr and Ms Skripal.

There is no means by which he could currently be enabled to make a decision. On the evidence currently available it is not possible to say whether the current lack of capacity is temporary or permanent.

The case is put both by the Secretary of State and the Official Solicitor on the basis of how the beliefs and values of the reasonable adult subjected to an attack of any sort, but particularly of this sort, might influence their decision.  Although it would be impossible for me to be unaware of what is in the public domain about Mr Skripal and Ms Skripal that is not evidenced before me and so I am constrained to approach this decision at this moment in time on the basis of assumptions as to how a reasonable citizen would approach matters.  In the absence of any evidence to show that either Mr Skripal or Ms Skripal was not a reasonable citizen that is how I will approach it.   The evidence establishes that the OPCW is an independent organisation with the support of 192 nation States and one of whose primary tasks is providing technical assistance in relation to chemical weapons issues. Their procedures appear to be rigorous and robust &#8211; as would be expected given the subject matter of their work. Their enquiry can be expected to be entirely objective and independent.  The results of their enquiry will likely hold very considerable weight in any forum.  Their enquiry is therefore likely to produce the most robust, objective, independent and reliable material which will inform any determination of what happened to Mr Skripal and Ms Skripal.  That might simply confirm the current conclusions, it might elaborate or clarify them, it might reach a different conclusion. Although the Secretary of State does not believe the latter prospect to be likely given her confidence in Porton Down&#8217;s findings I do not think the possibility can be ignored &#8211; and in particular I do not think an individual faced with supporting or not supporting such an inquiry would ignore that possibility at this stage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Most reasonable citizens in my experience have a quite acute sense of justice and injustice. Most want to secure the best information about what has happened when a serious crime is alleged to have been committed. I accept that such a person would believe in the rule of law; that justice requires that crime or serious allegations of crime are thoroughly investigated; that where possible answers are found as to who, how and why a crime was perpetrated, that where possible truth is spoken to power; that no-one whether an individual or a State is above or beyond the reach of the law and that in these turbulent times what can be done to support the effective operation of international conventions is done. Whilst I don&#8217;t assume that the reasonable citizen would necessarily have asked himself or herself those sorts of questions in quite such detail I do believe that if those issues were put to them they would adopt them and they would influence their decision. In any event all go to the general point that the reasonable citizen, including Mr Skripal and Ms Skripal believe that justice should be done. The conduct of the investigations proposed by the OPCW will further the general aim of justice being done as well as perhaps the more precisely identified goals which Mr Eadie QC identified in the course of argument. I accept that Mr Skripal and Ms Skripal&#8217;s decision would be influenced by these values and beliefs and that the influence would be in favour of consenting to the taking and testing of samples and disclosure of notes.  I am satisfied that an inquiry such as the OPCW will conduct which might verify Porton Down&#8217;s conclusion, might elaborate or clarify them or might reach a different conclusion is something they would wish be conducted and they would want to assist in that by providing samples. </p>

I understand that the Secretary of State reposes complete confidence in the results of the tests carried out by Porton Down but I believe both that Mr Skripal and Ms Skripal would wish for the further analysis (and so s.4(6)(c) would be engaged) but that also objectively there is benefit in the expertise of the OPCW also being brought to bear even if the possibility of them uncovering something useful from a medical perspective may be slight. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the other side of the equation what points to such steps not being in their best interests or being harmful? The taking of the modest blood samples proposed through the cannula already in situ will have very little impact. ZZ is of the opinion that it will be unlikely to adversely effect their clinical condition.  The involvement of the OPCW and the use to which the results may be put in support of the pursuit of &#8216;justice&#8217; will no doubt lead to further publicity but it seems to me to be unlikely to lead to any further intrusion than is currently the case and assuming that Mr Skripal and Ms Skripal regain consciousness so as to be aware of it. Does the authorisation of further testing create any further risk to the physical safety of Mr Skripal or Ms Skripal? I have not been addressed on this issue &#8211; theoretically I suppose it might if it were thought the death of Mr Skripal and Ms Skripal prior to the taking of samples might undermine the efficacy of the evidence gathering exercise (as opined by DD).  The Secretary of State has confirmed that measures are already in place to ensure their physical safety. Does the disclosure of medical notes to the OPCW amount to an intrusion into their privacy which is not in their best interests? I accept ZZ&#8217;s point that disclosure of medical records should only go so far as is necessary and this will cover disclosure from the period 4 March 2018 and for the specific information that the OPCW has sought. If it is sought I consider that it is in their best interests that OPCW is provided with copies of the relevant records not merely having sight of them. The processes which are in place for maintaining the confidentiality of such records (along with the integrity of the samples) which are evidenced satisfy me that copies could be provided subject to their destruction or return at the conclusion of the enquiry. </p>

In so far as it is necessary it is also lawful and in their best interests that the existing samples are provided to OPCW for further testing. </p>
