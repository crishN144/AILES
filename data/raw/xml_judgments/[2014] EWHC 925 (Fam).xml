	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013, Baker J gave permission to RM, the wife, to apply for financial provision pursuant to Part III of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984</ref> [&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>&#8221;].   As provided for by the Rules, the respondent husband, RW, was not on notice in respect of the application.  Accordingly, the leave was granted without notice.   From here on I shall refer to the parties respectively as the wife and the husband although they were divorced finally in November 2010 in New Zealand.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Leave having been granted without notice, the husband now applies to set it aside on notice and, as a makeweight to that application, that the wife&#8217;s substantive application should be struck out.  I do not think this further application adds anything to the issues in the end.  I have now had the benefit of full written and oral submissions by both sides who are well represented by counsel.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband seeks to set aside the leave granted on two main grounds.  The first ground, which Mr Bentham concedes only occurred to him very late in the day and was only notified to the wife&#8217;s legal team on the morning of the hearing, concerns this court&#8217;s jurisdiction to hear the wife&#8217;s claim at all.  In a nutshell the husband contends that in the light of the &#8220;Maintenance Regulation&#8221; this court does not in fact have jurisdiction to entertain the wife&#8217;s application for income provision.  The second ground upon which the husband relies, the substantive ground, is that the leave granted should be set aside because Baker J was not given the full picture so far as the proceedings which had taken place in New Zealand is concerned, and that had he had the full picture, in the way I have, this application by the wife would be bound to fail and so should not be allowed to proceed any further now.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The husband&#8217;s essential argument is that this a classic &#8220;second bite of the cherry&#8221; case.  His argument is that all the wife&#8217;s claims at the time of the parties divorce were fully and fairly dealt with in New Zealand, entirely properly according to New Zealand practice and law and the wife, having spent the full share which she received at the time, should not now be able to come back in this jurisdiction and have another go.   Mr Bentham argues that the filter process provided for under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> is precisely designed and targeted to filter out a case of this kind where proper provision has been made by a foreign court.  </p>

	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The wife&#8217;s simple response to the husband&#8217;s application is that this court does have jurisdiction under the Maintenance Regulation, when properly analysed, and, in relation to the substantive ground relied on by the husband, she was not dealt with fairly in New Zealand and now finds herself in this country very short of financial resources.   </p>

The parties made their home in England and overseas as and when the husband&#8217;s military postings required him to do so.  In 2001 a decision was taken by the family to move to New Zealand and they did so in September of that year having bought a home there in the June.   The husband had not by that stage completed his final tour of duty in the Army.  That occurred in April 2005 when he too went to make his home in New Zealand with the family.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties separated in March 2008, so the marriage lasted in effect 20 years.   During 2008 and 2009, the parties instructed solicitors in order to help them sort out their financial affairs.   As a result of their negotiations, a written agreement was entered into on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2009.  That agreement was drawn up into a document described as &#8220;Separation and Relationship Property Agreement&#8221;.  I shall turn to look at that in detail in a moment.  Following the signing of the agreement a decree nisi was pronounced on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2010 and made final on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2010.  Very shortly after the divorce was pronounced, the wife returned to live in this country in December 2010.  She has remained in this country ever since and regards herself as domiciled and habitually resident in this jurisdiction.  Neither party has remarried although the husband lives with a new partner and has a young child.  He has remained living in New Zealand.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In March 2010, the wife applied in New Zealand to set aside the separation agreement on a number of conventional grounds.  However, for reasons which are not fully explained, she withdrew that application in July 2013 and it has subsequently been dismissed.  The wife applied in this jurisdiction under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2013 and it is the leave granted on that day by Baker J which is the focus of this application.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This separation agreement was the culmination of negotiations partly between the parties direct and partly between their specialist lawyers instructed on each side.  It is to be found in the bundle prepared for today&#8217;s hearing at page 15.  It is an agreement in a form specially recognised by New Zealand Statute; the Statute being the &#8220;The Property (Relationships) Act 1976&#8221; and in particular section 21A.  It is four pages long and perfectly straightforward and simple to interpret and understand.  Paragraph 1 sets out the background and records the basic features of the parties&#8217; relationship, marriage and children.   Recital (d) under the heading Background reads:  &#8220;The parties are the registered proprietors of &#8230; the family home.  The family home has been sold and settlement of the sale is to take place on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2009&#8221;.  Recital (f) reads:  &#8220;The parties have continued to run their finances together from separation through until the date of this agreement&#8221;.  Recital (g) reads:  &#8220;RW has an entitlement to an Armed Forces Pension and a War Disablement Pension in the United Kingdom&#8221;.  Recital (h) reads:  &#8220;The parties have reached agreement on differences between them relating to the property owned by either or both of them situated in both the United Kingdom and New Zealand and wish to record that agreement pursuant to section 21A of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>). </p>

In fact, even where proceedings are commenced in court and the parties reach agreement before judgement, it is often the case that the understandings reached will be recorded in an agreement under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 21</ref>A of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and the proceedings discontinued, rather than consent orders being made.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Bentham complains loudly and strongly on the husband&#8217;s behalf that this attempt by the wife to launch a second full scale application for financial provision (for such it would in effect be) is to entirely ignore the full and final nature of the New Zealand agreement.  He says there is simply no justification for the wife to be able to go behind the written agreement which was fully compliant with New Zealand divorce law and practice.  He summarises his case at the foot of his written argument in this way:</p>

In that regard he draws attention to the Maintenance Regulation which governs the jurisdiction of the English court, regardless of whether any other relevant jurisdiction is an EU Member State, or if no other jurisdiction is involved.  The Maintenance Regulation becomes relevant because of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 15</ref>(1A) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MFPA 1984</ref>.  </p>

Firstly, that the defendant is habitually resident in this country (he is plainly not).  Secondly, that the maintenance creditor is habitually resident here.  Mr Bentham contends that the wife is not a creditor.  And thirdly, if the court has jurisdiction to entertain proceedings relating to the status of a person and the issue of maintenance is ancillary to those proceedings.  It is conceded that the court does not have jurisdiction to entertain proceedings relating to status because the divorce, as is plain, was dealt with in New Zealand.  </p>

He develops his argument fully in an addendum written submission which was lodged with the court following upon the conclusion of the oral hearing.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essence of this point turns upon the construction of the term &#8220;creditor&#8221;.  A creditor, says Mr Bentham, is not a mere applicant.  Mr Bentham goes on to suggest that in any event the wife in the particular circumstances of Part III is not even an applicant for maintenance (let alone a creditor) unless and until she is given permission to bring a claim which, of course, is the very thing that is in issue in this application.  So, says Mr Bentham, the application need proceed no further and should be struck out for want of jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Allen, on behalf of the wife, is faced now with a slightly different evidential situation to that which existed at the time of his application to Baker J on 30 July.  In the first place he has the benefit of the unchallenged legal opinion from the New Zealand barrister Stephanie Marsden.  That document puts beyond doubt what the efficacy of the 9 June 2009 agreement was and is.  Mr Allen is therefore driven to fall back on the more conventional grounds for undermining an agreement, being non-disclosure, undue pressure and lack of proper valuation.  He says in his careful written argument that the wife settled on unfavourable terms because the pensions were valued in a way which was unfavourable to her and undervalued them by English standards.  He also maintains that there were features of the disclosure process which meant she was not fully in the picture.  Finally he says that the wife felt under particular pressure at the time when the agreement was concluded.</p>

He concludes this part of his argument in this way:</p>

Mr Allen contends that the proper place to make these arguments is at a full hearing after full and proper disclosure and that it is the wife&#8217;s right, as a resident of this country, to have her claims properly assessed.</p>

In that case Lord Collins set out extensively the proper approach to these cases in general and preliminary applications of this kind in particular.  He indicated that the court should be slow to allow extended debates at the leave stage and should only prevent applications going forward if the parties seeking to set aside the leave could deliver a &#8220;knock out blow&#8221;.  He did, however, at paragraph 72 provide general guidance as to the purpose of Part III.  He said this:</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;It is not the purpose of Part III to allow a spouse (usually, in current conditions, the wife) with some English connections to make an application in England to take advantage of what may well be the more generous approach in England to financial provision, particularly in so-called big-money cases.  There is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of s 16, but it will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law, and an award was made in the foreign country.  In such cases mere disparity between that award and what would be awarded on an English divorce will certainly be insufficient to trigger the application of Part III.  Nor is hardship or injustice (much less serious injustice) a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction, but if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate, in light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made, and may affect the nature of the provision ordered.  Of course, the court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dealing first with the jurisdiction point; I can cover that shortly.  I agree with Mr Allen&#8217;s interpretation of the meaning of creditor in the context of Article 3 of the Maintenance Regulation.  The term &#8220;creditor&#8221; is of course generally to be found where a debt is already in existence.  However, I think a proper reading of the Article, particularly against the background of the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Farrell v Long </span>drives me to the conclusion that a maintenance creditor is someone who is an applicant in the sense of a potential creditor.  I consider that the Regulation makes little sense unless that is the proper interpretation.  Accordingly I find that the court does have jurisdiction to hear this claim.</p>

However, I have no doubt there are indeed occasionally cases where the existence of a clear preliminary point makes it desirable that such a point should be considered at the leave stage and before the prolonged and expensive disclosure process has been put in train, and therefore to prevent the unnecessary expenditure of costs.  I find that this is most certainly a case where the existence of this preliminary point properly merits a discrete hearing.</p>

He did not appreciate that the effect of the agreement finally concluded the proceedings in a way in which ordinarily in this country a consent order would be employed.  There is no reference to the full efficacy of the agreement in the wife&#8217;s skeleton put before him.  There is no reference to it in the note of the proceedings and there is no reference to it in the note of the judgment.  Indeed, on the contrary the judge seems to have been under the impression that the approval of the court was required.</p>

In the end I think the issue comes down to a simple one, which can be expressed in this way; does the New Zealand agreement make any prospect of the wife succeeding so remote as to be insufficient to justify leave being granted?  Is Part III of the MFPA to be allowed to be used in these very clear even stark circumstances?  </p>
