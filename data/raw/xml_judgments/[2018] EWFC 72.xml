A and B were made the subject of care orders and placement orders on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2008 in favour of Herefordshire Council. Neither were ever placed for adoption. A&#8217;s care order and placement order ceased to have effect when she attained majority on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September 2017. The local authority made an application to revoke the placement order in respect of B on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2018.  I revoked the placement order at a hearing before me on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2018. B attained her majority the following day.

However, if these are impacting on the ability of the department to meet the needs of a child as identified in the child&#8217;s care plan, the IRO should continue to escalate the issue.&#8221; </p>

The IRO may feel isolated and vulnerable in this position. It is essential that the IRO too can access independent legal advice, in addition to seeking the advice and support of the IRO manager. In the past some local authorities have been of the view that Cafcass duty lawyers provide this service. However, Cafcass duty lawyers can only provide guidance, not legal advice. Other local authorities have considered it sufficient for an IRO to seek advice from its own legal department. This is clearly not independent.&#8221; </p>

Taken as a whole they set out the hugely important function that an IRO performs to ensure that a looked after child is well served and whose needs are met by the local authority as his or her corporate parent. </p>

The fact that I have chosen in this judgment to focus on the role and actions of the various IRO&#8217;s should not be taken in any way to diminish the failures of the social workers and/or their mangers in this case. Rather the failings of the IROs has been so stark and grave that, in my judgment, it was appropriate to focus on the failings of the IROs and the IRO service in this case. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Once a court makes a care order it entrusts, as by statute it must, the future care of the child to the local authority. The essential safeguard the court and the public at large have that a local authority will be a good corporate parent is the function and role of the IRO. Any obstruction of an IRO performing their statutory role or any diminution in an IRO, or their manager, feeling empowered to do so, is a matter of the utmost consequence. For otherwise a looked after child is subject to the vagaries of social work practice and the local authority&#8217;s different pressures and priorities. The IRO is, or should be, the child&#8217;s protector or advocate. If the IRO is silenced or pressured not to </p>

Furthermore I recognise that this local authority, like very many around the country, have difficulties recruiting and retaining social workers. As a consequence many social workers have to carry very heavy case loads, may not have sufficient experience to deal with the more complex cases and/or have limited time to work on a particular case. </p>

I simply do not know or do not understand why the care plan was changed from adoption to long term fostering in 2009. The explanation given in B&#8217;s 2018 Care Plan is plainly false or, at best, inaccurate.  </p>

When it is known deadlines may be missed, visits not undertaken, assessments not completed or other actions in furtherance of a child&#8217;s care plan not addressed, the IROs must take active steps to ensure a child&#8217;s welfare and future care is not disadvantaged by these omissions.  </p>
