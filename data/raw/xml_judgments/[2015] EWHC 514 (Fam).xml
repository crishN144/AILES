Divorce proceedings followed in this jurisdiction.  Both parties are now in or about their late forties.  There are two children of the family who are now aged seventeen and twelve respectively.  The wife lives with the children in this country and the husband lives in the United States.  The wife is now working part time as a teacher.

The wife was in person and the husband was represented by counsel.  The District Judge was highly critical of the wife.  He dismissed her claim for a lump sum of &#163;160,000, which he regarded as absurd and unrealistic.  He spoke of her having pursued &#8220;a single minded litigation crusade against the husband&#8221; and &#8220;of putting forward convoluted calculations which made no sense, misusing the figures to produce calculations far removed from financial reality&#8221;.  He accepted all of the husband&#8217;s evidence about his means.  He found there were no assets to speak of.  He rejected the wife&#8217;s wish to withdraw her application for ongoing maintenance for herself and the children and accepted the husband&#8217;s submission that those matters should be dealt with there and then in this jurisdiction.  He referred to the wife having issued proceedings for those reliefs in America the previous year, which he spoke of as &#8220;forum shopping&#8221;.  He said that the only reason he could see for her wishing to pursue those aspects in America was &#8220;&#8230;to prolong the litigation with the husband in circumstances where she is constantly forcing him to instruct lawyers in two jurisdictions and incur heavy costs&#8221;.  He dismissed her capital claims.  He ordered a nominal order for her maintenance and imposed a condition on her making any application to vary it that: (a) there must have been a substantial change in the husband&#8217;s financial circumstances; (b) that a District Judge must have given her permission to make a variation application; and (c) that there would have to be no similar proceedings on foot in the United States of America.  </span></p>

The answer is now agreed, namely that there are arrears of child maintenance. The husband puts them at &#163;11,500.  The wife puts them at &#163;22,500, a difference of &#163;11,000. That difference depends on what deductions from the husband&#8217;s gross pay in America are to be made to get to the net.

The gravamen of the decision of Judge T was to express himself as entirely satisfied that the English child maintenance order of 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June 2007 was an order for a set specified amount, namely &#163;160 per month per child, and was not a percentage order.  He regarded the English order as absolutely clear in that respect stating that the English Court had ordered it &#8220;very specifically&#8221; and that, if it had been an Illinois order, then there would have been &#8220;absolutely zero doubt in my mind that this is not a percentage order&#8221;.  He said that if one pretended that it was a percentage order then in those circumstances there would be arrearage (arrears) of about $10,000; but as it was not a percentage order, there was no arrearage.  The wife did not appeal that decision, although she had been represented at the hearing.  </span></p>

The issue was the question of the husband&#8217;s providing the wife with certified copies of his tax returns.  The court&#8217;s decision was to deny the wife such an order on the basis that, on the evidence then presented, there appeared to be no way in the United States by which the husband could actually get his tax returns certified by anyone.  Further enquiries established that there was in fact some sort of certification procedure and, on 10</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> January 2014, the court in Illinois  made an agreed order that the husband must provide certified copies on a yearly basis.  </span></p>

He amended the problematic area of certified tax returns in his 2007 order by &#8220;retrospectively&#8221; removing that direction (that the husband must disclose certified copies of his tax returns annually).  He replaced it with a provision that he (the husband) should provide a copy of each tax return as filed, vouched by him in a sworn statement that it represented an exact copy of that which he had filed with the US Revenue.  </span></p>

As I have said, District Judge Marin held that this was wrong.  With great respect to Judge T I find it difficult to see how the order could have been read by its terms as being anything other than a percentage order, albeit a percentage order which for the record stated the then current payment rate at &#163;160 per child per month.  I cannot imagine it being construed in any other way in this jurisdiction.  The question is whether the wife should be barred from bringing an enforcement claim to the English Court on the basis of what everyone accepts was a mistaken interpretation of the English Court&#8217;s order?  Mr. Evans submits she should be so barred: the District Judge was right.  He (Mr Evans) submits in particular that a mistaken order is a binding order unless appealed.

As between themselves, the parties are bound by the decision and may neither re-litigate the same cause of action nor re-open any issue which was an essential part of the decision.

By interpreting it not as a percentage order going up (or down) with the husband&#8217;s income, but rather as a fixed sum order fixed at the 2007 rate of &#163;160 per child per month, the Judge reduced in the result the sums which the children should have received.  That was not just a mistake, says Mr James: it was actually outwith the jurisdiction of the Illinois Court.  Although neither the wife nor the husband had sought a variation of the order for the children&#8217;s maintenance, the effect of Judge T&#8217;s order was to &#8216;re-write&#8217; the order (to use the wording of Mr James&#8217; submission).  He, Judge T, did so unwittingly, but he did so in such a way as to span the full six years back to 2007.  </span></p>

Sections 601 and 603 in particular demonstrate, in essence, that the enforcing court (Illinois) may enforce, but (with certain specified exceptions which do not apply) &#8220;&#8230;may not modify&#8221; the order brought in from the other jurisdiction (England).  So Mr. James submits that an order of a foreign court (Illinois) which is wrong (as held by the very English Judge who made the original order) and which in its result was beyond that court&#8217;s power, should not bind the party disadvantaged by the mistaken interpretation.  He says that this is particularly so where it concerns periodical payments for children and where the existence of arrears is admitted.  It comes to the husband, says Mr. James, taking advantage of the error, which is not just.  Mr. Evans responds that the husband is quite entitled to do so and that all these points were well known to the District Judge who had very great experience of this case.  </span></p>

There is difficulty about the provision of required certified tax returns, which is not the fault of the wife.  The husband lives in the United States.  There are arrears.  The wife, acting in person, wishes to enforce them.  She applies in the States to do so, because the husband lives there.  In 2013 the English order is interpreted in Illinois in a way which was not intended and which had the practical effect of reducing that substantive order.  The husband admits a minimum of &#163;11,500 of arrears if the order is interpreted on a percentage basis, as was intended.  However, as things stand, the wife is debarred by the husband&#8217;s successful reliance on a principle the intention of which is to produce justice between the parties.  </span></p>

It is just not reasonable here to require that, as a necessary precondition of her being able to defend herself from the application of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">res judicata</span><span style="font-size:14pt">, she should have appealed this foreign decision which in my judgment exceeded that court&#8217;s remit.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Accordingly, I am persuaded that the particular and unusual facts here are such as to bring this case into a truly exceptional category where overall justice between the parties would not be served by allowing the District Judge&#8217;s decision to stand.  On the contrary, to my mind it would permit an unacceptable injustice to the wife and the children, by denying enforcement of admittedly existing arrears.  Therefore, on enforcement I shall allow the appeal and permit the wife&#8217;s claim to enforce to continue. </span></p>

It may be that the District Judge will consider that allowing enforcement back over the full seven years to 2007 would be excessive.  That is a matter for him when this case reverts to District Judge level, and the decision may be influenced by the explanations for the non-payment, the steps that the wife was taking to enforce and perhaps the parties&#8217; respective means.</span></p>

Part 4 allows the court to strike out a case if, for example, it shows no reasonable grounds or is an abuse of the court&#8217;s process.  Mr. Evans fairly accepts that there had been no formal application by the husband under Part 18 and that the first notification of a suggested strike out came in his Skeleton Argument given to Mr. James on the morning of the hearing on 12</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2014.  The court may nevertheless make an order of its own initiative.  But if it is to do so and if it is to hold a hearing to decide whether to make such an order (as here) then, pursuant to Rule 4.3.3, it must give each party likely to affected by the order at least five days&#8217; notice of the hearing.  No such notice was sufficiently given in my Judgment by the DJ&#8217;s order of 2</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">nd</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2013 (para 17 above).  When it became clear that the District Judge was thinking of striking out the wife&#8217;s variation application, Mr. James brought this to the District Judge&#8217;s attention and complained about the lack of procedural formality.  It is right to say that there are many occasions in the Family Division where strict adherence to the rules is not always required.  However, the &#8216;striking out&#8217; of a variation application for child maintenance is a serious matter.  </span></p>
