Quite apart from the need to ensure that paramountcy is given to the children&#8217;s welfare (see &#167;12 above), I remind myself of some core principles of family law procedure &#8211; specifically the need to deal with the application justly, having regard to any welfare issues involved.  In a case which has grown immeasurably in almost every sense (including the number of parties, volume of documents filed, duration of proceedings and length of hearings), there is a need to ensure (more than ever) that they are dealt with expeditiously and fairly, proportionately to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues, while ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing.  I bear in mind the need to save expense (these proceedings have been financially crippling to the parties &#8211; over &#163;500,000 had been expended in fees by the July 2013 hearing &#8211; and there have been two contested hearings since then), and to allot to this case an appropriate share of the court&#8217;s resources, taking into account the need to allot resources to other cases (see generally </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">rule 1.1 FPR 2010</span><span style="color:initial">).  Consistent with these objectives is the statutory requirement upon me to have regard to the general principle that any delay in determining a question concerning the children&#8217;s upbringing is likely to prejudice the welfare of that child (</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref></span><span style="color:initial">).</span></p>

Any hope that the children may have been spared from exposure to this further split were confounded by sight of letters which the girls had personally written to their aunt and niece, Y and Z.  These letters are angry and disrespectful. It is troubling that the children should have been embroiled in this separate dispute in this way.  I detected no indication that the mothers had tried to moderate the children&#8217;s views, or influence them against writing in such unbridled and trenchant terms; indeed M2&#8217;s astonishing evidence was that she had &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">scanned</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221; the letters, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">I have not read them in any detail</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221;, adding &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">It is not for me to scold A and tell her what is and is not appropriate in this context.

Her somewhat unconventional approach to her work, to the parties, to the children, and to the court, has brought benefits to the case, which on one view had become stale by conventional endeavour.

While relying on social work instinct (which may in many ways be right) she has failed to bring to the task the critical rigour of analysis, which would derive at least in part from extensive background reading and research (which was crucial to a proper understanding of the case, but which was lacking here).  Regrettably, where the discipline of professionalism has been relaxed, there has been correspondingly greater scope for confusion and misunderstanding &#8211; this has undoubtedly pervaded, and regrettably irreparably damaged, important relationships between the social worker and the fathers in this case.</span></p>

That said, it must be borne in mind that M2 has to fulfil the roles of more than one parent for the children; she has to compensate for M1&#8217;s ill-health and unavailability for the children.  What may be seen to the outside world as &#8216;control&#8217; may in fact simply be a description of M2&#8217;s rigid organisation and administration of the family and its functioning, taking responsibility for many aspects of the children&#8217;s, and M1&#8217;s, life.  I should add that Dr. R commented that M2 has &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">overwhelmingly presented as loving, caring and supportive</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">&#8221; of M1.

GBR says that she found the fathers&#8217; manner &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">intimidating</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221;, and felt undermined by the fact that the fathers had researched GBR, and her art on the internet (she told me that she found this &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">negative, pointless&#8230; it was a distraction</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221; (XX Tolson); GBR thought that this had been done in an attempt to discredit her, and made her &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">ill at ease</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221;.  I pause here to remark that I do not criticise the fathers for this, and I consider that GBR was wrong to interpret their actions in the way she did. GBR had told them, I accept, that she had appeared on a television show, and that her art work was featured on-line.  Either or both of these comments could predictably have prompted some internet research.  In fact, GBR&#8217;s notes of the meeting do not reflect this discomfort; indeed, GBR reports that she offered the fathers and their counsel art therapy &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">if they were prepared to take on the challenge</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221;, and appeared to volunteer for them &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">my poem about my art</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221; and (surprisingly) details of her financial circumstances.</span></p>

The mothers felt that the fathers &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">dominated</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221; the discussions, and were &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">aggressive</span><span style="color:initial">&#8221; to the mothers.

The fathers were disparaging of GBR&#8217;s lack of professionalism, and had a dim view of her appreciation of the dynamics of the case.  The 3 January 2014 meeting had not gone well.  The men felt that they had been sidelined in the CIN meeting (F1 told me that &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">We were upset that things were being misrepresented, having one conversation at home, and another one in the CIN</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">&#8221; XX Hughes); a letter written by their solicitor afterwards refers to them being &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">disheartened by the &#8230; lack of progress being made at the [CIN] meeting</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">&#8221;.  I find that F2&#8217;s frustrations did probably boil over at the end of the meeting, and he did speak to GBR in a threatening tone after the meeting on 16 January 2014.  I am unable to assert on the balance of probabilities what the precise words used were.

I detected that the social worker&#8217;s activity has in part been misdirected, and lacking in focus.  While making allowances at the December hearing for the fact that she had not read into the background of the case, such allowances could not be afforded now &#8211; yet I did not really feel that the social worker even now had read all of the key documents, or understood the very complicated background of this family.

From a child welfare point of view, M1 and M2 have nothing to fear from the contact; indeed I would like to think that they may find that accepting and supporting contact is less arduous and emotionally draining than fighting it.  Time will tell whether they feel any more able to accept my advice than they have any of the other professionals.

I am satisfied that the relatively short duration of this order, while the supervision order runs its course, strikes the correct, and proportionate, balance between intruding on the rights of the parties to bring disputes concerning their children before the courts, while promoting the welfare of the subject children. I make the order for this period conscious that a specific duty is imposed on the local authority (</span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial">section 35(1)(c)(i)</span><span style="color:initial">) to apply to the court during the next 12 months for variation of the supervision order where it considers that the order is not being wholly complied with.  </span></p>
