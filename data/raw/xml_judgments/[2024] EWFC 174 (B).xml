The local authority also seeks findings that the mother failed to protect A as A has reported telling her mother about the abuse on two occasions but the mother either not believing her or telling her to tell the father to stop. It further submits B and C are at risk of suffering significant harm. The father denies all allegations of abuse. The mother now wholly accepts A&#8217;s account of abuse as being true but denies having any knowledge of the abuse until A was spoken to at school on 1 July 2022. </span></p>

I heard this case between 5 and 11 May 2023. I read a bundle consisting of 585 pages and viewed the ABE interviews of all three children. I had also previously viewed A&#8217;s interview for the purpose of a Re W hearing. I also received written closing submissions on behalf of the father and the Guardian. At the Re W hearing in January 2023 the issue of A giving oral evidence at the trial was not pursued on behalf of the father and in the end there was consensus that the parties should agree questions to be put to A in a video-recorded interview conducted by the children&#8217;s solicitor/counsel. In the event A refused to participate in any further interview. </span></p>

The role of the court is to consider the evidence in its totality and to make findings on the balance of probabilities accordingly. Within this context, the court must consider each piece of evidence in the context of all of the other evidence (Re T [2004] 2 FLR 838 at [33]). However, the concept of the broad canvas is not an excuse for forensic laxity. Wide as it is, the canvas surveyed must still be comprised of threads of relevant admissible evidence. </span></p>

A focus which accords from the outset primacy to the allegation is antithetic to that end. Where the law requires, and will continue to require, proof to a defined standard, derived from admissible evidence, before making findings or pronouncing guilt, such an approach also does a manifest disservice to those who have experienced the pernicious tragedy of sexual abuse, as well as undermining more widely the principle of due process that is a bulwark of a fair and just society.&#8221;</span></p>

They asked A if this was true and, if it was, they wanted to help and make sure she was safe. A became visibly upset and confirmed what they had asked her. In response to open questions A stated that her father has persistently sexually abused her since shortly after he and her mother began a relationship. It happened when the mother was working, and sometimes when the mother was at home in a different bedroom. The abuse had recently been better but was still happening daily and the last occasion was that morning.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.64in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I accept some of Ms King&#8217;s criticisms of the interview by the teachers. Firstly, it is clear they were following the school safeguarding policy to the letter. The policy places the welfare of the pupil first and foremost with the effect that it is not completely aligned with the guidance given in the case law and the Achieving Best Evidence guidelines, such as the need to keep an open mind and not validating the child&#8217;s account by repeatedly praising them. I consider that it understandable but not ideal to open the discussion by telling A what they had been told rather than asking an open question about, for example, whether anything was troubling her. Secondly, although I am satisfied the handwritten note was accurate, it was not timed, did not take the form of questions and answers nor did it record the child&#8217;s demeanour, other than saying she was distressed. Further, praising the young person could be seen to be simply accepting her account, although it is understandable the teachers would have wanted to reassure A. I note, though, that the second expression of praise was after A had given her account. </span></p>

As stated, Ms Hoffman took the lead. She was a senior social worker but was not ABE trained. Notes were taken by Ms Robson, who was then a newly qualified social worker and had not been involved in a case where she was receiving information relating to sexual abuse. There is no evidence from DC Pettersen about this interview. Trainee DC Stepkowski-Fellows was then working in the Community Safety Unit which dealt with domestic abuse and had been called in to accompany the other officer due to resource issues. He did not take a note as he believed this would be intimidating for A but made a statement the following day. There was limited discussion between the police and the social workers prior to the interview. Estimates of the length of the discussion varied. Ms Robson believed it was 20 minutes to half an hour, Ms Hoffman 10-15 minutes and trainee DC Stepkowski-Fellows, who was &#8220;guesstimating&#8221; as it was a year ago, 30 minutes to 1 hour. </span></p>

The passage she quotes in her closing submissions from paragraph 2.43 of the ABE guidance in relation to section 47 in fact refers to the ABE interview itself. As I stated during the evidence, there is an overlap between child safeguarding and a criminal investigation when there is a joint s47 investigation. The ABE guidance refers to the need to read it in conjunction with the guidance set out in Working Together to Safeguard Children in England.

There was no planning prior to the meeting, for example, who was to take notes and the nature of the questions to be asked. The sense was of things happening in a rush, no doubt influenced by the fact that there had been delay in the police arriving. The note taken by Ms Robson was not a verbatim note and there was no record of timings. Ms Robson failed to record the question whether the father had ever had sex with A which appears in Ms Hoffman&#8217;s case note and there are minor differences between their case notes and subsequent witness statements. The police officers failed to take any notes although DC Stepkowski-Fellows considered it might be intimidating for the child. In my judgment, Ms Hoffman went beyond what was required by the guidance for an initial interview, namely, to ask no more than necessary to inform the next step. The question whether anything else happened was not in my view a closed question as Father&#8217;s counsel asserts but arguably unnecessary at this stage.  The following questions, namely whether he had made her do anything to him and whether they had had sex were closed questions. I appreciated Ms Hoffman felt that the latter question needed to be asked because of possible health/evidential implications but these matters were those which should more properly be left to a formal ABE interview. I have no doubt that Ms Hoffman was well-intentioned and welfare focussed but the guidance is there for a purpose.</span></p>

In this case events moved very fast. Again the impression is of a rushed process. The police were aware the local authority was potentially proposing to return the children to the mother and they were concerned whether she was a protective factor. There may also have been a need for further information before the father was interviewed and he was in custody. The children had only been placed in emergency placements in the night/early hours of the morning and the siblings were being interviewed by lunchtime in unfamiliar surroundings when they must have been tired and confused. The same applies to A albeit she was interviewed in the later afternoon. Ms King has highlighted the inadequacy of the CRIS report. Again this may have been because things proceeded so fast and 2 July was a Saturday, I know not. The CRIS report contained no reference to A&#8217;s interview at the school by the police officers and social workers. There was a detailed Merlin report containing full details of the joint interview dated 2 July 2022 but DC Jode did not have access to this before her interview. DC Jode had the initial referral by social care and the CRIS report. She assumed there would have been some discussion at the joint visit to the school. The ABE guidance in fact states it is preferable that the interviewer knows little detail of the incident and the alleged offence (paragraph 2.29) but I would nevertheless have expected her to know that A had been interviewed by police/social workers on 1 July and the broad gist of what was said.</span></p>

DC Jode was asked about the absence of any pre-interview assessment which is mandated by the Guidance, particularly if the child has had no previous involvement with the local authority (paragraph 2.70). DC Jode said that she had only been aware of 3 such assessments in the 4 years she had been at [a police station] because of lack of resources. Ms King was critical of DC Pettersen acting as interview monitor because she had been present during the previous interview which DC Jode did not see as a problem.

A young person seeking to retract his or her allegations in these cases is far from uncommon in my experience and there may be a variety of possible reasons for doing so. Ms Little highlights a thread running through the conversations with professionals right from the start on 1 July that A wanted to preserve her family unit but simply wanted the abuse to stop. In July 2022 however, she told Ms Hoffman at school that she felt happier and safer that her father was not there. In August 2022 she told her original Guardian that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">&#8220;it had been going on for so long&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF"> and she just wanted it to stop. In October 2022 the guardian visited A for the purpose of her Re W analysis and explained the options about her giving evidence or not.

I have found this conundrum to be a very difficult and troubling one. Added to this is the fact that this loving mother failed to notice anything amiss in her daughter over so many years. I have considered the evidence of Ms Sensicle that the mother was devastated when her relationship with the Father broke up and how anxious she was about caring for a child and providing for them both.

I find this mother is likely to have been preoccupied by a responsible and high stressful job, the demands of parenting three children and being the main wage earner.

Many of her points are well made. I have addressed the initial interviews at the school by the teachers and then police/social workers earlier in my judgment. In my judgment, the ABE interview suffered from a lack of pre-planning and forethought. Whilst I appreciate the pressures to get the interviews done quickly for the reasons discussed above, nevertheless to interview a young person when she had been removed from home and not placed until late the previous night was sub-optimal and not child-focussed. The lack of pre-planning was evident in the way the officer would move from topic to topic, for example, she introduced the question of telling her mother on two separate occasions, instead of following it up fully on the first. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Further when she appeared to have got to the stage of recapping A&#8217;s account with her, she then reverted to introducing new matters, for example, whether the fingers were outside or inside A&#8217;s privates and whether she had bled.

A&#8217;s account from the very first allegations has been remarkably consistent. The inconsistencies pointed out by Ms King, such as not remembering exactly when the licking stopped, are understandable given the difficulties in recalling when a particular form of abuse stopped when the abuse was part and parcel of daily life. The incident on the morning of 1 July could have occurred earlier before the mother woke up as she now concedes. The description of the father doing it when she was in bed with her brother in the same room as her mother could be seen as lacking credibility with the father taking a risk of this dimension but perpetrators often engage in risk-taking behaviour.</span></p>

She describes her father initially telling her she must not tell as he would go to jail and be with bad people but as she got older he would simply relied upon her apparent inability to speak out and that he had got away with it for so long.</span></p>

There is the detail of him licking his fingers before putting them down her private. There is the poignant description of dreading Sundays as she knew the inevitability of what awaited her. The description of feeling guilty even though he was the abuser is a frequent feature of a victim&#8217;s account. The description of seeing sexual abuse information on social media as triggering her to tell and the increasing anger she felt as she grew older and appreciated the wrongness of what was happening to her is highly persuasive. There is the absence of any sense of exaggeration. The interview has been aptly described as compelling and harrowing.</span></p>

I do not accept the presence of two authority figures and/or the nature of the interview would have caused A simply to acquiesce by telling a gross lie from the off. Having seen and heard them, I consider that the teachers would have come across as reassuring rather than intimidating. I have the same view about the second and the ABE interview. Thus despite the deficiencies which I have found, the compelling nature of the evidence overall means that they do not undermine the fundamental veracity of A&#8217;s account. Ms King has asked me to consider whether some of the allegations which were made in response to closed questions can be proved. I have considered this carefully and am satisfied that none of the account was made up in response to suggestions. For example, there was circumstantial detail given in relation to the bleeding.</span></p>

B and C occasionally witnessed this abuse but believed that A was being tickled. A tried to tell her mother twice, but did not spell it out explicitly and her mother did not follow it up as she should have. A has suffered and was at risk of suffering significant physical and emotional harm as a result of the abuse she suffered. B and C were likely to suffer significant emotional harm as a result of being exposed to her abuse.</span></p>
