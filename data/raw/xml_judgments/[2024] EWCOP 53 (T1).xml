He said he would be moving in when the work was done. At that time a blue power cable was being run from the Property to the caravan. And, at a subsequent visit he believed that Mr Adamou was now living in the Property because there was now no longer a blue power cable running from the house to the caravan. Further, he looked through the window of the Property and could see all the way down the front of the house to see Mr Adamou watching the television.

Mr Borrett submits that all procedural requirements have been satisfied to date and Mr Adamou will be notified of the outcome of today&#8217;s judgment forthwith. Taking those matters into account the return date for any sentencing hearing should be as soon as possible. Once again, Miss Haines for the Litigation Friend supports this request. </span></p>
