These are an application to invoke the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction to make her a ward of the court to secure her return to the UK by exercising the court&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction and for a Forced Marriage Protection Order (&#8216;FMPO&#8217;). Ancillary to these applications, the mother invites the court to continue the existing Passport Orders against the father. A&#8217;s father is the respondent to these applications and resists the applications on the basis that court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction is not engaged and the court has no jurisdiction to require the return of A to the UK. Furthermore, there is no evidence that would justify the making of a FMPO and that the existing orders retaining his passports should be set aside as the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to make such an order was questionable and in any event an unnecessary interference with his liberty. </p>

I merely observe that cases such as this demonstrate the continuing need for a remedy which, despite its antiquity, has shown, is showing and must continue to show a remarkable adaptability to meet the ever emerging needs of an ever changing world. I add that the use of the jurisdiction in cases where the risk to a child is of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention &#8211; risk to life or risk of degrading or inhuman treatment &#8211; is surely unproblematic. So wardship is surely an appropriate remedy, even if the child has already left the jurisdiction, in cases where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad for the purposes of a forced marriage (as in Re KR and Re B) or so that she can be subjected to female genital mutilation or (as here) where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad to travel to a dangerous war-zone. There is no need for me to go any further, so I need not consider whether there are other kinds of situation where a child who is already abroad should be made a ward of court or whether wardship is an appropriate remedy where the risk to the child is of harm falling short of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention.  </span></p>

It is, however, one thing to approach the use of the jurisdiction with great caution or circumspection. It is another thing to conclude that the circumstances justifying its use must always be &#8220;dire and exceptional&#8221; or &#8220;at the very extreme end of the spectrum&#8221;. There are three main reasons for caution when deciding whether to exercise the jurisdiction: first, that to do so may conflict with the jurisdictional scheme applicable between the countries in question; second, that it may result in conflicting decisions in those two countries; and third, that it may result in unenforceable orders. It is, to say the least, arguable that none of those objections has much force in this case: there is no applicable treaty between the UK and Pakistan; it is highly unlikely that the courts in Pakistan would entertain an application from the appellant; and it is possible that there are steps which an English court could take to persuade the respondent to obey the order. </span></p>

Conversely, Lord Wilson has identified the problems which would arise in this case if B had no habitual residence. The very object of the international framework is to protect the best interests of the child, as the CJEU stressed in Mercredi. Considerations of comity cannot be divorced from that objective. If the court were to consider that the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction were necessary to avoid B's welfare being beyond all judicial oversight (to adopt Lord Wilson's expression in para 26), we do not see that its exercise would conflict with the principle of comity or should be trammelled by some a priori classification of cases according to their extremity.&#8221; </span></p>

I consider that, by asking, analogously, whether the circumstances were sufficiently &#8220;dire and exceptional&#8221; to justify exercise of the jurisdiction, Hogg J may have distracted herself from addressing the three main reasons for the court's usual inhibition about exercising it. In para 59 below Lady Hale and Lord Toulson identify those reasons and I agree that arguably none of them carries much force in the present case. To my mind the most problematic question arises out of the likelihood that, once B was present again in England pursuant to an order for her return, the appellant would have issued an application for orders relating to care of her or contact with her. The question would be whether in such circumstances an order for her return would improperly have subverted Parliament's intention in enacting the prohibitions comprised in ss 1(1)(d), 2(3) and 3(1) of the 1986 Act. Or, in such circumstances, should the interests of the child prevail and indeed would Parliament have so intended?&#8221; </span></p>

The inherent jurisdiction with respect to children is exercised by reference to the child's best interests, which are the court's paramount concern. Whilst under its inherent jurisdiction, the court may make any order or determine any issue in respect of a child and whilst, therefore, the jurisdiction of the court under the inherent jurisdiction is theoretically unlimited, there are, in fact, far-reaching limitations on the exercise of the jurisdiction (see Re X (A Minor)(Wardship: Restriction on Publication) [1975] All ER 697 at 706G).

However, wardship is only one manifestation of the inherent jurisdiction with respect to children. Subject to the distinguishing characteristics of wardship being that custody of the child is vested in the court and that, although day to day control is vested in the individual or local authority, no important step can be taken in the child's life without the court's consent, the jurisdiction in wardship and the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court are the same (see Re Z (a minor)(freedom of publication) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] Fam 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] Fam 1</ref>).

So wardship is surely an appropriate remedy, even if the child has already left the jurisdiction, in cases where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad for the purposes of forced marriage (as in Re KR and Re B ) or so that she can be subject to female genital mutilation or (as here) where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad to travel to a dangerous war zone&#8230;." </span></p>

The Forced Marriage Protection Unit has stated that orders making each girl a ward of court would assist it in demonstrating to any relevant foreign authority that, notwithstanding any objection by the mother, the court had sanctioned the protection of the girls from their mother's actions and that such orders would facilitate the return of the girls to this jurisdiction. I note that it is beyond argument that, if M and K remain in Somaliland, there is a very high risk that each will be forced into marriage and that each may also become a victim of female genital mutilation. The latter harm is a harm which engages Art. 3 of the European Convention, namely the right to protection from torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. The very high risk of these harms in this case have persuaded me that I should exercise the nationality based inherent jurisdiction notwithstanding that it is eleven years since M lived in this jurisdiction and that K has never lived here.  </span></p>

Furthermore, it is unlikely that the courts in Somaliland or Somalia would entertain an application by a local authority for protective orders in respect of M and K which required their removal from both their mother's care and from that territory. Finally, it is possible that there are steps which an English court may be able to take which might persuade the mother to obey the court's orders. In that regard, I note that the mother still claims child benefit for both M and K. The Forced Marriage Unit has raised the possibility that, as leverage to persuade the mother to comply with this court's orders, the payment of this benefit might in due course be suspended.&#8221;  </span></p>

In other cases, the court should look as far as it can in assessing risk but no further. The court should first consider whether a finite order adequately meets the risk, with the consequence (if it does) that the applicant for the order will have to seek a further order at the end of the term if further protection is then needed. A date should be fixed on which the order, or a specific provision within it, is reviewed by the court. &#8220; </span></p>

The direction of the court has been complied with and there is nothing before the court to enable the further power of detention to be invoked. If the person is prima facie guilty of contempt but the proceedings are part heard and are continuing, I can see no reason, in certain circumstances, not to detain him pending the conclusion of the case if the court is satisfied that he will not voluntarily attend on the next hearing day.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">In addition to reading the case papers that include the updated opinion of Dr Abdelaziz Lahouasnia who was the jointly instructed legal expert on Algerian law, I have heard the oral evidence of the parents. The mother was the first of the parents to give evidence.  The mother confirmed her three statements to be true and accurate. She told me that she and the father made a joint decision to take A and Z to Algeria in 2008. This was to avoid any applications by the local authority in respect of these children. She accepted that she had lied in her first statement when she stated this was intended to be a holiday. She left with the children in March 2008 and the father joined them later. She came back to participate in the proceedings relating to Y and confirmed that the plans for Y to live with her sadly failed. When in Algeria, she resided at the paternal grandparent&#8217;s home. In 2009, whilst in Algeria, the father was </p>

The father punched her on the shoulder (pointed to her left shoulder) and &#8216;threw her out&#8217;. She got in touch with the British Consulate who found her a place in a refuge. She believed that she lived there for about two months. The Algerian police did not help her. During that time, she attended a court hearing when she was accompanied by a person from the refuge. She believed this may have been a hearing about her contact with the children. She was unable to follow the proceedings as it was conducted in Algerian. </p>

Usually the father brought them to the refuge. On two occasions she attempted to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;abduct the children&#8221;</span>. However, those attempts were discovered and ultimately failed. Having lost hope of gaining custody of the children, she returned to the UK. She continued to have some limited telephone contact with her children using calling cards in the absence of smart telephones. </p>

These have included numerous visits to France where her friend resides, a three-week holiday in Brazil in 2019 and two further trips in the same year to the United Arab Emirates. The latter two where funded by her as Z had requested to go there. Her other trips abroad have been funded by her friend who lives in France.

She was forced to accept that, notwithstanding her assertion that she did not have an address for where the children lived, she did have the address for the paternal grandparents and indeed she had continued to send gifts and parcels for the children to that address. She accepted that she may have visited an address in Bainham (a district of Algiers) but had no knowledge of the address. Although this was not addressed in her written evidence, the mother stated that, in 2010, she had consulted with three Algerian lawyers to seek the return of her children. She was concerned about sending anything official to the grandparents&#8217; home as this may have <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;tipped off&#8221; </span>the father.

On one such occasion the assault took place outside the family home and was witnessed by X who called the police. On Christmas day 2007, the father assaulted Y by dragging her out of bed and tearing her pyjamas. On the same day he assaulted X by hitting her with a belt and placing his hands around her throat. The mother ensured that the father left the property but stopped Y from calling the police. There had been physical altercations between Y and her mother. Y had been beyond parental control.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The practical implications of requiring A to come to England are complex and present with difficulties. There is serious concern about each of the parents&#8217; ability to adequately care for A. I have set these out in the preceding paragraphs. Additionally, there is a real risk that she may react badly to her mother with whom she has not lived for nearly twelve years. There are no alternative family members who may be able to accommodate her. The only realistic option would be for her accommodation by the local authority. Such an accommodation will bring with it an added layer of concern and potential harm that must be carefully weighed in the balance of A&#8217;s welfare considerations.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">The evidence in support of the FMPO is less clear. The only evidence consists of an account of a conversation that Z overheard between the father and his wife. This account has been repeated to the mother who has repeated it before the court. It lacks the necessary detail that would allow it to be properly scrutinised. This is particularly important in circumstances where Z&#8217;s translation of conversations has not proven to be reliable. Furthermore, the veracity of this evidence must be assessed in the context of the mother&#8217;s acceptance that there is no evidence in the paternal family of anyone marrying outside of the domestic Algerian law. The evidence of the jointly instructed expert makes it clear that such a marriage would be illegal under the said domestic laws. I do not find that the evidence in support of the application for a FMPO meets the request standard of proof or that it is sufficiently reliable that would justify the continuation of the FMPO. Whilst the Court of Appeal&#8217;s recent guidance in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re K</span> does not explicitly refer to the exercise of the court&#8217;s Inherent Jurisdiction in granting such injunctive relief, in my judgment the Court of Appeal&#8217;s four stage test applies equally to the court&#8217;s exercise of its Inherent Jurisdiction to grant such injunctive relief.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0in">Given this court&#8217;s previous findings about the father&#8217;s breaches of the Passport Orders and my observations about his cavalier approach to this issue, I am profoundly concerned that there is a real risk that the father will leave the jurisdiction at the first opportunity. In my judgment the continuation of the Passport Orders is necessary. However, I recognise that this places a serious restriction on his liberty and the continuation of this order must be for the minimum period. </p>

A is a British national and there can be no doubt that the court&#8217;s Inherent Jurisdiction is engaged. A&#8217;s welfare is my paramount consideration and having considered all of the welfare considerations, I have concluded that A does require the court&#8217;s protection. In my judgment there are no applicable jurisdictional schemes that would conflict with my decision. Furthermore, there is no evidence before me that would suggest that there is any risk of a conflicting decision being taken in Algeria. The evidence of Dr Lahouasnia does not raise this as an issue.  Finally, there is no suggestion that orders of this court may be unenforceable in Algeria. Accordingly, I will make A a ward of the court and exercise the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae </span>jurisdiction of the court by ordering her return to England forthwith. I am not making any determinations about the duration of A&#8217;s visit to the UK. Such a determination will be made at subsequent hearings when further appropriate evidence will be available to the court. </p>
