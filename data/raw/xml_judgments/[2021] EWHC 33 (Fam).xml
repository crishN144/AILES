	    <p style="margin-left:0.63in;margin-right:0.59in">The consequence is rather unsatisfactory.  Frequently a local authority will seek directions both in respect of the father without parental responsibility and close family.  The position is that the application in respect of the putative father should be made to the Family Court under Rule 14.21.  The application in respect of close relatives should be made under the inherent jurisdiction. Two different jurisdictions are invoked for applications which are inextricably intertwined and should be heard together. There is even, conceivably, a risk that the applications will be issued in different courts (a local Family Court and the High Court).  </p>

The application was determined by HHJ Marston on 16 August.  He directed that the local authority was under no obligation to inform the father or wider family members of A's birth, or to seek to assess them as prospective carers.  He declared that the lack of notice would not be regarded as a reason not to make an adoption order in due course.  The Guardian applied for permission to appeal on 24 September and permission was granted on 16 October.&#8221;  </p>

On the one hand, the parents were no longer in a relationship, but on the other their relationship had lasted for several years and they apparently remained on friendly terms.  That would not make a very persuasive case for the father having Article 8 rights, but he clearly had an interest that needed to be considered and I would on the whole accept that this was the judge's view.  </p>

The reasons given for non-disclosure concerned the risk to the mother's wellbeing and her account of the improbability of a suitable family placement.  As to the first, disclosure would be likely to be difficult for the mother, but there was no convincing evidence to support the judge's conclusion that it might be "disastrous".  The rejection of the possibility of a family placement was based on the mother's account without there being any objective basis for believing that the father and the wider families were very likely to have nothing to offer.  Nor was any real weight given to the potential benefits to A of growing up in his birth family if that is a realistic possibility, or of his adoption having his father's participation, and even his blessing, if it is not.  I would not accept the local authority's characterisation of the process of notifying a father of the birth of his child as "opening a can of worms" where the characteristics of the father or wider family raise no particular cause for concern.  The judge was entitled to note the delay involved in notification, but as the child had already been placed with prospective adopters, little weight could attach to that aspect of the matter.  In summary, while the judge rightly gave significant emphasis to the mother's point of view, he did not sufficiently balance it against the other important considerations bearing on A's lifelong welfare and the position of family members, and his decision cannot therefore stand.  </p>

As to the balance to be struck, I bring forward my observations from the preceding paragraph.  While I would not myself attribute Article 8 rights to the father, he has an interest to be considered.  The mother's account does not provide a strong objective basis for discounting him as a suitable carer without further investigation.  The difficulties that notification is likely to cause to the mother do not outweigh the considerations relating to the interests of the father and the child in the context of a plan for adoption.  This interference with the mother's right to respect for her private life is necessary and the staged approach proposed by the Guardian is proportionate.  For these reasons, I agreed that the appeal should be allowed.&#8221; </p>

Respect is also due to the position of the unsuspecting relatives. Some may have been a fleeting presence in the mother's life, but others may be more significant figures who have been kept in the dark and would be astonished to find that a baby (their child, sibling or grandchild) had been born and adopted without their knowledge, particularly if they were in a position to put themselves forward as carers. Most of all, the notification decision has lifechanging implications for the baby. It may influence whether adoption happens at all and, even if it does, a sound adoption has its foundations in the integrity of the process by which it is achieved.  </p>

The law aims to distinguish those cases where a 'fast-track' adoption without notification of relatives is lawful from the majority of cases where the profound significance of the decision for the child demands that any realistic alternatives to adoption are given proper consideration.

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in">&#8220;[59] Pausing at this point, this body of authority at first instance and on appeal affirms that there is a discretion to be exercised by the local authority and by the court as to whether fathers and other relatives should be notified of the birth of a child. The discretion requires the identification and balancing up of all relevant factors. While the mother's right to confidentiality is important it is not absolute. The presence or absence of family life is an important, though not a decisive feature and where it exists strong countervailing factors are required to justify withholding knowledge of the existence of the child and the proceedings. The tenor of the authorities is that in most cases notification will be appropriate, and the absence of notification will be the exception; but each case will in the end depend on its facts. In each case, the welfare of the child was regarded as an important factor but, significantly, there is no suggestion that the exercise of the discretion is governed by the paramountcy principle. </p>

On the other hand, excessive weight should not be given to short term difficulties and to less serious situations involving embarrassment or social unpleasantness, otherwise the mother's wish would always prevail at the expense of other interests. </p>

In cases where a mother declines to identify a father she may face persuasion, if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced. In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable, and maternal relatives may also be identifiable. The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement. Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure. In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child's existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind.  </p>

In most cases, the importance of the issues means that the delay cannot be a predominant factor. There may however be circumstances where delay would have particularly damaging consequences for the mother or for the child; for example, it would undoubtedly need to be taken into account if it would lead to the withdrawal of the child's established carers or to the loss of an especially suitable adoptive placement.  </p>

However exceptionality is not in itself a test or a short cut; rather it is a reflection of the fact that the profound significance of adoption for the child and considerations of fairness to others means that the balance will often fall in favour of notification. But the decision on whether confidentiality should be maintained can only be made by striking a fair balance between the factors that are present in the individual case.&#8221; </p>

It seems to me that in the circumstances of this case to proceed to adoption (the &#8220;last resort&#8221;/&#8221;where nothing else will do&#8221; as it was described in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re B</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#4D5156"> (Care Proceedings: Appeal) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2013/33" uk:canonical="[2013] UKSC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKSC 33</ref></span>)) without (a) conducting a thorough inquiry into his circumstances and (b) permitting him to advance a case as to how he might make a meaningful contribution in W&#8217;s life and (c) permitting him to put forward options which fall short of adoption, would be disproportionate and unjust.   iii)<span style="font-family:Arial"/>Similarly, I do not consider that the evidence justifies either the maternal grandparents or (conceivably, albeit rather less likely) the paternal grandparents being summarily excluded from consideration at this stage, whether as carers or as people whom W should have the opportunity of seeing, and with whom he may benefit from developing a relationship.   iv)<span style="font-family:Arial"/>The Mother&#8217;s relationship with her parents, in particular her mother, does not appear to be irredeemably broken down.  She told the Guardian that had she known how these 10 months would unfold, she would have had the company of her mother at the birth.  I have also been told that during lockdown the Mother lived with her parents, albeit because her tenancy had come to an end.  These are positive relationship indicators. </p>

But that, while an important consideration, does not in my judgement outweigh the considerations pointing the other way. The Guardian considers that W is the type of child who will be easily adopted, and an alternative adoptive family should be readily found. In the meantime, he is securely placed with foster carers. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:1.14in;margin-right:0.59in;text-indent:0.38in">I accept that the Mother is experiencing considerable distress and anxiety, although according to the evidence this has been the position since she discovered that she was pregnant in December 2019, well before she was aware of this possible application.  In other words, the anxiety, profound though it may be, appears to be primarily a consequence of the birth and giving her son up for adoption rather than the non-notification proceedings per se.  These proceedings will no doubt have exacerbated her distress, but I regard the difficulties as manageable rather than representing a significant mental health vulnerability.  There is no expert evidence as to any particular mental health issues or diagnosis on the part of the Mother, nor has the Mother accessed any specialist mental health services. True, she has recently been to a GP and been referred for counselling, but beyond that there is little to satisfy me of a substantial risk to her mental health. I conclude that the impact on the Mother, while distressing and unsettling, is unlikely to be disastrous and I would hope and expect that proper support will be offered by the Local Authority to address any issues.  ix)<span style="font-family:Arial"/>Finally, I bear in mind that a determination in the Local Authority&#8217;s favour inevitably will lead to a total severance of W&#8217;s relationship with his birth families, without any of them (bar the Mother) having any say or being considered beyond the merest superficiality.  Should this come to the attention of the Father and/or wider family at some later date, they would, in my view, legitimately complain of having been completely written out of W&#8217;s welfare decision making. </p>

The Father&#8217;s casual relationship with the Mother and lack of parental responsibility militate against a conclusion that he has formal Article 8 rights, but he clearly has an interest which must be weighed in the balance. The wider families, particularly the maternal family, are also interested persons. Weighing up all the relevant and competing considerations, I conclude that the Father should be identified and notified, and the wider families considered.   </p>

This was an utterly unacceptable period of delay.  Had the application been made promptly, the various difficulties which were explored during this hearing would not have arisen. Worse, the Local Authority appear not to have considered properly or at all the legal requirements in a case of this nature or, if it did, it inexplicably did the exact opposite.  And piling error upon error, the Local Authority assured the Mother that it did not need to make a non-notification application, only to do so several months later.  </p>
