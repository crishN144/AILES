The second respondent, BA, is X&#8217;s mother and the wife of X&#8217;s biological mother. For ease of reference, I will refer to the first respondent as &#8220;Mother&#8221;, the second respondent as &#8220;BA&#8221;, and both together as &#8220;the parents&#8221;. The local authority is Derbyshire CC, represented by Stefano Nuvoloni KC [&#8216;SNKC&#8217;], and Louise Sapstead. The Mother is represented by Brendan Roche KC [&#8216;BRKC&#8217;] and Helen Knott. BA is represented by Shiva Ancliffe KC [&#8216;SAKC&#8217;] and Chris Adams. The child is represented by his children&#8217;s guardian through Kathryn Taylor.  The NHS trust is represented by Zoe Henry, but for reasons which will become obvious Miss Henry took little part in the proceedings today.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 12th July 2021, X attended at hospital for a routine standard operation for a tongue tie. When attending at the hospital the parents said that X had been unsettled the evening before and they asked the consultant if X could be seen at the A &amp; E department. Chest x-rays were carried out and revealed healing rib fractures which were to the 6th, 7th and 8th ribs to the left side. The view of the paediatrician at the time was that these were likely to be non-accidental injuries and so various experts have been instructed. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Care proceedings were issued on 2 August 2021 and the matter came before HHJ Williscroft on 4 August 2021, with an application by the Local Authority for an Interim Care Order [&#8216;ICO&#8217;]. The Judge considered that the tests for making public law orders were not made out and therefore no ICO or supervision order was made. It was agreed that X should be subject to what was a complex and very full supervision plan, and he has been subject to that supervision ever since. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since the proceedings commenced, all X&#8217;s care has been supervised by at least one family member. For two weeks of every month, he lives in Derbyshire with both parents and the mother&#8217;s mother (X&#8217;s grandmother). However, the other two weeks are spent in West Sussex &#8216;with his grandmother&#8230;&#8217; and one of his parents. This obviously involves a significant journey every two weeks from West Sussex to Derbyshire. There are other family members, who have been approved as supervisors, who supervise at various times. At no stage has X been removed from his parents&#8217; care. Throughout this period of intensive supervision and oversight from the Local Authority (including visits and phone calls), at no point has there been any doubt about the quality of care that the parents are giving to X or any other concerns about their parenting. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Local Authority&#8217;s threshold (which I do not need to read in detail) alleges a non-accidental injury caused to X by one or both of the parents and alleges that the parents have not been honest with the Local Authority professionals about this. The parents fervently deny ever injuring X in any way, and thereby causing him harm, and they raise the possibility of X having been injured at birth or in hospital immediately after birth. It is for that reason that the Trust was joined, and Miss Henry appeared before me today.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Various experts have been instructed, and it is the general view of the experts (without going into detail) that the injuries are more likely to be non-accidental inflicted injuries than birth related, although I note the time window for the fractures includes X&#8217;s birth. The medical evidence also states that there is no underlying condition which would increase the likelihood of fractures and nothing unusual about the birth process or immediately afterwards which would have caused the fractures. If the matter proceeds to a fact-finding hearing, the parents intend to challenge the expert evidence and suggest that there is some other cause of the injuries. The case is currently set down for a 9 day fact finding hearing commencing on 9 January 2023 and various experts are warned to attend. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The familial background here is that BA has three adult children and neither parent has had any previous involvement with social services before the facts of this case. It is agreed by all parties that there are no risk factors or red flags concerning either parent in this case, such as those which were set out by Peter Jackson J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re BR (Proof of Facts)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2015/41" uk:canonical="[2015] EWFC 41" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWFC 41</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since the events of 12 July 2021, the parents have been subject to very considerable oversight by the Local Authority for 16 months and there are numerous notes of their interaction with the Local Authority over that period. There is no suggestion that their parenting has been anything other than positive and the clear view of everyone who has been involved is that there is nothing to suggest that they are anything other than caring and loving parents. Despite his movements up and down the country, X appears to be thriving developmentally, although there are some specific health concerns which I will address in a moment. The parents &#8211; and this is important - are noted to have fully cooperated with the Local Authority throughout the proceedings. When they have wished to change the supervision plan, they have assiduously raised this with the Local Authority. There is therefore every reason to believe that they would fully co-operate with the Local Authority going forward. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This hearing was listed for a pre-trial review before the fact-finding hearing in January 2023. BRKC, supported by SAKC, makes an application for the case to be dismissed. He submits that these proceedings are not necessary to protect X and that to proceed to a fact-finding hearing does not meet the tests in the case law. He relies on the President of the Family Division&#8217;s recent &#8216;View&#8217; dated 29 November 2022, in which he stresses the need for the Family Justice System to focus its energies on what is really necessary and in particular to try and get back to, or closer to, the principles of the Public Law Outline [&#8216;PLO&#8217;]. BRKC is supported in his position by SAKC. I note that BRKC&#8217;s position in this respect is set out in his position statement and neither SNKC or KT have suggested that they were not fully prepared to deal with this argument today.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SNKC points out that a key difference between private law cases such as <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">K v K</span> case and this case is that in public law proceedings threshold findings need to be made out before any public law orders can be made. In this case the parents deny threshold because they say that they have caused no harm. Therefore, if there is no fact-finding hearing and the threshold is not made out, the Court does not have jurisdiction to make public law orders. I accept that is a significant difference to private law proceedings, but that does not alter the Court&#8217;s approach that a finding of fact hearing should not be undertaken unless it is going to make a material difference to the welfare outcome and the orders which may be made. </p>

The fundamental purpose of public law proceedings is to determine what public law orders are needed for the welfare of the child and to protect the child from future risk. Understanding the facts and circumstances of an alleged non-accidental injury is often critical to the determination of future risk. But here I do not find that is necessary, and even if I made all the findings it would be unlikely to have any material impact on the ultimate orders for X. </p>

Importantly, there are no risk factors, or &#8220;red flags&#8221; of the kind identified in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re BR</span>. In my view, that is particularly significant in making a decision such as that because it is critical to any assessment of future risk.

It is not clear that that was related to the travel but sitting in a car for upwards of four hours is unlikely to be positive for him. These proceedings are also placing enormous strain on X and his family and normal family relations. This would be wholly justifiable if the evidence suggested that it was necessary in order to safeguard X. But it does not appear to me that the evidence is now supportive of that position. </p>

It is highly unlikely that the parents would accept any findings even if I made them, so even if a fact-finding hearing were held, there is a strong possibility that in practical terms we would be no further forward.</p>

Given the oversight of the family so far, it is extremely unlikely that (even if all of the facts were found) any Court would remove X from the care of his parents. That is not a realistic prospect given all that has happened over the last 18 months. SNKC submits that removal is a possibility but, in my view, on the evidence it is highly unlikely. He says there could be a care order at home. But we know that the latter course of action has been discouraged in all but the most necessary of circumstances. I cannot see that such an order would be justified on the facts of this case. Therefore realistically, in all probability, the Court is only going to be considering whether to make a supervision order with X living at home, and some form of safety plan in place. </p>

That type of plan is almost certainly what the Court would order in any event. The current amount of supervision cannot be maintained in even the medium term with the extensive travelling between Derby and West Sussex. Therefore, the Court is likely to end up with the same plan for a decreasing level of supervision whatever findings may be made following a fact-finding hearing. </p>

In this case the benefit of finding out what happened is largely illusory. X is too young to know (or care) what happened.

If the parents do not follow that plan it would be open to the Local Authority to bring the matter back to Court through fresh proceedings. The order can make clear that any future application in respect of X should come back before me. That way, in my judgement X will be protected and the disproportionate use of resources for a 9 day finding of fact hearing will be saved. The Local Authority can either apply to me to withdraw proceedings, or we can proceed to a short final hearing in the new year to determine the final order. </p>
