Newport are involved and will take on a role in relation to the children but should not be the authority holding the order.

Ms Jones has pointed out that the social services in Newport have not even read the files from Redbridge and there have been three authorities involved in the case. Further there have been detailed and careful discussions and negotiations between the current Redbridge social work team and all this will be lost. Hence, from a practical point of view Newport should not be designated as the responsible authority now and probably not anyway at the final hearing.</p>

		    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;&#8230; the attraction of the construction favoured by Bracewell J is its simplicity. The ordinary residence immediately preceding the commencement of the period of disregard is deemed to continue uninterrupted. The court is relieved from what may be a contentious and disputed investigation of what other circumstances have changed within the period of disregard. Any construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/105/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 105(6)</ref> can be said to produce anomalous results. We should not be over-impressed by anomaly arguments where the court&#8217;s function is simply to determine which authority is to be designated in the care order. I am convinced that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31(8)</ref> was never intended to be a gateway to extensive judicial investigation of a number of relevant facts and circumstances as the prelude to the exercise of some discretionary choice. It was surely intended to be a simple test to enable the court to make a rapid designation of the authority upon which is to fall the administrative, professional and financial responsibility for implementing the care order and the care plan. Where the child has connections with more than one area ordinary residence determines on the basis that almost every child will have an ordinary residence, if not a presence, in some local authority area. In the rare case where a child lacks an ordinary residence in a local authority area the court designates the area in which occurred the events that carried the application over the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 31</ref> threshold</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.79in">On that approach I lean towards Bracewell J&#8217;s inclination to hold that the area of ordinary residence immediately prior to the commencement of the stay to be disregarded should be notionally extended throughout that stay. I would not say that developments affecting the family during the period to be disregarded cannot in any case be considered. But I would say that such cases should be exceptional.&#8221; </p>

If that involves a degree of artificiality and the import of legal fiction any misgivings can be met by recognising the limited purpose and effect of the court&#8217;s function. After all, it must be assumed that all local authorities are equally competent, professional and committed in the discharge of responsibilities cast upon them by the making of a care order. &#8220;</p>

From May 2002 the children were placed in local authority accommodation with their mother and so <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/105/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 105(6)</ref> still applies.

I appreciate that this allows the uncertainty to continue. It means that Redbridge must remain involved in the case and hold the interim orders but Newport must be aware of the real possibility that ultimately the final order may be made in their favour.</p>
