An issues resolution hearing in the care proceedings had been put in my list for 10 August 2022 and the inherent jurisdiction application was therefore listed for review on the same date.. At that hearing, I fixed a final hearing for both applications in the week commencing 19 September 2022 and I renewed the deprivation of liberty declarations until the conclusion of the proceedings.  However, I raised with all advocates that I would wish to be addressed at that final hearing on whether, in fact, such declarations were necessary in the case of a 12 year old disabled child where the measures in place were not being presented as anything other than rooted in her safety and wellbeing.  I also noted that, whilst RN was then the subject of an Interim Care Order, the final Care Plan proposed that she should be made the subject of a 12 month Supervision Order, remaining at home with her father.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The final hearing of the care proceedings has needed to address a range of threshold and welfare issues.  Put shortly, the Court found the s.31 threshold established, although no findings adverse to the Father were made (and no party invited the Court to do so). The case on threshold centred primarily on the Mother&#8217;s  long-standing misuse of illegal drugs, namely amphetamines and cannabis, together with other prescription medication and the adverse impact on her care of RN. As to welfare/outcome, all parties accepted the making of a final Supervision Order for 12 months.  The Mother advanced a case for shared care between the parents. However, drug testing during the proceedings revealed ongoing misuse of drugs by her and dishonesty on her part about this during LA assessment work.  I determined that it was in RN&#8217;s best interests to remain in her Father&#8217;s care under a Child Arrangements Order with the Mother having contact twice per week. The LA committed to supervising such contact for at least 3 months whilst working to identify an alternative supervisor.  This short summary does not, of course, convey the full range of issues that the court had to determine and the evidence and analysis which founded my Judgment in those proceedings.  But it does, I hope, capture the essence of the case.</span></p>

Parental responsibility is about the relationship between parent and child and between parents and third parties: it is essentially a private law relationship, although a public authority may also hold parental responsibility. As Irwin LJ correctly pointed out (</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re D</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (Parental Responsibility: Consent to 16-year-old Child&#8217;s Deprivation of Liberty <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/1695" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 1695" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 1695</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2018] 2 FLR 13" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] 2 FLR 13</ref>, at para [157]) human rights, on the other hand, are about the relationship between individuals (or other private persons) and the State.

But it would be a startling proposition that it lies within the scope of parental responsibility for a parent to license the State to violate the most fundamental human rights of a child: a parent could not, for example, authorise the State to inflict what would otherwise be torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon his child. Likewise, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> recognises that a parent cannot authorise the State to deprive a child of his liberty by placing him in secure accommodation. While this proposition may not hold good for all the Convention rights, in particular the qualified rights which may be restricted in certain circumstances, it must hold good for the most fundamental rights &#8211; to life, to be free from torture or ill-treatment, and to liberty. In any event, the State could not do that which it is under a positive obligation to prevent others from doing.</span></p>

Although there is no doubt that they, and indeed everyone else involved, had D&#8217;s best interests at heart, we cannot ignore the possibility, nay even the probability, that this will not always be the case. That is why there are safeguards required by Art 5 of the European Convention. Without such safeguards, there is no way of ensuring that those with parental responsibility exercise it in the best interests of the child, as the Secretaries of State acknowledge that they must. In this case, D enjoyed the safeguard of the proceedings in the Court of Protection. In future, the deprivation of liberty safeguards contained in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> (as amended by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2019/18" uk:canonical="2019 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity (Amendment) Act 2019</ref>) will apply to children of 16 and 17.

The common law may draw a sharp distinction, in relation to the deprivation of liberty, between those who have reached the age of 16 and those who have not, but the extent to which that affects the analysis under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> is not clear to me and we have heard no argument upon it. I therefore prefer to express no view upon the question. Nor would I express any view on the extent of parental responsibility in relation to other matters, such as serious and irreversible medical treatment, which do not entail a deprivation of liberty. Some reference to this was made in the course of argument, but it does not arise in this case, which is solely concerned with depriving 16 and 17-year-olds of their liberty&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

He postulated parents taking a 13 year old child who had misbehaved to the police station and asking them to lock to the child up for the night and the police agreeing to do so as this was regarded by them as the parents&#8217; lawful exercise of parental responsibility.  But, Mr Taylor went on, if the child had been 16 or 17, this could not happen.  Any such step would require the sanction of the High Court.  </span></p>

Nor, I suggested, did it help the parents to have to listen to it.  Mr Taylor used it to make the point that there should be no different approach to children of different ages.  But the choice of the hypothetical scenario illustrates just how far removed that is from what this Court is in fact being asked to address. Given RN&#8217;s complex needs and the care she requires to keep her safe, I ask, rhetorically, what these parents must think when listening to that example.  The two situations are not remotely comparable. As Lord Carnworth rightly cautioned in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re D</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, the parents in that case were not acting in an abusive or harmful manner towards their child. They &#8220;&#8230;were doing what they could, and what any conscientious parent would do, to advance their child&#8217;s best interests. They did so by authorising the treatment on which all the authorities were agreed. That this involved a degree of confinement was an incidental but necessary part of that treatment, and no more than that&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Lord Carnworth&#8217;s essential point is irrefutable. If the law is to ensure respect for the private and family life of those who meet the day-to-day challenges of caring for disabled children, a distinction must be drawn between parenting which is abusive and parenting which is anything but.  Caring parents of children with a disability do not want those children to be subjected to restrictions on their liberty.   It is the child&#8217;s disability which is the root cause of the restrictive care arrangements, not the conduct of the parents. Far from acting in a manner that is harmful to the child, the restrictions that are in place are vital for their protection.  Where the decisions that such parents make are driven by that objective, why should such parents be the subject of state intervention in their lives (in the form of High Court litigation)?  This is the point made clearly and persuasively by Keehan J in his first instance ruling in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re D</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">:  &#8220;&#8230; Why on public policy or human rights grounds should these parents be denied the ability to secure the best medical treatment and care for their son? Why should the state interfere in these parents&#8217; role to make informed decisions about their son&#8217;s care and living arrangements?  I can see no reasons or justifications for denying the parents that role or permitting the state to interfere in D&#8217;s life or that of his family&#8221; (paragraph [60] and [61])..</span></p>

If, in any given case, a local authority is concerned that the parents of a child under the age of 16 are depriving that child of their liberty in a manner that is causing them actual or likely significant harm attributable to a lack a reasonable parental care, it can and should issue care proceedings to protect that child.

Here, when I focus on the actual facts relating to RN, my conclusions are reinforced. RN has very limited vocabulary. She is unable to communicate her wishes and feelings in the same way that a child without her level of disability would.  Plainly, RN is incapable of giving consent to the arrangements that are in place for her. But her parents are able to do so on her behalf.  And, when they do, they make a decision in the context of her particular needs and characteristics.  All those who have given evidence before me have spoken of RN having complex needs and the demands of meeting those needs. She has a significant learning disability and a diagnosis of ADHD. RN is hyperactive, impulsive and she has poor attention skills. At times, her behaviour has been challenging, including outbursts when she has thrown items. She attends a specialist school and there is an extensive care support package in place throughout the week, and at weekends.  She requires a high level of support and supervision, due to her complex needs, her young age and her vulnerability.  She is dependent upon adult care to meet all of her care needs. In contrast with other children of her age, RN will not develop the same independent living skills as she progresses through her teenage years and into adulthood.  As the Children&#8217;s Guardian observes, she is highly likely to need care and safety planning around her into adulthood and beyond. </span></p>

They are rooted in securing her safety and wellbeing. The parents&#8217; consent is therefore given with that objective in mind.

RN&#8217;s parents do not </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">wish</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> to place unduly restrictive care arrangements on their daughter. If it were possible, they would like her to be cared for and live her life without such measures.  The Father spoke movingly in his oral evidence about that very topic.  But RN&#8217;s complex needs are such that that cannot be achieved for her.  The restrictions are the price that must be paid to ensure her safety and wellbeing. Without them, RN would be exposed to unacceptable risks of harm. That is why the restrictive aspects of those care arrangements have the full support of the LA professionals and the Children&#8217;s Guardian.</span></p>
