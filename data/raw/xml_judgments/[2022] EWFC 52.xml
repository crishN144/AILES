The draft order sought anonymisation throughout the proceedings of the parties and prohibition of reporting of any part of these proceedings which would: (a) identify the parties, the children, the children's school, the property where the children are living, or the companies in which the husband is a director; or (b) that would disclose the facts and matters raised in court during the hearing before me.</p>

The decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott</span> [1913] AC 417 definitively established that the Divorce Court was governed by the same principles in respect of publicity as other courts.</p>

A chambers&#8217; judgment is not secret and is publishable. Furthermore, the change of language in the FPR 2010 from &#8220;in chambers&#8221; to &#8220;in private&#8221; did not presage that ancillary relief proceedings should become more secret. </p>

If the case does not relate wholly or mainly to child maintenance, and in the absence of a valid reporting restriction or anonymity order, they can report anything they see or hear at the hearing. That some of the material under discussion would have been disclosed compulsorily does not constrain their right to report the hearing. The power under FPR 27.11(3)(b) to exclude a journalist or blogger to prevent justice being impeded or prejudiced confirms the unrestricted reportability of the hearing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The standard rubric on financial remedy judgments providing for anonymity cannot prevent full reporting of the proceedings or the judgment. This is because it is not a reporting restriction injunction, not merely because none of the procedures for making such an order have been complied with, but because it manifestly is not an injunction. It is not an anonymity order under CPR 39.2(4), not merely because no process for making such an order was followed, but more fundamentally because it is not such an order. Such an anonymity order can only be made exceptionally. The general rule is that the names of the parties to an action are included in orders and judgments of the court. There is no general exception for cases where private matters are in issue. An order for anonymity (or any other order restraining the publication of the normally reportable details of a case) is a derogation from the principle of open justice and an interference with the Article 10 rights of the public at large and, indeed of the parties.</p>

Such cases are heard in public on appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and the law reports and press reporting are riddled with considerable intimate and financial detail of many financial cases on appeal. Accredited journalists are, in any event, entitled to be present even when the court is sitting in private, subject to strict and limited exceptions. To permit the presence of accredited journalists, but then tightly to restrict what they can report, creates a mere illusion of transparency.&#8221;</p>

Therefore, I do not agree that it is necessary to hear all cases in open court in order to achieve full transparency. The hybrid arrangement ordained by Parliament when it endorsed FPR 27.10 and 27.11 achieves true transparency in two ways. First, the press and authorised bloggers act as the eyes and ears of the public in exactly the same way as they would if the case were heard in open court. Second, as explained above, there is no prohibition, in the absence of a specific individual order, on either party telling whosoever they please what has happened in court.  </p>

It is certainly arguable that it is not, given the statement at [34] of Dame Victoria Sharp PQBD in <span style="font-style:italic">Tickle v Griffiths</span> [2021] EWCA Civ 1882 that in a case which involves the determination of civil rights and obligations, Article 6 confers on each party to the litigation the right to a public hearing and a public judgment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Derogations from the rule of open justice can take two forms. There can be a reporting restriction order preventing reporting of all or part of the proceedings. Alternatively, there can be an anonymity order requiring pseudonyms to be used in respect of people, places and bodies in any report of the proceedings. Equivalently, the court may decide to anonymise its judgment. Each of these measures represents a derogation from the rule of open justice. Every derogation must be considered with great care as the incremental accumulation of superficially unremarkable judicial derogations, proceeding under the cover of rules of procedure, may well lead to an usurpation of justice, as Lord Shaw explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott</span> at 477 &#8211; 478:</p>

There is no greater danger of usurpation than that which proceeds little by little, under cover of rules of procedure,&#160;and at the instance of judges themselves. I must say frankly that I think these encroachments have taken place by way of judicial procedure in such a way as, insensibly at first, but now culminating in this decision most sensibly, to impair the rights, safety, and freedom of the citizen and the open administration of the law.&#8221;</p>

In his judgment, Sir Christopher Staughton states:&#160;"When both sides agreed that information should be kept from the public that was when the court had to be most vigilant."&#160;The need to be vigilant arises from the natural tendency for the general principle to be eroded and for exceptions to grow by accretion as the exceptions are applied by analogy to existing cases.&#160;This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the&#160;public nature of proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also&#160;maintains the public's confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially.&#160;It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors&#160;or with one or more of the parties' or witnesses' identity concealed.&#160;It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely. If secrecy is restricted to those situations where justice would be frustrated if the cloak of anonymity is not provided, this&#160;reduces the risk&#160;of the sanction of contempt&#160;having to be invoked, with the expense and the interference with the administration of justice which this can involve.</p>

It would show the world, he says, through Mr Farmer&#8217;s report, how the Family Court deals with these cases. He suggests that certain parts of the evidence namely (i) jointly-instructed tax counsel&#8217;s submissions as to the degree of risk that the husband faces from HMRC action; (ii) the risks that the husband faces from the lawsuit against him in Ireland and (iii) the evidence of the expert accountants as to the value of the business, plainly must be the subject of a reporting restriction order. He argues that were such evidence recorded in a confidential annex which could not be published then, paradoxically, the result would be less transparent than if the whole judgment were anonymised. In the latter situation all the confidential evidence would be available for the world to see, albeit anonymised. The world would be able to see, fully, how the court had reached its decision. In contrast a public judgment (which the world would see) with a confidential annex (which the world would not see) would afford less insight into the court&#8217;s workings.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I disagree with these arguments. First and foremost, I agree with Mr Farmer that if very rich businessmen are in court fighting at vast expense with their ex-spouses over millions, then the public has the right to know who they are and what they are fighting about. The judgment should therefore name names. Redactions can be made of commercially sensitive information, but only to the extent that they are strictly necessary. But the redactions should not ever obscure the way the court has decided the case. In any event, I am satisfied that in this case I can place the commercially sensitive information that ought not be reported in a confidential annex to the published judgment without offending this vital principle. Fundamentally, Mr Webster&#8217;s submissions fail to recognise that anonymisation is a direct derogation from the Art 10 rights of the public at large and must be treated as such. As is commonplace, the submissions suffer by tacitly asking the wrong question: &#8220;Why is it in the public interest that the parties should be named?&#8221; rather than the right one: &#8220;Why is it in the public interest that the parties should be anonymous?&#8221; The submissions also pay no regard to the requirement in s. 12(4) of the Human Rights Act 1998 which requires me to have &#8220;particular regard to the importance of the [Article 10] right to freedom of expression.&#8221;</p>

I firmly disagree with this argument. The constitutional principle of open justice obviously cannot be put aside by anecdotal gossip about the motives of some litigants who have settled their cases. One can confidently assert that if this practice were a common phenomenon in litigation generally the civil courts would be empty. And they are not.</p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;There remains this point. Granted that the principle of openness of justice may yield to compulsory secrecy in cases involving patrimonial interest and property, such as those affecting trade secrets, or confidential documents, may not the fear of giving evidence in public, on questions of status like the present, deter&#160;witnesses of delicate feeling from giving testimony, and rather induce the abandonment of their just right by sensitive suitors? And may not that be a sound reason for administering justice in such cases with closed doors? For otherwise justice, it is argued, would thus be in some cases defeated. My Lords, this ground is very dangerous ground. One's experience shews that the reluctance to intrude one's private affairs upon public notice induces many citizens to forgo their just claims. It is no doubt true that many of such cases might have been brought before tribunals if only the tribunals were secret. But the concession to these feelings would, in my opinion, tend to bring about those very dangers to liberty in general, and to society at large, against which publicity tends to keeps us secure: and it must further be remembered that, in questions of status, society as such - of which marriage is one of the primary institutions - has also a real and grave interest as well as have the parties to the individual cause.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.80in">I do not think that Lord Shaw could have intended this conclusion to be confined to matrimonial cases about status, as opposed to matrimonial cases about ancillary relief. True, the secular law of divorce from its inception in 1858 was founded on the principle that the public status of marriage meant that collusive divorces were  anathema and that therefore the court&#8217;s process would be inquisitorial. But the state had, and has, an equal interest in the sufficiency of maintenance both while the marriage subsists, and after its ending, as Lord Atkin explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Hyman v Hyman</span> [1929] AC 601. Hence litigation about the financial consequences of divorce was, and is,  also inquisitorial. Lord Shaw&#8217;s stark  conclusion that individual feelings of delicacy had to yield to liberty in general, and to the security which publicity supplies to society at large, obviously applies equally to all disputes about a marriage.</p>

Courts sit with the authority of the Sovereign, but on behalf of the people, and the people must be allowed, so far as possible, to see their courts at work. There is considerable current, legitimate public interest in the way the family courts daily operate, and that cannot be shut out simply on an argument that the affairs of the parties are private or personal.

In this case the children and their contemporaries will know that Donal and Brid Gallagher are in court fighting about millions. But that is not a reason for imposing secrecy on proceedings. If it were, then swathes of cases of manifold types would have to made secret, because many, if not most, adults have children. It would mean, for example, that many, perhaps most, TOLATA and Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 cases would require to be held in secret.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The problem with this proposal, as I pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Xanthopoulos v Rakshina</span> at [140], is that in order for such new rules to have teeth they would have to prescribe that it would be a contempt for any report of such an anonymised judgment to identify the parties or the children. Therefore, the new rules would make punishable as contempt something that is not presently so punishable. To make such  rules would appear to be beyond the powers of the Rule Committee as conferred by ss 75 and 76 of the Courts Act 2003. So far as is material to this issue, those powers&#160; are confined to matters of &#8220;practice and procedure&#8221; and the &#8220;rules of evidence&#8221; and, so far as they relate to contempt, to rules which &#8220;authorise&#8221; the publication of information (s. 76(2A)). None of this extends to enlarging the substantive law of contempt. Sec 76(2A) clearly only permits rules to be framed so as to make something presently punishable as contempt not so punishable, but not the other way round.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Section 12(4) of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 has only peripheral relevance as the spectre of contempt in s. 12(1) is confined to those financial remedy cases which are wholly or mainly about child maintenance. Even in such cases, s.12(4), in common with s. 76(2A) of the Courts Act 2003, only allows rules to be made so  as to make something presently punishable as contempt not so punishable.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I therefore adhere to my view that to create a scheme  providing for standardised anonymisation of financial remedy judgments will require primary legislation<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="10">
		  <p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span> </span>In s.121 of the Family Law Act 1975 Australia has grasped the nettle and enacted just such a scheme. It imposes a widespread prohibition on the publication of any part of family law proceedings. Subject to limited exceptions it is a criminal offence to publish information that identifies any person who is a party to such proceedings or who is otherwise connected to such proceedings. In my opinion only Parliament can determine if such secrecy would be in the public interest and that we should follow suit.  </p>
