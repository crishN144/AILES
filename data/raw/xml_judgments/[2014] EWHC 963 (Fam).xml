	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with M, born on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012 he is now 20 months old. The matter is listed further to the order of Mr Justice Bodey, dated 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>  January 2014, to determine the issue of jurisdiction. Originally listed on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February it was adjourned to the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2014 as the Respondent, K, was arrested outside court and taken to Holborn Police station for questioning regarding an alleged sexual assault on the Applicant, B. The hearing as to the habitual residence of the child took place on the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2014.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties&#8217; cases are set out in their respective statements. In short the Applicant/mother says that in July 2013, the parties agreed that M would travel to Singapore and remain with the paternal grandparents for a temporary period whilst she took exams in England. The Respondent/father says that they agreed that M would remain in Singapore, indefinitely, with his parents. The child was born in London and remained largely in his mother&#8217;s care until they travelled to Singapore in July 2013; therefore until that date he was habitually resident in England. The issue before the court is whether the place of his habitual residence was changed to Singapore.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties met in Singapore in and married there on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2011. The Respondent, who worked for a bank in London, had previously bought a property here to serve as the family home. B travelled to England when she had been granted a visa and joined K; M was born the following year on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012. Before he was born both the maternal grandmother visited and helped with the new baby for several months. The paternal grandparents visited after the birth for a period of five months. </p>

	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is clear, and not a matter of dispute, that the marriage had difficulties. The reasons for the difficulties are disputed but in February 2013 the police were called and there were concerns that B had been the victim of domestic abuse and K was taken into custody. Further concerns were raised that B was then minimising the incident. These concerns led to an assessment by Westminster social services. B was by then studying as well as looking after M full time and needed more assistance than she was getting from her husband; they were said to be arguing about whether to have a nanny or have the paternal grandparents involved. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This assessment is the only independent evidence that is before the court, and while I cannot place too much weight on it, it was largely unchallenged by either party and provided some further background to the case. The author records that there were no concerns as to the standard of care provided by B and that she appeared to be very well informed on child care. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The couple were reported as intending to remain in the UK.  They owned their home and were working and studying here. B said that returning to Mongolia was not an option and that as a dependant of her husband she felt that there was no guarantee that she would be able to return to Singapore. This is a telling piece of evidence as it would not support the Respondent&#8217;s case that there was a long standing agreement to return to Singapore.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2013 B took up a language access course which had classes lasting 3 hours most, but not every, weekday. The paternal grandparents visited again in 2013 and stayed for a few months during which time they certainly took care of M when his mother was at classes. The Respondent continued to work full time. He says his parents undertook the bulk of M&#8217;s care which B denies. K was not there and I have not heard from them. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">B had to take exams in October 2013 which would have been time consuming. It was undoubtedly agreed that M would travel to Singapore with his parents in July and that they would leave him there in the care of his parental grandparents. M&#8217;s mother says she expected to him to return to England in November, but that K said he could not take any time off of work then. He booked and paid for flights for himself and the mother to travel to Singapore on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, a flight for all three to return to England on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014. Without telling his wife K resigned from his job in London and arranged to take up a position with his employer in Singapore.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Immediately on his arrival in Singapore in January, and unbeknownst to B, K commenced ex parte custody and divorce proceedings. B was served with the divorce and custody papers as she took lunch with her husband at the hotel where they were staying. He had also applied, without giving her notice, for a court order prohibiting her from removing M from the jurisdiction of Singapore. An attempt to serve this order, which he obtained in the ex parte hearing, took place when K and his Singaporean lawyer threw it at B at the airport as she was leaving the country.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not disputed that K then remained at &#8220;home&#8221; with his parents. He says she was welcome to stay there too. B&#8217;s case is that she was left in a hotel with limited access to her son. Her immigration status in Singapore was and is dependant on the good will of K. She used the return ticket to return to London. Upon her return to England the mother discovered she had been locked out of the family home and that her ATM card to the party&#8217;s joint account no longer functioned.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is her case that M was unlawfully retained in Singapore as he is habitually resident in the UK. It is K&#8217;s case that M remained in Singapore with his mother&#8217;s consent and by agreement. To decide on the issue of the disputed consent I heard from both parties and I have read the documents filed in the case which included the assessment by Westminster social services. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Neither parent remained in Singapore with their young baby until the parents travelled there in January 2014. It is not disputed that until July 2013 the baby was habitually resident in England. He was a year old when he left for Singapore; he has now been there for almost 8 months. It is B&#8217;s case that a 3 month temporary stay was initially contemplated, which was later extended to 5 months. It is K&#8217;s case that it was agreed that the baby should move to Singapore and remain there with his parents while B continued her education and undertook a degree. It is argued on his behalf that the time spent in Singapore means that M has acquired a Singaporean habitual residence as a matter of fact as the purpose and intention of the parents is merely one of the relevant factors.</p>

To some extent his written evidence is contradictory. He also makes serious allegations about his wife which take the form of assertions and are wholly unsubstantiated; such as that she was involved in prostitution and that she tried to poison him so he feared for his life. Their inclusion was obviously intended to be prejudicial. </p>

He said that she had been doing so since the child was born. He described a marriage in disarray and accused her of seriously abusive behaviour. None of this is consistent with the plan that he says was agreed as to M being cared for by his parents to allow B to study which is his story before this court. If B was so dismissive of her son why would she threaten to remove him to Mongolia? The two, while not necessarily mutually exclusive provide enough of a contradiction to warrant an explanation which was not forthcoming.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">K deliberately set out to mislead his wife as to his intentions when they returned to Singapore in January. He withdrew a substantial sum of money from their joint account (&#163;18,000) the day before they arrived in Singapore. He did not tell her he had left his job, he did not tell her in intended to divorce her, he did not tell her he would be remaining in Singapore. Even on his own account that M was to remain in Singapore by agreement that was on the basis that both his parents would be working and studying in the UK. He renewed his work visa for the UK, unnecessarily, with the intent of compromising and invalidating his son&#8217;s visa and his wife in the UK. This was to stop his son travelling here and to make B&#8217;s immigration status precarious. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">He bought return tickets for himself and his wife; and one for M. The speed with which lengthy documents were filed with the court on the Monday, after they had arrived on the Saturday in Singapore, makes it more likely than not that the case had been being prepared prior to his leaving London. Moreover he did not disclose to the court in Singapore the purpose of his trip to Singapore and the fact that the child&#8217;s mother was present in the country. This is all consistent with a deliberate plan to separate mother and child indefinitely as, on his own evidence B could not remain in Singapore for long without his sponsorship. It is not possible to say when this plan was conceived but it may have been as early as before M was taken to Singapore in the first place or shortly thereafter. </p>

The only independent evidence available would indicate that it was he who was believed to be the bully and the manipulator. He travelled with an empty suitcase to Singapore in January and admitted to me in evidence that he had taken this and other steps to conceal from his wife what his intentions were. He claims that B was a neglectful mother and poor parent. The observation of the social worker entirely contradicts this claim.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">B gave evidence with the assistance of an interpreter. Her English is good but she needed assistance from time to time. She was quiet in her manner, but calm and dignified. She denied ever agreeing to M remaining in Singapore indefinitely or for a period of at least a year. She has a place on a part-time course at Birkbeck College and has arranged a nursery place for M which K knew about. She accepted that she had gone to see nurseries in Singapore but said that she had done so for M and that contrary to K&#8217;s evidence M could have gone there before the age of 18 months if both his parents were busy. It&#8217;s a matter of record that B was advised of the benefits to M of his attending nursery when Westminster assessed the family because of concerns over domestic abuse by K. I gained the impression that when in Singapore B did not feel she was not in a position to object to any course of action suggested by her husband. She was certainly isolated and without family or support.</p>

K&#8217;s evidence that she chose to leave the flat in such circumstances is not credible. Both agree that the police were called and chose to resolve the matter by an officer flipping a coin as a result of which B left the flat. It is a pity that they do not have the officer&#8217;s number so that this court could have followed up this curious approach to domestic abuse cases by the Metropolitan Police.</p>

I was wholly unconvinced by his claims that he was bullied or coerced by his wife into doing things against his will. He had no idea what clothes B had bought M for his return; either he has no interest in what M&#8217;s mother does for their son or he had already dismissed her as irrelevant. His actions were underhand, devious and cruel. He has, quite deliberately, sought to separate M from his mother, and clearly intended to do so permanently, as there is no plan in place to enable B to remain in Singapore. I do not accept his claim that B did not care for and look after M; there is no evidence that she was anything other than the primary carer. </p>
