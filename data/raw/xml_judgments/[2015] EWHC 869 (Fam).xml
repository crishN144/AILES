Wardship, following the introduction of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, which came into force in&#160;October&#160;1991, has now much more limited scope than previously.  It is primarily utilised in contemporary family law, in cases involving alleged international child abduction and in cases within the Hague Convention of 25&#160;October&#160;1980 on the civil aspects of international child abduction.</span></p>

For this reason, and because it vests parental responsibility solely in the High Court, it is particularly apposite in circumstances such as those contemplated here.  All the major decisions relating to such children for the period of the operation of the wardship require the approval of the High Court.</span></p>

It is never an order that can be made lightly.  Where only the State, in this case through the arm of the local authority, appears in court, it must never be forgotten that the court requires a&#160;very high degree of candour on the part of all of those involved.</span></p>

Some of the concerns identified in the local authority's risk evaluation may, ultimately, never have to be determined.  We are, as Ms&#160;Carter-Manning on behalf of the police, rightly emphasises, concerned entirely with risk assessment, itself an essentially fluid concept. </span></p>

It concerned a&#160;passport which was said to have been lost.  I&#160;should add that this was not the only "lost" passport in this case.  The school concerned, the Bethnal Green Academy, received an&#160;account from parents that that particular passport had been lost but had in any event expired.  That appeared to have been accepted.  Given that it concerned one of the subject children, it is manifestly highly relevant in evaluating the risk to that child.</span></p>

Notwithstanding that there have been several lengthy meetings between police and social services during the course of this week, and that the issues are being subject to scrutiny here in the High Court, that information was not communicated to the local authority.  Both they and I&#160;heard about it, again, because I&#160;pursued it, in the court room through counsel.</span></p>

More than that, she had been told it in the presence of two detective constables who, within minutes, she was, on consulting her notes, able to identify by name.  I&#160;have no doubt that misinformation about that passport had been given to the school, the police and to the social services, a&#160;fact which plainly is relevant in evaluating the matrix of risk. </span></p>

Where there are changes in medicine or in technology or cultural change, so often they resonate first within the family.  Here, the type of harm I&#160;have been asked to evaluate is a&#160;different facet of vulnerability for children than that which the courts have had to deal with in the past.</span></p>

Once again, this court finds it necessary to reiterate that only open dialogue, appropriate sharing of information, mutual respect for the differing roles involved and inter-agency cooperation is going to provide the kind of protection that I&#160;am satisfied that the children subject to these applications truly require.  </span></p>
