They want to correct what they assert are inaccuracies in the reports and the records.  They propose making a complaint to the General Medical Council or other appropriate body against Dr. McInerney, and they propose taking libel proceedings against her.</span></p>

In respect of the disclosure applications NCC submit simply that, because the proceedings have effectively concluded, disclosure should not be ordered.  Additionally, NCC submit that disclosure should not be ordered because it would expose AH to a risk of harm.  It is asserted that this would occur both from direct disclosure to DH and from disclosure to AH because, as recorded in Bodey J&#8217;s order, she would provide the documents to him.  </span></p>

If these proceedings are going to lead to any substantive intervention on the part of the local authority, on the basis either that AH lacks the capacity to make important decisions or that she is a vulnerable adult effectively unable to exercise the capacity that she may have, then the evidence of Dr. McInerney, as well as of the local authority&#8217;s Social Services staff, has got to be tested.  </span></p>

At this stage, I would confine my determination of the issue of disclosure to the other points raised by the parties.
