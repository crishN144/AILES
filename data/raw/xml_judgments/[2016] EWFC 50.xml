	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court of Appeal rightly set aside the order of Judge Brasse dated 6 January 2016. That was an impermissible freestanding injunctive order requiring the husband to transfer to the wife his interest in the Indian pension fund in circumstances where he had earlier in October 2015 awarded the wife a lump sum worth about &#163;19,000 and dismissed all her remaining capital claims including her claims for property adjustment. As I will explain, it would have been open to the Court of Appeal to have reframed the order of Judge Brasse to position it within the powers available to the court so that it achieved much the same effect; but it did not do so. Instead it set aside the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">entirety</span> of the offending order, including the provisions which made declarations as to the beneficial ownership of the Indian pension fund; and ordered that the wife's claims for a pension sharing order should be &#8220;reheard&#8221;. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Judge Brasse found that the Indian pension fund belonged to the husband and dismissed his case that he had transferred all his interest in it to a Mr Deshmukh. He made strong findings of dishonesty against the husband. McFarlane LJ did not in his judgment question those findings, and indeed relied on them. He stated however at paragraph 15 that &#8220;the focus of this appeal is not upon the judge's findings of fact but upon the order that he made in the light of those findings.&#8221; In paragraph 47 he held that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order should be set aside - and those only concerned the injunction order. However, as I have already stated, the actual order of the Court of Appeal sets aside not merely the illegitimate free-standing injunction orders (i.e. paragraphs 1 and 2), but the order &#8220;in its entirety&#8221; made by Judge Brasse, and this included the key declarations as to the beneficial ownership of the fund. Therefore, it seems to me that, although this was probably unintended by the Court of Appeal, the question of the ownership of the fund is at large and needs to be re-determined, although in such determination the findings of Judge Brasse are naturally admissible and influential, if not decisive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The time allocated for the hearing before me has not been sufficient to rehear the beneficial ownership question and in any event Mr Deshmukh has not been served with the paperwork concerning this issue. Nor has there been time to deal with the cross-applications to vary the order for spousal maintenance made earlier by Judge Brasse on 9 October 2015. They will be determined by me on a later date, although I will have something to say about the wife's application (which I deemed to have been made on 9 August 2016) later in this judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Turner QC&#8217;s submission is laden with irony.  Judge Brasse held in paragraph 29 of his judgment of 6 January 2016 that &#8220;I am unable to make a pension sharing order or a pension attachment order because the HDFC pension is in fact placed in India&#8221;. In the light of this the judge made his free-standing injunction order (he could not have made a property adjustment order in respect of the fund, either by way of transfer or variation of settlement, as he had dismissed those claims on 9 October 2015). In the Court of Appeal Mr Turner QC suggested, admittedly tentatively, that this finding was wrong and that there may well have been power, subject to his second point, to make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref>B in respect of the Indian pension. Therefore, that was the route that the judge should have followed rather than his free-wheeling adoption of the injunction powers of the court.</p>

At the time of his decision, however, he understood that the fact that the policy was based outside the jurisdiction of England and Wales placed it outside of the reach of the English Family Court. <span style="font-weight:bold">It is now common ground between the parties, and accepted by this court, that, in terms of the overall principles, the judge was in error in this regard.</span> Although, as Mr Turner submits, there would be a need to consider, possibly with the assistance of expert evidence, whether the terms of the policy prevented transfer, what the reaction of the financial institution holding the policy was and whether a pension sharing order with respect to that policy by the English court would be enforceable under the law of India, those are specific matters of detail relating to this policy and, because of the erroneous understanding of the judge on the issue of international jurisdiction, the court simply did not engage with those lower level details at the hearing.&#8221;</p>

He says that the notes in the Family Court Practice are wrong and the statutory instrument referred to has nothing to do with the sharing of a foreign pension (it is concerned with the tax treatment of payments received under such pensions). One might think that Mr Turner QC should be stuck with his concession, but it is trite law that the parties cannot confer a non-existent jurisdiction on the court by agreement.</p>

It should be noted that Scottish pension providers will usually implement an English pension sharing order. In certain circumstances (e.g. in the USA), it may be possible for a pension sharing order made in England or Wales to contain a recital that it should be registered in the USA for implementation purposes by means of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) or to give an undertaking to similar effect.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is true that it has been accepted for a very long time that orders for property adjustment can be made in respect of a foreign property or nuptial settlement trust provided that there is clear evidence that such an order would likely be enforced by the foreign court (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Jackson's Matrimonial Finance and Taxation</span> (Ninth Edition, 2012, LexisNexis) at 7.57 &#8211; 7.58 and the cases there cited). I discuss this below. The question is whether a pension sharing order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref>B falls into this category. Mr Turner QC now argues that irrespective of whether the Indian court might enforce such an order the terms of our domestic legislation simply cannot be construed to apply to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">any</span> foreign pension. Mr Salter agrees that the reach of the legislation cannot be construed to cover a pension that originated in an overseas jurisdiction but he argues, cautiously, that it might extend to a pension which is exported overseas as a &#8220;qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme&#8221; (QROPS). Under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12/section/150/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 150(8)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/12" uk:canonical="2004 c. 12" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Finance Act 2004</ref> a recognised overseas pension scheme is an overseas pension scheme that meets the requirements prescribed under the Pension Schemes (Categories of Country and Requirements for Overseas Pension Schemes and Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006 No. 206).  One of the countries in which such a scheme may be established is India.  </p>

He accepts that the definition of a &#8220;personal pension scheme&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1993/48/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1993/48" uk:canonical="1993 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Pensions Schemes Act 1993</ref> has a territorial limitation but argues that there is actually no such limitation in the definition of an occupational pension scheme. So, literally, it extends to any such scheme whether it was originated overseas, or whether it originated here and was exported.  He is frank enough to accept that such an interpretation would come as a surprise to most practitioners and other professionals in the field. </p>

It is not an order <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span>. However, he questions whether the old cases, which state that, at least in principle, and subject to proof of likelihood of reciprocal enforcement, an order can be made varying a foreign nuptial settlement, in fact violate the presumption against extra-territorial effect. In none of those cases was the point considered.  In such a case, he says, the relief has the hallmarks of an order <span style="font-style:italic">in rem</span>. Moreover, it imposes obligations on foreign third parties - the trustees of the overseas trust. These are respectable arguments which will need to be considered when such a case arises. The counter-argument is that it is a very necessary power in many cases, particularly where the overseas trust owns property sited in this jurisdiction.

The evidence that she did supply suggested that an order for the payment of a sum of money made by the High Court here would, under the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, be enforceable. That is not what a pension sharing order does.  Indeed, in England and Wales (unlike, I believe, in Scotland) a pension sharing order cannot specify a sum of money but rather, as I have said above, only a percentage. It then goes on to direct how the pension credit should be created and given effect (by internal or external transfer, depending on the rules of the scheme). There is no evidence before me which begins to confirm that this unique order would be reciprocally enforced in India.</p>

When the husband dies (or if he befalls a critical terminal illness) the then value of the original purchase price of &#163;87,000 will be returned to his estate. That will, I expect, be in many years' time, so the return of the purchase price (at par) is scarcely relevant. The annuity contract is in the husband's name and the payments are made to an Indian bank account also in his name (although he says that it is controlled by Mr Deshmukh). As far as the insurers are concerned the owner of the rights under the contract is the husband alone. As far as they are concerned there is not a single piece of documentary evidence that he has assigned his rights to Mr Deshmukh. </p>
