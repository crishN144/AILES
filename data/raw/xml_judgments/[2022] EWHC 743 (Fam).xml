	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">CC is a very bright 4 year-old boy who was born in a northern county of England, but who just three months after his birth flew with his mother to a different country and a different continent &#8211; to the Republic of South Africa.  There he lived most of his young life until his mother brought him back to the United Kingdom and then kept him here against the wishes of his father, causing his father great anguish and consternation.  The vital issue arising in this case is whether this court should insist that CC make another intercontinental flight.  This time to be returned to South Africa by virtue of the powers vested in the court under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (&#8220;the Convention&#8221;: Cmnd 8281).  </p>

		<p class="NormalWeb"><span/>Forthwith means forthwith. This is not an empty word or artificial and unrealistic ambition.

This includes where the child would be exposed to a grave risk of harm or where the child would be placed in an intolerable situation.  The Convention is not blind to this.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">What happened was this.  CC&#8217;s parents met in high school in South Africa.  Their relationship started as a youthful romance, but it inevitably had to end when her mother left for England and Ms ST went along, too.  Several years later, Ms ST returned to South Africa and took up the relationship with Mr QR.  Frankly, it did not go well.  They separated in 2016, after CC was conceived but before he was born.  Approximately three months after his birth in [a northern city of England], he was taken by his mother to South Africa.  This was on 26 September 2016.  From then until 8 April 2021, he had been living in South Africa.  Indeed, he had been attending the YY College preschool, certainly before Covid struck, as it ultimately did so devastatingly in South Africa.  </p>

The significance is that scheme of the Convention is the enforcement of rights of custody as opposed to court orders.  The right to assert and enforce custody rights exists, therefore, independently of any pre-existing court order.  Here the parents were signatories to a joint parenting plan endorsed and approved by the Family Court in South Africa. It is dated 7 August 2017.  This agreement was mediated.  Both parties were present in court and it was approved by the court.  So that was 2017.</p>

Thus, CC should have returned to South Africa on 29 April 2021.  Or thereabouts.  However, once Ms ST sought to keep her son here, Mr QR did not consent to that.  He had agreed to a holiday and then a prompt return to South Africa not, he says, to his son&#8217;s wholesale relocation to the United Kingdom.  Therefore, on 18 May 2021, his South African attorneys sent the mother a letter seeking for CC&#8217;s return within twenty business days.  CC was not returned before the expiry of that period.  So his father took legal action.  </p>

In the first instance, the hearing was adjourned to 19 November.  On that date, Ms ST made a successful Part 25 application for a psychiatric expert.

She went to the United Kingdom with her mother and so the relationship ended a few years later.  She returned to South Africa again in 2013 and the relationship started up again in 2014.  In 2015, she states that he became abusive, coercive, and controlling towards her, but when he proposed, she accepted.  She became pregnant.  He still wanted sexual intercourse with her during the pregnancy and she refused.  As a result, she alleges that he, as she puts it, beat her up and they ended the relationship as a result.  Nevertheless, she decided to keep the baby which was CC and she resolved to bring him up on her own.  She went to live with her brother U in [a major South African city].  </p>

Mr QR told her that he would change and she &#8220;foolishly&#8221; believed him.  Therefore, she returned to South Africa approximately three months after CC&#8217;s birth.  It was now September 2016 and, again, she went to live with her brother.  Wedding plans had been discussed in August 2016 but by October, the relationship had broken down.  She was still living with her brother.  The parents broke up for good in May 2017.  </p>

That was a month after she came to the United Kingdom in April.  When that marriage failed, the tenancy on their property was surrendered.  So the mother has no property from that relationship and she has nowhere, she says, to live in South Africa.  If she has to return because her son is ordered to return, she will have nowhere to live, no job, no benefits, and no real support.  Rental prices are between 7,000 and 9,500 rand per month.  She says that looking back, Mr QR did not really want a relationship with his son.  He was inconsistent with contact and that used to make CC cry.  She does not want to go back to court in South Africa because she feels he, that is Mr QR, &#8216;would win&#8217; because he is very manipulative.  She stopped working at the law firm in March 2019 and she found it hard to find employment in South Africa following the pandemic.  In April 2021, she came to the United Kingdom and she did have some employment here.</p>

There has been shortly before the judgment started a flurry of emails about this vexed topic.  The certificate itself is woefully inaccurate.  It shows that CC was born in South Africa and not in [a northern county], and that is wrong.  Ms ST alleges that this was because of a fraud by the father.  He denies it.  I make two points about all of this.  First, without oral evidence, it is impossible to resolve this issue on the papers in summary proceedings.  Second, as importantly, if not more so, I have indicated to parties that I regard this as of secondary or tertiary importance in the determination of the Art13(b) exemption.  I therefore turn to the evidence of Mr QR.</p>

She did that following what he says was an agreed three-week holiday in England.  Instead, she decided to uproot their son from his home in South Africa and she separated him from his father.  Even before CC was born, the mother and her family had made it difficult for him to see his son.  Under their cultural rituals, he had to pay them 15,000 rand just to get access to his son.  It is partly because of these difficulties that he applied for a parenting plan in the South African courts in order to have regular contact with his son. </p>

Once back in England, her argument for staying here was that she was better able to provide for their son and she would be able to get benefits for him in England.  Therefore, CC was not brought back on 29 April.  Mr QR never consented to her retaining him in the UK beyond this date and he has been consistent, he says, in his wish that his son be returned to South Africa. </p>

With progressive globalisation, the problem has assumed an increasingly urgent international dimension.  The Hague Convention 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty that was concluded at the fourteenth session of the Hague Conference on private international law, also known as the HCCH &#8211; the acronym reflecting its dual English and French language origins.  Since 1893 this conference has sought unification of private international law through the device of multilateral conventions.  What became the 1980 Convention evolved over time from the 1902 Convention on the Guardianship of Minors to the 1961 Convention on the Protection of Minors.  Article 1 of the 1961 Convention changed the primary basis of jurisdiction from the nationality of the child to the child&#8217;s habitual residence and this continues in the 1980 Convention.</p>

It can include any measure which might address the risk being advanced by the respondent, including relying upon the courts of the requesting state.  Accordingly, the general right to seek assistance of the court or other state authorities is something that is capable of persuading a court that there was not a grave risk within Art13(b).

If the intensity is likely to destabilise the respondent&#8217;s parenting of a child, this is something that has the capacity to render the position of the child intolerable.  As noted above, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E</span>, the Supreme Court made it clear that such subjective anxieties are capable of founding an exception under Art 13(b).  However, it is also clear that in order to do so, there are three important caveats.  First, the court will look very critically at an assertion of intense anxieties not based upon objective risk: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (A Child) (Abduction: Rights of Custody)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2012/10" uk:canonical="[2012] UKSC 10" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] UKSC 10</ref> at [27].  </p>

It matters not whether the mother&#8217;s anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable.  The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the court&#8217;s assessment of the mother&#8217;s mental state if the child is returned.&#8221;</p>

She is taking a &#8220;whole range&#8221;, as he put it, of medication and the antidepressants have been increased.  They are going to take some months to be effective, according to Dr Chahl.  In the United Kingdom, she has family and support and she has been able to obtain work although she has given it up recently.  She was working in August.  She worked in a shop but gave that up because of mental health issues as her medical notes make clear.  In South Africa, she will have to look after her son and she will not be able to get a job.  Her mental health will deteriorate.  Her mental health is, as Mr Jarman put it, &#8220;subjectively acute&#8221;.

However, that does not take into account the reality of Ms ST&#8217;s circumstances in South Africa.  There is no offer to pay for her air fare which counsel both agreed is approximately &#163;450-&#163;500, something like that.  The maintenance is limited to 3,250 rand.  When Mr Jarman made his submissions, Mr QR had undertaken to pay two months&#8217; accommodation.  It is now three months&#8217; accommodation.  Not a derisory amount.  But Mr Jarman submitted that it is unlikely within two months that she will have a job.  I take the same submission to apply to three months.  What is Ms ST supposed to do then? Mr Jarman asks.</p>

He has drip-fed her maintenance in the past, small amounts over time.  She has investigated schools in South Africa such as the VWA Institute and the school fees are about 96,000 rand per annum.  The fees at JLZ are 62,000.  There are government schools, but they are in or near townships and these parents would not want their son to go there.  There is no offer about paying for school and that is another element of intolerability.  There are no benefits available to Ms ST in South Africa because she has not worked since 2019.  Her written evidence states that she has no entitlement to benefits and, therefore, she would be wholly dependent on Mr QR.  Her only state claim would be for their child because they have not been married. </p>

Even if the case went to the court in South Africa, it is likely that the maintenance would be less than Mr QR has offered.  The accommodation costs are expensive and she would not be able to afford them.  He has changed his position and said, at first, that she could stay in one of his properties, but he has rented that out and so he offers her a one-bedroom commercial property.  She says that it is unfurnished.  That is disputed and the court was directed to a photograph or a picture in the additional bundle which appears to show, it is submitted, furnishing in the property.  Irrespective of that, the reason Mr Jarman says it is cheap is because it is next to a township and that is not a safe area.  To walk to her aunt&#8217;s would take well over two hours.  The mental health services in South Africa would not be sufficient.  The free telephone advice is not appropriate for what she needs.  It is not individual counselling.  There is not individual therapy as a free resource.  The diagnosed mental health problems of Ms ST that Dr Chahl set out would not be helped by a telephone helpline.</p>

This is not a financial proceedings court but even if the Art13(b) defence is not proved, the father is nevertheless, as a sign of good faith, giving undertakings with a view to safeguarding and protecting his son so he has some security before the South African court makes any further orders on maintenance.  If the mother wishes him to pay school fees, she can go to court in South Africa.  That is the forum to resolve this dispute.  In the parenting plan of 2017, the maintenance was set at 3,250 rand per month and it was to be reviewed at the maintenance court.  She can invite the court to extend the period of accommodation for more than three months and she can do that from here and now.  She could stay with her brother.

In any event, if CC needed a home, he can have one with his father and thus he would not be homeless.  Ms ST can get support from the Social Security Agency in South Africa and that would be, even on her case, 420 rands per month approximately.  She should pay for her plane ticket.  Why is it that Mr QR has to shoulder the bulk of the financial burden?  She was never his wife and she has unlawfully retained their son in the United Kingdom.</p>

She submits that they risk of diverting the court into an impermissible welfare analysis of its own at a remove of 5,000 miles from the home court.  I recognise that Ms Ramsahoye is correct: best interests welfare analyses are not the meat and drink of these applications.  But I am bound to say that I did not understand Mr Jarman&#8217;s submissions to be directed at that.  It is vital, it seems to me, for this court to gauge the welfare and well-being of the child on the ground, the reality of his life on return to the country of habitual residence with a view to judging risk and intolerability.  The child&#8217;s welfare is implicit in that analysis.  How can it not be?

Again, I understood Mr Jarman&#8217;s submissions to be of a subtler complexion than that.  It is, of course, settled law that the focus must be on the child but that cannot be holistically and meaningfully assessed without an intelligent and sensitive understanding of the impact of return on the child&#8217;s primary carer.  This is because any significant distress or intolerability suffered by the carer may impact the child.  May.  That much is obvious.  I make it plain, therefore, that I do assess the question of intolerability to the mother.  It is not freestanding.  It is to examine any linked and consequent impact on CC.

The claim of grave risk of psychological harm to CC caused by his mother&#8217;s mental health cannot be assessed in an evidential void, ignoring what cannot be ignored: Dr Chahl&#8217;s report.  This is part of the broader anxious scrutiny.  The expert report furnished the court with significant evidence to gauge what is likely to be Ms ST&#8217;s mental health situation on return to South Africa and thus the consequent risk to CC &#8211; always that link to the child being the pressing question.  This approach is endorsed by Baker LJ at principle (6) <span style="font-style:italic">op. cit.</span>:</p>

In submissions filed on her behalf, it is argued that he has admitted &#8220;situational abuse&#8221;.  But what is the scope of this concession?

I acknowledge there was an incident in 2015.  However, there were no proceedings in relation to this incident as there was insufficient evidence to warrant a protection order.  In my understanding in South African law, this can be labelled as &#8216;situational abuse&#8217; based on the fact that [Ms ST] was blocking my exit from the complex.  I did use force to flee the situation so we could both calm down.  My intention was to exit the building, not to harm her.  I do not believe she would have come back to South Africa after CC&#8217;s birth in 2016 and even continued to look for wedding venues until 2017 if she honestly perceived me to be the abusive, controlling, and apathetic man she would like the court to see me as.  As recently as December 2020, she even messaged me to say she never stopped loving me [and he gives the exhibit reference].  She made no police complaints about me or prevented me from having care of CC.

The couple have not been living together from the time he came into the world.  Ms ST subsequently married somebody else and there have been no concerns about abusive conduct during the contact arrangements which have been in place since 2017.  Thus, in my judgment, it is difficult to conceive how domestic violence and abuse remains part of her anxieties presently.  There has been no suggestion of it for years.  The far-reaching and debilitating effect of domestic abuse should never be underestimated; this court takes it <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> seriously.  But in this particular case, on these very specific facts, the risk of domestic abuse and violence is remote. I judge that it can be discounted for the purposing of this application.  I remind myself that these are summary proceedings; nothing has been proved about these historic allegations. To my mind, the risk is all but eliminated due to the prudent undertakings that contact between the parents will be strictly limited and restricted to contact at handovers.

What is striking, as Mr Jarman very realistically concedes, is that the issue of her mental health was not addressed at all in her written evidence of 24 September 2021.  If this was such a pressing and vital issue, it is puzzling that there is no mention of it anywhere in her filed evidence to prevent her son&#8217;s return to South Africa.  To counter this concern, it is submitted on behalf of Ms ST that she was &#8220;reluctant to mention it previously because her mental health may be used against her by the father in South Africa&#8221;.  However, there is no evidence filed by her about this.  I cannot accept that submission in the absence of any evidence &#8211; it has no foundation.

Indeed, Mr Jarman characterised them as &#8220;comprehensive&#8221;.  I remind myself of what Lord Wilson said <span style="font-style:italic">Re S</span>.  His Lordship was plain that in assessing the asserted grave risk of exposure to harm arising from subjective anxieties, the court must examine very critically such an assertion and the objective evidence of the actual position in the round must remain relevant.  I have conducted a critical examination of the mother&#8217;s assertions and relevant evidence, and also the likely position on the ground in South Africa.  I find that she has not made out a case that whatever the objective level of risk, the impact on her mental health and subjectively of returning to South Africa would place her son in an intolerable situation.  Dr Chahl put it directly:</p>

What is necessary to deal with her adjustment disorder is time to adjust.  Adjustment disorder is an emotional disturbance arising in a period of adaption to significant life change or stressful events.  As Ms ST moves through that period, there is every reason to believe, based upon Dr Chahl&#8217;s expert clinical evidence, that she will adapt to life once again in South Africa and the emotional disturbance will only result in a slight worsening.  There are good grounds to believe it will improve and the expert prognosis is good.  I remind myself that the risk must be grave.  A risk that is real is insufficient.  However, I find here that the risk to this child is nowhere near the necessary Convention threshold.  The risk must be grave.  That adjective was a very deliberate choice by the framers of the Convention as a more &#8216;intensive qualifier&#8217; than &#8216;substantial&#8217; risk.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7">

He says that this should give Ms ST an opportunity to explore employment opportunities and, indeed, other accommodation in South Africa.  He will pay her 3,215 rand per month.  If there are disputes about the level of proper maintenance, they can be litigated in the South African courts.  It is perhaps paradoxically submitted on behalf of Ms ST that this is little comfort because should she make a maintenance application to the South African court the award may be lower than the amount that Mr QR is proposing to pay.  Indeed, he has been paying what was mandated by the previous court order and parenting agreement. I take from this the maintenance offered by Mr QR is not unreasonably and wretchedly low.  It is not unrealistic.  In fact, it is more than she might otherwise receive from the court.  </p>

This submission is hard to sustain: Ms ST is an intelligent woman.  She has a diploma in law from the United Kingdom and has worked in a law firm in South Africa.  It strikes me that the place to resolve all these disputes is in the jurisdiction of habitual residence &#8211; the home court.  As Baroness Hale made absolutely plain, this is the scheme of the Hague Convention 1980.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">It is submitted that she would have no effective family support in the FX region of South Africa.  However, she will be returning to [a major South African city] where she previously lived with CC.  When the court asked for clarification, it transpired that both her aunt and her brother do actually live in that same city.  She lived there with her brother in 2015.  She also lived with him after CC was born and lived there when she travelled to South Africa in September 2016, and then later after the relationship with Mr QR terminated.  It appears therefore that she has lived with her brother U for a not insignificant amount of time in [that major South African city].  It becomes difficult to maintain that she would have no effective support.  She does have family in the same city.  It is hard to believe that she would be completely abandoned by them and destitute if she was in need. </p>

He says, therefore, there is no room for her.  I am bound to say that this is hardly impartial evidence coming from her brother in support of her defence to the application.  I can place only limited weight upon it.  That is because there are photographs of the renovations including the painting of walls in mid-September.  Next week is mid-February.  It is hard to believe that almost five months later, the bedroom renovation would not be finished.  It is said that the renovations are with a view to selling the property in due course, but there is no information at all provided about that. </p>

In any event, Mr QR states that, if necessary, CC can stay with him and he is, after all, CC&#8217;s father.  I emphasise that I am not conducting a conventional welfare analysis at this point, nor suggesting it is better for their son to live with father rather than mother.  Nothing like that at all.  </p>

But what has been the position since the birth of CC while she was married?  There is no evidence one way or another whether she did or did not have health insurance and, if she did, how it was funded.  Mr QR is not married to her and never has been.  He has not lived with her since their son was born in 2016.  I cannot see why he should pay her health insurance.  He will certainly pay his son&#8217;s.  I do not understand how his not paying her health insurance would be part of a picture of intolerability and why it is his obligation.  However, I emphasise again the solution to this lies with the South African court and Ms ST can immediately make her application there from these shores and the procedural ball rolling. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr QR says that a school can be found for CC.  Ms ST queries how it would be funded.  Again, if necessary, this is a matter for the home court to resolve.  It is submitted on behalf of Ms ST that it would be intolerable for CC to go to a state school in South Africa, that such schools are not safe and they are either in or near townships.  In summary proceedings, I find it impossible to assess the merits of such a suggestion.  While it is true that CC has previously gone to a private nursery, I cannot accept that if it actually came to it, having to attend a state school would amount to intolerability.  No doubt very large numbers of children in South Africa attend state schools.  None of these matters individually or cumulatively amount to an intolerable situation for CC.  The judgment of the court is that this is very far from the case.  As Baroness Hale emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E </span>at [34]:</p>

It is fundamental to the philosophy of the Convention that there is respect for other Contracting States as part of international comity.

Having done so, I find that Ms ST has not proved to the requisite standard that either her situation or CC&#8217;s situation would be intolerable on her return to South Africa.  There would, at most, be a slight worsening of her present presentation. It would be manageable by her GP.  It is not materially different to someone without her condition.  The best treatment is time to adjust.  She will have accommodation for three months.  She could live with her brother if necessary beyond that, just as she has done before.  She can resort to the South African court for further support or arrangements.  </p>

What she then proceeded to do was to attempt to construct a case to justify keeping her son in Britain.  She sought to argue at first that the removal or retention was lawful.  She has now accepted that it was not.  She argued that Mr QR had acquiesced or consented.  She now concedes he had not.  She then argued that he was not exercising his custody rights in South Africa.  He was.  There is a report from an expert on South African law to confirm this.
