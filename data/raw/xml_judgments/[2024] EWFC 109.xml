The issue relates to monies held for the benefit of their 10-year-old child (to whom I shall refer as A) who has lifelong care needs as a result of a chromosomal disorder. The monies derive from a damages award of &#163;5m arising out of a successful damages claim brought by H and W relating to the antenatal care provided to W during her pregnancy. </span></p>

Depressingly, there has been no improvement in their poor relationship which has, I am sure, contributed to their inability to reach agreement on this application. Nevertheless, one glimmer of hope is that A does spend time with them both; W is her primary carer, and she spends between 25% and 33% of the time with H.  </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There is a mortgage with RBC in the sum of &#163;1m secured on the property. The mortgage term comes to an end in August 2024. H seeks court permission to remortgage with a different lender. H is concerned that the order of Roberts J at paragraph 24(a)(ii) on one reading only entitles him to secure this particular mortgage with RBC on this particular property and does not entitle him to remortgage without permission of the court, although he says that was never the intention behind the order. He has made this application out of an abundance of caution. For my own part, the order read as a whole does not seem to me to require permission for a remortgage, not least because paragraph 24(d) clearly envisages the possibility of remortgage. Further, the structure of the order as a whole is clearly intended to enable H to utilise the monies towards housing provided that at all times such monies are protected in the manner set out in the order. If H is not permitted to remortgage, he would have to sell the property as he cannot redeem the mortgage from other funds.  In any event, paragraph 25 expressly reserves to the court the power to permit H to arrange alternative security and paragraph 50 contains the standard general liberty to apply in respect of implementation. I am quite satisfied that I have the power to make the order sought if appropriate. </span></p>

Under the terms of paragraph 24(c)(ii) of the order, H requires the permission of W or an order of the court to do so. W does not consent. Hence H needs court permission to take this step. If approved, the remortgage required would then be &#163;750,000 rather than &#163;1m. </span></p>

W instructed solicitors late the afternoon before, even though she had been served with the application on 27 March 2024. On the day of the hearing, her counsel sought an adjournment so that W could give full instructions to her legal team. I granted the adjournment application and relisted for today. I made a direction that W should (if so advised) file a witness statement by 25 April 2024 setting out her objections to the order sought by H. Although I accept that W&#8217;s legal team had very little time to prepare for the case, it struck me as surprising that W was unable at the hearing on 11 April 2024 to articulate through counsel at that stage what her objection was, even if only in broad terms. </span></p>

It does not impact negatively upon A. The monies would be secured under the multiple protective terms of the order. It would reduce the overall level of borrowing to &#163;750,000, and the mortgage repayments. It would enhance the stability of housing for H and A. The judgment anticipated that H would put the entire &#163;900,000 in a property. In fact, he chose at the time to retain &#163;250,000 in a bank account, but he cannot be criticised for now wanting to put in place what was always envisaged. The order itself states clearly that the monies can be invested in property or a bank account, and H in my judgment is entitled to elect to place the entirety of the monies in property. I bear in mind that W has done just that, and lives in a mortgage free property; it seems reasonable to me that H should be able to reduce the mortgage without in any way jeopardising the monies. </span></p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">W did raise one or two ancillary points which merit consideration but do not justify refusing the application. She was concerned that the proposed mortgage offer allows for interest to be rolled up over 3 years, at which point H would have to undertake a further remortgage. I did not think it sensible for interest to accrue in this way, not least because it would erode the equity in the property. However, H assured me that he will in fact meet the interest costs on a monthly basis, which meets the point. Separately, W told me that H is not paying the correct amount of child maintenance as it has not been uprated in accordance with CPI. This is not directly relevant to the application but needs to be sorted out. H told me that if he has been underpaying, he will make up the arrears. W also told me that H has not registered the relevant declaration of trust with HM Land Registry as provided for by the order of Roberts J; that, too, will need to be corrected and H agreed. </span></p>

In particular, it is not a &#8220;financial order&#8221;  which in turn is interpreted at FPR2010 r2.3. Thus, FPR 2010 r28.3(5) that the general rule &#8220;&#8230;is that the court will not make an order requiring one party to pay the costs of another party&#8221; does not apply to this application.

The relief sought was reasonable, and H has throughout made clear that all the protective measures in the order remain in place. W did not consent, and sought to introduce unrelated matters. Further, the costs of the abortive hearing on 11 April were caused by her failure to instruct lawyers until the last minute without any good reason for leaving it so late. </span></p>

I do not consider that her stance has reached the threshold for an order for costs on the indemnity basis. On H&#8217;s own presentation, there was some room for uncertainty about the meaning of one relevant paragraph of the order, and it is of note that H originally elected not to put all the monies in the property and is now revisiting that earlier decision. Further, the offer to pay interest on an ongoing basis, rather than allowing it to be rolled up for the course of the mortgage term, only appeared during the hearing before me as a result of W&#8217;s concerns. Other points raised by W had some validity (e.g sending a copy of the relevant declaration of trust to HM Land Registry). But overall, I reject W&#8217;s assertion that she has been &#8220;strung along&#8221; and that H has sought to frustrate the order of Roberts J. </span></p>
