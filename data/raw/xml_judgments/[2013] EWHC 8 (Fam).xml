However, in my judgment, in the particular circumstances of this case, J&#8217;s interests would be likely to be harmed if there were no power to revoke the freeing order made in relation to him.  This cannot realistically be done without reliance on the inherent jurisdiction.  There is presently no applicant entitled to apply under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> (just as was the case in re SC) and the reality is that no application is ever likely to be made, even once the mother becomes so entitled.  The freeing provisions are designed to facilitate the placing and adoption of children so that their welfare can be secured parliament cannot, in my view have intended that the statutory provision should work so as to cause harm to children when plans have changed and in my judgment it is open to me to exercise the inherent jurisdiction to supplement the statutory powers and therefore protect J.&#8221;  </span></p>

He submitted that to deny the parents the opportunity to challenge or scrutinise an up-to-date care plan, through the medium of an interim care order, would be accepting an interpretation that offends against the requirement of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> and in particular <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> which requires that primary legislation, in so far as is possible, is to be read and given effect in a way compatible with Convention rights. </p>

From a statutory interpretation point of view, the section is, in my judgment capable of only one interpretation; the wording is <span style="font-style:italic">to revive&#8230;&#8230;any care order within the meaning of that act.</span> The use of the word <span style="font-style:italic">revive</span> in the statute shows that what is intended is that the full care order (made immediately prior to the freeing order), is to be restored and accordingly a care order will be the order determining J&#8217;s legal status following the exercise of the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction to revoke the freeing order.  </p>

The aim must be, they submit, to protect the child in so far as that is achievable. Where the child&#8217;s day to day living arrangements will be unaffected, it will often be the case that the child need know little or nothing about the regularisation of their legal status until such time as it has been resolved and that it is only if the parents decide to take an active part in the proceedings, that they need actively to be engaged in the process.</p>
