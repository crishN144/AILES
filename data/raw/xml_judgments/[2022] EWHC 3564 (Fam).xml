The order of Keehan J reiterated an order made by his Honour Judge Nathan on 18 September 2017. These were orders requiring Lena&#8217;s  return to this jurisdiction from Poland. It is not in issue that Lena was wrongfully retained in Poland by the mother following an agreed two week trip in July and/or August 2017.</span></p>

The parents met when they were young but were not initially close. The father moved to the United Kingdom in 2002. The mother moved here in 2003. The parents married in 2008 and Lena was born in the UK in 2009 in London. Lena is a British National. She previously held a British passport but I am told she does not currently have a valid British passport. Lena&#8217;s home was in the UK from her birth until 2017 when she was retained in Poland in circumstances to which I have just referred. She and her parents also spent substantial time in Poland before 2017, including some time in 2011, and I am told a couple of months almost every Summer and some time at Christmas and other ad hoc visits.</span></p>

The charges against the grandfather had been dismissed but it is at least possible, if not likely, that the prosecution will seek to appeal that decision in Poland. Obviously I make no comment in this judgment about the sexual abuse allegations other than to note their existence. It is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to comment on the merits or veracity of those allegations. I have not conducted a fact finding hearing and no one has - at least yet - invited me to. I have not heard any oral evidence.</span></p>

I have not at the moment come to any conclusion about that and will hear submissions about it later as and when they may be appropriate. I am conscious of the fact that there are ongoing criminal proceedings in Poland against the father.</span></p>

She never returned to the UK with Lena. Lena was made a ward of court by the English courts and return orders were made initially by his Honour Judge Nathan on 18 September 2017 and then by Keehan J on 14 November 2017. The father also initiated Hague Convention proceedings in Poland. His application was dismissed by the Polish court on 6 December 2018 on the basis of Article 13(b) and Article 20. The father appealed that order but his appeal was dismissed on 27 May 2019 and thus it was that the Polish court declined to order Lena&#8217;s return.</span></p>

The mother did not appear at that hearing and nor was she represented. The deputy Judge rejected the suggestion that Article 20 was engaged by the Polish court but he found that he did have jurisdiction under Article 11. This led to the return order which was dated 18 July 2019 and which the mother now asks me to set aside.</span></p>

On 20 March 2022, so, four and a half years later, the Guardian applied to be discharged as a Guardian given the lack of progress in the High Court. By an order dated 30 June 2022, the Guardian was directed to file a position statement by 18 August setting out the discussion which she has had with mother and what are her recommendations to the court. This date was later extended by consent.</span></p>

The Guardian reports that Lena remembered going to Poland for a holiday with her mother and saying that she did not want to return to the UK when the holiday was ending. The Guardian reports that Lena said that she felt safer in Poland and she had family whom she could rely on there, especially maternal family. She told the Guardian that there was not anything that she misses about being in the UK. She described her father to the Guardian as a bad person and referred to him as harming her and someone that has made her suffer. She said that she did not want to be back in the care of her father. She told the Guardian she had been harmed by him to an extent that she is unable ever to forgive him. She said that she was unable to remember anything positive about her father.</span></p>

There is in these cases always a risk if a child is not reporting his or her own views but views that have been acquired by the parent who has sought to influence or sometimes they even brainwash a child into a particular position. Obviously, it is important that both of the parents hear me say this although it would be obvious to their legal advisers: I am unable to make any findings either way at this stage and I expressly do not need to do so and have not done so. It seems to me that these are the possibilities, either:</span></p>

I do not intend to return to England. I would rather kill myself than return there. I have provided my reasons in my conversation with [the Guardian] as well as before the specialists and courts in Poland. I will not return to the place where I was hurt. I do not want to go back to that. I want to live normally and forget about the things that happened to me. Here, I have plans for the future. I do not have anyone in England. I feel safe here. I will never return there. I ask the court to listen to me.&#8221;.</p>

Mr Langford said that he recognised that Lena could not live with her father at the moment given the investigation of the allegations to which I have referred above. I asked Mr Langford: how is it proposed in practical terms that Lena will be transferred to England? He said that if necessary the Polish authorities would arrange for police and social services to escort her to the airport.</span></p>

She also apparently has limited English although I note that she did spend the first few years of her life in England as set out in the chronology above, and I imagine would probably pick up the language again fairly easily.</span></p>

A full detailed note of our meeting has been taken by the Guardian&#8217;s solicitor and distributed to the parties and their advisers. The meeting took place online via Microsoft Teams and I understand there is also a recording of our meeting. I was immediately struck by Lena&#8217;s emotional intelligence and her warmth. She asked me the interesting question of whether the decisions that I have to make as a Family Division Judge weigh heavily on my conscience. It seemed to me that that was a remarkably mature question for a 13 year old girl to ask. I established with her that there was no one else in the room and I am satisfied that she was telling me the truth about that and that she was talking to me unprompted and telling me and asking me what she wanted to tell me and to ask me. I am satisfied with the questions that I have just referred to emanated from her as did all of the questions that she asked me, and I have no reason at all to suggest that she was put up to say anything that she said.</span></p>

Of course, I made it clear to her that I was not receiving evidence from her and I made it clear to her that I could not just wave a magic wand and make things happen that she wanted to happen. I explained of course to counsel, as they know only too well, that this was not in any sense an evidence-gathering process. It seems to me that if a young person - 13 years old in this case - asks to meet the Judge and look in the eye the person who is going to be making decisions about them, that it is a proper thing for a Judge to do and would, it seemed to me, to be rude of me not to have agreed to meet her. It was a very congenial meeting and I explained to Lena that I was impressed with the way that she put it that she wanted to meet the person that was going to make the decision about her. Lena was, if I may say so, a credit to each of her parents. She is obviously a delightful and intelligent young person.</span></p>

Mr Langford very reasonably told me that I should be very wary indeed of rewarding mother&#8217;s conduct in wrongfully retaining Lena in Poland. The floodgates argument is always likely to be of concern to any Judge in this type of case. However, the facts of this case are, I suggest, more than unusual. I am in the early Autumn of 2022 dealing with a return order that was made as long ago as 2017. Put another way, significantly more than a third of Lena&#8217;s life has passed since the first return order was made.</span></p>

It does not seem to me to provide a good reason for such a long delay in the father seeking to enforce the order, nor any explanation why he suddenly did apply for enforcement in March 2022. Having said all of that, I repeat my observation that limited importance should be given to the complaint by the mother that the father delayed enforcement when, as I have said, it was her own actions that brought the need for orders in the first place.</span></p>

When the child was three the couple travelled to Poland for a holiday. When the family was due to return to England the mother refused to do so retaining the child. The father returned to England alone but shortly afterwards issued Hague Convention proceedings. The Polish court accepted that there had been a wrongful retention but considered that the mother had established both that the father&#8217;s alcohol consumption posed a great risk in Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention and that the child then aged three years and eight months old objected to a return. The Polish court were bound to refuse to return the child having made no reference to Article 11(4) BIIR which provided that the court could not refuse to return the child under article 13(b) if adequate arrangements could be made to secure the child&#8217;s protection.</span></p>

That of course was the view taken by Theis J in the way that I have just set out. Professor George takes issue with this. He says that this provision does not confer any power on the court in this jurisdiction but merely provides that any return order properly made here shall be enforceable in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation, irrespective of the non-return order made in the other State. He says that an order for the return of the child must either be a specific issue order under section 8 of the Children Act or an order pursuant to the High Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction. He says that given that Lena was a Ward of Court prior to the making of these orders, it may be most likely that they are orders under the inherent jurisdiction. It was noted, he says, the order is also headed as being under the Children Act and as I have said, it is also headed as being under the Regulation.</span></p>

It is important that I remind myself that the Guardian initially was supportive of the return at the time when the application was made several years ago. The Guardian has changed her position. The Guardian&#8217;s position at this hearing is the return order should be set aside and that the proceedings in this jurisdiction should be concluded.</span></p>

And moreover, the Guardian raises the real likelihood of parental alienation of Lena by the mother against the father.&#8221;.</p>

The Guardian gave evidence to the court on that occasion supporting the order and was clear that such an order was in Lena&#8217;s best interests at that time.&#8221;.</p>

I have often been heard to say in this court &#8211; and there is nothing particularly original about it &#8211; that delay is the enemy of justice in most children cases. While I agree with what Ms Mitchell says, we are now three years on from the return order being made and I agree with her that the situation is now far more complex.</span></p>

There has never been a fact finding hearing in this jurisdiction. I have already referred to the almost impossible practical arrangements for Lena returning to the UK. She is a bright, articulate, 13 year old who has expressed the strongest views including a threat to kill herself. Now, I am not able to say whether that threat to kill herself was seriously intended but it is hard to think how an articulate, clever, 13 year old could make a frivolous threat to kill herself and I am not prepared to take the risk.</span></p>

And, at the end of the day, I have decided that whether I apply the lower test or the higher test to which I have referred in this Judgment, I find that the threshold on either test is very clearly met and it would be unsafe for me to make an order returning Lena to the jurisdiction of England.</span></p>

I go further than that. I would say that there is a really serious reason to believe that it would be detrimental and dangerous for Lena to be returned to England at this time and that it would be likely to cause her serious harm.</span></p>

I cannot see that it could possibly be consistent with her welfare interests to be returned to England in these circumstances. I am mindful, in saying this, that there is a serious possibility - I make no findings - that the mother has alienated or continued to try and alienate Lena from her father and we will have to have a discussion when I finish giving this Judgment and the parties have had time to reflect on it, as to what are the next steps and where those next steps should take place. Because the father, so far as I am concerned, may be entirely innocent of the allegations of which he has been charged, and the mother may have set about a comprehensive programme of alienation to try her very best to make Lena want never to see her father again. I am very alive to that and to the dreadful risks that that poses to Lena, but as I so often say in this court, my job is very often to balance risk and I find it impossible to say that it would be appropriate for Lena to be forced to return in the circumstances to which I have referred.</span></p>
