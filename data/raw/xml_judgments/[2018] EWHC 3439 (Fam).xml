It is legal to administer fertility treatment, and for a single or married woman to act as a surrogate.  Written surrogacy agreements are legal, and enforceable in Iran.   </p>

That document is, in Iran, an official deed and was notarised at the time of signing.  It constitutes a binding surrogacy agreement between the parties providing for the surrogate to carry the child conceived by way of embryo transplant.  In turn, the applicants agreed to pay various sums of money to meet her reasonable expenses and medical costs.   </p>

The applicants presented this certificate to the Registry of Births in Tehran, together with the notarised surrogacy agreement and other medical documents.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Iran is one of the few Islamic countries that permits surrogacy, it takes a relatively enlightened attitude towards the donation, for example, of third party eggs.  Most Sunni scholars, as opposed to Shiite, being the majority in Iran, take a different view about surrogacy, introducing, as it were, the sperm of a man into the uterus of a woman to whom he is not married.  Those difficulties do not arise in this case.  Sperm donation in fertility treatment is not permitted. </p>

The intended mother is recognised as the child&#8217;s legal mother and the birth certificate is issued under the names of the intended mother and her husband.  The egg donation must not incur a cost.  The intended parents must be the same religion as the egg donor.  I am told that currently about 2,000 children a year are born via surrogacy in Tehran alone, and that there are over 70 registered fertility clinics. </p>

I note that their services involve the medical and psychological screening of surrogates and intended parents, and the clinic helps the parties agree to and prepare a free surrogacy contract, similar to the one which appears in this case. </p>
