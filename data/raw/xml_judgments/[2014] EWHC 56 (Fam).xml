	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">10 October 2013: an ordinary afternoon in a typical County Court. Her Honour Judge Roberts is giving a judgment in Southend County Court. She has been hearing a family dispute between Simon Abraham Ramet and his former wife about his contact with their son, who is only a few weeks short of his thirteenth birthday. The mother is represented. The father is appearing in person. For the three human beings involved, the mother, the father and their son, the matter is intensely important. What, after all, can be more important than a parent&#8217;s contact with their child and the child&#8217;s contact with their parent? For the outsider all I need add is that the litigation has been going on for much of the time since the parents separated in 2003. That must be very distressing for the family. For anyone concerned with or concerned about the family justice system it is very depressing.</p>

My comments received much publicity at the time. How much has changed? A coruscating judgment by McFarlane LJ in September last year, <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1104" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1104" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1104</ref>, would suggest to the pessimist the answer &#8220;not much&#8221; and even to the optimist &#8220;not enough&#8221;. Something must be done. A recent report by a Working Group chaired by Cobb J, <span style="font-style:italic">Report to the President of the Family Division of the Private Law Working Group</span>, is at present the subject of consultation and urgent consideration. With its proposal for a <span style="font-style:italic">Child Arrangements Programme </span>to replace the current <span style="font-style:italic">Private Law Programme</span>, it maps out a radically different approach. I am determined to implement the necessary reforms as soon as possible this year.</p>

On 28 November 2013 Mr Ramet appeared before me, represented by Mr Anthony Jerman of counsel.

Despite the fact that there could never be any issue of identification or what you did, the guidelines lay down that you are entitled to credit for your guilty plea. You have not chosen to put your former wife through giving evidence. Your guilty plea shows remorse. Your guilty plea has saved a considerable amount of court&#8217;s time and public expense.

There is a considerable presence by way of security, if necessary. Family proceedings cannot operate in that way. The family court cannot operate in that way. It is, of its very nature, less structured, somewhat less formal, and in cases where the emotional temperature is inevitably high. Parties are going to be in close proximity to each other. That increases the risk of matters such as that which occurred on this occasion happening. It also increases the responsibility of people involved in such proceedings to keep their emotions in trim, to act with appropriate dignity, not to lose their temper and the court will always act by way of deterrent sentences to ensure that proceedings which needs to be conducted in a proper dignified and non-violent matter.  Where they are interrupted, the courts will act entirely appropriately to punish those who act in that way.&#8221;</p>

I agree with Judge Lodge that deterrent sentences are justified in such cases, so as to ensure, insofar as the law can, both that the proper administration of justice is not impeded and that persons attending the court can do so without fear. Where there is serious violence &#8211; such as would amount to actual bodily harm or worse &#8211; consideration should be given, as in the present case, to inviting the appropriate authorities to consider bringing criminal proceedings in the Crown Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one final matter to which I must draw attention. As I have already mentioned, there were difficulties in serving Mr Ramet because he was in prison. Service was eventually effected by the expedient of having him brought to the Royal Courts of Justice on 7 November 2013 pursuant to a production order and served by the Tipstaff. Mr Jerman tells me on instructions that the papers were removed from Mr Ramet on his return to prison and not returned to him until a day or two before the hearing on 28 November 2013. He also tells me that there were, despite what I had said in court on that occasion, difficulties in arranging access in prison to Mr Ramet by his legal team, with the consequence that proper instructions could not be taken until Mr Ramet&#8217;s arrival at court on 17 December 2013. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Recognising that I have not thought it appropriate to conduct any kind of investigation into these matters, and that I accordingly have only one side of the story, I must nonetheless record my concerns. Prisoners have a constitutional right of access to the court, the obstruction of which may be a contempt of court: <span style="font-style:italic">Raymond v Honey</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1983] 1 AC 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">[1983] 1 AC 1</ref>. Mr Ramet was facing penal proceedings before me: denial of access to the papers which the court itself, acting by the Tipstaff, had served on him and preventing adequate access to his lawyers, if indeed that is what happened, are very serious matters. I trust there will be no future occasion when I have to express such concerns.  </p>
