Given a continuing level of medical concern (which did not vitiate  the ability of the hearing to proceed) I agreed to hear the balance of FF&#8217;s evidence  on a remote basis.

The children&#8217;s guardian supports the  Applicant in asking for findings to be made against FF. FF denies the allegations  and asks me to find all the alleged points not proven. GG has taken a neutral  approach to the hearing but by the point of submissions considered the evidence  against FF &#8216;troubling&#8217; and had ended their relationship.</span></p>

She said she  was not worried about giving her evidence and said she would have remembered  if FF had physically abused S and she would tell 100% as there is a child who needs  protecting. FF had discussed deleting messages, he would want her phone to be  &#8216;clean&#8217; and would ask for screen shots or would want to check the phone. Her  phone was password protected and she did not think he knew the password. FF  had known S all her life and she had no issues leaving S with him. She didn&#8217;t think  he would go further than fantasising. She had sent an erotic picture to FF but it  was for his benefit alone. FF had been with her on the day she was arrested.

She had led both DD/FF into believing this.  She agreed the reference to a trip to a field was linked to DD. She agreed she was  cross/angry with FF who had led her on. She would always be angry with him for  what he did and he could go to hell. She agreed she had lied to the police when  first arrested. Everything she said in interview was false and self serving. She had  sent  pictures  of  her  children.  She  had  lied  to  the  Family  Court  about  her  relationships and the messaging. She agreed she had opposed FF&#8217;s application to  set aside the findings notwithstanding the finding made against FF was not  correct on her account. She had not opposed his application as she was angry.  This was not about getting her parole. She had discussed a threesome with FF but  it had not happened and she had never been on the &#8216;Ashley Maddison&#8217; app. She  thought the threesome idea was another fantasy. She had not had a threesome  with a female with the tag &#8216;sexybear&#8217; and the letter &#8216;S&#8217; did not refer to her. It was  wrong to suggest her relationship with FF started in 2017, it was when she was  15 and her sister heavily pregnant. She disagreed his reaction on Boxing Day  supports his case that he was disgusted by what he saw. He went off the rails  because he was jealous.  </span></p>

She had little if any knowledge of the same. The information she had about FF&#8217;s  relationship with her sister was third party. He had admitted a one-night stand  but no more. She had not been aware of the suggestion this had started much  earlier in 2010 until after CC had been arrested. She had understood FF was giving  CC emotional support and no more. As regards her own relationship with FF this  was very on/off after he cheated. The relationship had continued in an effort for  the children but both of them had &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">one foot out of the door</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">&#8217;. She agreed herself,  FF and their children had moved in with CC in the couple of weeks up to the Boxing  Day incident following a disagreement with FF&#8217;s parents whilst they were living  with them. They had then moved out following the situation with DD (the penis  photo) but also after CC had claimed she had a sexual relationship with FF. EE had  a gut feeling about this but her brother had told her he felt this was CC trying to  split her and FF up. As regards the photo/message FF had claimed to have seen,  she had understood it was related to DD&#8217;s daughter. She didn&#8217;t recall how he had  come to have the phone but FF had told her and her brother about it by which  time the phone had disappeared. He had not said it was inappropriate but this  was the sense she had from what was being said. FF had not described what he  had seen. She had been concerned and that is why she had wanted to see the  phone. She had a gut feeling but was unsure if this was FF trying to split up DD/CC.  When taken to FF&#8217;s description of what he had seen she told me this didn&#8217;t ring  any  bells  with  her.  He  had  not  told  her  the  detail  but  it  was  something  inappropriate. She left and he stayed. After this he would visit to see the kids and  they would sleep together sometimes. EE didn&#8217;t know what cuckolding was and  was not interested in threesomes or S&amp;M. She was aware FF was interested in  threesomes  and  he  had  tried  to  persuade  her  but  she  wasn&#8217;t  comfortable.  </span></p>

She had not learnt this from AA. She had known about the plan to speak to W  about safety work but she had not been directly involved. During this time W had  made no allegations against FF. She spoke about contact between FF and their  children. At first W had given the impression that she was enjoying the contact  but it was not going well and she would say things about not feeling comfortable.  She agreed FF had said he had not been having contact due to S having made  allegations. W had asked questions but she had said she did not know  the  specifics. Subsequent to contact ending W had asked about updates, this had  been both before and after W made her allegation, but EE&#8217;s response had been  non-committal. The last contact had upset W when Z could be heard in the  background. W&#8217;s troubling behaviour has been going on for years with outbursts  and defiant behaviour. It has included telling lies but this was not significant until  a few years ago.

By the end of the conversation  she was convinced the allegations were not true and that the police had looked  into it. She was clear the allegation was made by a child and had understood the  only  evidence  was  what  the  child  had  said.  FF  had  told  her  about  being  interviewed and receiving the letter from the police. She was shocked and initially  felt this was a mistake [i.e. the allegations were not correct] as the criminal side  had found nothing. In respect of updating her views she wanted to hear all the  evidence before making up her mind and did not want to simply rely on what FF  might  tell  her.  They  had  spoken  about  the  text  messaging  but  she  did  not  understand what they meant and they were heavily redacted. FF&#8217;s explanations  appeared plausible. He explained this was about a threesome and the Ashley  Maddison app. GG confirmed she had used the same app once with FF when they  had been joined by a third party male. She explained the circumstances in which  a process server had attended her property and searched her bedroom. FF had  told her about the one-night stand with CC which he said was a mistake which he  regretted. He didn&#8217;t say he slept in the same bed as S. He said words to the effect  he was disgusted by what had happened. She was aware of the allegations made  by W. FF had denied S&#8217;s allegations and said W was lying because of Z as she did  not want FF to see Z if W could not see FF. She was confused by the text messaging  but after speaking to FF she could see where he was coming from. She still felt  she wanted to hear the evidence before making her mind up.  </span></p>

This had arisen by way of an act of revenge after EE  had cheated on him. This was in January 2017 and it was untrue to suggest they  had slept together either in 2010/11 or 2015. His relationship with CC lasted  between January-April 2017. He had led CC on with false promises about setting  up a family together. The last time they had sex was in November 2017. He told  me that he had limited knowledge or dealings with DD. He did not know DD had  a sexual interest in children. He denied abusing S and said he was never left alone  with her. He spoke about the messaging and told me he had encouraged a  threesome with CC and had used the Ashley Maddison app. This was what he was  referring to in the messaging. The letter S was a reference to the tag name of the  person who joined them. As to W he explained about how contact had been going  well including with W but it came to an end when W became upset when it was  apparent Z was also in the room. There is no truth in the allegation made by W.  He could not explain why the allegation was made save that it was related to  jealousy around contact issues.  </span></p>

I will summarise the key  components here but will return to detail in my analysis below. He spoke about  his relationship with S being a uncle relationship in which he loved her like an  uncle and described limited physical interaction. He was horrified when he was  arrested for raping her. He had first become aware there might be a suggestion  CC was a paedophile after her arrest. He dealt with the Boxing Day argument and  explained how he had taken CC&#8217;s phone to check it when he came upon the  photograph in question. It was a picture of an erect penis with small pants. He  had spoken to EE and her brother and said he was uncertain if it was adult or  child&#8217;s underwear. His concern was that they were small pants. EE&#8217;s account of  what he said was false as DD didn&#8217;t have a daughter. They decided to leave due  to the concern about this. He had told EE what he told the Court. He later moved  in with CC between January &#8211; April 2017. He had accepted CC&#8217;s explanation about  the photo and hadn&#8217;t understood he was seeing something paedophilic. He noted  he had reported being told by the brother that CC/DD had sex with S in the bed.  He thought this was &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">probably not a good thing</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">&#8217; and inappropriate. He didn&#8217;t  understand the question when it was put this would be sexually abusive. He  couldn&#8217;t remember if he spoke to CC about it. When asked he agreed this might  have been to sexualise her and distort her boundaries. When he moved into the  house he wasn&#8217;t thinking about the photo or S being in bed with DD/CC, instead  he was thinking about being homeless. He agreed these were the first matters in  respect of which he had been arrested and knew things were serious. In police  interview he was embarassed and was not forthcoming. He and CC did interact  sexually by videocall. He suggested he was not forthcoming entirely about the  threesome due to embarassment and due to worry as to the further questions his  answers might lead to. He denied the suggestion of a threesome was a lie to cover  up the truth of abuse.  </span></p>

It wasn&#8217;t because he had made  this all up since. The messages were not about abusing S. He was then asked  questions as to the detail of the meeting with &#8216;sexybear&#8217;. He explained how this  had come about via the Ashley Maddison app and gave answers to various  questions  around  the  process  of  locating  someone  for  this  threesome.  He  detailed the events of that threesome which was more about foreplay than actual  sex. &#8216;Sexybear&#8217; had arrived around 10-11pm and left around 7-9am the next  morning. When asked for details he said he thought her real name was Sarah. He  understood S was being cared for by the neighbour that night. He was then asked  about subsequent messaging which he had suggested related to &#8216;sexybear&#8217;. He  denied this did not fit with the individual he had described and said it made sense  to him and that he had been both messaging and telephoning CC and so she  understood  what  he  was  sending.  He  suggested  CC  was  now  calling  him  a  paedophile because she hated him and felt if she could not be around children  then nor should he. When asked about the similar messaging to DD (the &#8216;boob&#8217;  message) he felt CC was stealing ideas they had and putting it into something  disgusting. He denied he had seen S sucking CC&#8217;s nipple. He interpreted &#8216;Pref  Under A&#8217; as preferably underneath and explained the error was due to a typing  error. He was asked about the appearance of sado-mascochistic elements to the  messaging with CC but was unable to shed much light on these entries. He  disagreed he was a sexual sadist. He disagreed he had asked for a photo of S and  got  upset  when  CC  did  not  provide  the  same.  C  P  was  not  child  porn  but  cuckolding porn and threesomes. He agreed a reference to &#8216;Sxxx&#8217; was to S. He  explained one message should have read &#8216;happier&#8217; whereas &#8216;tighter&#8217; had been  wrongly typed and that this had not been confusing for CC due to the fact they  were also in telephone communication at the same point in time. He denied  sexual abuse of S and that the messages were describing the same. He was asked  about his knowledge of computers and deleting files. He denied inappropriate  sexual activity with the child into whose home he moved when younger or to the  two sisters of CC/EE who were said to have made allegations. He was asked about  the factory reset on his computer but denied having done this to cover his tracks.  He denied W&#8217;s allegations.  </span></p>

I have weighed up  all the evidence with care and approached aspects of the evidence with caution  but  have  found  the  evidence  to  be  clear  and  cogent.  At  the  heart  of  my  conclusion are very clear findings as to messaging created by FF and which is  telling against him. On any reasoned and balanced assessment this messaging  can lead to only one conclusion. But these points are also supported by other  aspects of the evidence which, although I might have been more cautious  reaching conclusions upon them alone, fit closely with the surrounding evidence  and support the conclusion I have reached. I have naturally weighed up with  care the points which are said to have balanced against such a finding. I have to  say such evidence is scarce on the ground and is at best ambigious as to the  direction in which it points. I have indeed struggled to identify any evidence  (beyond FF&#8217;s denials) which objectively and reasonably casts doubt on my  finding. For reasons which I give below I gave the most careful consideration to  the evidence given by FF. I found his evidence unimpressive and at points  incredible and wholly unreliable. To make sense the surrounding evidence had  to be pulled out of shape to fit with his account. I simply did not believe FF for  one moment as to his evidence concerning this allegation.</span></p>

In my assessment this question substantially finds its answer in  an assessment of the messaging between CC and FF. In simple terms if S had never  made allegations against FF the messaging would remain damning against him  (insofar as the question is: Is FF a paedophile)? It is what is known about CC and  DD and what has arisen out of the S&#8217;s allegations that has placed a focus on this  messaging.

I note and agree that this must be understood in  the context of FF being interviewed twice on the subject. It is clear from  his  evidence  that  the  &#8216;threesome&#8217;  was  something  he  continued  to  remember and yet he wholly refused to provide the account that would  meet the challenges put to him.  </span></p>

I listened to FF&#8217;s explanation that this was  about embarassment and the potential that it might get him in deeper  trouble with EE. I found this explanation unsatisfactory. Most importantly  FF had by that point in the police interview travelled far beyond matters  of simple threesomes in the information he provided to the Police. It  simply does not make sense to say that he did not identify &#8216;S&#8217; out of some  sense of embarassment. He had already stated an interest in a threesome  to the police. On what basis could confirmation of achieving the same be  so embarassing as to get in the way of giving an exculpatory account? It  is implausible to claim he did not give a fulsome answer because to do so  would have led to further questions given that not to do so inevitably led  to problematic conclusions being drawn.  </span></p>

When he did in fact give his explanation it  was simply unbelievable. It may be that this factored into his reticence in  giving a similar false account to the police.  </span></p>

Having listened to FF&#8217;s  account I was left with the sense I was not being given a remembered  account of an event at which FF was an active participant but rather a  theoretical account of how one would arrange a threesome and how it  might thereafter proceed. FF on being questioned gave me no confidence  he was recalling an event in which he had taken part. I agree with the  Applicant that there was a strong sense of the account being made up as  he went along. FF variously spoke of &#8216;what one would do&#8217;; he seemed to  have no recollection of the stranger to the threesome despite this being  something he had worked on for some period of time and despite being  in  the  company  of  &#8216;sexybear&#8217;  for  about  10  hours;  having  intimate  relations with her and eating breakfast together before she left. I note it  was clear there was no suggestion of his memory being affected by either  drink or drugs. FF could not even remember what colour &#8216;sexybear&#8217;s&#8217; hair  was. Courts often talk in terms of the an account having the ring of truth.  FF&#8217;s account of this event did not have anything of the sort.  </span></p>

FF maintained this was about  &#8216;sexybear&#8217; despite on his account this only happening once. In the same  short  conversation  he  wrote  of  &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">You  know  when  last  time  woke  up  cuddling S in the morning with you watching over&#8230;felt like it meant  something, felt like home</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">&#8217;. Again this simply did not make sense in the  context of &#8216;sexybear&#8217; whereas it did in the context of S.

Again this was referenced to &#8216;sexybear&#8217; but simply did not fit with the  timelines of her suggested involvement with the couple. Elsewhere FF  wrote of CC holding S like a baby. The obvious point was made how could  this be CC holding another adult. In simple terms whilst one might give  the benefit of the doubt to an isolated text which might be out of context  in this case the reliance on &#8216;sexybear&#8217; as &#8216;S&#8217; strained the evidence beyond  breaking point.  </span></p>

As  previously noted FF accepts much of the messaging about &#8216;S&#8217; was sexual in nature  and reflected sexual interest on  his part.  That this is clearly S leads  to  the  irresistible inference as to paedophilic interests. For the avoidance of doubt were  FF to have denied the messaging was sexual in nature I would have reached the  conclusion it was. It is plain beyond doubt that S was a source of sexual interest  to FF. Perhaps the most obvious illustration of this is the &#8216;boob&#8217; messaging in  which  FF  is  plainly  writing  about  this  &#8216;being  hot&#8217;  and  finding  what  he  has  seen/been told about it sexually exciting. If as is plain this is about &#8216;S&#8217; (as FF agrees  it was albeit on the basis &#8216;S&#8217; was sexybear) then FF is describing being sexually  aroused by S in a sexualised setting sucking her mother&#8217;s breast. Boiling this point  down to the bare essential I agree the messaging is in a sense referable to a  threesome, in that it included three individuals, however the third party to the  suggested act is a child, S not an adult &#8216;sexybear&#8217;.  </span></p>

I disagree.  Although FF may have previously sought to have made such a point, in his  evidence before me he equivocated as to whether the image was in fact indicative  of child abuse at all. It is difficult in that context to take from the event a clear  expression of disgust as to the same. But, and in any event, having regard to all  the evidence I have reached the conclusion that this event should be assessed in  a different way. I have to say I found the evidence of FF surrounding how he came  to check the phone most unlikely. He suggested the phone was checked in the  sense of a joke to embarrass CC by looking to find information as to DD. However,  by  the  end  of  the  evidence  FF  agreed  he  had  probably  started  a  sexual  relationship with CC by that date. I put to one side the suggestion that this started  much earlier. I consider it much more likely FF was seeking to check CC&#8217;s phone  for his own reasons and did come across a photo which was very evidently  improper in suggesting paedophilic interests. In my assessment FF&#8217;s emotions  were not disgust but rather a likely combination of upset with CC (that she was  engaging with DD) and concern (that CC was creating a situation in which FF might  end up vulnerable &#8211; as he eventually did when her messaging was discovered). As  the Applicant contends, and I agree, this was part of a picture which plainly fixed  FF  with  knowledge  that  the  household  into  which  he  then  moved  included  worrying evidence of child abuse (by this I mean evidence that CC&#8217;s boyfriend was  sending pictures of his penis and children&#8217;s underwear and the information which  </span></p>

I consider by this evidence CC was distancing herself from the reality of her  actions. I do not intend to go beyond the clear conclusions reached by the  sentencing judge as set out earlier in this judgment. For my part I do not reject  the notion that part of this behaviour was CC allowing S to be abused to maintain  the  relationship  with  DD.  She  understood  DD&#8217;s  desires  and  treated  S  as  a  commodity that  could be used  to keep him.  CC was willing to sacrifice her  daughter to achieve this goal. CC gave clear and it seemed compelling evidence  as to the interaction between her own needs and how these could be met by  allowing the abuse of S.  </span></p>

On his own evidence FF appears to accept that he &#8216;strung CC along&#8217; by painting a  future picture of them together as a family. I have already referred to the message  about waking up and it feeling like home. There is within the evidence significant  support for the position that contrary to his actual feelings FF was allowing CC to  develop a sense of emotional dependency on him. This might aptly be described  as a form of grooming but for the fact that CC was already more than willing to  permit her daughter to be abused. One can see FF taking an approach which  varied between encouragement and bullying/coercion. The message about the  clothing being super glued is at the bullying end. It is difficult to convey in a  judgment but my reading of the messages paints a clear picture of FF by a mix of  methods pushing and coaxing/encouraging CC towards an ultimate point at which  S might be available for him. As is plain from the previous section CC was in many  ways an open-door to such pressures and it was likely she would facilitate the  same to preserve a relationship.</span></p>

This is not simply a case of CC being  &#8216;strung along&#8217;. It is clear to me she was placing some emphasis on the potential  for this relationship to her future and this explains in part her strong antagonism  to FF now. Within the later messaging from November 2017 one can see her  feelings about being let down writ large.  </span></p>

In simple terms it is because I find CC felt able to confirm  the reality of the messaging as paedophilic in nature (i) without harming her own  position whilst (ii) obtaining pay-back against FF. I agree she harbours deep  resentment against him but the messaging allowed her to activate this without  any need to falsify an account. She could simply rely on what she knew had  transpired to obtain this outcome. As with FF the alternative would have been to  seek to create a false narrative around plain and obvious messaging. She had no  need to stretch the truth to achieve this goal and I find from her perspective  honesty on this aspect of the case is likely to come without any perceived material  costs.  </span></p>

First, it would require her to further  confront the level to which she went in abusing S to meet her own needs. I have  little doubt CC has now settled on an internal narrative in which she is also a victim  (which to some extent she may be but it pales in significant when once considers  the  abuse  of  S)  of  the  men  around  her.  In  this  narrative  she  continues  to  equivocate as to her responsibility seeing the abuse of S as being part of DD&#8217;s  sexual interests (but not hers) and in which she was simply feeding a sexual  fantasy. To accept a similar pattern of actual abuse occurred with FF would be  problematic. Secondly, though is the fact that CC was not sentenced for abuse  involving FF. To accept the same now would not only likely impact on her hopes  re parole but might open her to further prosecution. Whilst I appreciate the  evidence from CC that she had not taken legal advice as to her evidence it seems  to me a reasonable inference that she would be able to distinguish betwee the  risks of admitting to thought-crime with FF and actual crime with FF.</span></p>

My assessment is  as set out above. In reaching this  conclusion I have reflected on the evidence of the messaging which paints an  equivalent picture against CC as it does against FF although it is perhaps only right  to note that FF appears to more proactive of the couple with CC as the facilitator  of abuse.  </span></p>

This poses a real  problem for FF once, as I have, I reject the notion that S is &#8216;sexybear&#8217; but is in fact  a child. Simply put, too much of the messaging is as to what has happened rather  than what might happen.  </span></p>

In summary this  was (a) that I am not bound to assume that the rest of the description of those  events within the messaging are accurate but must have regard to whether the  balance might all be fantasy, and; (b) that in any event I must consider whether a  false narrative around &#8216;sexybear&#8217; was one of a number of lies designed to cover  up sexual fantasy (alone) regarding S. Counsel urged me to conclude the best  approach would to be reject the account concerning &#8216;sexybear&#8217; in totality rather  than rely on parts of the account only whilst rejecting other parts.  </span></p>

In  this  case  I  consider  FF&#8217;s  reasoning  has  proceeded on the basis he needs an explanation for messaging which otherwise  suggests actual abuse of S. To resolve this he has latched upon the idea of  &#8216;sexybear&#8217; but this is simply to replace the participant in the event not to change  the physical quality of the event. So we see (below) it is &#8216;sexybear&#8217; who sucked  CC&#8217;s nipple not S. I do not consider rejection of &#8216;sexybear&#8217; means the whole event  falls away. The much safer and logical conclusion is that &#8216;sexybear&#8217; alone falls  away to be replaced with S. This is because &#8216;sexybear&#8217; was simply a device to hide  the involvement of S.  </span></p>

The  conclusion I have drawn from this mixed messaging is that whereas DD was  informed about what had happened FF witnessed the event happening. I consider  it likely this was experienced remotely and this is perhaps why, due to technical  limitations, why it was only him and not DD who witnessed the event. But it seems  to me clear FF is detailing something he has experienced. There is nothing in his  messaging which would suggest it was otherwise. For instance he doesn&#8217;t seek  for it to be repeated or suggest he would have like to have been there. He doesn&#8217;t  ask for pictures or video. Rather he talks about </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">&#8216;it was (</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">being)</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000"> hot</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">&#8217;.

It is clear to me  that FF is asking about whether S or CC would trust enough to allow cream to be  put on. It is far from clear on what basis this question could have an otherwise  innocent explanation. The reference to &#8216;do something with S on Friday&#8217; is plainly  a reference to a sexualised act.   </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.14in;margin-right:1.33in"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial;color:#000000"/><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">My conclusions on the above messaging [&#167;76-77] is as follows. The messaging in  &#167;76 are communications which are planning towards an opportunity to engage in  actual child abuse of S that forthcoming weekend. Whilst I cannot be confident  as to the timeline my sense of the messaging is that matters had been escalating  over the preceding period and by then had reached the point where S was being  actively abused (the boob message) in pursuit of CC and FF&#8217;s shared sexual  interest in children. The subsequent messaging intended to take the interest  forward with abuse in the physical presence of FF. Whilst I do not have direct  messaging which details what did or did not take place in the following period I  am satisfied the August messages reads back to the earlier period. The reference  to &#8216;c p&#8217; is as before ambigious as to &#8216;child porn&#8217; or &#8216;child paedophilia&#8217; or an  equivalent phrase but I am confident that this is the sense of the abbreviation. It  is not a reference to cuckolding porn which is broadly interpreted as a man who  obtains pleasure by watching their female partner engage in sexual activity with  another man. Importantly here FF is writing that he doesn&#8217;t want to do anymore  of this which suggests he has by this point acted in this manner. It could be argued  this might be limited to fantasy or talk. I disagree and consider the subsequent  messaging makes this clear. In November the messaging is more explicit and  sends a clear signal. I find CC and FF are talking about what they have done to S  in the previous period and FF is explicitly comparing S&#8217;s vagina by comparison to  another child and commenting that it is &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">tighter</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">&#8217; perhaps because they treated  her too nicely. This is a plain reference to actual abuse involving S&#8217;s vagina. I do  not need to spell out the obvious meaning beyond that. It is not about her being  damaged to a lesser degree because she was not actually abused. The final part  of the messaging proves this point with the comment that &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">[S] pleased [FF] more  than [CC]&#8230;</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">&#8217;. In the context of the surrounding messaging this can only be a  reference to sexual pleasure and FF </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">having been </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">pleasured. Again the point being  made is tolerably clear.  </span></p>

It is a focused document which deserves careful  consideration. I have just explained why it is that I consider I can rely upon S as  part  of  my  overall  evaluation  despite  the  manner  in  which  the  evidence  developed and the circumstances in which it was obtained. I accept S does not  specifically  make  reference  to  abuse  which  can  be  found  in  the  messaging  between CC and FF. But there are messages which can be associated with the  abuse claimed by S. A prime example is the messaging around &#8216;hurting&#8217; and  &#8216;tighter&#8217; which speak of a set of circumstances not materially distant from the  allegation made by S in her picture referred to during the hearing. I do not know  why the DD messaging is more explicit than the FF messaging. It could be a  function of the available opportunity to CC/FF for non-messaging communication  during the relevant periods; it could be a function of FF&#8217;s caution and as suggested  by CC his prompting that all messages are deleted. I can only speculate but I do  not consider the absence of explicit messages detailing what has just happened  to S to be significant given the available evidence. I am also not particularly  persuaded  by  the  suggestion  that  the  absence  of  a  close  link  with  DD  is  significance. There is no reason why there should be a close link. The sense of the  evidence is that CC was playing off two men at the same time rather than joining  them together (see the boob messaging). For this reason I do not think the  messaging between DD and CC on 11 August 2017 has any real probative value to  the issues confronting me. For CC to be telling DD that she has not carried out any  further abuse for some time tells me very little if anything as to whether she has  </span></p>

There are surrounding circumstances relating to W  which cause me to pause and create doubt in my mind.

Having  regard  to  [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">removed  to  preserve  anonymity</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';color:#000000">]  issues  and  behavioural  concerns surrounding W I am wary as to whether these allegations flow from  unrelated points unknown to me. The evidence in regard to this allegation is of a  different order and is otherwise uncorroborated (other than by the fact of the S  allegations). Weighing up all the arguments I am not satisfied.  </span></p>

It is largely onto  his shoulders that the preparation for this case has fallen, as has its maintenance  throughout the proceedings. I can well imagine this will have required work well  beyond normal expectations. I have previously commented as to the efforts he  has made in ensuring videos are available in the proper format but this is only  part of the exceptional effort he has brought to the case. It is only right and proper  that I should recognise high quality work when it is found. I would ask leading  counsel to ensure these comments are forwarded to the head of legal services at  the local authority.  </span></p>
