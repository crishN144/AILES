Insofar as I am able to ascertain P&#8217;s likely views at all, they are said to emerge from a discussion between the Official Solicitor&#8217;s agent, Ms. McKendry, and H on Tuesday 24 June;  H thought that if one could ask P now what her wishes would be, he thought she would say that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">probably when it came to the last</span>&#8221; she &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">should be allowed to sink into death</span>&#8221;.

By the time of the hearing, her position had modified again; it appears (from a discussion with Dr. Bell on 22 June 2014, which I am told is accurate) that she recognised that her mother is in a terminal phase of her life, and would want her mother&#8217;s last days to be spent in &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a nice environment</span>&#8221;; she accepted that physical resuscitation manoeuvres would be inappropriate but would want her mother to have relief from discomfort or distress.   </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">S has been, until the morning of this final hearing, the main opponent of the Trust&#8217;s application, and the apparent spokesperson for the family.  He is angry at what he perceives to be sub-standard care delivered to his mother-in-law in Ivy Dene Nursing Home and Darlington Memorial Hospital; he has filed a statement in which he bluntly accuses the care staff of failing to discharge their professional duty.   It appears from the totality of the documents filed (including limited <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span> correspondence) that he and his solicitor have devoted significant time and energy into collating evidence for a potential civil action, which I cannot but observe has detracted a little from the key issues engaged in these proceedings.  No one doubts S&#8217;s love and concern for P; it is not said that he is otherwise than sincerely and genuinely trying to do what is best for P.  As the hearing began yesterday, I was advised that he would no longer oppose the application.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The salient background chronology can be summarised thus.  On 9 April 2014 P was admitted to Hospital in Darlington from the Ivy Dene Nursing Home with raised sodium levels and infected pressure ulcers on her feet.  She was unable to communicate verbally and was believed to be suffering osteomyelitis, the effects of dehydration, and fixed flexion deformity.  Later that evening P was transferred onto a ward, where she was treated over the following weeks.   The records show that P had fluctuating levels of consciousness with increased periods of sleepiness.  S considers that P showed higher levels of consciousness and responsiveness in this period than the records or the clinicians attest to.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">On 7 May 2014, Dr Nini (Consultant Geriatrician) assessed P, identifying her frailty and cognitive and functional decline over the previous few years.  Dr Nini advised that cardiopulmonary resuscitation would not be in P&#8217;s best interests in the event of a continuing decline in her health, and opined that should such treatment be successful it would be more detrimental than beneficial for her given the likelihood of ongoing vascular incidences to the brain and worsening life quality.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">A little over a week later, P appeared to suffer a decline.  Following a CT scan, it was believed that a further cerebral vascular event had occurred.  P became less responsive. Dr. Bell confirmed that he concurred with the view that P had suffered a further stroke. On the following day, 16 May 2014, a &#8216;Best Interest&#8217; meeting took place at the hospital involving Dr Cowie, Consultant Respiratory Physician with General Medicine, Peter Duffy the charge nurse, other representatives from the hospital and the nursing home together with P&#8217;s husband, daughter and son-in-law.  The family were keen for P to return to Ivy Dene Nursing Home.  Dr Cowie states (in his written evidence) that the clinicians advised at that meeting that resuscitation in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest would not be in P&#8217;s best interests &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">and indeed would be detrimental should she survive, given her overall cognitive and physical decline</span>&#8221;. As indicated above, D indicated her consent to the DNR procedure at the meeting, a view which she subsequently retracted.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The family wish P to move from Darlington Memorial Hospital to another residential resource, which I have referred to (a pseudonym for the purposes of this judgment) as &#8216;The Elms&#8217;.  I am told that the CCG will fund such a placement.  There are potent arguments for and against such a move.  Dr. Bell discusses these at &#167;6.3 and 6.4 of his report, indicating that in his view such a move would be &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not ideal</span>&#8221;; he amplified his reasoning in his oral evidence yesterday highlighting two particular reasons for not moving P:</p>

Secondly, the benefits to P of being cared for by staff who have accumulated a repository of knowledge and experience of her will be lost; there is a risk that subtle indicators of P&#8217;s comfort/discomfort may be lost at a critical stage of her life.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The family wish to be able to visit P in a setting which they find more welcoming and accommodating.  They say, understandably, that this would benefit P herself.  Dr. Bell recognised the force of this contrary argument; Dr. Bell wished to emphasise that he was not being &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">absolutist</span>&#8221; about his view, though felt that ideally she should not be moved.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">There are, or may well be, other argument for and against moving P at this stage of her life, but (as I indicated to the parties at the hearing) I do not propose to make a declaration about the issue of a move.  Now that the two key decisions on which the court&#8217;s adjudication was sought have been resolved, a decision should now be taken by the clinicians in consultation with the family; I encourage those making the decision to do so swiftly, taking account of the points raised above.  Dr. Bell encourages the involvement of a palliative care specialist in any transfer, and as a lead in any follow-up post-transfer.  In this respect, Dr. Nicholson would be the obvious candidate.  Dr. Bell further recommends a palliative care package at &#167;6.5 and &#167;6.6 which should be respected in the event of transfer.  The Trust acknowledges all of these points.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">That principle, in &#167;43 above, emerges from the judgment of Lady Hale in the Aintree case (<span style="font-style:italic">Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust &#8211;v- James</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 3 WLR 1299" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 3 WLR 1299</ref>).  The Supreme Court there considered the issue of withholding further life sustaining treatment in the context of a patient lacking capacity holding that the fundamental question is whether it would be in the patient&#8217;s best interests, and therefore lawful, to have the treatment, and if the treatment was not in the patient&#8217;s best interests the Court would not be able to give consent on the patient&#8217;s behalf. Whilst &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the starting point is a strong presumption that it is in a person&#8217;s best interests to stay alive &#8230; this is not absolute. There are cases where it will not be in a patient&#8217;s best interests to receive life-sustaining treatment</span>&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">per </span>Lady Hale at para 35).</p>
