The mother of the children is represented by Ms Lorraine Cavanagh of Queen&#8217;s Counsel and Ms Niamh Ross of counsel.  The children&#8217;s father is Mr X.  He does not appear before the court and is not represented.  The children&#8217;s putative special guardians, Mrs Z and her husband, Mr Y, are represented by Ms Elizabeth Isaacs of Queen&#8217;s Counsel and Ms Yvonne Healing of counsel.

However, prior to the making of a special guardianship order the mother seeks an order prohibiting Mrs Z from giving effect to her stated intention to have each of the children take the sacraments of initiation in the Roman Catholic faith of Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Communion and the healing sacrament of Reconciliation (as included in the seven sacraments given by the Council of Florence (1439) and reaffirmed by the Council of Trent (1545&#8211;1563), the others being the healing of the sick, marriage and the taking of Holy Orders).  The mother&#8217;s application for a prohibited steps order is opposed by Mrs Z and Mr Y and the Children&#8217;s Guardian.  The local authority takes a neutral stance on that application. </p>

The mother is of Romany heritage and of Welsh descent.  The father, X, is of African heritage.  The mother follows the protestant Pentecostal faith. The children have not been baptised into that faith, but the mother contends that the children were raised in the Pentecostal faith when in her care.  Whilst the mother also now contends that the children should be able to choose their own religious path when older, in her statement dated 19 June 2020 the mother states that, but for the children being removed from her care, it had been her intention to christen the children in the Pentecostal faith.   </p>

This followed a referral from the police concerning a disagreement that had taken place between the parents.  Thereafter, further referrals were received from health professionals regarding the mother&#8217;s level of cognitive functioning.  The involvement of Suffolk County Council in the welfare of the children, the precise nature and extent of which involvement remains in issue, continued over a number of years.  During this period, significant evidence of neglect was noted, including the children being unsupervised outside, poor home conditions, lack of money and food and issues with housing.  In addition, it was alleged that the maternal grandfather, a convicted sex offender, was being permitted contact with the children. </p>

On 11 September 2013 the mother and children were reported to be homeless.  Suffolk undertook further assessments in June 2014 and August 2014 and convened a Child in Need meeting on 18 September 2014.  On 27 September 2014 B, C, D and E were made the subject of Child in Need plans by Suffolk.  Although Suffolk closed the case in January 2015, in April 2016, following the birth of F, Suffolk completed a further statutory assessment of the children. </p>

Within this context, Suffolk received a high number of further referrals regarding the mother&#8217;s partner&#8217;s anti-social behaviour and aggression.  On 10 April 2017 E, then aged 2 years old, was found by police to be wandering half a mile away from the family home.  On 28 April 2017 a referral was made to Suffolk by the NSPCC regarding anonymous concerns that had been received concerning the alleged neglect of the children, their lack of supervision, a report of a baby being slapped, drug use and the children being left alone in the family home with unknown men. It was also reported to the NSPCC that the children had to walk to school alone and exhibited aggressive behaviour.  Within this context, on 28 April 2017 Suffolk commenced a yet further assessment of the children and they were again made the subject of Child in Need plans.   </p>

On 24 June 2017 D was found alone and distressed in the street.  The police made a further referral to Suffolk.  In June 2017 arrangements were made for the children to live with the putative special guardians, Mrs Z and Mr Y, and the children moved into their care in Salford.

The children&#8217;s father contacted Suffolk objecting to such a course of action and supporting the children remaining with Mrs Z and Mr Y.  On 23 August 2017 Suffolk requested a welfare check at the home of Mr Y and Mrs Z, which check demonstrated no welfare concerns in respect of the children.  On 22 September 2017 Suffolk informed Salford City Council that the children had moved into Salford&#8217;s area.  Suffolk authorised the payment of &#163;150 to Mr Y and Mrs Z for the purchase of school uniforms for the children.  On 22 November 2017 the mother and father met with social workers from Suffolk.  At that meeting the mother agreed to the children remaining in the care of Mrs Z and Mr Y.  The father requested that the children return to his care.  In February 2018 Salford City Council informed Mrs Z and Mr Y that the mother was again seeking the return of the children.  Mr Y also contacted Suffolk for advice in February 2018. </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[15] A prohibited steps order is a statutory restriction on a parents exercise of their parental responsibility for a child. It can have profound consequences. On the facts of this case, without commenting on the wisdom of any step that either parent took or intended to take when they were already in dispute, and in the absence of an order of the court, the father had the same parental responsibility as mother in relation to his son. Once the order was made, he lost the ability to exercise part of his responsibility and could not regain it without the consent of the court. That is because a prohibited steps order is not a reflection of any power in one parent to restrict the other (which power does not exist) it is a court order which has to be based on objective evidence. Once made, the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> do not allow the parents to relax the prohibition by agreement. It can only be relaxed by the court. There is accordingly a high responsibility not to impose such a restriction without good cause and the reason must be given. Furthermore, where a prohibition is appropriate, consideration should always be given to the duration of that prohibition.&#8221; </p>

Some older children do not wish to be legally separated from their birth families. Adoption may not be best for some children being cared for on a permanent basis by members of their wider birth family. Some minority ethnic communities have religious and cultural difficulties with adoption as it is set out in law. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children may also need secure, permanent homes, but have strong attachments to their families abroad. All these children deserve the same chance as any other to enjoy the benefits of a legally secure, stable permanent placement that promotes a supportive, lifelong relationship with their carers, where the court decides that is in their best interests.&#8221; </p>

The Local Authority have no parental authority and never have had in this case. Often a SGO will replace an existing care order and then by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 91</ref>(5A) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> the SGO discharges the care order. All of this sits comfortably with the philosophy which lies behind the introduction of this new form of order. It is intended to promote and secure stability for the child cemented into this new family relationship. Links with the natural family are not severed as in adoption but the purpose undoubtedly is to give freedom to the special guardians to exercise parental responsibility in the best interests of the child. That, however, does not mean that the special guardians are free from the exercise of judicial oversight.&#8221;   </p>

Article 9 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, after all, demands no less. The starting point of the common law is thus respect for an individual&#8217;s religious principles, coupled with an essentially neutral view of religious beliefs and a benevolent tolerance of cultural and religious diversity. </p>

The concepts of thought, conscience and religion imply a capacity to understand, appreciate and engage rationally with competing ideas and beliefs and, ultimately, the capacity to exercise choice in respect of those ideas and beliefs. These faculties will be ones that develop and become more sophisticated as a child develops and matures during the course of childhood.  In relation to matters of thought, conscience and religion, children will move along a continuum from relying on the direction and guidance provided by their parents or carers to, ultimately, having their own ideas and making their own choices about matters of religion and conscience.  Within this context, the older the child becomes, the less likely it is that a prohibited steps order will be made against the wishes expressed by the child (<span style="font-style:italic">Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority and Anor </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1986] 1 FLR 224" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1986">[1986] 1 FLR 224</ref> and see also the dissenting judgment of Justice Douglas in <span style="font-style:italic">Wisconsin v Yoder</span> (1972) 406 US 205).

Rather, the child&#8217;s experience of religion occurs within the broader ethical, moral, spiritual, cultural and social framework of, and is embedded within, the values of family and community, which families and communities will often have a cohesive religious dimension.

Mr Hames submits that I do not, but his argument, which I do not find convincing, assumes that the inherent jurisdiction in play in relation to this aspect of the matter is the inherent jurisdiction in respect of children whereas it is, in my judgment, the inherent declaratory jurisdiction which is here in issue.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">[19] The more problematic question is whether I should exercise the jurisdiction, not least bearing in mind, first, that neither the CPS nor the Secretary of State is a party and that, accordingly, neither will be bound by any declaration I may make and, secondly. that the court is traditionally, and for good reason, slow to grant declaratory relief in relation to the criminal law. I am, none the less, persuaded, having regard to the principles set out by Aikens LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Rolls-Royce plc v Unite the Union</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/387" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 387" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 387</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 WLR 318" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 WLR 318</ref>, para 120, that I should exercise the jurisdiction. Given the stance being adopted by Mr Hames on behalf of the father, I have the benefit of rigorously adversarial argument. And, at the end of the day, and despite the scepticism expressed both by the advocate to the court and by Mr Hames, I can see advantage, as indeed do both the Crown Prosecution Service and the Home Office, in the court which has determined the question of contempt also deciding whether the contempt is civil or criminal. As Ms Patel put it in her skeleton argument for the hearing before Newton J on 10 March 2016, the mother can properly seek to invoke the adjudicatory powers of the convicting court to clarify whether any of the contempts in question were criminal rather than civil in nature. Mr Summers went even further, submitting that &#8220;only the convicting court is able to determine the issue.&#8221; Ms White expressed scepticism, which I share, as to whether this latter point can be right, and I make clear that this is not the basis of my decision to proceed.&#8221; </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.4in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;[29] The law both prescribes the incidence of responsibility and provides for a high degree of flexibility. If a child is a looked-after child then responsibility lies with that authority; if not, it lies with the authority in whose area the child resides. It is therefore of critical importance when a child is placed out of area to have regard as to whether a child should or will remain looked after (i.e. under an interim care order or accommodated) or not (i.e. under a residence order). At the same time the local authorities involved should co-operate from the earliest stage in deciding who will in fact execute the statutory duties that arise and who will fund that work. Local authorities have powers to make sensible arrangements between themselves wherever primary legal responsibility may in fact lie. </p>

Moreover the statute gives the court no power to make directions as to payment of money or provision of services. Of course judges may properly express views to local authorities and are entitled no doubt to expect that they will receive serious consideration (just as judges can and do express views about adoption and care plans) and of course it is only the judge who in the end can make the special guardianship order.&#8221; </p>

Further, I accept that were each of the children to take the sacraments of initiation into the Catholic faith this would have the effect of casting a profound link for the children to the Catholic Church and of constructing a potentially lifelong philosophical narrative for each of the children.  I further accept that this has the potential to result in the children observing a religion and developing a philosophical outlook that is different to that of their mother and the father.  However, notwithstanding these matters, I am satisfied that to prohibit Mrs Z from allowing the children to take the sacraments of initiation into the Roman Catholic faith would not be in their best interests having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  </p>

In particular, they have attended church each Sunday, pray the Rosary and light candles each evening, wear the religious symbols associated with the Catholic faith and have accompanied Mrs Z on pilgrimages to Catholic holy sites.  During the course of the lockdown consequent upon the COVID-19 pandemic the children have continued their religious observance in an amended form.  Further, since being placed with Mrs Z and Mr Y, the children have been involved closely with both members of the extended family and their peers, who are likewise adherents to the Roman Catholic faith.  Whilst objecting to the children taking the sacraments of initiation into the Roman Catholic faith, the mother takes no issue with the children&#8217;s continued informal attendance at a Catholic Church and their continued participation community events centred on that religion.   </p>

The evidence before the court further demonstrates, and clearly, that Catholic religious observance forms a significant element of the children&#8217;s daily lives within the family and is part of the rhythms of family life.  The evidence before the court further demonstrates that the socialising and nurturing of the children into the Catholic faith has been, and continues to be, an integral part of their involvement in, and of their connection with, the family of which they are now a part.  Each of the children is demonstrably conscious of, and comfortable with this situation.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Within this context, the evidence before the court further demonstrates not only that the children have participated informally in the rituals and ceremonies of the Catholic faith at home, at church and within the community, but that each of the children has developed an understanding commensurate with their age of the formal rites of passage of that faith comprised by the sacraments, of the events that mark those rites of passage and of the importance of those rites of passage within the family and the community in which the children are being, and will be brought up.  The evidence is likewise clear that the older children in particular understand that their peers in the community, with whom they live in close proximity and with whom they attend church, do not face the same limitations with respect to these rites of passage as they do currently and would continue to face were a prohibited steps order to be made.  I accept the evidence that the older children have enquired why they too cannot take Holy Communion as their peers have done. B in particular has questioned why he has not been permitted to follow the rites of passage taken by his peers and family members.  I accept the evidence of the Children&#8217;s Guardian that each of the children is also aware that they are perceived differently at church by virtue of not having taken the sacraments of initiation. For example, the fact they are at present required to stand in a separate line for blessing in circumstances where they are not entitled to take Holy Communion during Mass.    </p>

Within this context rites of passage, by which an individual leaves one group and enters another via a ceremony or ritual, may be important and, in my judgment, are important in this case.  </p>

Whilst the rites of passage in issue in this case are within the sacred rather than the secular sphere, placing a prohibition on these rites of passage within a family in which the sacred plays such a central role would, in my judgment, inevitably impact on the ability of the children to perceive themselves as fully part of, and integrated into the family and community to which all parties agree they should now belong.  Further, in so far as rites of passage involve a process of separation, liminality and incorporation, to act to prohibit the children from the rites of passage comprised by the initiation sacraments of the Roman Catholic faith at this stage, after the children have spent a significant period observing the Roman Catholic faith in the context of family and community life, would be to leave the children in an undesirable liminal state within their family and community, with the concomitant emotional burden of feeling different, separate or excluded therefrom.

The unchallenged evidence of the allocated social worker and of the Children&#8217;s Guardian is that a prohibited steps order would, in the children&#8217;s eyes, mark them as outwardly different to their community and the family of which they are now to be members and cause them to perceive themselves as different, segregated or excluded within that context.  Both the allocated social worker and the Children&#8217;s Guardian consider that this would risk significant confusion and emotional distress for each of the children in circumstances where the evidence demonstrates that each identifies strongly with Roman Catholic faith and the family and community to whom that faith is important, threatening the destabilisation of their placement by precluding them from continuing their full and active participation in one of the family&#8217;s central activities. Further, in the particular circumstances of this case, these difficulties are exacerbated by two additional factors.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">First, the terms of the prohibited steps order sought by the mother are inconsistent with the nature of the final order that all parties now agree it is in each of the children&#8217;s best interests for the court to make, namely a special guardianship order in favour of Mrs Z and Mr Y.  Whilst maintaining the <span style="font-style:italic">legal</span> link between the children and their parents, a key purpose of the order is to provide a firm foundation on which to build, and to promote a lifelong <span style="font-style:italic">permanent </span>relationship between Mr Y and Mrs Z and each of the children.  It is plainly in each of the children&#8217;s best interests that the special guardianship order achieves that aim in their respective cases.  Within the context of the matters I have set out above, I am satisfied that making a prohibited steps order in the terms sought by the mother would fundamentally undermine the purpose of the special guardianship order.  For the reasons I have set out above, the effect of such a prohibited steps order would be to place a sharp brake on the children&#8217;s integration into the family at the very point the court seeks to signal, through the making of a special guardianship order, that the court considers that they are now fully part of the family that has been caring for them since 2017.  This can hardly be said to promote and secure stability for the children as the court seeks to cement them into their new family relationships. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">In this context, I am further satisfied that to make orders that have obviously incompatible aims would risk from the outset undermining the children&#8217;s current placement, particularly in circumstances where the central purpose of a special guardianship order is to confer parental responsibility on the special guardians to the exclusion of the parents.  Parents and carers with parental responsibility are entrusted with the welfare decisions concerning the children in their care, including deciding the nature and extent of a child&#8217;s religious observance without interference from the State where there is no danger or risk from religion or religious practice in question.  The effect of a special guardianship order is to confer parental responsibility on the special guardians to the exclusion of the parents.  Within this context, there is a heavy responsibility on the Court not to impose restrictions on the exercise of parental responsibility without good cause.  In these circumstances, and absent any aspect of the family&#8217;s religious practice posing a risk to the welfare of the children, to grant a special guardianship order whilst at the same time heavily prescribing the exercise of Mrs Z&#8217; and Mr Y&#8217;s parental responsibility with respect to welfare decisions that play a central role in the lives of the children and the family of which they are members risks undermining that placement, as well as again sending an entirely mixed message to the children about their permanence and security within the family.  Again, this can hardly be said to promote and secure stability for the children as the court seeks to cement them into their new family relationships. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">Second, the making of a prohibited steps order in the terms sought by the mother would be inconsistent with the expressed wishes and feelings of the children.  Mrs Z asserts that the children consider themselves to be Catholics. This evidence is corroborated by that of the Children&#8217;s Guardian and the evidence of the allocated social worker. All of the children expressed desire to be baptised and each expressed a wish to take Holy Communion, B in particular expressing strong wishes in this regard. Each of the children manifests their religion by the wearing of religious symbols and, on the evidence of the allocated social worker and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, consider themselves proud to do so. I am further satisfied that Mrs Z&#8217; evidence regarding the children&#8217;s view of religion is also consistent with the extended period of relatively intense involvement with the religious observance of the family that the children have had over the course of nearly three years. I accept the evidence that each of the children has, commensurate with their age and understanding, expressed a clear wish to continue their daily observance of tenets of the Catholic religion. </p>

Whilst I am satisfied that the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings are not determinative with respect to the question of whether they should be prohibited from taking the sacraments of initiation into the Roman Catholic faith, they do serve to reinforce the conclusions I have drawn above regarding the detrimental impact that granting a prohibited steps order in the terms sought by the mother would have on the children&#8217;s welfare.  To not only expose the children to the risk of them perceiving themselves as different, separate or excluded within their family and community, but to do so against the consistently expressed wish of each of the children to proceed with the formal rites of passage comprising the initiation sacraments of the Roman Catholic religion would, in my judgment, serve to further and significantly exacerbate the difficulties I have identified.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">I have also borne in mind the mother&#8217;s evidence with respect to the children&#8217;s previous religious upbringing.  In considering the matters under the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> the child&#8217;s &#8216;background&#8217; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 1(3)</ref>(d) may include the child&#8217;s religion (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Infants)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1967] 3 All ER 1071" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1967">[1967] 3 All ER 1071</ref> at 1074).  The children have not been baptised into that faith, but the mother contends that the children were raised in the Pentecostal faith when in her care.  However, there is little evidence to support this contention and even less to demonstrate that this led to the children observing that faith in the way they have now taken to doing with respect to Roman Catholicism.  In any event, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (MA) (An Infant)</span> [1966] 1 ALL ER 838 the court made clear that even where a child had been baptised in a particular faith (which, again, is not the case with these children) does not mean that the court will order the child to be brought up in that faith. For the reasons I have given above, I am unable to accept the submission of Ms Cavanagh and Ms Ross that one of the primary functions of a special guardianship order is to ensure the child&#8217;s previous religious heritage is preserved by the special guardians.  Once again, the test is the child&#8217;s best interests based on all the circumstances of the case. </p>

This conclusion is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to pronounce judgment on the relative merits of the Roman Catholic and Protestant religions.

Rather, the decision of the court is the product of the evaluation of each of the children&#8217;s best interests by reference to the matters set out in the welfare checklist in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 1(3)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and holding each of the children&#8217;s best interests as the court&#8217;s paramount consideration.  For the reasons I have given, it would not be in any of the children&#8217;s best interests to prohibit their further progression in the Catholic faith by restraining their participation in the formal rites of passage of that mainstream religion. </p>
