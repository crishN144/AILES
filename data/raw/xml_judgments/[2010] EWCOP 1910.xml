	    <p style="text-align:justify">This judgment is being handed down in private on 27 July 2010. It consists of 12 pages and has been signed and dated by the judge.  The judge hereby gives leave for it to be reported.</p>

At the conclusion of the hearing on 20 July 2010, I announced my decision, namely that in my judgment LT did indeed lack capacity in the respects identified. However, due to the time, the nature of the arguments addressed to me, and the importance of my decision for LT and her family, I reserved my reasons. These I now give.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The consequence of my decision is that, in default of agreement, there will need to be a &#8220;best interests&#8221; decision about where LT should live and what contact she should have with her family. The Official Solicitor, who represents LT, advocates a declaration that it is in LT&#8217;s best interests to be provided with care by the local authority in the case at a residential establishment, with a &#8220;planned, supported and gradual&#8221; move back to the home of her parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nothing in this judgment should be taken as preventing the parties from negotiating towards that end, and it is plain to me that the resolution of this case is as much a human as it is a legal dilemma. To that end I released the parties from attending court on the second day of the hearing. If necessary I will, of course, resolve any outstanding issues. My hope, however, is that  it will be possible to reach an agreement, and I gave the parties permission to apply to me at short notice whether with an agreed order or for further directions. </p>

Behaviours noted by the psychologist included resistance to demands, poor attachment, attention seeking, bizarre ego-centricism, and verbal and physical aggression provoked by changes in routine. Although the psychologist  considered autism spectrum disorder, she felt that LT's way of dealing with pressure and demands, through the use of social and verbal tactics to remove herself from the situation, was more akin to PDAS than autism.</p>

Although not strictly a failure to understand, Dr K categorised this trait as a refusal to receive the relevant information and was of the opinion that it did impair a person&#8217;s ability to understand all relevant information. Furthermore,  reports  suggested that LT preferred conversation which was <span style="font-style:italic">'</span>matter of fact, purposeful and achieves some goal<span style="font-style:italic">'. </span>This suggested to him that she had difficulties with abstract concepts.</p>

In  his assessment of LT&#8217;s capacity he noted particular difficulties in LT making balanced judgments, as she was only able to look at a problem from one perspective. The nature of her social disorder (whether it was an adult form of  PDAS or RAD, or autistic spectrum) limited her ability to take in and weigh the relevant information and, in extreme circumstances, communicate it effectively.  Thus, he concluded,  she demonstrated strong dichotomous (black and white) thinking; for example,  social workers were all bad and  only lie;  parents were all good and  never had any problem. </p>

Another difficulty was that she held very strong, often pre-formed, views. She was described as stubborn and strong-willed, and also did not like change. Dr K concluded, therefore, that  cognitively LT may struggle to take on fresh information and synthesise that into a whole, particularly if it ran counter to her pre-formed views, or did not support her wishes.</p>

In general LT did have the capacity in the above areas. However, if LT  developed a fixed idea  about a subject, it was very difficult for her to incorporate counterbalancing or conflicting information. Thus, whilst LT did have capacity in these areas, he recommended that for complex decisions, or those with long-term and/or serious consequences, her capacity to make those decisions should be assessed at that time, and in relation to  the specific decision.</p>

At the present time, for decisions that involved her family, LT would need to be assessed to determine whether she was able to take on any other information. As this was an area which is causing her anxiety at the moment, it was likely that she would struggle to make a capacitous decision. However, during Dr K&#8217;s interview with her,  he had been impressed by her logic around choice of day services. She had, for example, spoken of looking for three things in a day service. Thus, whilst LT did have the potential capacity to determine issues to do with her social care needs, she required assessment at the time as to whether she had taken on board all the information and used that information in the balance to come to a decision. In particular reference had to be made to whether she was able to acknowledge the risks and benefits of any decision as it  affected (1) her behaviour and (2) the impact that decision would have on others.</p>

He noted that LT was able to work with him in discussing the issue. In some respects LT was able to produce quite detailed lists of reasons, but those reasons were entirely one sided. Thus she had only acknowledged the positive aspects of returning home. She did not spontaneously identify any risks of returning home (or benefits of living in a residential placement). Moreover when it was impressed upon her that providing such counter-examples would give Dr K greater confidence that she had capacity, she could not.  Significantly when Dr K gave information that could be used as a counter-balance she refused to factor it into her considerations. Furthermore, she was unable to account for her parents growing older and perhaps becoming unwilling or unable to provide the kind of support LT required in the longer term. Thus, in Dr K&#8217;s view, LT only considered one side of the argument, only acknowledging information that led to an outcome she desired i.e. to return home. She was not able to weigh information in the balance. </p>

She plainly did want such contact. However,  due to the nature of her disorder, Dr K thought that she might not be able to identify at any particular moment the impact that contact might have on the other family members, for example, in relation to  timing, frequency or  duration. Thus whilst Dr K was of the opinion that LT had the capacity to decide that she did or did not want to see a particular family member in principle, she needed  support in deciding when and where that should be.</p>

In this regard, as in others, he was forcefully and skilfully challenged by Miss Markus for RT, who had earlier given oral evidence that in his view, LT did indeed have capacity.  A capable person, Miss Markus suggested, might well dismiss arguments out of hand as contrary to a strongly held belief. Dr K agreed: what, however, made LT different was what he had earlier in his evidence described as &#8220;the wall through which you could not pass&#8221;. Miss Markus put to Dr K  that he had not really given LT the opportunity to go back and &#8220;identify the negatives&#8221;.

He accepted as &#8220;possible&#8221; a number of the hypotheses which Miss Markus put to him. He accepted, in addition,  that LT understood the choice between what was home and what was not.

It is difficult for me to explain why I think she has the capacity to make such a decision but I feel that, whilst she has a lot of needs, she is quick on the uptake. She has in the past been found to have the capacity to make decisions regarding her health and we would agree with that. When it was found  (around the time of our complaint to the Ombudsman) when at (a particular residential home) that LT had the capacity to make decisions about her diet, even though they might be to her detriment, we didn&#8217;t disagree with that. What we disagreed with was the way in which (the home) &#8220;gave up&#8221; in the face of that and didn&#8217;t seek to manage her food intake, we felt that they &#8216;hid behind&#8217; that finding. </p>
