The First Respondent is the woman who carried the child and her consent is ineffective if it is given less than six weeks after C&#8217;s birth (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s54 (6)</ref> (a) and (7)). As the Respondents were married at the time of C&#8217;s conception the Second Respondent is C&#8217;s legal father by virtue of s 35. He is therefore the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;other person who is a parent of the child&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and his consent to a parental order is required (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s54 (6)</ref> (b)). There is a written consent signed by each of the Respondents. It sets out clearly what they are consenting to. Whilst is not a Form 101A it is in fact more detailed. Rule 13.11 (1) Family Proceedings Rules 2010 (FPR) states the consent can either be in Form 101A or a form to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;the like effect&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> This form clearly sets out all the requirements to satisfy the court that the Respondents fully understood what is involved and the effect of their consent. The evidence clearly establishes that the consent was translated into Russian and sent by the Applicants&#8217; solicitors to the agency in Russia. They made the arrangements for the Respondents to sign it in the presence of a notary who witnessed the Respondents&#8217; signature and notarised the document (FPR 13.11(4)). Following further directions from the court, evidence was filed which demonstrates the Respondents were literate and able to understand the document they were signing. I am therefore satisfied the Respondents have both consented to the parental order as required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s54</ref>, and in the case of the First Respondent this was more than six weeks after C&#8217;s birth (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s54 (6)</ref> and (7)).</span></p>

That means that it may be commercial and altruistic.  There is neither regulation nor precise information concerning reimbursement to surrogate mother and/or amount of payment.  In practice, medical expenses of surrogates are supposed to be reimbursed; loss of earnings and/or monthly allowance is known to be compensated as well.  However, as to the payment for the services rendered, the parties may try to make it hidden or interpret it as compensation for the moral and physical sufferings caused by pregnancy and delivery of a child.  According to the mass media, the services of surrogate mothers in Russia were estimated approximately to cost 15,000 to 20,000 USD [see: &#8216;Theme Issue: Surrogate Mothers&#8217; (2010) 4(4113) Ogoneyk 1 February 2010, p.32-33 (in Russian)].  In Saint Petersburg, surrogate mothers are paid on average 16,000 &#8211; 19,000 USD (500,000 to 600,000 RUB) [see: &#8216;Russian Surrogate Moms Attract Foreigners&#8217; (2012) 1726 (37) The St Petersburg Times 12 September 2012].&#8221;</span></p>

Over the last 16 years they have had a long and arduous journey to become parents, involving 15 IVF cycles both here, in Italy and then Russia. When they considered surrogacy they sought legal advice here, which at the time advised they should be matched with an unmarried surrogate mother to enable them to secure British nationality for their child, as the First Applicant would be considered the legal father. They did not seek updated legal advice, so were unaware that since 2009 it had become relatively routine for the Home Office to award British nationality, on a discretionary basis, in international surrogacy cases where the foreign surrogate mother is married. Following C&#8217;s birth the Applicants&#8217; believed they had no way of obtaining a British passport for him if they declared he had been born through a surrogacy arrangement. As a result they applied for a British passport without disclosing the surrogacy context, that application was unsuccessful. The Applicants then sought specialist legal and immigration advice here and realised their error. They immediately made the correct applications to the Home Office and the British Embassy, declaring all the details of their previous application and why it had been made in the way that it had. The Home Office were satisfied by their application and explanation. They agreed to expedite the application to enable the Applicants and C to be re-united with the wider family here, as they had been in Russia for a number of months awaiting immigration clearance to return home. C is now a British citizen.</span></p>

Their explanation regarding the first application was accepted by the immigration authorities, who then processed their fresh application for C.

The First Applicant made it clear he was prepared and available to continue to parent C. The parental order reporter also discussed this with the Second Applicant&#8217;s daughter, who has her own children. She confirmed she spoke to her mother each day, and although she lived some way away she had plans to move closer. She was clear that she would do everything she could to support C in the event that he lost his mother during his childhood.</span></p>
