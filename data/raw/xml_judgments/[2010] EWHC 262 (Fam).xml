I will call Mr &#8216;A&#8217; the birth father and Mrs &#8216;A&#8217; the birth mother. He is much older that she is.  Despite the difference in their ages, they are and at all material times have been married to each other and they live together.  They have three living children, &#8216;B&#8217;, &#8216;C&#8217; and &#8216;D&#8217;, who are now aged about six, four and three.  Each of these three children were removed from their mother within days of their birth and neither parent had any opportunity even to try to parent any of them. Ultimately, &#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;C&#8217; were adopted together by one adoptive family and &#8216;D&#8217; by another.  There is some communication between the two adoptive families and the three children occasionally meet.  The birth parents are not permitted to meet them and only receive very occasional and limited information about them.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All the relevant decisions have been taken or approbated by court orders. In a sentence, the children were removed and adopted because it was considered that their birth parents could not parent them adequately due to a combination of the birth father&#8217;s unusual personality and the mother&#8217;s low intelligence. I wish to stress that the appropriateness of, and justification for, removing any of the children and their subsequent adoption does not arise for consideration by me and I do not express or imply any view one way or another about it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the removal of the first child, &#8216;B&#8217;, the parents felt that they had been unjustly and unfairly treated.  They approached the press and media and in 2005 a number of articles and interviews were published about them, including photographs of themselves and &#8216;B&#8217; as a new born baby.  Those articles referred to the parents and &#8216;B&#8217; by their true names.  The day after &#8216;C&#8217; was born a further article was published which described how &#8216;C&#8217; (who was not actually named) was removed from the mother immediately after birth.  Again, the parents were named and depicted in a photograph.  So far as I am aware, the publicity was largely confined to the Wakefield area of Yorkshire which is not the area in which any of the children now live.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As a result, the local authority, the City of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council (Wakefield), obtained the first of a series of continuing injunctions which, in summary, forbid each birth parent from discussing, or otherwise communicating, or encouraging, or suggesting to any other person to publish &#8220;any matter relating to the care or family circumstances, including proceedings before any court&#8221; relating to the children, other than to certain very limited categories of person such as their legal advisors.  When, in due course, &#8216;D&#8217; was born, an injunction was made in relation to &#8216;D&#8217; as well.  The injunctions were, and are, directed to the birth parents personally and no injunction was ever sought or made against the media; but the birth parents have always obeyed and respected the injunctions with the result that, so far as I am aware, there has never been any further publicity since the making of the first injunction in July 2005.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The injunctions were all made during the course of subsisting care or adoption proceedings in relation to the children, and it is clear from the terms of the supporting judgments that part of the reason for making or continuing the injunctions at that time was so as to remove (in the words of one judgment) &#8220;the glare of media publicity&#8221; while proceedings and the adoptive process were still underway.  But the injunctions are of indefinite duration and remain in full force and effect, even although all the children have now been fully and finally adopted and all proceedings have ended.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The birth parents continue to consider very strongly that they have been the victims of injustice and they applied in September 2008 for the injunctions to be discharged.  They made quite plain that they wished to publicise their stories in the media and, in the case of the birth father, to publish a book of their experiences.  At paragraph 6 of his statement dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2008,      Mr &#8216;A&#8217; made his position very clear:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;I wish to be freed from the injunctions out against me currently.  I feel myself and my wife have been treated extremely unfairly during the course of these proceedings. I do not believe that due consideration has been given to our ability to parent the children and, although I have been advised there is no legal course open to me, I wish to bring the public&#8217;s attention to what I see as a miscarriage of justice&#8230;  I wish to continue my fight and this would include, hopefully, publishing a book I am writing on the subject&#8230;  I feel that I should be allowed to continue my fight through the press as I believe it is an infringement of my human rights.  I am aware that there will be some things I will not be able to publish due to the privacy of the children, but I believe that the general details of my case and the situation myself and my wife have found ourselves in should be drawn to the public&#8217;s attention.&#8221;</p>

At that time, no-one had alerted either set of adoptive parents to the applications or contacted them to ascertain their views.  I gave a judgment sitting in private on 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2009 which has been transcribed but which must not be made public since it contains names and other potentially identifying information which is deliberately excluded from the present judgment.  For a range of reasons which I gave in that judgment, I considered that I, or the court, could not appropriately consider these applications until the adoptive parents had been contacted and their views ascertained. In any event, the adoptive families would have to be informed if there was any variation or relaxation in the terms of the injunctions;  and plainly they had a right to convey their views to the court (and, indeed, to be represented if they so wished) before any variation or relaxation was considered or ordered.</p>

Naturally, I regret the distress to them.

As they indicated at that hearing that they might do, Wakefield have now  applied for an injunction or reporting restriction order binding the press, broadcasters and other media directly.  If there is to be any relaxation or variation of the orders against the birth parents directly, with the result that some communication with the media, publishers or broadcasters is permitted, Wakefield consider (and I agree) that it is important that the media should know clearly and directly what they, the media, can and cannot publish.  </p>

Several reported judgments themselves refer to twenty or more earlier authorities.  For busy first instance judges operating at the coal face in cases such as this, there has to be a simpler approach and process.  In the present case, although I was supplied with a bundle of authorities, counsel for each birth parent and for the local authority made no reference to reported authorities in their skeleton arguments and only minimal reference during oral submissions and, in my view, they were right not to do so.                             Mr Stephen Switalski, on behalf of the children&#8217;s guardian, very neatly summarised the legal framework in just over one page of his very helpful written skeleton argument. In my view, the legal framework applicable to my decision in this case can and should be simply stated.  The real difficulty lies, of course, in striking the appropriate balance on the facts and in the circumstances of the case.</p>

The exercise to be performed is one of parallel analysis in which the starting point is presumptive parity, in that neither Article has precedence over or trumps the other. The exercise of parallel analysis requires the court to examine the justification for interfering with each right and the issue of proportionality is to be considered in respect of each.  It is not a mechanical exercise to be decided on the basis of rival generalities.  An intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary before the ultimate balancing test in the terms of proportionality is carried out.&#8221;</p>

It would not, and certainly should not, achieve any alteration at all in the respective positions of the birth parents, the children or the adoptive families.  The birth parents assert their qualified right to freedom of expression.  They consider that there is a public importance in the public being aware of the (in their view) unjust way in which the local authority, social workers, a guardian, courts and judges, and, collectively, the system, have treated them and their children.  It may be that they feel, too, that their own burdens, emotions and feelings may be assuaged to some degree if they can get them &#8220;off their chest&#8221; through legitimate publicity. </p>

It may be that any further or continuing interest has, in any event, diminished with the passing of time.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, the highest importance in this case does attach to the welfare of each of these children and to the need not to destabilise or disrupt any of them in their adoptive placements. They are young, needy, innocent and defenceless.  Whatever the shortcomings or failures of the child protection system, it does no service to society or the public to victimise children in the name of exposing such actual or perceived or alleged shortcomings or failures.  But restrictions should go no further than are actually necessary, justifiable and proportionate to protect the children and the Article 8 rights of themselves and their adoptive families.</p>

In the course of some very well balanced and well argued submissions on behalf of the mother, to which I pay tribute, Miss Catherine Mason submitted that it is not necessary or justifiable to prevent publication of the name (or, at the very least, the forename) or pictures of the birth mother. She asked me to read, as I have, a long up to date hand-written statement by the birth mother as to how she currently feels.  </p>

Those submissions do not, however, meet the point so strongly made by the adoptive parents and the guardian that these children themselves would recognise the name and/or pictures if they chanced to hear or see them. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the issue of publishing the name, or a recognisable or identifiable picture of the birth parents (or either of them), I have very firmly concluded that the welfare and rights of the children, individually as well as collectively, clearly outweigh the rights of the birth parents or media under Article 10.  It is necessary, proportionate and justifiable to prevent the pictures or names (including the forenames) of the birth parents from being published in any context and in any way which might lead anyone (including, very importantly, any of the children themselves) to make any connection between the publication and any of the children.  In short, if there is any publication of the birth parents&#8217; story it must not include their names or any recognisable or identifiable picture of them.  Provided, however, that a picture (whether in print or on television) is conscientiously and responsibly pixellated and/or &#8220;rear view&#8221; or otherwise obscured or disguised, such that the depicted person cannot be recognised or identified, then a picture or image may be depicted.  Similarly, since there is no evidence that any of the children would or could recognise a birth parent&#8217;s voice, I do not require that their voice or speech is disguised or distorted. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The prohibition includes prohibition on publishing the dates of birth of any of the children which are an obviously identifying feature. It seems to me, however (and neither the local authority nor the guardian suggested otherwise), that if there is to be any publication at all, it could not preclude reference to the age (expressed only as a whole year) of all or any of the children.  Some reference to the period in which events happened could not be excluded altogether, for otherwise it would be impossible to know whether a story related to very recent events or, to exaggerate the point, events ten or more years ago.  It is, in my view, unreal and a disembodiment too far not to anchor any published story to approximate time;  and unreal, therefore, to preclude reference, expressed as a whole year to age (e.g. aged three, four, five or six or as the case may be).  For that reason, I have already referred to the ages of the children in this public judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the course of argument, it was agreed that there could be reference also to gender.  While preparing this judgment, I have changed my mind on this point. In relation to age, some reference to time cannot realistically be avoided, as I have just explained.  Gender, however, is different. There is absolutely nothing in the birth parents&#8217; stories which is gender specific.  Any decisions which were taken in relation to any child were entirely unrelated to gender.  The course of events in relation to all or any of the children would have been exactly the same whatever the gender of that child or any of them. In short, gender adds nothing to the story and avoidance of reference to gender does not disembody it.  On the other hand, precise reference to gender adds a small piece to the jigsaw which just might lead to a third party in the localities in which any of these children live surmising that an article or programme in the press or on television related to that child or these children.  </p>

I have also deliberately avoided any gender specific pronoun or other reference to gender in this judgment.  Any written publication must be rigorously scrutinised and edited to ensure that there is no reference to gender or a gender specific pronoun.  </p>

[This, of course, precludes the use of fictitious but gender indicative names, but not fictitious initials, provided it is made clear that any initials are not the respective child&#8217;s true initials].  </p>

The rights and interests to be protected are those of the children and their adoptive families. Neither local authorities, nor judges, nor guardians, nor social workers who work in this public field can claim any immunity or protection from their names being mentioned in legitimate media reporting, and it was accepted and agreed by all represented parties (and, in particular, by Wakefield and the guardian) that such names may be named. I appreciate the comments, in particular, of the adoptive mother of &#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;C&#8217; on pages 2 and 3 of her written statement which I have briefly quoted in paragraph 35 above (her reference to &#8220;a revengeful attack on Wakefield Social Services&#8221; and to a &#8220;&#8216;name and shame&#8217; campaign&#8221;).  But, although she is sympathetic to them, she does not represent the interests of social workers or other professional people, including judges.</p>
