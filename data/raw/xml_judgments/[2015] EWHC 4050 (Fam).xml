The parents of T, certainly in a psychological sense, are QS, the applicant in this matter, and RS, the respondent.  I say at this stage, "certainly in a psychological sense," in circumstances where, for reasons I will come to, there is, it transpires, a significant question mark as to the legal status of T <span style="font-style:italic">vis-&#224;-vis</span> her parents. Both QS and RS are British citizens.   </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The background of this matter must start with T.  On the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2005 T was found abandoned in a Temple, in the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.  She was estimated to be 14 months old and upon being found she was moved to an orphanage.  T's date of birth of the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2005 is her official designated birth date.  Subsequent to T's move to an orphanage in Kathmandu, the mother and the father (as I shall call them) were introduced to T on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2006.  Thereafter there followed an adoption of T by the mother and father under Nepalese law.  I have before me, in the bundle of documents prepared for this hearing, copies of the documentation which indicates that that adoption took place on 10 February 2008 and was completed under the law of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.  I have no reason to believe that under the law of that jurisdiction the adoption was anything other than properly constituted.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Following their adoption of T the parents moved with her to live in Dubai.  When in Dubai T was granted British Citizenship.  Again in the documents before me I have a Certificate of Registration dated the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;September 2008, registering T as a British citizen.  The precise circumstances of that registration, and the need to examine further those circumstances, I shall, again, return to.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Sadly, following the return of the parents and T to Dubai, in due course the parents' marriage got into difficulties.  For the purposes of this judgment I do not at this stage need to go into the precise nature of those difficulties.  However, one relevant result of the breakdown of the parents' marriage was that they commenced litigation both in the jurisdiction of Dubai and in the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  In Dubai that litigation has concentrated on T, with a case concerning her custody and contact moving all the way from the First Instance Court in Dubai finally to the Dubai Court of Cassation.  In this jurisdiction the litigation has involved both divorce proceedings, matrimonial finance proceedings and wardship proceedings before the High Court of England and Wales.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The wardship proceedings arose in the following circumstances.  On the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;November 2011, again for reasons that it is not at this point in time necessary to go into in detail, the mother was deported from Dubai.  Notwithstanding that deportation, the proceedings in Dubai concerning T continued.  On the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2012 the first instance Dubai Court gave a ruling in those proceedings.  Part of that ruling was that the custody of T was awarded to the mother.  The father immediately appealed that decision.  However the mother, now in England, and in light of the Dubai court's ruling, came before Pauffley J on the 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2012, without notice to the father, with an application to make T a ward of court.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The order that Pauffley J made on that day is set out in the bundle.  Pauffley J, upon the basis of an understanding that it was the intention of the court in Dubai that T should live with her mother in England and Wales, made T a ward of court and made a further order that she should be in the care and control of her mother in this jurisdiction.  Pauffley J further gave liberty to either parent to apply on notice in relation to that order.  The father was served personally at an address in Dubai with those orders on the 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2012.</p>

Her last direct contact with T was on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June 2013.  On the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2013 the wardship proceedings again came before this court without notice to the father.  On that date Bodey J continued the wardship in relation to T, directed that the Passport Office in this jurisdiction issue to the mother a British passport for T and continued the care and control order made by Pauffley J on the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2012.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Meanwhile the proceedings that the father had instituted in Dubai in relation to T were continuing.  On the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014 the Dubai Court of Appeal handed down a provisional judgment having heard evidence from both the mother and the father.  In relation to the issue of the custody of T the Dubai Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the first instance Court in relation to the order conferring custody of T on the mother.  The father again appealed, this time to the Dubai Court of Cassation; that court being the highest court in the United Arab Emirates.  On the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014 the Court of Cassation allowed the father's appeal and gave custody of T to the father.  The mother sought to appeal this decision but her appeal was dismissed.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It is important at this point to make clear what the effect of the judgment of the Court of Cassation in Dubai has been in this case.  The effect of that judgment and the orders made by the Court of Cassation has been considered in this case by an expert in Islamic law and the law of the United Arab Emirates, instructed jointly to provide an opinion to the court in these proceedings.  The expert in question is Dr Dawoud Sudqi El-Alami.  He is a member of the Egyptian Bar Association qualified before the Court of Cassation.  He has a PhD in Islamic Law from the University of Glasgow and is a Senior Teaching Fellow and Reader in Islamic Law at the University of Aberdeen.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in">The status of T as an adopted child: Islamic law does not allow legal adoption of children in the sense understood in the United Kingdom, as great importance is placed on the establishment of blood lineage.  UAE nationals and Muslims of other nationalities are therefore not permitted to adopt, nor are foreign nationals permitted to adopt children who are UAE nationals.  While adoption is not dealt with in the Personal Status Law, the UAE has expressed its position in the form of a reservation to Article 21 (regarding adoption) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.&#8221;</p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in">"Evidence from the proceedings to date indicates that whilst the courts have recognised the relation of T to the  S&#8217;s as their ward in accordance with the foreign adoption and Mr. S&#8217;s sponsorship of the child and of Mrs.  S, they have nevertheless emphasised at several points that she is not their biological child.  As T's sponsor with legal and financial responsibility for her in the UAE he is the first choice as her guardian, provided he meets the conditions for guardianship specified in the aforementioned Articles 180 and 181 of the Personal Status Law.  Whilst this is not affected by the position that T is an adopted child, the opinion that she has no natural parents has an impact on the entitlement to custody in accordance with the Shari&#8217;a, and consequently the Personal Status Law."</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in">"<span style="font-weight:bold">In the Appeal Number 38/2014 Cassation (of which there are in the case file a draft and final ruling) the Court of Cassation has overturned the earlier rulings and awarded custody of the child to Mr. S.</span>  It bases this position primarily on Article 147 of the Personal Status Law asserting that this Article allows that &#8220;Should there be no party fit for custody, or no party accepting custody, the judge shall choose a male or female trusted relative of the minor under custody or others or may place the minor in a qualified institution.&#8221; [c168, para1]  It goes on to say that Article 147 does not differentiate between male and female and claims that this quote leaves no room for the application of Article 144(2)(b). [C171]  </p>

	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in">Article 147 does not explicitly state that the person appointed as custodian may be male or female, but provides that: &#8216;If there are no parents and custody is refused by those entitled to it the judge shall choose whomsoever he considers suitable from the relatives of the child, or non relatives, or one of the institutions qualified in this regard.&#8217;  The explanatory memorandum of the Article goes on to say: &#8216;If there is no person who is entitled to custody, or who accepts custody, the judge shall choose a person he trusts, man or women, of the relatives of the child or others, or shall place him/her with one of the institutions qualified in this regard.  This ruling is based on the Hanafi School.&#8217;  </p>

	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in">This Cassation ruling is, on the face of it, an unusual application of the law.  Islamic law and the UAE Personal Status Law do not allow a man to have custody of a child who is not in the categories of relationship to him that prohibit marriage between them.  The law states categorically that for a man to have custody he must, 'be of a degree of relationship to the child that makes marriage between them unlawful if it is a girl.'  [Law 28.2005, Article 144(2)(b)]  It goes on to say: &#8216;In all cases there shall be no entitlement to custody where there is a difference of sex for a person who is not prohibited in marriage by degree of relationship to the child whether male or female.&#8217; [Law 28.2005, Article 146(5)]  </p>

It would be expected that the person whom the judge considers suitable should be chosen from amongst those who meet the qualifications or, in other words, by definition the criteria for 'suitability' should be those listed as the qualifications for custody.  <span style="font-weight:bold">What is clear, however, is by this literal application of Article 147 and its explanatory memorandum the Court of Cassation has taken the strict position that Mr. and Mrs.&#160; Sare not T's parents, as according to the letter of the Article this provision applies only where there are no parents</span>."</p>

Indeed it would appear that, subject to further questions being asked of the expert, the effect of the judgment of the Court of Cassation is that for the purposes of the law of the United Arab Emirates neither the mother nor the father are T's parents.</p>

As discussed previously the Court of Cassation has overturned the rulings of the lower court and awarded custody of T to  QS on the basis of Article 147 of the Personal Status Law:  &#8216;If there are no parents and custody is refused by those entitled to it, the judge shall chose whomsoever he considers suitable from the relatives of the child, or non relatives, or one of the institutions qualified in this regard; and  the explanatory memorandum to this: If there is no person who is entitled to custody or who accepts custody, the judge shall choose a person he trusts, man or woman, of the relatives of the child or others, or shall place him/her with one of the institutions qualified in this regard.  This ruling is based on the Hanafi School.&#8217;</p>

If the court were to admit Mrs.  S's status as T's mother in order to grant visiting rights then there would be no reason to deny her priority right to custody as, so far as I&#160;am aware, there are no other impediments to her custody.  Correspondingly, in awarding custody to Mr. S, the Court of Cassation has made no provision for visiting with regard to Mrs.  S.  </p>

It is inconsistent with and potentially disruptive of the modern trend towards habitual residence as the principal basis of jurisdiction; it may encourage conflicting orders in competing jurisdictions; using it to order the child to come here may disrupt the scheme of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> by enabling the child's future to be decided in a country other than that where he or she is habitually resident.

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in">"<span class="Strong" style="font-weight:normal">[45]&#160;</span>In our judgment, the use of the inherent jurisdiction in cases where the child is outside the jurisdiction remains subject to the long-established and consistent jurisprudence. Various words have been used down the years to describe the kind of circumstances in which it may be appropriate to make an order &#8211; &#8220;only under extraordinary circumstances&#8221;, &#8220;the rarest possible thing&#8221;, &#8220;very unusual&#8221;, &#8220;really exceptional&#8221;, &#8220;dire and exceptional&#8221;, &#8220;at the very extreme end of the spectrum.&#8221; The jurisdiction, it has been said, must be exercised &#8220;sparingly&#8221;, with &#8220;great caution&#8221; (the phrase used by Lord Hughes JSC in <span class="Emphasis">A v A</span>, &#167; 70(v)) and with &#8220;extreme circumspection.&#8221; We quote these words not because they or any of them are definitive &#8211; they are not &#8211; but because, taken together, they indicate very clearly just how limited the occasions will be when there can properly be recourse to the jurisdiction.<br/><br/><span class="Strong" style="font-weight:normal">[46]</span><span class="Strong">&#160;</span>Moreover, and as we have already explained, those occasions will in modern times be even more limited than previously, given, first, the effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> and, secondly, the other recent developments noted by Thorpe LJ and Baroness Hale. The importance of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> in limiting recourse to the inherent jurisdiction is plain.

In that regard Black LJ said as follows at paragraphs 52 and 53:</p>
	    </intro>
	    <subparagraph>
	      <content>
		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.59in"><span style="color:#000000">"</span><span class="Strong" style="font-weight:normal">[52]&#160;</span>Overall, unsatisfactorily general though the evidence is, we are prepared to proceed on the basis that it is very unlikely that the courts in Pakistan would be prepared to recognise the appellant as having any relationship with P that would entitle her to relief. She could hardly hope to demonstrate the necessary kind of parental, or in any event familial, relationship with P unless she were tolerably frank about the nature of her relationship with the respondent. But in that case, even if the Court evinced no actual hostility to the appellant, the evidence about societal attitudes strongly suggests that her consequent relationship with P would not be recognised as one which justified any legal protection. Thus, while we need reach no conclusion about the alleged &#8220;risks to all concerned&#8221;, what matters is that the appellant will have no realistic opportunity to advance her claim in the Pakistani courts.<br/><br/><span class="Strong" style="font-weight:normal">[53]</span><span class="Strong">&#160;</span>However, in our judgment that state of affairs is not by itself enough to justify the intervention of the English court. The fact that local judicial processes are, to our perception, inadequate does not in any way lessen the difficulties about seeking to invoke the inherent jurisdiction when a child is abroad. As a matter of principle, such a claim to jurisdiction sits most uncomfortably not merely with the long-established jurisprudence but more particularly with the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(d)(i) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> and the decisions in <span class="Emphasis">Al Habtoor v Fotheringham</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2001/186" uk:canonical="[2001] EWCA Civ 186" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] EWCA Civ 186</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 951" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 951</ref>, and <span class="Emphasis">Re N (Abduction: Appeal)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1086" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1086" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1086</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] 1 FLR 457" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] 1 FLR 457</ref>. We would not wish to lay down any rigid boundaries for the exercise of the jurisdiction; all must depend, as always, on the circumstances of the particular case. However, we are satisfied that the present case does not approach the very high threshold necessary to justify the exercise of the jurisdiction. We are very willing to accept that the attenuation or even &#8211; if this is, regrettably, what happens &#8211; the ultimate loss of her relationship with the appellant will be a real detriment to P, quite apart from being a great grief to the appellant herself. But it has to be recognised that the respondent has always been P&#8217;s primary carer, that the appellant had not been part of the household for some time before P and the respondent left for Pakistan and that the appellant has never even in this country had any legal parental rights. The situation falls short of the exceptional gravity where it might indeed be necessary to consider the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction<span style="color:#000000">."</span></p>

On a clear reading of the expert report, the mother has, by virtue of the law pertaining in the jurisdiction of Dubai, no remedy in relation to T, either as her mother, or to any lesser degree, in seeking custody of, or access to her.</p>

In that case the child had a legal parent exercising parental responsibility for her.  The child's legal status <span style="font-style:italic">viz</span> her parent was absolutely clear and firmly established.  In this case the position for T is, in my judgment, fundamentally different and much more stark.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">It would appear to be the case that T has been adopted by the mother and father under the law of Nepal.  However the jurisdiction of Dubai, where T currently resides, does not recognise the adoption of T by her mother and father.  The result of that position under the law of Dubai is clear from the judgment of the Court of Cassation and the expert report; namely that T is not, under that jurisdiction, the daughter of the mother and the father.  At best, she is the ward of the father.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The consequence of this position is that, in addition to it being the case that T is not the legal child of the mother and father in Dubai, T is not the legal child of the mother and father for the purposes of English law.  In the circumstances, on the face of it T has no parents save in the jurisdiction of Nepal; that being the only jurisdiction that appears to date to have recognised the adoptive relationship between the mother and father and T.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Within that context it is further clear from the expert report that this situation cannot be remedied in Dubai, as the law that pertains in that jurisdiction does not recognise adoption and does not therefore, axiomatically, provide for the difficulties regarding T&#8217;s status as a child of the parents that I have outlined to be remedied.  The only jurisdiction that is capable of remedying the position and achieving the situation that was intended by both parents in 2008, and that has been the assumption of both parents (and T) since 2008 and throughout the majority of T's life, is that of England and Wales.  Thus it will be seen that, in my judgment, the position of T in this case is fundamentally different and fundamentally more stark than the position of child P in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (A Child) (Habitual Residence) (Inherent Jurisdiction) </span>before the Court of Appeal.</p>

However, having regard to the fact that at present it is by no means certain that T is the legal child of the mother and father anywhere other than Nepal, and to the fact that it would appear on the information presently available to the court that only the English court is in a position to remedy that situation (the Dubai courts, as I have said, being bound by the ambit of the law governing that jurisdiction to the position endorsed by the Court of Cassation) I am satisfied in this case that there exist extraordinary circumstances justifying this court having recourse to the inherent jurisdiction on the basis of T's British nationality in addition to any other jurisdictional bases that may apply in this case.</p>
