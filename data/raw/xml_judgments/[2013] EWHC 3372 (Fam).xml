He was without doubt masterminding the conduct of the litigation behind the scenes whilst ensuring that he was never exposed to cross-examination in the witness box or to being brought to book for his continuing contempt of court. </p>

The initial replies of the Companies to the questionnaire were a disgrace and only compounded by the supplementary replies. I remind myself that, as parties to the proceedings, the Companies had a duty of full and frank disclosure. That part of the case that was tried (the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>, 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> and 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> Respondents having taken no part), turned in its entirety upon the assertion of the Companies that they were the beneficial owners of various domestic properties in the UK used by the family. Not one document was produced by the Companies of their own volition in support of that contention.</p>

Thereafter, through the medium of his Companies - and without exposing himself - he obtained the benefit of Leading Counsel to fight the case - but to fight it only in respect of those assets where there is a relatively easy route to enforcement, namely the domestic properties within the jurisdiction of England and Wales. The Husband has wasted no money on legal representation at the trial with a view to protecting his assets held abroad, having, as he believes, put them beyond the Wife's reach through the new Belize structure.  Such manipulative and contemptuous conduct must be visited by an order for costs on an indemnity basis.</p>

The Wife asks for summary assessment of her costs in the sums set out above. I note that the schedules of fees are not set out in a so-called 'Woolf schedule' whereby the costs are broken down on a letter by letter basis or telephone by telephone call basis. I am told by Mr Dyer QC that to conduct such an exercise would take a fortnight of chargeable time for the solicitors and would in my judgment be a disproportionate expense, as would the costs involved in a detailed assessment of the costs. Mr Dyer submits that such additional costs may not be recoverable &#8211; I fear he may be right.</p>
