In paragraphs [33]-[36] I explained the unusual forensic context in which I had come to give judgment. I set out my findings in relation to no fewer than sixteen issues, referred to as (a) to (p). Issue (a), relating to sexual abuse, was itself divided into four sub-issues. In relation to costs (issue (q)) I made no decision. In the circumstances I was not asked to make and have not made any order. </p>

The Official Solicitor, by application dated 22 November 2010, sought costs against MF and (in part) against the local authority. The application was supported by a witness statement by the Official Solicitor also dated 22 November 2010 and a skeleton argument by Ms Hodes dated 18 November 2010. The local authority made no application but indicated that it resisted any application made against it by either the Official Solicitor or MF.</p>

In the email sent on 19 January 2011 he said that &#8220;In the light of new evidence (OS wants money from LA and LA refuses to pay &#8230; ) and its ramifications as extensively analysed, in my application for costs and compensation&#8221; he sought a &#8220;RE-TRIAL &#8230; in the name of FAIRNESS and JUSTICE.&#8221; Under cover of the email dated 25 January 2011, he sent a copy of a letter from the Adjudicator dated 24 January 2011 (see paragraphs [126]-[131] of my previous judgment). In the email sent later the same day, 25 January 2011, MF asked that &#8220;In the light of new evidence and the letter of the Adjudicator&#8221; I &#8220;consider [his] appeal.&#8221; In the email sent on 27 January 2011, he said that &#8220;In the light of recent developments I have to ask for permission to appeal&#8221;.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I explained in the further judgment I handed down on 28 January 2011 (<span style="font-style:italic">Re RB (Adult) (No 2)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2011/112" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 112 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 112 (Fam)</ref>), I treated these emails from MF as making applications to me, as the trial judge, to direct a re-trial and/or give him permission to appeal. Since all the relevant material was at hand, and as MF in his email of 25 January 2011 had asked me to consider his appeal, I said I was prepared to do so without requiring MF to file a formal notice of application for permission. For the reasons I set out in that judgment, and which I need not repeat here, I refused permission to appeal and refused to direct a re-trial. I explained why, contrary to MF&#8217;s contention, there was no new evidence and how, in reality, his challenge to my findings was no more than an attempt to re-argue the case and to persuade me (or the Court of Appeal) to come to a different conclusion. I described his application for permission as &#8220;devoid of merit&#8221;. I said that there was simply no basis for a re-trial. I observed that a wish to have the opportunity of re-arguing a case in the hope that it will produce a different outcome does not begin to justify a request for a re-hearing.</p>

It follows that both the judgment I gave on 30 September 2010 and the judgment I gave on 28 January 2011 (and the order I made on the latter occasion) are final and binding.</p>

I indicated that I was willing (but only if all parties agreed) to decide the matter on the papers and without an oral hearing. I indicated that if any party wished there to be an oral hearing, I would fix the hearing (probably in March 2011) with a time estimate of half a day. I said I was minded to agree to dispense with the need for attendance at that hearing by any party who wished not to attend or be represented. I asked that I be notified by 2 March 2011 whether or not anyone wished there to be an oral hearing. </p>

I emphasise this point because most of the material MF has put before me, and the vast bulk of his arguments, are not in fact directed to either of these issues. For, notwithstanding my judgment and order of 28 January 2011, MF has persisted, endlessly, repetitiously and obsessively, in seeking to re-argue the matters which I dealt with in my judgment of 30 September 2010. That judgment, as I have explained, is now final and binding. It is simply not open to MF to seek to re-open my findings or to re-argue issues that were disposed of finally and conclusively in that judgment. I appreciate that MF may disagree with some of my findings, but I cannot help that. For good or bad, like it or not, he is bound by them, just as are the local authority and the Official Solicitor.     </p>

In my judgment, none of this material &#8211; almost all of which, I emphasise, was before me when I wrote the judgment of 30 September 2010 and none of which constitutes new evidence &#8211; even begins to cast the slightest doubt on the correctness of my findings. His points are devoid of merit. Even it was open to me to reconsider my findings, I would not alter any of them.</p>

On the contrary, I found (judgment para [65]) that the local authority was justified on the evidence it had in making the original allegation of sexual abuse; I found (para [67]) that, quite apart from any allegation of sexual abuse, the local authority was &#8220;fully justified&#8221; in commencing the proceedings; and I found (para [123]; see also para [151]) that the allegations of financial abuse had at all times been made by all concerned in good faith, without any impropriety and in circumstances where there appears to have been an appropriate basis for them.</p>

Since then, MF has been afforded a double indulgence: at the hearing on 14 April 2011 I gave him the further time for which he asked; subsequently I extended that time until 15 July 2011. Enough is enough. Making every allowance for the fact that MF has been acting as a litigant in person (albeit that he has had professional assistance in recent months) I am satisfied that he has had more than enough time in which to formulate his claim. The other parties are entitled to finality. The litigation must be brought to an end.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other is that the Official Solicitor&#8217;s predecessor consented to act for RB because she appeared to have sufficient capital to cover her costs; indeed, the court made an order providing that the Official Solicitor&#8217;s costs be met from her estate. However, it became apparent in due course that RB&#8217;s capital had been depleted, first by the removal of the money in her bank accounts during the period when MF was acting as her attorney and, second, by the local authority&#8217;s charge on her house in respect of her financial contributions to the cost of her social care. The Official Solicitor&#8217;s difficulties were, he says, exacerbated by MF&#8217;s failure as her attorney to provide financial information despite repeated requests, and his refusal to complete a means form in order for RB to be eligible for public funding. This prevented a potential application for public funding by the Official Solicitor on her behalf. The end result, he says, is that there is no cover for the &#8220;extremely high&#8221; costs he and his predecessor have incurred.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Ms Greaney points out, not merely is the vast bulk of what MF has to say directed to an impermissible attempt to re-litigate issues which I have already determined, but he actually says very little in support of his application for costs. Although, as she makes clear, the local authority acknowledges and accepts the criticisms I have made of its handling of the sexual abuse and related issues, she submits that neither those matters nor anything else justifies an order for costs in favour of MF. Looking to the litigation more generally, she submits that MF lost on the central issue; indeed, except in relation to the apology issue, he can, she says, fairly be said to have lost on all issues &#8211; an appraisal with which Ms Hodes agrees. Moreover, it has to be borne in mind, she submits, that I did not criticise the local authority for initially raising the allegation of sexual abuse, my criticisms focusing on the local authority&#8217;s subsequent handling of the issue and its failure to apologise. Given the welter of other issues I had to consider (not least the myriad complaints raised by MF) it cannot reasonably be said, she submits, that the proceedings would have come to any earlier or significant less costly conclusion if the local authority had handled the sexual abuse issues differently. In short, the adverse findings against the local authority have to be seen in the light of the litigation as a whole and do not of themselves justify an award of costs in MF&#8217;s favour.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns the Official Solicitor&#8217;s claim for costs against the local authority, the Official Solicitor makes clear that this relates only to such additional costs as were generated by the local authority&#8217;s handling of the sexual abuse issues and that his claim is contingent on him not recovering those costs from MF. Ms Hodes makes clears in her skeleton argument that the claim is pursued only if I take the view that the local authority contributed &#8220;in a significant way&#8221; to the generation of costs in this context. Ms Greaney submits that this was a side issue which arose between MF and the local authority and did not in substance affect the Official Solicitor. And, as we have seen, she disputes that it contributed in any significant way to the costs. She says that MFs conduct of the litigation has been at heavy expense to the public purse and that there is no justification for imposing any further burden on the local authority.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset there are two points that need to be made. In the first place, MF&#8217;s conduct in the litigation was something which, directly or indirectly, arose in relation to a number of the issues I had to determine; and it was something I made various findings about, many exceedingly damaging to MF. Nothing which has been put before me since I handed down my judgment seems to me to justify any adjustment to those findings, whether by way of mitigation or otherwise. Thus, where the Official Solicitor now seeks to characterise MF&#8217;s conduct in more severe terms than those I chose to use in my judgment &#8211; for example, in relation to Mr Sohewon or, more generally, in relation to what the Official Solicitor calls MF&#8217;s &#8220;manipulation and manufacture of evidence&#8221; &#8211; I propose to proceed on the basis of my findings, nothing more and nothing less (see, for example, judgment paras [87]-[88]).</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other point relates to the Official Solicitor&#8217;s complaints about MF&#8217;s alleged obstruction of the process of his seeking to obtain public funding. This is not something, in my judgment, which I can properly take into account. If the Official Solicitor had cause for complaint (and I am not suggesting that he may not have done) then this was something which, as it seems to me, he could and should have ventilated at the time, either in this court or in the Court of Protection, either of which, it might be thought, would have had ample powers to prise the relevant information out of MF if indeed he was holding it back. </p>

	    <num>47.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first relates to the costs of what everyone is agreed was the central issue, namely (issue (p)) the question of RB&#8217;s best interests and where she should live. Now on this, of course, MF lost, and, moreover, lost in circumstances where he should have had Bracewell J&#8217;s warning well in mind. In the circumstances there is, in my judgment, no sensible basis upon which MF can seek his costs, whether against the local authority or, for that matter, the Official Solicitor. So far as his costs are concerned, there should be no order. But I go further. I am not persuaded that in all the circumstances of the case it would be right, just or fair, to order MF to pay these costs. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Four factors in particular persuade me to this conclusion. First, what everyone accepts is the general approach to costs in this type of case. Second, the fact that MF was not seeking to re-open an issue which had previously been determined by the court after a full hearing. Prior to the hearing before me in December 2008, the court had made only interim orders. It is quite a strong thing in a case of this kind to say that the answer is so clear that a final hearing is either unnecessary or, at least, to be undertaken only at risk of an adverse order for costs. Third, the fact that MF&#8217;s case did have a real measure of support from two expert witnesses. Although one was heavily criticised the other was not (compare judgment paras [104], [163], with paras [117]-[118]). Moreover, the case against MF on the facts was not all one way and not quite as dark as his opponents saw it (judgment para [165]). Fourth, the fact that, if there was indeed litigation misconduct sufficient to justify penalising MF in costs, then that can be done by way of a &#8216;split&#8217; or &#8216;issues-based&#8217; costs order.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second question relates to the costs of the sexual abuse issue (issue (a)) and, in particular, the apology issue. On this I agree with the local authority that there should not be any order for costs in favour of either MF or the Official Solicitor. My reasons are in essence those articulated by Ms Greaney.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns MF&#8217;s costs, any claim which he might conceivably have against the local authority in relation to this issue would be swamped by the claims which the local authority would have against him in relation to the many issues (for example, issues (c), (f), (g), (h), (m) and (n)) where much time was taken up by him in attacks on the local authority or its representatives which signally failed. The fact that the local authority has chosen not to pursue MF in relation to those costs, when it might well have done, is no reason why he should have his costs. In my judgment he should not.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns the Official Solicitor&#8217;s costs, this was an issue which arose primarily as between MF and the local authority. It did not in substance affect the Official Solicitor and I doubt that it contributed in any very significant way to his costs. The reality, in my judgment, is that it is well nigh impossible to assess the additional burden upon the Official Solicitor, but the burden, whatever it may have been, was comparatively modest when assessed in the wider scheme of things. Accordingly I decline to make any specific order in relation to these costs.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third question relates to the costs of all the other issues. The stark facts here are that these were almost all peripheral issues which had more to do with MF&#8217;s personal concerns than with RB&#8217;s welfare; that on all these issues MF lost; and that in very large measure both his pursuit of these issues and the manner in which he chose to do so were unreasonable. I do not propose to rehearse what is set out in great detail in my judgment; the key points have already been summarised (see in particular the language extracted in paragraph [35] above). </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances the Official Solicitor, in my judgment, is entitled in principle to an order for costs against MF in relation to all these issues. In relation to these issues MF&#8217;s conduct of the litigation was far outside the ambit of what is reasonable or appropriate in a case of this kind. His behaviour over a very long period takes him, in my judgment, far outside the circumstances where it is appropriate to make no order as to costs. On the contrary, his pursuit of all these issues, and more particularly the extravagant, strident and on occasions vicious way in which he chose to pursue them, mark this out as a classic case for making an adverse order for costs. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I recognise, of course, that the fact that a litigant&#8217;s conduct opens the door to the making of an adverse order for costs does not, without more ado, justify actually making an order. But in the present case the factors that open the door also more than justify &#8211; indeed, in my judgment they demand &#8211; making the order the Official Solicitor seeks.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The question then becomes how most fairly and justly to give effect to this. It is unthinkable that I should make an order requiring a detailed assessment on an issue by issue basis. This is quite plainly a case where I should order MF to pay a percentage of the Official Solicitor&#8217;s costs, that percentage reflecting the principle that MF is not to be required to pay the Official Solicitor&#8217;s costs of the central issue or of the sexual abuse issue but only his costs of the other issues. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The assessment of such a percentage is inevitably impressionistic and produces a figure which can at best be only a rough approximation. Mathematical precision is impossible. I have to take a broad axe and do my best to achieve what in the nature of things can only be rough justice. I have of course been steeped in the minutiae of the case over a number of hearings spanning some five years. I take that into account. I bear in mind that whatever the time spent on the various other issues, the central issue would inevitably and on any basis have taken up a substantial proportion of the overall time and costs. And I also bear in mind that the proportion of space occupied by the various issues in my judgment bears only a tenuous relation to the time and costs expended on them before and during the final hearing.</p>

The Official Solicitor has succeeded, but only against MF and only in part. There has been no suggestion from the local authority that it might wish to seek any costs. I suspect that, assessed in the context of the wider picture, the costs incurred since I gave judgment, whether by the Official Solicitor or the local authority, are comparatively modest. In my judgment, broad justice will be done if I make no order in relation to the costs since 30 September 2010.  </p>
