There have been two occasions in the past when she has made determined efforts.  The first occurred in September 2014, where she planned to travel with two other young girls.  It seems that at the very last minute she lost her nerve and she did not travel, though her two companions did.  This year, on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> April, she made a further effort and was detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/11/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/11" uk:canonical="2000 c. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Terrorism Act 2000</ref> at an Airport, seeking to board a flight for Turkey having obtained a one-way ticket.  The staff of the airline or airport (I am unclear which) were suspicious, as well they might be, of a single young woman travelling to Turkey on a single ticket.  They notified the terrorism unit and she was returned to her family.</span></p>

It is plain to me, having heard evidence at this urgent application, that neither she nor her parents, in particular her mother, her father having been largely passive, has been consistent, open and honest with the police.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">A little while ago the police were contacted by a man purporting to be a cousin of this young woman.  He told them that there was to be a family wedding and that Z wanted to attend.  That telephone call was on Tuesday, 1</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">st</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> June.  That led the officers involved to speak to Z's mother.  I have been told that the mother has created every impression of being in the depths of anxious turmoil during the course of the last 24 hours.  She resolved that however by making an application this morning to the police for the return of the passport.  The police, quite wrongly, in my view, took the view that they were constrained to return the passport.  They were not.  An immediate telephone application could have been made seeking to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court and Wardship.  Moreover, it seems to me that given the escalation of concern by this morning, to which I will refer in a moment, there were obvious powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/11/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.7</ref> of the Terrorism Act.  I make these observations not to be critical in any way of those involved in these challenging situations but merely to try to ensure that there is proper sharing of knowledge through the various regional counterterrorist units.  I have been concerned that those channels of information do not run as efficiently as they need to.</span></p>

The officer was very clear regarding this inconsistency.  Moreover, when first asked about the plans to travel, Z's mother had said that it was for Z to, as she put it, "Wash her brain", by which I understood her to mean that she wished to encourage her daughter to reintegrate into her family and reabsorb its values.  She did not mention any marriage ceremony.</span></p>
