At the time, the average length of a care case was around 57 weeks.  This was unacceptable.  The Review recommended a maximum of 26 weeks.  The Government accepted the recommendation and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6" uk:canonical="2014 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children and Families Act 2014</ref> was enacted.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 14</ref> imposes a statutory limit on care proceedings of 26 weeks, albeit that the period can be extended but only if it is necessary to resolve the proceedings justly.  Extensions are not to be granted routinely and each extension is to be for no more than eight weeks.</p>

By my calculations, that is some 148 weeks ago.  I am dismayed by this.  It is completely wrong.  E. has been let down in a quite unacceptable way.  The strain on E.&#8217;s mother has been huge.  She has been let down as well.  Everything that could go wrong in this case has gone wrong.   E. and her family are due an apology for this unacceptable state of affairs.   </p>

She was badly let down by her parents who did not provide her with good parenting. Some of the documents say she was accommodated in care pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in March 2008, although she herself believes it was earlier than this when she was aged approximately eleven.  She clearly did not have a happy experience in care, moving from placement to placement.  She has 22 previous convictions, many of which relate to the period that she was in care homes.   I am told that the offences include violence, racial abuse and criminal damage.  Over the years, there has been concern as to her mental health, her aggressive behaviour, her use of drugs and a chaotic lifestyle.    </p>

Care proceedings were instituted on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014.  The Local Authority placed the Mother and E. at the Beacon Lodge Family Centre, Finchley in January 2014, immediately after E. left hospital.  It was supposed to be an eight-week assessment but there were difficulties.  It is alleged that the Mother initially failed to attend to E.&#8217;s basic care needs.  It is said she was aggressive and that she refused to engage.  Abuse to staff was said to have improved following a verbal warning. There was intensive supervision but, on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2014, the Mother asked for E. to be taken into care.  Beacon Lodge terminated the placement and E. was moved to foster carers, initially pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> and, from 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2014, as a result of an interim care order.  </p>

A psychiatrist, Dr O reported on the Mother.  There was no evidence of a psychiatric illness or personality disorder but the Mother did have anger management issues which the Mother said she would like to address.  The doctor thought that, if she cooperated fully, improvement would be expected within 3-6 months.  </p>

This is not optional.  It is mandatory.  An Independent Social Worker, SM was asked to report.  She did so on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2014.  She highlighted the Mother&#8217;s vulnerability, such as to domestic violence and her inability to control her emotions.

Later that month, the Mother started counselling with AC at KCA (now known as Addaction).  To her credit, the Mother began to change her behaviour.  This included, for a time, ending her use of cannabis but it appears that this increased her anxiety.  Ms SM reported again on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014.   She noted a change in the Mother&#8217;s skin tone, her eyes and her body language.  She was hardly smoking cannabis.  She displayed an insight as to the Father.  She had made a substantial change and, although the change was late and the decision finely balanced, Ms SM thought that rehabilitation was feasible.</p>

She found that there was a clear emotional bond between the Mother and E. but set out all the difficulties that I have briefly outlined above. In particular, she made findings as to the Mother&#8217;s loss of control in court in January 2015.  She went on to find that E. deserved a permanent home where she could thrive.  The care plan for adoption was found to be appropriate and proportionate.  She made a placement order, saying no other order would do.  She dispensed with parental consent.  Slightly surprisingly, she immediately granted permission to appeal.   </p>

It could not stand as the District Judge had made factual findings on which no evidence had been given such as in relation to the incident at court on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2015 about which the Mother had not given evidence and had not had the opportunity to call a witness.  The Circuit Judge considered this was a central finding as the rest of the updating evidence had been positive. Contact was thereafter increased first to twice per week and then to three times per week including one session of community based contact.</p>

Permission was given to instruct a second Independent Social Worker, LC to undertake a parenting assessment.  The case was only finally relisted for hearing on 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015, before Mr Recorder Bedingfield.  He dismissed the application for the placement order. He followed the recommendations of Ms CT.  He required the preparation of a new care plan based on a phased rehabilitation plan to Mother lasting 6 to 8 weeks.  It is a long judgment and I do not propose to rehearse all his findings.  Suffice it to say that he found there was a bond between the Mother and daughter.  Contact was positive.  The Mother had engaged well.  Her guidance and boundaries were good.  Both took pleasure in the other&#8217;s company.  He considered there would be harm to E. if the bond was severed.  There had been a sea change in the Mother and, although she sometimes shouted at professionals, she was not out of control.  She was able to provide warmth and set consistent boundaries and could take the foster mother&#8217;s advice without getting upset.  He also made some findings that were not positive in relation to the Father and four incidents of domestic violence; to the Mother&#8217;s cannabis use; to her lack of a positive experience of parenting; and as to the risk of breakdown of placement but he thought the pressures on the Mother would lessen if the proceedings were over.  He disagreed with the Guardian who recommended a placement order finding that the risk was manageable although it remained a finely balanced case.  He was not appealed.   </p>

The Mother&#8217;s appeal was allowed and the final care order set aside.  An interim care order was made and the case was returned for reconsideration by a High Court Judge.   In the judgment, Black LJ set out four incidents that led to the change in the care plan, namely the Mother&#8217;s involvement with the Father on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015; her walking out of a contact review on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016; the incident at Canary Wharf station on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016; and her reaction at the child protection conference on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2016.  Black LJ said that the Recorder failed to put these four incidents into proper context and why they justified a change in direction.  If the decision had tipped the other way from November 2015, it would be necessary for it to be founded on well-established facts.  She noted that E. was not present at any of these incidents.  There was insufficient analysis of whether the alleged Local Authority failures to support the Mother contributed materially to the Mother&#8217;s difficulties.  Finally, it was clear that the Local Authority had decided on placement for adoption but the Recorder did not consider it. She was, however, at pains to say that nothing in the judgment should be taken as an indication of the likely outcome following the rehearing.   </p>

Given the maternal grandmother&#8217;s abject care for the Mother relatively recently, such an assessment was surprising.  It undoubtedly upset the Mother significantly.

On E.&#8217;s return to the foster carers in March, E. seemed more anxious, frightened and clingy.  Her emotional security is to the foster mother.  She is a happy, friendly and easy going child.  E. went two months without contact to her Mother as the Mother cancelled the June contact.  Mr MM says that E. calls the foster mother, Mummy M., which angers the Mother.

The evidence placed before the court must address all the options which are realistically possible and must contain an analysis of the arguments for and against each option and, in particular, the nature and extent of the risk of harm involved in each of the options (Paragraph [34]).  The need for analysis of the pros and cons and a full reasoned recommendation was essential if the exacting test set out in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re B</span> and the requirements of Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention are to be met (Paragraph [36]).  There must be adequately reasoned judgments (Paragraph [43]).  The court rejected a linear approach whereby each option other than the most draconian is considered and rejected in isolation.  Instead, a balancing exercise is required in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives.  Each option should then be compared, side by side, against the competing option or options (Paragraphs [49] &#8211; [50]).  </p>

He had to tell her, at their first meeting, that the Local Authority plan remained one of adoption as she asked him and he would have been misleading her to say otherwise.  Whilst I accept this was very difficult for the Mother to accept, I find that he is not the sort of man who would be insensitive in conveying this to the Mother.  Indeed, he told me that, he first spoke to her over the telephone and she said to him that she did not want any &#8220;baby snatchers&#8221; in the house.  When he first met with her, she was very hostile.  She said he should be ashamed of his culture and religion.  Given the racial heritage of the Father, I do find this an odd reaction from the Mother.  She then asked him what the plan was and he said it was adoption but that did not mean he was taking that view.  She slammed the door and stormed off.  She has basically had nothing to do with him or anyone else from the Local Authority since.  This has undoubtedly harmed the Mother&#8217;s case.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The sixth witness was the Independent Social Worker, CT. I took on the role of calling her to give evidence to enable all three advocates to cross-examine her.  She is a very experienced social worker and has been a part-time Cafcass Guardian since 1999.  She is a strong supporter of the Mother being given an opportunity to care for E.  She accepts that this could not be an instantaneous return to her care.  In addition, the Mother would need to undertake a number of courses in relation to drug misuse, parenting and anger management.  It is right to note at this point that her position is diametrically opposed to that of the Guardian, SC.  I will obviously return in due course to consider this divergence of opinion when I reach my conclusions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother was incredibly distressed for much of the case.  She sat through the evidence of the social workers on Monday getting more tearful as the day went on.  She did not return on the Tuesday.  I accepted her absence on the basis that she felt unable to sit through adverse evidence to her yet again.  She was due to give evidence on the Wednesday after Ms CT.  She was not at court at 10.30 but arrived mid-morning. She did not enter the court and despite the presence of her very supportive solicitor, in whom she clearly has a great deal of confidence, she felt unable to remain and left.  She was therefore not present when it came to her turn to give evidence.</p>

At one point, Mr Pavlou upset her by one of his questions and she left court.  Again, her lawyers managed to get her back and I sat slightly late to conclude her evidence.

I will have to make findings in due course as to whether it is just the stress of this litigation that is causing her anxiety and distress or whether it goes deeper than that.  She has been through a very great deal in this litigation and it is not surprising that it has made her angry and distressed but I have to consider whether her anxiety will disappear if I was to find that E. could return to her care.  After all, Mr Recorder Bedingfield did so find in November 2015 but she clearly remained very anxious.  Her main concern, it appears justifiably, was that the Local Authority would remove E. from her care again.  She would undoubtedly continue to be terrified of this if I agreed with her proposals.  </p>

She told me that she did feel like giving up some days as it was a constant battle.  I do not criticise her for this but it is as a result of a number of factors, including the dreadful stress of these appalling proceedings that have gone wrong at just about every point as well as the clear difficulties she had after the second judgment of Mr Recorder Bedingfield and her current anxiety combined with her belief that E. will be taken from her again even if returned.  She has specifically said she wants what is best for E.  She does not want E. to go through what she encountered from her mother, particularly during her teens.  I find that there is a little part of her that has wondered whether adoption would be best for E.  I make it quite clear that I do not criticise her for any of this.  In fact, it goes to her great credit.  She has been putting E. first and that deserves the greatest praise.  </p>

I accept that she has not been involved in the case for as long as Ms CT but that is not her fault.  Moreover, that point is somewhat diluted by the fact that the previous Guardian had also supported the Local Authority&#8217;s care plan throughout.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am equally satisfied that there have been many operational failings by the Local Authority in performing its duties as to its social work function.  These have occurred at a significant number of points in the case but were particularly evident at the time that rehabilitation to the Mother was ordered by Mr Recorder Bedingfield.  For example, the order of the Recorder dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2015 required the Local Authority to convene a professionals meeting by 4pm on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015.  It did not do so.  It did attempt to arrange a meeting but gave Ms CT such little notice that she could not attend.  The Local Authority did not, therefore, comply with the next order, namely to file a new care plan setting out the detail of the rehabilitation plan within seven days of the meeting.  </p>

Whilst the Mother may have carried some of the responsibly for this, I am satisfied that the Local Authority did not assist in the way that it should. Correspondence from the Mother&#8217;s solicitors was not responded to such that judicial review had to be threatened.  Eventually, the Local Authority agreed to provide the Mother with &#163;234.31 per week in a recital to an order dated 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016 but I am satisfied that even that did not go smoothly.  Moreover, there was difficulty with the Mother getting her travel warrants to attend KCA for her drug and anger management therapy.  Later, she was unable to attend this therapy as only one hour of child care was provided via PKS.  As the KCA appointment was also for one-hour and she had to travel to and from the venue, it made it virtually impossible for her to continue with the work.  </p>

Mr Recorder Bedingfield had made criticisms of Ms T in his judgment.  I accept Ms Maclachlan&#8217;s submission that Ms T should not have been invited to the contact review meeting in January 2016, although I do not accept that this was a deliberate attempt by the Local Authority to get the Mother to lose her cool.  I do recognise that, for example, the issue of the Mother&#8217;s leaving care grant, which I have been told is some &#163;2,000, was very much in issue and needed to be dealt with.  However, given the Mother&#8217;s opposition, the Local Authority should have respected that.  It was another unnecessary failing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, the position of the Local Authority throughout this period left much to be desired.  At one point in February/March 2016, it was inviting the court to make no order at all.  At another, it sought only a supervision order.  It then changed tack completely in later March 2016 to ask for a full care order.  On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2016, it had been indicating it would be withdrawing the PKS workers.  I accept that they could not continue to go into the home for ever, let alone daily but it is in stark contrast to a care plan only eight days later for removal.  The way in which the Mother was told of the change in the care plan in the child protection conference on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> March 2016 was very insensitive, particularly as E. was present in the building, albeit with a PKS worker.  I accept that it was always going to be difficult to tell the Mother.  Is it better to do it in her home or with her solicitor or in the Local Authority offices?  It was not, however, right to do it in the meeting. It was bound to distress the Mother enormously.  </p>

First, the Mother was quite wrong to invite the Father to her home on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015.  She knew the danger he posed.  She had suffered significant domestic violence at his hands.   She has suggested that she invited him there to ask him for financial assistance due to the failure of the Local Authority to support her.  Whilst that may have been part of it, she says in her statement that she invited him because she felt &#8220;low&#8221;.  I prefer the latter explanation as the main motivator.  This is another indication of her vulnerability, isolation and lack of support.  </p>

I cannot find that he was living there but there were clearly unresolved feelings between them at the time.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was inevitable that inviting him back would lead to difficulties, particularly in the context that E. was soon to be returned.  I am satisfied that there was an argument and that the Father refused to leave.  The Mother denies that there was any damage to a television.  All I would say is that it would be odd if the Police recorded that if it was completely untrue.  It appears to have come from the Father and I cannot see why he would admit to such damage if he had not done it.  Nevertheless, I make no finding.  The position was, however, bad enough for the Mother to call the Concierge to ask him to seek assistance from the Police.  I accept that the Mother acted responsibly in calling the Concierge.  I further accept that she behaved responsibly when she told the Local Authority, although she may well have expected the Local Authority would find out anyway.  The difficulty is that this shows that she turned to the Father when she was feeling low, notwithstanding her knowledge of the dangers he posed and the threat this was to the return of E. to her care only a few weeks later.  If E. had been present, she would undoubtedly have been harmed.  </p>

There is no credible evidence as to his presence recently, let alone that he was the father in the pregnancy this summer.  I accept the Mother&#8217;s evidence that he was &#8220;bad-mouthing&#8221; her and she called him in March 2016 to &#8220;warn him off&#8221;.  On the balance of probabilities, I find that she does now view the relationship as at an end.  I am not sure what would happen if E. was returned to her care.  It might spark the Father into further action as I am sure he would find out.  It is correct that he has not shown any real interest in E. over the years but it is a small additional risk factor.  I remind myself, however, that the Mother could protect herself by means of an injunction if necessary.</p>

She says it was after a &#8220;one-night stand&#8221;.  The Local Authority submits that this is unlikely as it was exactly what she said when she got pregnant the previous year. I remind myself that she did lie about the identity of the father on that occasion although I have accepted that E.&#8217;s Father was not the father of the baby this year.  I find, however, that it does show her vulnerability.  She needed male company.  We know nothing of this man other than that he appears to be White British and to have a girlfriend who resides on the same Estate.  She does have a friend called A. but she denied any sexual relationship with him. She did say that he could give her money if she needed it.  I do not know if this is right or just an off-the-cuff remark but I do not suppose he would give her money unless he, at the very least, hoped for a relationship.  Again, we know nothing about him although I make it quite clear that this is not an important aspect in my decision.  I remind myself that the Mother has not done the Freedom Programme.  I cannot speculate but I do find that her choice of partners remains a risk factor.</p>

I do not see why he would need help getting out of the Station.  She could have given him directions to the Court.  I entirely accept that the day would have been stressful for her but so are many days when you are caring for a young child.  She lost her temper and behaved badly.  As I have not heard from the London Transport staff, I cannot find that there were threats of violence but it was sufficiently serious for the Police to be involved.

Second, she tells me that she is unable to work with the local authority but can work with the local authority where she lives.  She therefore asks me to make a supervision order to them.

Having said that, the Minutes of the Conference say that her behaviour was &#8220;challenging, confrontational and difficult&#8221; throughout the majority of the Conference.  She showed little respect for the social worker and the Chair with inappropriate laughter and insulting comments referring to them as &#8220;baby snatchers&#8221;.

She said she was fed up with the social services controlling her life as she had not done anything wrong and that it would not matter if she did not attend as they don&#8217;t listen to her.  This was all before she knew of the change of plan.  Her solicitor had to convince her to attend.  This is of some relevance to the issue as to whether or not she can work with the social workers in the future when things become difficult.  It is said that she has shown that she can work with the Guardian even though the Guardian is against her.  It has to be said, however, that she has not been prepared to meet the Guardian without her solicitor.  She even said that she would not attend the contact the Guardian wished to observe if her solicitor was not present.  This was before the Guardian reported.  Moreover, once a final order is made in this case, her solicitor will cease to be involved and the Mother would have to work with professionals without the support that her solicitor undoubtedly gives her.  </p>

Overall, I consider that the position is not encouraging.  If anything, it has got worse as there is no relationship with Mr MM at all and I have found that the Mother has reacted unreasonably in relation to him.

There were some initial problems with E. not sleeping and being difficult about eating.  She also appears to have been kicking and hitting the Mother.  Such incidents are not surprising and I do not criticise the Mother for them.  She is clearly good at dealing with E.&#8217;s tantrums by deflection using appropriate language and tones.  Her home was kept clean, tidy and warm.  There was lots of eye contact, praise, encouragement and physical closeness.  E. presented as being happy and confident.  I find that it may not be nearly so easy if E. was to return to Mother now although this is not in any way the Mother&#8217;s fault.

I do find, however, that she is at present vulnerable and fragile.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the March hearing, the contact was immediately reduced to once every two months.  I consider this was too abrupt and it would have been better to have reduced it gradually. As it turned out, it might not have made a difference if the Mother had been too upset to attend contact during this period but I do not know that for sure.  In fact, she has only had six contact visits since March 2016.  In nearly eight months, this is a low level of contact.  Three visits have been cancelled.  One was when she was too upset.  The second was when she was ill with morning sickness when she was pregnant. The third was when Mr MM wished to observe the contact. I do consider that it was not reasonable of her to cancel for that reason.  By then the contact was back to fortnightly but that is still not a high level.  It meant that E. did not see her Mother for a month.  Whilst I recognise that the Mother considers it was pointless for Mr MM to observe the contact, I would have expected her wish to see E. to be at the forefront of her thinking.</p>

On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016, the Mother did lose her cool when initially told that her solicitor could not come into the contact which the Guardian was observing.  She became agitated, protesting about the decision and commenting several times that &#8220;this is a joke&#8221;.  I accept the Guardian&#8217;s analysis that she was behaving like a &#8220;stroppy teenager&#8221; and that the Guardian was uncomfortable.  She questioned how E. would react if she saw her Mother behaving like this.  The Local Authority also sought to rely on an alleged incident on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016 when she attended at the Local Authority&#8217;s offices with her friend, ML.  The log says that she was quite aggressive and used inappropriate language towards the receptionist before shouting at another service user.  The only part of the log accepted by the Mother was that she &#8220;ripped to pieces&#8221; the paperwork she was seeking.  I have not heard from the receptionist and cannot make findings but it is clear that, on her own evidence, the Mother did lose her temper by tearing up the paperwork.  </p>

E. runs into her Mother&#8217;s arms.  The Mother is warm, cheerful and thrilled to see her daughter.  E. reciprocates and enjoys the contact greatly.  There is undoubtedly a bond.  The Mother loves E. and E. loves her.  I accept all of this.  I do, however, equally accept that E. herself has displayed anxiety since the return to the foster carers.  She is concerned that she will be removed from them again.  She has found it difficult to adjust to nursery. She is worried that the foster mother will not collect her.  I do not find that any of this is as a result of anything the Mother did when E. was with her Mother but it is a function of the various moves of carer that have taken place.  I do find that any return to Mother&#8217;s care now would be significantly more difficult to manage than it was on the last occasion.  </p>

She has gone from one zoot per day to three zoots.  This is a clear indication of her increased anxiety and fragility. She told the Guardian that she had ceased taking cannabis on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2016 but it lasted one day, as the Guardian predicted. She has told me she has reduced her cannabis intake recently but I am not satisfied as to this without far more information.  She told the Guardian that she was using skunk, which is a significantly stronger version of the drug.  She told me that she did not know the difference between ordinary cannabis and skunk, which I did find surprising although she seemed to be genuine when she told me.  Having said that, she did accept that it was skunk she was buying and the Guardian told me that this is now the normal way in which cannabis is sold.  </p>

This Mother has been using cannabis since she was aged thirteen.  It does not appear to have affected her as badly as some.  It has not prevented her getting to contact on time even early in the morning.  It has not stopped her providing a good level of care for her daughter but I simply do not know what damage it is really doing.   I strongly suspect that, in the long term, it is making her anxiety worse rather than better even though it does deal with the symptoms at the time.  Moreover, the Mother accepts that the cost is some &#163;10 per day or &#163;70 per week. Given the enormous squeeze on benefits, I simply do not know how someone can spend that amount of money without a really serious effect on their standard of living.  All this would have a real effect on E. too if it was to continue notwithstanding what the Mother said about prioritising E.  </p>

She said to me on more than one occasion that this did concern her, particularly if the Mother was taking skunk.  She said she did not know of the increase in usage and there was no disagreement as to the seriousness of the risk if she was using three zoots per day. She accepted that the Mother would have to deal with this before E. could be safely returned and she was not advocating an immediate return to that Mother&#8217;s care.  She reminded me that the Mother had managed to achieve periods of abstinence in the past (on one occasion of some four months) but she has always returned to the drug.  I find that, without professional help, there is no chance of her being able to cease its use.  In due course, it may start to have severely adverse effects upon her mental health.</p>

She has not even allowed him into her flat.  She has refused to give the Local Authority her new mobile telephone number.  She would not see the Guardian without her solicitor.

She told me that the care plan had to change in March 2016 for a number of reasons.  I accept that one was invalid, namely the alleged injuries to E. in the Mother&#8217; care.  The others, however, were legitimate concerns, namely lack of engagement with professionals, the history of lack of cooperation, the Mother&#8217;s volatile outbursts at times and her drug misuse.  The second social worker, Mr AD was involved from March 2016 until the end of June 2016 when he left the local authority.  The first thing he did was to alter the care plan to one for removal of E. from the Mother.  I entirely accept that this must have come from his managers as his involvement until then had been peripheral to say the least but, as he grew into the case, he clearly formed the view that removal was correct.  He did not change his view before me although he also referred to inappropriate supervision leading to injuries, which I have rejected.  </p>

He has been quite unable to do his job properly given the refusal of the Mother to engage, which I have already found to be unreasonable.  I accept that he was an inexperienced social worker having only qualified in July 2013.  This was only his second contested care proceedings.  I have already indicated that I was impressed by him but I accept that it would have been far better given the terrible history of this case if it had been allocated to a more experienced social worker or even a team manager.  Nevertheless, his evidence was compelling.  He accepted that his ability to contribute had been hampered by the Mother&#8217;s unwillingness to communicate with him and that there had been no shift in her position since the Court of Appeal decision.   He accepted that the Mother showed some strengths but he could not see E. having permanency with the Mother in the long term.  He told me that, in general, children do better with their families but, in this case, he could only see the concerns continuing in the foreseeable future.  He said that E. needs permanency. She is very anxious.  The Mother is unable to engage with him and any improvement would be, in his view, outside E.&#8217;s timescales.  Consistency had not been demonstrated.  The Mother needs to do a lot of work before she could care safely for a child.  This includes work as to domestic violence, drug misuse, anxiety and anger management.  I accept his evidence save in one aspect.  He was critical of the Mother&#8217;s basic parenting and her alleged inability to draw boundaries. I accept he has been hampered by his inability to see the Mother with E. but I do not consider his conclusion fair.  In this regard alone, I reject his evidence.  </p>

I accept that she did not consider the work had to be completed before a return, which was different to the other professionals.   She accepted that use of skunk has a detrimental effect on behaviour and it would concern her if the Mother was using this strong form of cannabis.  I have already found that the Mother has used skunk.

The Webster-Stratton course never happened.  The only referral was a late one to Mellow Parenting in February 2016.  The professionals meeting never happened.

She considered the Mother got angry to mask her anxiety.  It makes it more likely for incidents to occur when her stress is high.  The Guardian went on to say that the Mother would understandably be really anxious if E. was returned to her care.  A particular concern would be that E. would be taken away again, such as if E. got a bruise or the Mother fell out with somebody.  It would be unrealistic to expect children&#8217;s services not to be involved.  This all makes the Mother much more vulnerable.  The Guardian accepted that the Mother is very likeable and this makes taking decisions more difficult.  The simple fact of the matter is that the Mother is very sensitive to criticism.   It is no coincidence that incidents occur when difficult things are going on such that she is more likely to be volatile at that time.  She said that none of the issues raised are new issues.  </p>

Her concerns were the Mother&#8217;s cannabis use; her inability to work with professionals; her anxiety and the possible threat of domestic violence. She said that, although the Father may be out of the picture, all the other concerns had increased since it was a finely balanced decision by Mr Recorder Bedingfield.  Cannabis use has increased.  Anxiety has increased.  There is now a complete failure to work with the Local Authority social worker.  I accept all these points.  The Guardian said it is too much for the Mother to manage.  She has succeeded at times but has not been able to sustain the success, such as cannabis abstinence despite wishing to stop taking it.  The Mother had denied addiction to cannabis.

I accept that the four main issues cannot allow me to return E. to the Mother safely.  The least significant is the concern as to domestic violence but the other three are serious, namely her cannabis addiction; her anxiety and her inability to work consistently with professionals.  I am absolutely clear that, if a further rehabilitation was to be tried in say six months&#8217; time, even after extensive work, there would remain issues, incidents and problems.

If the Mother cannot care for E., E. needs a permanent family for her life.  She cannot remain in the uncertainty and limbo of the care system.  In short, having ruled out the Mother, I accept that it must be adoption.  Nothing else will do.  I am not playing lip service to this requirement.
