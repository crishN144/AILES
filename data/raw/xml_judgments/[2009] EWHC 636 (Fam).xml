It is brought under Article 15 of The Hague Convention, which came into force pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref>.

The father, A, is a British national, the mother, H, is from The Netherlands.  They went through an Islamic wedding 3 days after the mother came to England in August 2006.  On 31 March 2008 the mother, without notice to the father, took M to The Netherlands where they have both remained.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father started Hague Convention proceedings in June 2008 in The Netherlands.  It led to the present request.  The issue it raises is whether the father had, in March 2008, &#8220;rights of custody&#8221; as defined under the Convention, an essential prerequisite to his Hague Convention application.  If he did, the removal was wrongful under the Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The legal difficulties that resulted have led to a delay of 6 months before determination.  They have involved the appointment of an Advocate to the Court and representation on behalf of the Registrar General of Births and Deaths and the Secretary of State for Justice as Interveners. The hearing, with evidence and a reading day, lasted 4 days, with numerous authorities before the court.  Even then argument was not concluded, with further submissions in writing being forwarded a week later. I have endeavoured to answer those which are essential, whilst mindful that this will not be comprehensive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The result is that, a year after M was removed and 9 months after Hague Convention proceedings started in The Netherlands, a date for a final hearing has not been fixed.  It awaits an answer to the request.  A review of the delay on behalf of the father has not shown any obvious lessons to be learned.  It is the problem of advocates advancing a full range of arguments and the difficulty for the court in predetermining points before they are fully addressed in what are bound to be complex situations.  I am fortunate to have had experienced counsel to address me.</p>

There were hearings in The Hague District Court leading to the request of 6 October 2008. In the course of those proceedings the mother denied that the father had rights of custody in respect of M.  The father in answer relied on the fact that his name appeared on M&#8217;s birth certificate.  He also claimed that he had rights of custody pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/31/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/31" uk:canonical="1976 c. 31" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Legitimacy Act 1976</ref>.   The mother said that the father's name should not have appeared on the birth certificate and denied his claim. It is as a result of those rival contentions that the present request was made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition to the issue of rights of custody, the mother seeks rectification of M&#8217;s birth certificate.  It may be helpful at this stage to list the route by which it is said the father had parental responsibility or otherwise acquired rights of custody.  There is also a claim by the father that he had inchoate rights of custody in the particular circumstances which arose here. It is common ground that if parental responsibility or inchoate rights of custody are established, then the father has rights of custody within the Hague Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s position has been clear from the beginning of proceedings in The Netherlands.  The father does not have parental responsibility.  There were means by which he could have sought to acquire it, but not by registering M&#8217;s birth in the manner that he did. He did not acquire rights of custody whether by this or any other means.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his later written submissions, Mr Setright raises the question whether inchoate rights should be considered within domestic law or within the autonomous jurisdiction of the Hague Convention.  I am satisfied that firstly I have to determine the father&#8217;s rights in English law.  If they do not include parental responsibility, that may not be a complete answer. There could be instances where an unmarried father had rights of custody, whether inchoate or otherwise, without having parental responsibility.  This is because of the international aspect and autonomous nature of the Hague Convention.</p>

It is to treat the child of a void marriage as if the marriage was valid provided one or both parents reasonably believed the marriage was valid when the child was conceived.  The child is therefore legitimate and the father has parental responsibility as a result. However the belief has to be that the marriage was valid in English law (see the Court of Appeal decision in Misha Azad v Dhaka (2001) Imm AR 318 at para 13). It follows that a belief that the marriage was valid by reason of a ceremony not recognised as constituting a valid marriage is not sufficient.</p>

He said he would sort it out and told the mother that she did not need to come.  She did offer to go with him but he refused.  He did not then or later explain to her the significance of his being named as the father on the birth certificate.  The birth certificate itself provides no information about how the father came to be registered in that capacity.  It does not say that an application by an unmarried father resulting in him being named on the birth certificate can confer parental responsibility on him.</p>

If the father is right that the process at the Registry was the same on all 3 occasions, he cannot have been registered as the father unless he said he was married, or reasonably believed he was if the guidance was followed. Yet though the Islamic ceremony of marriage may have been crucial to the father, both he and the mother knew that it was not one that was recognised in English law.  He was being asked this for the purposes of registration which he knew potentially gave rise to rights in English law.</p>

Is it to be confined to what lawyers would instantly recognised as established rights &#8211; that is to say those which are propounded by law or conferred by court: or is it capable of being applied in a Convention context to describe the inchoate rights of those who are caring out duties and enjoying privileges of a custodial or parental character which, though not yet formally recognised or granted by law, a court would nevertheless be likely to upholding the interests of the child concerned?  The answer to that question must, in my judgment, depend upon the circumstances of each case.  If, before the child&#8217;s abduction, the aggrieved parent was exercising functions in the requesting State of a parental or custodial nature without the benefit of any court order or official custodial status, it must in every case be a question for the courts of the requested State to determine whether those functions fall to be regarded as &#8216;rights of custody&#8217; within the terms of the Convention.  At one end of the scale is (for example) a transient cohabitee of the sole legal custodian whose status and functions would be unlikely to be regarded as qualifying for recognition as carrying Convention rights.  The opposite would be true, at the other end of the scale, of a relative or friend who has assumed the role of a substitute parent in place of the legal custodian.&#8221;</p>
