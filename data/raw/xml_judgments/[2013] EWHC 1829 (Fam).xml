	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The circumstances in which I am considering this case could hardly be more unsatisfactory.  The context is a petition for divorce presented here in Birmingham by a wife. She herself resides in Pakistan and appears currently to be unable to visit this country.  She has previously been represented by solicitors, but can no longer afford the cost of doing so.  I have been told on the telephone this morning by the solicitor concerned that legal aid or public funding is not available to her.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Yesterday, 18 June 2013, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, the President of the Supreme Court, gave a public lecture, which is now publicly available, headed:  "Judges and Policy:  A Delicate Balance".  In that lecture he pointed out some of the considerable risks and consequences which may flow, and indeed are already flowing, from reductions in the availability of legal aid.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 27 he said: "&#8230; It is vital for the Ministry [of Justice] to appreciate that any changes which are made to reduce legal aid and cut the cost of litigation are likely to have a knock-on effect on the cost of the courts.  Less legal aid means more unrepresented litigants and worse lawyers, which will lead to longer hearings and more judge time &#8230;"</p>

Lawyers and judges have a duty to help make the system work, as well as warning of the risks of cuts."</p>

As it is, I have no legal representation and no expert evidence of any kind.  I do not even have such basic materials as an orderly bundle of the relevant documents;   a chronology;  case summaries, and still less, any kind of skeleton argument.  Instead, I have had to rummage through the admittedly slim court file, supplemented by various documents handed up to me by the respondent husband today and some material sent by the petitioner wife from Pakistan.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Against that, it should be recognised that I am fundamentally concerned with a petition for divorce brought here in Birmingham by a lady who (for whatever reason) clearly lives in Pakistan.  There is an issue in this case as to the amount of English court time and English public funds which may proportionately and justifiably be expended on trying to unravel here in England what may or may not have taken place in Pakistan concerning a lady who clearly lives there.  </p>

I will call him "the husband".  It appears to be completely common ground between them that they lawfully married in Pakistan on 8 July 2010.  At that time the wife was living in Pakistan. The husband was living here in the Midlands of England, but his ethnic background is clearly that of Pakistan.  </p>

The account given by the wife within the particulars of unreasonable behaviour in her later petition is that the husband sponsored her to come to the United Kingdom on a spouse visa.  She actually arrived here on 6 March 2011 and shortly afterwards gave birth to their only child, Zainab Zubair, on 10 April 2011.  Zainab is, accordingly, now aged just two.  </p>

She says that they both travelled to Pakistan for a family visit on 14 October 2011.  That was about seven months after she first arrived here.  Her petition continues:  "The respondent returned to the United Kingdom on 9th November 2011, leaving the petitioner and the parties' daughter in Pakistan.  The respondent also took the passports of the petitioner and the parties' daughter and these passports remain in his possession.  On 18th November 2011 the respondent telephoned the petitioner and informed her that he has made his decision and does not wish to stay married to her and said:  'How do you want to take the divorce, by court or by phone?'  The petitioner pleaded with the respondent to consider the parties' daughter. However, the respondent refused to listen.  &#8230;"</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was an immediate response by Artis Legal who wrote to the court on      4 December 2012. Their letter said, in part:  "We understand that the respondent has written to you enclosing the certificate of divorce he claims he obtained from the Union Council in Pakistan.  The petitioner does not agree to remove this matter from the list of decree nisi to be pronounced on 10th December 2012.  You will note from the divorce certificate sent by the respondent that he issued the notice of divorce on 17th July 2012 in Pakistan, some three months after the petitioner issued her petition on 15th May 2012 in England.  As the petitioner issued the divorce proceedings first, then these should continue.  Further, there is matrimonial property and financial matters in England that will also need to be resolved.  Therefore this matter should proceed and the decree nisi is pronounced as listed on 10th December 2012."</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Pausing there, that part of that letter from Artis Legal contains, with respect to them, some faulty reasoning.  The assertion that had been made by Park &amp; Co. was (as the husband's case remains) that these parties have already been completely and validly divorced in Pakistan.  If that be right, it is irrelevant whether or not, or what steps took place in Pakistan after the date of issue of the wife's petition here.  The order in which proceedings took place may of course be relevant on an application to stay one set of proceedings in favour of another.  But if in fact these parties had by December 2012 already been divorced in Pakistan, then it would necessarily follow that there could not be an English decree of divorce, for it is a fundamental proposition of English matrimonial law that the court can only dissolve a valid and subsisting marriage.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The letter from Artis Legal also made reference to "matrimonial property and financial matters in England."  Again, even if there are property and financial "matters" here, that cannot be relevant to the grant of a divorce here if in fact the marriage between the parties has and had already been fully dissolved elsewhere.  It may be (I do not know) that there could be other remedies available to the wife here under Part III of the 1984 Act.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This morning the husband has handed to me a considerable sheaf of documents which have very recently been supplied to him by his lawyer in Pakistan.  They actually arrived with him yesterday in a large brown envelope, which I have examined.  Those documents happen to include at page 58 of the bundle a copy of an e-mail which the wife's solicitor here, Mr M Shabir, a partner in Artis Legal, had sent to the wife on 10 December 2012 at 6.15 p.m., describing to her the course of the hearing earlier that day before            District Judge O'Regan.  I think, therefore, that I should, for completeness, read out that e-mail/attendance note.  It reads as follows:  "I attended the court this morning.  Mr Zubair [viz the husband] also attended.  He produced the original divorce certificate from Pakistan and the letter from his advocate in Pakistan.  (I sent these copies to you on Friday).  The judge looked at it and said that as the parties have been divorced there is nothing else for her to dissolve.  I made representations that Mr Zubair is habitually resident in the UK, there is matrimonial property that needs to be distributed.  I said that you do not believe that the divorce documents are genuine.  The judge said that she does not know whether they are genuine or not.  The judge has given you until 7th January 2013 to provide evidence of the authenticity of the documents.  Once you do this, then Mr Zubair will have one month to produce his evidence against your evidence.  There will be a further hearing on first available date after 11th February 2013. &#8230;"  </p>

This is a lengthy document, which appears to be addressed to  "The Inspecting Officer/Assistant Director, Local Government and Rural Development, Lahore".  It is headed  "Petition number 106-31/01/2013".  It appears therefore to have been issued in  "The Office of the Assistant Director" on 31 January 2013.  It is described as  "Revision petition against the order dated 12.11.2012 passed by [the Administrator/Chairman of the Arbitration Council] whereby he issued the impugned certificate of divorce and for the same to be set aside being illegal, unjust, unlawful, coram non judice and a nullity in the eye of law".  </p>

I asked him (as I mentioned, now a considerable time ago) whether she could not obtain public funding in this somewhat complex matter, and he said that legal aid is not available to her in these circumstances.</p>

To date I have managed to handle this case from Pakistan via the solicitors, but at a very high cost and now I am at a stage that I cannot afford the costs any more.  Although this is not a very technical case, I am confident that in person I can explain my case to the honourable court &#8230;   I also want to bring in notification to this honourable court that in Pakistan due to elections 2013 all cases in Pakistani local courts were put on hold.  Similarly, I had challenged the decision of the Pakistani court in Pakistan and refused to accept the divorce through the Pakistani courts.  Therefore the divorce deed, which my husband Muhammad Zubair Riaz had presented in this honourable court is not true and this case is still in progress in the local court.  The court at Pakistan has now postponed that case as well, because they were all heavily busy in conducting elections.  Respected sirs, I am still on my stance that I do not accept this fake divorce deed issued from Pakistan.  I have valid proofs which once presented in the court will be highly in my favour and will lead to the decision in my favour and will hence prove that this divorce is not a valid one and has been issued wrongly by                 Mr M Z Riaz.  As I have already mentioned in the case paperwork that has been submitted, that my passport and my daughter's passport have been taken by Mr M Z Riaz and he is refusing to return [them] due to which I am not in a position to travel back to UK. &#8230;   I would like to request the court to please give some more time so that I can get the decision from the court in Pakistan and this will definitely help in sorting the case in UK also.  Once the matter in Pakistan is solved I will be in a position to present those legal documents to the Birmingham County Court also."</p>

By sheer good fortune, the other case which had been listed for hearing by me today was vacated yesterday for reasons connected with its readiness.  If that case had not been vacated, I, and the litigants in that case, would have been faced with very considerable difficulties and a severe shortage of court time, and probably also additional expenditure to the parties in that case who, as likely as not, would have to have returned on another day.  </p>
