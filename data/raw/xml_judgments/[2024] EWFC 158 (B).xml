Any order made by the Court interferes in family life but the order sought in this case is at the far boundaries of permissible intervention and requires a high level of justification. In considering article 8 it is incumbent on the Court to apply a test of proportionality, reasonableness, necessity, and legality to any proposals under consideration. I pause to note that with proportionality comes a direct consideration as to whether any lesser form of interference might adequately address the concerns in the case. If it would then the proposal before the Court would be judged disproportionate and would be refused.</span></p>

This notion is one which involves avoiding a linear approach, with the endorsement of the last option left standing, rather applying a two-stage analysis under which (1) each option is assessed as to the positives and negatives surrounding that option, and; (2) carrying out a balancing exercise by way of a comparison and contrast of the outcome of these assessments.

The suggestion is that she needs to engage in therapeutic work and at this time there is no confidence that she will do so nor is there confidence as to the outcome of the same, even if completed. It is argued a combination of this work, including likely delay in any commencement (in addition to the work itself), when taken with the need for evidence of sustained change, thereafter, means this falls outside of the timescales for S.

The issue is her ability to apply and sustain an appropriate good level of care. As noted, the MGM withdrew her opposition to the application and was discharged from the proceedings.

Yet the process of interpretation was not without its challenges. The mother&#8217;s evidence was at times confused and it was difficult to ascertain, as I would normally hope to do, what the source of this confusion was. She would respond to simple questions with expanded responses which after translation appeared often not to address the question asked. At times I intervened to attempt to keep her focused on the question but this was rarely successful. I bear in mind her mental health challenges and I have read a number of messages sent by her which are also somewhat unfocused in their content. I appreciate some of that might reflect the application of a translation app but I was left with the sense that the mother was struggling to provide a clear answer to questions asked.</span></p>

The symptoms of PTSD have the potential to impact on her parenting as she has symptoms of anxiety, panic disorder and hallucinations and pseudo-hallucinations. Such symptoms have the potential to come to the fore when the stresses of child rearing arise. The anxiety can be overwhelming and lead to neglect and avoidance. The risk from her depression is of psychological and emotional neglect as the mother becomes self-absorbed. In terms of her EUPD the risk is of impulsive behaviours including self-harm with emotional impact upon children in the care of the mother. Further there is a risk of unstable and unpredictable parenting. These conditions have the potential to cause both emotional and physical harm to a child in her care having regard to the unpredictable nature of her emotional state, self-harming and other actions which have the strong potential to impact on the children&#8217;s own mental health into their adulthood.</span></p>

He recommended a process of psychological therapy aimed at assisting with recovery from the trauma she has experienced. This might be based on CBT, DBT or related therapy and would require 1 to 2 years of work. He had some doubt as to her ability to engage in such work given her presentation at interview.</span></p>

She went onto describe behaviour patterns and concerns consistent with the earlier diagnosis. The symptoms of the same are often lifelong, with the potential to manage the same through therapeutic intervention. In terms of caring for S the expert expressed issues with attachment and mentalisation. The challenge is to develop an attuned understanding of what is going on in the mind of the child with the risk of breakdowns in interaction and relationship. The concern is to how the mother will manage taking on the stresses of caring for S and particularly so in the light of her experience of the challenge in caring for her older children. The expert noted the recent comparative stability in her presentation but noted it was not so long before that her presentation was problematic and drew attention to the fact that this arose in the context of not having caring responsibilities for a child.</span></p>

They also point to communications sent by the mother and suggest this is further evidence of instability in her mental health. It is accepted the mother has been subject to some material challenges during the last two years. The circumstances of her relationship with the father are likely to have caused her stress as has the impact of both these proceedings and the proceedings concerning B. Notwithstanding this it is of note the mother has not been further hospitalised or acted in a self-harming manner.

It is clear to me that during periods of deterioration she will be unable to meet the needs of a child in her care and particularly so a vulnerable child of the age of S. I accept a child in her care will be impacted at an emotional level with long term implications for that child. I accept the prognosis is unclear, that work will likely need a period of 1-2 years to be completed and will have to be demonstrated as having been embedded successfully.

In lasting over 14 sessions it seems clear it has a level of superficiality when compared to that required. I do not want to undermine the efforts the mother had made and I am willing to accept this may help her in her day-to-day life but it is unlikely to be the answer to the issues faced by the Court.

It appears agreed that since about November she has missed about 16 of the possible 30 sessions. There is a level of disagreement, with the evidence being somewhat confused on the part of the mother, as to the extent to which the mother notified her non-attendance in advance. Frankly, little turns on this detail and I do not need to resolve this dispute. However, the mother accepts and apologises for her non-attendance. I accept these are heart felt and genuine emotions. The problem is that this inability is a marker of her surrounding poor mental health. I find she has largely failed to attend as a result of the stress and emotional impact the contact has upon her. It seems likely by not attending she is protecting herself from the stress and harm that would be caused to her mental health. In a way this is a sensible strategy but it does speak volumes as to her ability to resume full time care of S. If the mother cannot maintain regular weekly contact for a short period, then how will she manage full-time care?</span></p>

In her evidence the mother sought to suggest there was a level of misunderstanding and mistranslation around the messages in question. She suggests she and the MGM are able to move forward positively. Having considered the messages, I tend to share the concerns of the applicant. These messages are recent in timing and highly critical of the MGM&#8217;s care of the children. It is very difficult to reconcile these messages with a suggestion of a co-operative and supportive relationship between the two women. I also bear in mind the challenges currently faced by the MGM which I consider likely led to her realistic change in position at the start of the hearing.

The mother argues she is open to working with the applicant. The applicant again points to a number of messages from the mother which suggest she is not open to working with the professionals. I have considered these messages which appear hostile to the applicant. Once again, they are not historic in character. As with the messaging around the MGM I listened to the explanation given by the mother which seemed to suggest there may have been  a mistranslation by use of a translation app. I have to say I found this explanation unconvincing. The language used was clear and the Court interpreter had no issue in translating the same words in the manner used by the mother. The mother expressed herself in terms of &#8216;hating&#8217; the applicant and made other highly negative observations. I struggle to accept an alternative and less problematic emotion was being expressed. Once again, this messaging indicates a level of emotional instability. It does not support the notion of a positive working relationship.</span></p>

On the applicant&#8217;s case she was receiving unwanted messaging from the father; he is said to have attended at her property, and; having done my best to understand her account of the messaging (which was not available) it appears it was abusive of her and sought to undermine her. In the context of the case this was information which one would have expected her to share. I understood her to explain her failure by the concern that were she to do so it would impact on her case.

The risk would be of a dysfunctional attachment style being set. Whilst I consider her current characteristic needs below, I do not consider S to require special care.

I have already referenced the agreed threshold. This hearing has appropriately focused on the risk that is likely to arise out of the mother&#8217;s poor mental health. I have referenced the expert evidence and the views of the ISW. The evidence indicates the mother&#8217;s condition is a lifelong condition that is amenable to therapy but will remain a matter of relevance. Through her adulthood it has had profound impact upon her and her children. The evidence is clear in regard to the need for intensive therapeutic support over a sustained period with uncertain prospects of success. As a result, there is a real and continuing risk of mental health deterioration with significant harmful impact upon a child in the mother&#8217;s care. The impact on a wholly dependent and vulnerable child is exacerbated.</span></p>

Within the hearing the applicant has recognised a need to actively promote the benefits of post-adoption contact with any prospective adopter. This willingness is based on the sibling relationship and the potential benefit of contact and harm if there is no contact. This reflects the profound impact of severance from family life that will follow from adoption. At this point in time one can have regard to post-adoption contact but one must have in mind (1) a real possibility that any prospective adopter will not be open to direct contact; (2) that in such circumstances there would be only very limited circumstances in which a Court would go against these wishes, and; (3) that any contact would be quite limited in nature, be for identity purposes and might extend to no more than 1-2 times per annum. I have to consider the impact on S of this severance /significant reduction in relationship. I agree there is a real potential for emotional harm on S discovering the fact of her adoption whilst her half-siblings remained within family. The risk is of S feeling punished or thinking there was something personal or wrong with her which made this the case. The danger is of her blaming herself. All of this may lead to instability in the placement and this would be troubling in circumstances in which such a placement is being preferred as a result of the stability it will bring. There is a further risk of the severance being not only a severance of family life but of identity. With the best will in the world, it will be very difficult to find a cultural match for S. I am cautious about reaching the conclusion that a placement with an individual who has a geographically proximate link to country X would resolve this issue. Whilst this would introduce some common understandings and broad cultural connections it would be somewhat parochial to draw strong links between countries with vastly different histories. Placing a French child in an Italian family might be a broad parallel. Of course, there are some common cultural links around European history and social organisation but each country has a proud and very different history. The same applies with respect to X and surrounding countries. As such any adopter would need to be active in their support of S&#8217;s culture and this might be a challenge leading to this important aspect diminishing over time. I do accept the view of the CG that in any such consideration there is a &#8216;hierarchy&#8217; of priorities with identity needs being important but secondary to more basic needs for safety and emotional stability.</span></p>

This does have value to her. There have been real challenges with contact and I have noted a level of non-engagement. This will have had a negative impact on S having particular reference to her presentation as a clingy child and the consequent need for her to receive consistent contact to overcome this difficulty. I do accept there has been some progress in this regard with the support of the foster carers and no doubt as a result of S ageing. This raises the worry that contact in the future will be inconsistent and may wax and wane as the mother&#8217;s mental health stability fluctuates. To an extent one can see this in the case of the older children with periods of significant fragmentation in the relationship. I am in no doubt it would highly damaging for S if she were placed with her mother only for the placement to subsequently break down due to an inability on the part of the mother to provide sustained care. I accept there is separate value to a potential relationship with wider family but this is not yet firmly established. I am in no doubt as to the mother&#8217;s wish for S to remain within her family and in her care. But I am also required to have regard to the ability and willingness of the mother to provide S with a home which is a secure environment in which S&#8217;s needs are met. This is the controversial issue at the heart of the case with the professionals unanimously questioning the ability to meet S&#8217;s needs on a sustained basis within a secure environment. Furthermore, the professionals whilst recognising the potential for change do not consider this can be done within S&#8217;s timescales and there is a doubt whether it will be successful in any event.</span></p>
