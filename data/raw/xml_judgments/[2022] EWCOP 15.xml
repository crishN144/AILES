	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The North Yorkshire Clinical Commissioning Group has applied for an order that it is in the best interests of E to receive Covid-19 vaccinations. E is a man in his mid-60&#8217;s who has moderate to severe learning disability which has for many years been presumed to be due to organic brain damage following the administration of the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine in infancy. There is no dispute that he lacks capacity to make decisions for himself about whether or not to receive Covid-19 vaccinations because of an impairment of, or disturbance in the function of, the mind or brain. The Official Solicitor, as E&#8217;s litigation friend, indicated that she was broadly of the view that vaccination was likely to be in E&#8217;s best interests and confirmed that position on conclusion of the oral evidence. E&#8217;s parents died some time ago. He has four siblings: two - the third and fourth respondents, G and H - strongly support the application. One, who is not a party, initially opposed the proposal that E be given the vaccine but has now withdrawn that objection. The fourth sibling, F, the second respondent, strongly opposes the application.</p>

The principles to be applied are established but, since those judgments, as F points out to the court, there have been significant changes in the course of the pandemic. The circumstances of each individual case will be unique and in the present case an important feature is that E&#8217;s organic brain damage appeared to follow the administration of the pertussis vaccine when he was an infant in the 1950&#8217;s. </p>

It remains in force. During the hearing I determined that Dr J&#8217;s name should not be published or communicated because to do so would be liable to lead to the identification of E given the small number of patients Dr J has who would meet the description of E that is included in this judgment.</p>

His c.v. shows that Dr Eccles has been a registered medical practitioner since 1993 with membership of the Royal College of Physicians in 1997 and GP registration the same year. For 10 years thereafter he did one to two sessions per week in local GP practices. He undertook Naturopathic training in the Czech Republic in 1999, obtained certification for Clinical Thermography in 2005, and became a Director of the World Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine in 2007. He was listed in a publication called Great Minds of the 21st Century, 5th Edition, and is the holder of two pending patents for discoveries in non-surgical hair restoration and computerised breast thermal imaging. He is a medical and research director for the Natural Dr Limited, 69 Harley Street, London W1. He says that his primary interest is in nutritional support of cancer patients and in &#8220;non-invasive methods for the restoration of cell health in general and in particular as this relates to breast and prostate health.&#8221; He is also medical director of HB Health Anti Aging Medicine at Beauchamp Place London SW6 and Medical Director to ThermoClock Limited.  He says he is &#8220;one of the UK&#8217;s leading experts in magnetic therapy&#8221;, advising manufacturers of magnets including Ladycare which uses a magnetic device to relieve dysmenorrhea &#8211; severe menstrual pain. Previously he was Senior Clinician in charge of the Harley Street Stress Clinic on Mondays and Wednesdays conducting consultations with patients on lifestyle advice and counselling on more efficient stress coping strategies.</p>

To that extent it can be argued that Dr Eccles&#8217; report addresses some of the relevant issues. However, there are four principal difficulties with the proposal that Dr Eccles can give expert evidence to assist the court:</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Dr Eccles&#8217; c.v. and report do not reveal that he has a field of expertise which would enable him to assist the court in this case. An expert witness ought to have qualifications, knowledge, and experience in a relevant field to enable them to give opinion evidence with some measure of authority such that the court can rely on it. A certain level of familiarity with the relevant state of knowledge, learning, and practice within the field of purported expertise is required. By his c.v. and report Dr Eccles purports to have expertise and experience in counselling for stress, diagnosing breast cancer, anti-aging treatments, hair restoration, magnetic therapy, and preventative medicine. He does not have any specialisation in virology, epidemiology, or any other field of practice that would be recognised as relevant to the issues that the court has to determine in this case. The fact that he may have given vitamins to individuals does not make him an expert in the treatment of Covid-19. There is no analysis of that cohort of his patients and their health profiles, nor any comparison with patients who had not received vitamin treatments. He has not published any relevant research or papers related to Covid-19 in recognised medical or scientific publications</p>

Dr Eccles&#8217; evidence is not objective or balanced in any way. His report is wholly one-sided. It reads as polemical rather than as a disinterested expert report. There is no weighing of evidence. There is no hint that there might be a range of reasonable expert opinion. There is no recognition that there is any available evidence to support the contrary view that vaccination might be effective in preventing or reducing the symptoms caused by Covid-19, or that there may be medical opinion that vitamins are not effective in preventing the contraction of Covid-19, reducing the symptoms, or in preventing hospital admissions from Covid-19, for example. When determining whether to give permission to rely on expert evidence it is not for me to say whether Dr Eccles&#8217; opinions are correct or incorrect, but it is clear that he has not acted objectively or in balanced way when purporting to advise the court.</p>

In contrast, Dr Eccles&#8217; report does not provide any kind of informed analysis of the evidence about Covid-19. He does not examine any evidence in support of the national immunisation programme. That is not to say he is not free to criticise such evidence but he should at least recognise its existence and then apply his knowledge and experience to analyse it. His uncritical reliance on a news article from Israel and another in an online magazine to support his assertion that &#8220;It has now become very clear in recent months that the existing vaccines do not prevent illness, nor do they prevent transmission&#8221; is far below the standard of analysis that the court is entitled to expect from an expert witness.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">An expert should ensure that they have considered all evidence relevant to their opinions in the specific case. Where the expert opinion concerns an individual, then their individual circumstances will be relevant. There is a lack of specificity to the case of E in Dr Eccles&#8217; report. There is no mention in the body of his report that Dr Eccles has seen any documentation in this case. He does not refer to any medical records in the body of his report, but he does say, in what appears to be a standardised statement possibly for Data Protection Act purposes, that he has seen &#8220;the patient&#8217;s medical records&#8221;. He does not state what records or other documentation he has been provided with or the nature of his instructions. I do have an email from Mr F, husband of the Second Respondent who says that he sent Dr Eccles the two statements of Dr J, E&#8217;s GP which exhibit the mental capacity assessment identifying E by name. He does not appear to have sent to Dr Eccles any medical records but he did annotate Dr J&#8217;s statements and provided those notes to Dr Eccles. Dr Eccles does not refer to them and I do not know what they said. Save for a single reference to a proposal to give E statins, Dr Eccles does not refer to E&#8217;s medical history or current condition. He does not refer to E&#8217;s general health, his weight, or even his age. He does not refer to his vitamin levels which may have been relevant to the proposed treatment. He does not refer to, let alone discuss, E&#8217;s learning disability or how treatment would be given to him. He does not refer to his capacity to make decisions about the proposed treatment. He does not say that he needs to see E&#8217;s medical records before giving an opinion.</p>

She has obtained the report having instructed the expert unilaterally without the agreement of the other parties and  before seeking permission from the court. Therefore, there has been no opportunity for consideration of the letter of instruction to be sent to Dr Eccles. There has been no opportunity to consider what issues an expert should address and no opportunity for joint instruction of an expert. The premature instruction of Dr Eccles led to breaches of the Transparency Order because non-anonymised information identifying E was given to Dr Eccles without permission of the court. The other parties to this case are entitled to expect at least some compliance with the rules so that the proceedings are fair. The court is entitled to expect compliance with the rules so that it can manage cases proportionately, efficiently and to do justice. The disregard for Part 15 of the COP Rules would in itself be a strong reason not to permit this evidence to be admitted.</p>

I cannot see how this statement or report from Dr Eccles can assist in that manner. Insofar as it is contended that E would, if he had capacity, have been opposed to vaccination, that does not make it necessary for the court to hear from a doctor with Dr Eccles&#8217; practice and experience. This evidence will not tell the court what E would have wanted or consented to if he had capacity to make the decision in question. Indeed, Dr Eccles does not purport to do so, and his evidence gives the court no insight into what E wants or would have wanted had he not had his impairment or disturbance in the functioning of his mind or brain.</p>

When he was an infant he was administered vaccines for whooping cough (pertussis) after which he was noted to have developmental delay. His parents were dedicated to his care, alongside his siblings. They understood that E had suffered brain damage due to his pertussis vaccinations. F told me that he was given the vaccine in three stages and suffered some signs of an adverse reaction particularly after the second, but the advice was to go ahead with the third. After that third vaccine, E began to suffer severe neurological problems. E has twice been awarded compensation under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1979/17" uk:canonical="1979 c. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Vaccine Damage Payments Act 1979</ref> on the basis that he did suffer &#8220;vaccine damage&#8221;. </p>

A number of the staff there have known him for several years. He is well cared for. He has four siblings who also care for him and with whom he enjoys a variety of activities. He has interests in football, previously horse-riding and now riding in a horse-drawn carriage, music, holidays, and animals. He loves food but cannot foresee the unhealthy consequences of over-consumption which means that he has to be monitored and, even so, he can sometimes put on too much weight. It takes time to develop an understanding with E so that he can make his preferences known. Mr A of the solicitors instructed by the Official Solicitor, has provided a statement of his visit to E on 8 February 2022. He gives a vivid description of E who was in a buoyant mood at the visit. He communicated using Makaton sign language.  He showed Mr A number of animal figures within the room, naming them and making a sound that each animal would make. He mentioned each of his siblings and an activity he associated with them, such as &#8220;park&#8221; for F, or horse shows associated with H. He communicated a love of watching football. He showed some understanding of what an injection was by giving a simplified Makaton sign for injection by hitting his left arm with the side of his closed right fist when injection was mentioned to him. He did not give any indication, when asked, whether he thought injections were good or bad. In her oral evidence F said that she smiled with recognition of E when she read Mr A&#8217;s account of his meeting.</p>

She has had an input into the management of E&#8217;s nutrition and believes that the use of vitamins, minerals and pro-biotics can prevent the more harmful effects of Covid-19. However, she encapsulated her objection to E being administered the Covid-19 vaccine by saying that since he has once been bitten &#8211; by the pertussis vaccine causing him brain damage &#8211; why should he be offered up to be bitten again? Why take the risk of catastrophic consequences a second time? F is the closest of E&#8217;s siblings to him in age, and she urged the court to accept that had E the capacity to make the decision himself, his values and beliefs would be like hers and would lead him to elect not to be vaccinated. F had not been fully aware of the annual influenza vaccines received by E.</p>

They believe that were E to have capacity he would elect to welcome scientific developments to counter Covid-19 and would have chosen to be vaccinated. They are concerned that some activities which E would otherwise enjoy, such as going to an indoor theatre, may not be open to him whilst he remains unvaccinated because his care home will consider it too much of a risk to him. </p>

Restrictions have now been largely lifted. The Omicron variant has proved to be less harmful than previous variants. Nevertheless, Covid-19 is still being transmitted within the community with tens of thousands of new cases reported daily and, at the time of the hearing, numbers of new, reported Covid-19 cases and numbers of people in hospital with Covid-19 are increasing again after a recent reduction. The virus continues to cause significant harm and death. Earlier in the pandemic it could more reasonably be said that Covid-19 vaccines were &#8220;new&#8221; and that, if not &#8220;untested&#8221;, the evidence for effectiveness and complications was not the same as it would have been for more established vaccination programmes. Now, millions of doses have been given and the evidence base is much larger albeit the vaccines have not been in use for long enough for longer term studies to be performed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nevertheless, despite these changes in the general circumstances, the approach adopted by the Vice President remains valid. In particular it is not feasible for this court to make rulings about the reliability of the evidence on which national vaccination guidelines are based, or the validity of the analysis of that evidence which has led to those national guidelines being developed and adopted. For F, Mr Hoar contends that the evidence from the UK Health Security Agency demonstrates that the Covid-19 vaccines are now ineffective at reducing transmission, that their general effectiveness against harm from the Omicron variant is much more uncertain, that complications and side-effects are alarmingly high, and that the evidence does not support the contention that it is in E&#8217;s medical best interests to be administered Covid-19 vaccination. Nevertheless, I proceed on the basis the national guidance is that it is for the health benefit of someone of E&#8217;s age to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and that further it is established guidance that a person with learning disability is at a greater risk than those of a similar age in the general population.</p>

She accepts that E has previously enjoyed visits to the pantomime and other indoor activities. She maintains that reductions in E&#8217;s visits to church clubs and elsewhere has been due to restrictions imposed on everyone, whether vaccinated or not. However, the evidence from Dr J is that the care home staff carry out risk assessments in relation to E&#8217;s participation in activities and those assessments take into account his unvaccinated status. As such he appears to be precluded from attending indoor activities off site which would risk him being exposed to a crowd of people some of whom may transmit the virus to him. The vaccine would give him good protection against the more harmful effects of Covid-19 and so change the risk assessment to one that is more in favour of his participation. E may not understand the risks and benefits of vaccination but he likes to participate in the full range of activities.</p>

There is no evidence at all that E is more vulnerable to side-effects from the Covid-19 vaccine because of the damage (which may have been) caused by the pertussis vaccine. It might be said that had E, with capacity to make a decision about vaccination, applied an evidence-based approach to decisions about his health, he would have elected to be vaccinated against Covid-19 notwithstanding his previous vaccine damage. F departs from the scientific and medical consensus that vaccination is protective against the harm of Covid-19 and invites the court to assume that E would have done the same, but I cannot make that assumption &#8211; I have no evidence to suggest that he would have rejected the established evidence and government advice.</p>

E has positive relationships with all his siblings. They all care for him deeply. The fact that two of his siblings, knowing that E may have suffered severe damage as a result of the pertussis vaccine, are nevertheless strongly in favour of the Covid-19 vaccine being administered to him, tends to show that it cannot be assumed that E would have become risk averse in his own decision making about medical procedures in general or about Covid-19 vaccination in particular. G has told the court that it is precisely because of E&#8217;s disability and vulnerability that he is so anxious that he should be protected.

His parents had been assured that the pertussis vaccine had been safe. He would be slow to accept similar assurances made now about the Covid-19 vaccine. The longer term effects of the Covid-19 vaccines cannot be known. It is an mRNA vaccine and that type of vaccine has not been in use long enough to know whether there could be adverse effects several years after administration. Clearly there is a substantial number of individuals whose values and beliefs cause them not to be reassured by the current scientific and medical evidence and consensus. However, for the reasons already given I am not persuaded that I can assume that E would have been within that group. There is no dominant set of values and beliefs within his family or any wider culture or group to which he belongs that would have influenced him to reject vaccination. It is much too speculative to suppose what his values and beliefs would have been. He has never been able to form or express any values and beliefs relevant to the decision in question and there is no consensus within his family from which I can infer that he would have adopted a certain position. In this case the evidence does not allow me to make any findings as to his likely values and beliefs if he had had capacity to make the relevant decision.</p>

He has been compliant with vaccinations in the past and would be likely to be compliant in the future. It is unlikely that he will resist being vaccinated. Two of his close relatives are strongly in favour of him being vaccinated, one is strongly against it. His GP is strongly in favour as are the staff at his care home. The court takes those views into account &#8211; no one voice has a veto but neither is the fact that more relatives support the application than oppose it determinative of best interests. Administering the Covid-19 vaccine involves some degree of risk. Very rarely, some individuals suffer from severe side-effects. However, these risks are far outweighed by the risks to E of not having the vaccine. The benefits to E of being vaccinated are considerable. It will afford him good protection against the more harmful effects of Covid-19, even death, should he contract the virus. It will enable him to be risk assessed as a vaccinated individual for activities which should open up to him the same opportunities to participate in the full range of activities that he has enjoyed in the past.</p>

Disagreements amongst family members about vaccination should be resolved without the need for court proceedings.
