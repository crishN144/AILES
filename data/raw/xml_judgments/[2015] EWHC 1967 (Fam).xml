They are the three children of the relationship between M and F, which ended in 2009.  Unhappily, these care proceedings were issued as long ago as 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2013.  They came before me for the first time on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015, when the final hearing was listed.  Unfortunately, no judge was available to hear the case then.  I therefore listed the case on the first available date for final hearing, which was 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2015.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In October 2014, the Local Authority served its final care plans.  The care plan for Ro provided for her to remain placed at Residential Unit A, subject to a final care order, with on-going contact with her family.  In respect of the boys, the Local Authority care plans proposed special guardianship orders in favour of their paternal aunt (PA) and her partner, following the completion of positive special guardianship assessments.  </p>

She now accepts that since October 2014 she has been involved in another relationship.  She and her partner, BM, are expecting a baby, due to be born in August 2015.  M indicated her intention to seek the return of the children to the joint care of herself and BM, with support from her parents, MGM and MGF.  </p>

MGF has engaged in the proceedings and, in fact, sought to put forward a case to care for the children himself in the event that the children were not to be returned to their mother.  In a statement dated 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2015, MGM put herself forward as a carer for Ro should the children not return to M&#8217;s care.  Since October 2014, F has accepted the children could not realistically be placed in his care.  He supports the placement options within the birth family.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The final hearing was therefore expected to determine a range of factual issues to inform the welfare decision making.  These factual issues included the relationship between M and F, their care of the children, the allegations of sexual abuse against MGF, M&#8217;s failure to protect the children from the risk posed by MGF and her failure to cooperate with professionals.  </p>

On 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2015, counsel for MGF served a position&#160;statement which confirmed that MGF no longer put himself forward as a carer for the children and, if they were not to be returned to M&#8217;s care, supported the Local&#160;Authority&#8217;s plans for the children, but sought some form of contact.  </p>

The Local Authority had then reviewed the entirety of the disclosure relating to the findings sought against the maternal&#160;grandfather, some of which had been received late in the day.  For reasons I will return to shortly in a little more detail, the Local Authority indicated it no longer sought to pursue findings of sexual abuse against MGF.  </p>

Having done so, I was told she was no longer seeking the return of the children to her care and was not opposing the placement of the boys with PA, subject to special guardianship orders.  In the case of Ro, however, she did not support her continuing placement at Residential Unit A, but proposed that Ro should be placed with MGM.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In those changed circumstances, the sole welfare issue for my determination at this hearing was therefore whether Ro should move to the care of MGM or whether she should remain in her placement at Residential Unit A.  In these circumstances, I did not consider it either necessary or proportionate to investigate the other factual issues.  I had myself had the opportunity of reviewing the evidence relating to the allegations made by MA against MGF, in the context of the position of the parties in the case and the placement options for the children.  The evidential difficulties relating to MA&#8217;s allegations were highlighted in a helpful document prepared by Miss Woolrich, for the Local Authority, following full disclosure by the police.  I was also alive to the vulnerability of MA herself, although medical evidence had confirmed she was fit to give evidence if required to do so.  In the light of the position of the parties, I concurred with their view that it was not necessary and would not be proportionate in these circumstances to investigate and seek to determine these allegations.  </p>

MGM is not currently a party to these proceedings.  She has, however, had access to all of the relevant case papers.  In circumstances in which M&#8217;s case was to support Ro&#8217;s placement with MGM, Miss Gibson (representing M) effectively put the case on behalf of MGM.  I am grateful to Miss Gibson for that, as - I know - is MGM.  </p>

MA was born in 1981; M was born the following year in 1982.  There was Local Authority involvement with the family when the children were young.  MA was placed in foster care when she was aged 3.  In 1984, a final care order was made in respect of MA and a supervision order was made in respect of M.  M was never removed from her parents&#8217; care.  In 1986, MA first made allegations of a sexual nature against MGF.  Investigations were inconclusive.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">M&#8217;s relationship with F was volatile and included episodes of domestic abuse.  Ro was born in 2001.  From an early age, Ro was cared for by MGM and MGF, who obtained a residence order in respect of her on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> May 2003.  Ro later returned to M&#8217;s care (although when this happened is unclear).  Rh was born in 2006, followed by C in 2008.  M and F separated in 2009, with the children remaining in their mother&#8217;s care.  In 2012, the Local Authority became aware that MA was distributing leaflets in the area in which the maternal family live (and the children attended school) alleging that MGF was a paedophile.  She made a complaint to the police, alleging serious sexual abuse by him during her childhood.  He was arrested and was duly charged with two offences of buggery and two offences of indecency with a child.  MA also made allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by MGF to Ro and that Ro&#8217;s behaviour was sexualised.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">M and MGM have always been resolute in their support for MGF&#8217;s denial of these allegations.  The Local Authority was understandably concerned to ensure the children were protected from any risk of harm from MGF in the light of those allegations.  The Local Authority therefore formulated a written agreement, which was signed by M on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> May 2013, in which she gave her agreement that she would not allow MGF unsupervised contact with the children or allow him to visit the family home.  The children were, however, accommodated by the Local Authority and placed in foster care on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2013, following a strategy meeting which considered information indicating that M had not adhered to the working agreement.  </p>

It concluded that the children would be at significant risk of sexual harm and neglect if they were returned to M&#8217;s care.  The parenting assessment was updated in February 2014.  This addendum parenting assessment recommended a plan of rehabilitation, for the children to return to their mother&#8217;s care with support and monitoring.  The children duly returned to M&#8217;s care on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014.

The previously allocated social worker, Sam Lockey, undertook a viability assessment in June 2014 at a time when MGF was awaiting trial.  The assessment recorded MGM&#8217;s view that MGF posed no risk to the children and that she would be likely to allow him unsupervised contact with the children as a result.  That assessment reached a negative conclusion.  A second assessment completed by Viorel Duman in November 2014 focused more closely on MGM&#8217;s ability to manage Ro&#8217;s behaviour, which is described in the Local Authority&#8217;s evidence as &#8216;extremely challenging&#8217;.  The assessment did not support Ro&#8217;s placement with MGM.  The assessment recorded MGM&#8217;s view that Ro&#8217;s behaviour is not challenging.</p>

The judgment of McFarlane LJ stressed the need for a proper, thorough and holistic evaluation of the placement options, giving full weight to the Article 8 rights.  Such an approach involves the court balancing the pros and cons of the placement options in any case.  McFarlane LJ considered (at paragraph 46) that where the placement options do not include adoption, the wording of certain elements of the welfare checklist involve a direct comparison of the relevant options that are being considered, giving the following by way of example: the likely effect of any change in circumstances; the harm which a child has suffered or is at risk of suffering; and the capability of the parents (and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant) of meeting the child&#8217;s needs.  The proper consideration of these issues requires the court to consider the positives and negatives of the placement options in material respects.</p>

This evidence comes from the direct observations of the key social worker, Viorel Duman, who has been involved since the autumn of 2014 and, to a lesser extent, from the observations of the children&#8217;s guardian.  M agrees with this evidence, which also accords with the consistent descriptions of Ro in other settings, particularly from Residential Unit A.

I found MGM to lack any insight at all into Ro&#8217;s vulnerability, her current and likely future behaviour and the demands that Ro currently and in the future is likely to provide for her carers.  MGM&#8217;s lack of understanding of these issues was reflected in her own assessment of M&#8217;s parenting abilities.

On the other hand, from the evidence that I heard, I found I could have no confidence that MGM understands the care that Ro requires and the demands that Ro will place upon any carer.  I do not accept MGM&#8217;s assertion that the difficulties simply result from Ro&#8217;s placement at Residential&#160;Unit A.

That is a placement in Local Authority care and in residential care rather than a foster placement.  This accommodation will only be available to the age of 16 and is therefore time limited.  Inevitably, there are the prospects of changes, as residents who are mainly older than Ro move on.  This placement has, however, provided a generally positive environment for Ro, despite her more challenging recent behaviour.  The carers for Ro at Residential Unit A are alive to her vulnerability, her care needs and the risks to which she is susceptible.  Ro is at risk of physical, sexual and emotional harm if she does not receive the consistent and structured parenting she requires from carers who are alive to her difficulties and her challenging behaviour.  A care plan of residential care is relatively unusual for a young person of Ro&#8217;s age.  The evidence demonstrates that the placement is, however, meeting her needs well and certainly as well and consistently as any other form of placement could offer.  </p>

The Local Authority&#8217;s care plan recognises Ro&#8217;s own wishes, so far as her contact with her father is concerned, which will remain under review.  Ro will be able to maintain contact with her brothers.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">For Rh and for C, the court is not invited to consider any option for their placement other than their placement together with PA and her partner, subject to special guardianship orders.  It will be clear from the short summary I have given of the background to these proceedings and the events since proceedings were issued that Rh and C have experienced a very disrupted start to their young lives.  They have a pressing need for a secure, stable and permanent placement.  PA and her partner have been thoroughly assessed by the Local Authority as to their ability to provide such care for Rh and for C.  The assessments support this placement for them.  There is no challenge to the plans for the boys by their parents (or any other family members).  The placement and the making of special guardianship orders is supported by the children&#8217;s guardian.  </p>
