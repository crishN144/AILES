	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This case concerns G, who is a 29-year-old woman, suffering from a profound, degenerative neurological condition. G lacks capacity to take decisions in relation to any aspect of her life and welfare. I have heard several applications in this case, the first of which started on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> December 2021. Protracted litigation of this kind is extremely unusual in the Court of Protection. When G&#8217;s circumstances first came to be considered before me, I was alarmed to discover that she had spent all her adult life in a children&#8217;s hospital. Efforts to provide alternative care arrangements had been met with resistance, chiefly from G&#8217;s father (LF), who did not consider the alternatives to be satisfactory. The relationship between the family, G&#8217;s treating clinicians and many of the nurses was poor. The root of those difficulties lay in LF&#8217;s attitude to his daughter&#8217;s medical treatment. He had been repeatedly critical of the staff and of the senior clinicians. Living in accommodation in the hospital grounds for ten years, visiting his daughter daily, his own life absorbed in a hospital environment, fired in LF an intense interest in his daughter&#8217;s medical condition and generated in him, a zealous desire to understand her treatment and the medical knowledge that informed it. His language is fretted with medical terminology. The ease and facility with which he uses the medical lexicon draws great admiration from his mother, CJ. She is in no doubt, and told me directly, that LF </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;knows more about G&#8217;s medical condition than anyone in this court room&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. As my previous judgments in this case reveal, LF has repeatedly challenged medical opinions and pressed for a Court determination. </span></p>

I agree with Miss Debra Powell QC, acting on behalf of the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), that at some point, G&#8217;s continued placement there became irreconcilable with her dignity. I would go further, in these circumstances where the parameters of her personal autonomy are circumscribed by her condition, the continued placement at the Hospital limits, unnecessarily, the small sphere of autonomy that remains available to her i.e., to be treated as the young woman she now is and not as the child she was upon admission. It is important to record that nobody, including G&#8217;s parents, has suggested that the Hospital is now the right place for her. In my judgement it is axiomatic that this children&#8217;s hospital, however great its resources and skills, is ill-equipped to meet the emotional, medical and physical needs of this young woman.&#8221;</span></p>

The CCG was not prepared to fund it. Ms Powell, acting for both the Hospital Trust and CCG, politely but firmly, submitted that I should not use the powers of this Court to put pressure on the CCG to allocate its funds in a particular way: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Holmes-Moorhouse v Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2009/7" uk:canonical="[2009] UKHL 7" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKHL 7</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 WLR 413" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 WLR 413</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.

He expressed himself in clear terms. He referred to 'the jeopardy of [G's] discharge' and to the 'extremely complex' breadth of her medical needs. He also, properly in my view, identified the importance of achieving what he called greater 'functionality' in the relationship between professionals and family. This said, he emphasised that the love and commitment of these parents requires to be kept sight of. In simple terms, in a phrase which he repeated on a number of occasions, Dr D considered that G was likely to be 'overwhelmed if she were discharged straight home'. He told me in evidence that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">it was important that G's team have full autonomy to deliver her care package, whilst respecting LF's practical contribution and insight. Though, I did not sense the parents were absorbing what he said, Dr D was also emphasising that G's family need to 'gain confidence in the team' in order fully to unlock their own role at home as a family. In order that both parents hear it clearly and unequivocally, I consider this perhaps more than anything else is the gateway to G's return to them. Ultimately, the decision to walk through it is theirs. I am confident that all involved with G would encourage them to do so.&#8221;</span></p>

It provided a road map to follow and to provide G with what was then a realistic prospect of being able to live at home. As I found, the dysfunctionality of the parents&#8217; relationship with the clinical team compromised G&#8217;s safety and exposed her to avoidable harm. For too long, the clinical team yielded to LF&#8217;s opposition and failed to protect their patient. As I noted, this could have had very significant and harmful consequences for her. The clinical team seemed somehow to have assumed that these parents had determinative rights in respect of their daughter&#8217;s treatment. They did not. G was then, already an adult woman in her twenties. Her parents&#8217; views are, at least potentially, an important conduit by which her wishes and feelings might be communicated. That, however, will, in most cases, be the limit of them. The parents&#8217; role is to facilitate G&#8217;s rights not to assert their own. This is the primary way by which the parents are most likely to make a significant contribution to identifying G&#8217;s best interests. It was this misunderstanding that lay at the core of the dysfunctionality. Its danger was illustrated very clearly in the entirely unsatisfactory document that had become the CPR plan.

It provided no clarity for the treating clinicians and served to stifle G's voice</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Indeed, I was told that notwithstanding the fact that the form was intended to communicate to the treating clinicians that CPR should not be attempted, it was more likely that the exact opposite would have occurred. It is a mark of Dr B's integrity that she should express herself with such candour, but she identifies a wholly unsatisfactory scenario. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">She considered that if LF had been present at cardiac arrest, he would have pressed this ambiguous document upon the treating clinicians in order to encourage CPR</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">That would have been painful and wholly contrary to G's interests as LF now recognises.

In June 2022, i.e., 6 months later, the case returned to me with G still living in the children&#8217;s hospital. At the time of my judgment in December, I had anticipated a move being only weeks away. Moreover, the ceiling of care plan had still not been put in place, though there appeared to be consensus as to its content in December. The Trust and the CCG identified LF&#8217;s intransigence as the cause for this and sought injunctive orders to implement and secure the placement at the care home. Ms Powell contended that LF was fundamentally opposed to the move and had conducted a campaign of resistance to it. Though LF insisted that he was only </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;seeking answers to reasonable questions&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, he eventually yielded in cross-examination and accepted that he was fundamentally opposed to the placement. Again, I have worked through the history here to understand the present. It is significant that long before G was transferred to the care home, LF had a deeply entrenched opposition to it.

LF conceded his implacable opposition to the care home only when Ms Powell had carefully worked through the details of his behaviour, which really permitted of no other explanation.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Fact-finding hearings at Tier 3 in the Court of Protection are extremely rare. Junior Counsel in this case tell me that they are conducted more frequently at Tier 1 and 2, especially at Tier 2. I have been surprised to hear that. I can see no obvious reason why this should be the case. For my part, I do not think that in this sphere of law, they have quite the same practical utility that they can have in the Family Court. In the Court of Protection, the range of welfare options for P is frequently very limited and unlikely to vary very much in response to a shifting factual matrix. In determining whether a fact-finding hearing should be convened, Judges must consider, rigorously, what real purpose it is likely to serve i.e., from the perspective of informing decisions relating to P&#8217;s welfare. Such hearings are inevitably adversarial and invariably generate further hostility. This is inherently undesirable. Delay in reaching conclusions is inimical to P&#8217;s best interests. In a very pressing and literal way, time is often not on P&#8217;s side. Delay can only be justified if it is identifiably purposeful. Even in this case, given that G is moving towards the end of her life and has had a positive relationship with her parents from which she has and probably still does derive benefit, I wondered whether a fact-finding hearing was necessary. However, I am satisfied that the gravity of the allegations here and the nature of the family&#8217;s responses has made such a hearing unavoidable. It has clear resonance for the central welfare issues i.e., as to where G will live and whether or to what extent it will be in her best interests further to promote her relationship with her family. This disagreeable truth, I very much regret to say, must be confronted. </span></p>

The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

One of the most important lessons of such research is that in everyday life we are not aware of the extent to which our own and other people's memories are unreliable and believe our memories to be more faithful than they are. Two common (and related) errors are to suppose: (1) that the stronger and more vivid is our feeling or experience of recollection, the more likely the recollection is to be accurate; and (2) that the more confident another person is in their recollection, the more likely their recollection is to be accurate.&#8221;</span></p>

The evaluation of accuracy is a far more multi-faceted exercise, which inevitably involves testing veracity by reference to objective facts, proved independently of their testimony by documentation, motives and overall probabilities. Consistency of account, from first recollection and over time is also not to be discounted where it can be evaluated in the above way. Where a witness&#8217;s account is verified by this kind of external support, it matters not whether it is delivered confidently or diffidently. </span></p>

Contested trials last long enough as it is without spending time on evidence which is irrelevant and cannot affect the outcome. Relevance must, and can only, be judged by reference to the issue which the court (whether judge or jury) is called upon to decide. As Lord Simon of Glaisdale observed in Director of Public Prosecutions v Kilbourne <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1973] AC 729" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1973">[1973] AC 729</ref>, 756, &#8220;Evidence is relevant if it is logically probative or disprobative of some matter which requires proof &#8230;. relevant (ie. logically probative or disprobative) evidence is evidence which makes the matter which requires proof more or less probable&#8221;.</span></p>

If such a person would, or might, attach importance to evidence such as this, it would require good reasons to deny a judicial decision-maker the opportunity to consider it. For while there is a need for some special rules to protect the integrity of judicial decision-making on matters of fact, such as the burden and standard of proof, it is on the whole undesirable that the process of judicial decision-making on issues of fact should diverge more than it need from the process followed by rational, objective and fair-minded people called upon to decide questions of fact in other contexts where reaching the right answer matters. Thus in a civil case such as this the question of admissibility turns, and turns only, on whether the evidence which it is sought to adduce, assuming it (provisionally) to be true, is in Lord Simon's sense probative. If so, the evidence is legally admissible. That is the first stage of the enquiry.</span></p>

For the party seeking admission, the argument will always be that justice requires the evidence to be admitted; if it is excluded, a wrong result may be reached. In some cases, as in the present, the argument will be fortified by reference to wider considerations: the public interest in exposing official misfeasance and protecting the integrity of the criminal trial process; vindication of reputation; the public righting of public wrongs. These are important considerations to which weight must be given. But even without them, the importance of doing justice in the particular case is a factor the judge will always respect. The strength of the argument for admitting the evidence will always depend primarily on the judge's assessment of the potential significance of the evidence, assuming it to be true, in the context of the case as a whole.</span></p>

First, it is likely to be said that admission of the evidence will distort the trial and distract the attention of the decision-maker by focusing attention on issues collateral to the issue to be decided. This&#8230; is often a potent argument, particularly where trial is by jury. Secondly, and again particularly when the trial is by jury, it will be necessary to weigh the potential probative value of the evidence against its potential for causing unfair prejudice: unless the former is judged to outweigh the latter by a considerable margin, the evidence is likely to be excluded. Thirdly, stress will be laid on the burden which admission would lay on the resisting party: the burden in time, cost and personnel resources, very considerable in a case such as this, of giving disclosure; the lengthening of the trial, with the increased cost and stress inevitably involved; the potential prejudice to witnesses called upon to recall matters long closed, or thought to be closed; the loss of documentation; the fading of recollections. &#8230; In deciding whether evidence in a given case should be admitted the judge's overriding purpose will be to promote the ends of justice. But the judge must always bear in mind that justice requires not only that the right answer be given but also that it be achieved by a trial process which is fair to all parties.&#8221;</span></p>

There are two questions that the judge must address in a case where there is a dispute about the admission of evidence of this kind. Firstly, is the evidence relevant, as potentially making the matter requiring proof more or less probable? If so, it will be admissible. Secondly, is it in the interests of justice for the evidence to be admitted? This calls for a balancing of factors of the kind that Lord Bingham identifies at paragraphs 5 and 6 of O'Brien.</span></p>

That question was considered by the Supreme Court in the criminal case of R v Mitchell <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2016/55" uk:canonical="[2016] UKSC 55" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] UKSC 55</ref> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2017] AC 571" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] AC 571</ref>, where it was said that the defendant, who was charged with murder by stabbing, had used knives on a number of other occasions, none of which had led to a conviction but which on the prosecution's case showed propensity.

Must the facts of each individual incident be considered by the jury in isolation from each other? In my view, the answer to both these questions is "No".</span></p>

The jury is entitled to - and should - consider the evidence about propensity in the round. There are two interrelated reasons for this. First the improbability of a number of similar incidents alleged against a defendant being false is a consideration which should naturally inform a jury's deliberations on whether propensity has been proved. Secondly, obvious similarities in various incidents may constitute mutual corroboration of those incidents. Each incident may thus inform another. The question &#8230; is whether, overall, propensity has been proved.</span></p>

Equally, she will make findings of fact on all the evidence available to her, including her assessment of the parents' credibility; she is not limited to the expert evidence. I am also content to decide the question in this appeal on the basis that a judge &#8230; is not required slavishly to adhere to a schedule of proposed findings placed before her by a local authority. To take an obvious example: care proceedings are frequently dynamic and issues emerge in the oral evidence which had not hitherto been known to exist. It would be absurd if such matters had to be ignored. All that said, however, the following propositions seem to me to be equally valid. Where, as here, the local authority had prepared its Schedule of proposed findings with some care, and where the fact-finding hearing had itself been the subject of a directions appointment at which the parents had agreed not to apply for various witnesses to attend for cross-examination, it requires very good reasons, in my judgment, for the judge to depart from the schedule of proposed findings. Furthermore, if the judge is, as it were, to go "off piste", and to make findings of fact which are not sought by the local authority or not contained in its Schedule, then he or she must be astute to ensure; (a) that any additional or different findings made are securely founded in the evidence; and (b) that the fairness of the fact finding process is not compromised.&#8221;</span></p>

What I find myself evaluating is an alleged course of behaviour, manifested in different ways and contested to varying degrees. A great deal of the behaviour in focus relates to interactions between the staff and the family but some of it concerns specified allegations of covert tampering with G&#8217;s ventilation equipment.

The alternative options, however, are elusive. One of the suggestions made involved creating &#8220;narrative statements&#8221; which it was submitted, would allow there to be consideration of the overall nature of the relationships in focus. It was advanced that such an approach would allow the court to identify the real character of the allegations before then going on to look at the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;granular detail&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> I recognise that the structure of the allegations here is steeped in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;granular detail&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and also runs the risk of occluding the significance of the totality of the alleged behaviours and their impact, on both sides. Ms Roper KC, on behalf of the Official Solicitor, suggests that the Court should approach its judgement by &#8220;narrative&#8221; findings based on an adaptation of the model discussed above. I am not sure whether my judgment reflects Ms Roper&#8217;s aspiration but I have endeavoured to address the overall picture emerging from the broad evidential canvas as well as its individual parts. </span></p>

Ultimately, I have not found the structure of the schedule to have been an entirely satisfactory framework by which to navigate this highly contentious case. When I asked Miss Khalique at the outset of the hearing if there was to be an application to commit for these alleged breaches, I was told, after some deliberation, that there was not. I have taken the central allegations and themes and constructed this judgment around them. A narrative summary of my findings can be found below (paras 201-211). </span></p>

It is said to have been repeatedly intimidating, threatening, challenging and insidiously rude. It is asserted that this behaviour was deliberate, intending to weaken the placement to the point where it was no longer viable. Its impact is said to have been deeply corrosive of morale. It is contended that the family&#8217;s behaviour was orchestrated to undermine the professional confidence of the staff and to portray them as incompetent and unsuitable to care for G. This is the real nature of the first tranche of allegations. As the President suggested, it is helpful to recognise and establish the true complexion of the allegations and then consider the granular detail. </span></p>

As the hearing progressed, the family&#8217;s criticisms of CH became increasingly florid. GR describes the care home as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;like a prison but even worse than a prison&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. She repeatedly describes CH as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;disgusting&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.

Both LF and GR told me explicitly that they remain 100% committed to G being removed from CH. I have been struck by the number of times the parents have described themselves as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;terrified&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> by what they see as the poor quality of G&#8217;s care. It is LF who uses that word most. I also note that when he does so, he becomes visibly distressed. This is in contrast with his rather more overbearing manner when talking, often in challenging terms, about G&#8217;s medical needs. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">As the hearing evolved, LF has made dark, unspecified insinuations about G having been sexually abused at her care home. I should emphasise that there is not a scintilla of evidence in support of this. Mr Patel has advanced no case in respect of it. If these insinuations have any evidential relevance, it is only as yet further illustration of LF&#8217;s determination to terminate the placement. This has further resonance in an issue that arose at the very end of the hearing. At Mr Patel&#8217;s request, I agreed to look at a recent photograph of G with what is being suggested is a &#8216;black eye&#8217;, inflicted abusively by an unknown carer or nurse. I emphasise that whatever Counsel&#8217;s perorations on this, there was no doubt at all that this was being advanced by LF as an abusive injury. I was asked to listen to a covert recording of the nurse&#8217;s response when this complaint was made to her. I have been told that LF reported this alleged assault to the police (Mr Patel confirmed that those were his instructions). There is no doubt at all that LF considered the nurse&#8217;s response to his complaint to be some kind of admission of fault. There has been no medical opinion, as yet, but an explanation was proffered by the nurse (a burst vessel whilst cleaning G&#8217;s eyes) which, to the lay person, seems, at the very least, as viable as that proffered by LF. The point here is that LF rushed immediately to a hostile interpretation and is resistant to any benign explanation. As to the nurse making any admission, the recording reveals nothing of the kind. The interpretation LF places upon it requires a distortion of perspective. The nurse, who was plainly offended, eventually stated </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;well&#8230; alright, you know what, maybe we&#8217;ve smashed her in the face&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. This was a nurse, who at that particular point, had simply had enough and wasn&#8217;t going to let an allegation of physical abuse of this nature go by unchallenged. In different circumstances, her response might be seen as unprofessional. On some level, it is; however, placed in the context of LF&#8217;s corrosive behaviour, I do not consider it attracts criticism. She was, in my judgement, indicating to LF, in plain, albeit ironic language, what she regarded as an absurd and manipulative allegation. </span></p>

It is important that I emphasise that she expresses this view cordially and politely. Despite the compelling professional consensus as to its danger, she continues, for example, to believe that it was wrong to have removed G&#8217;s central venous line. I find her position on this both unsustainable and alarming. CJ allies herself entirely with her son. Her respect for his medical knowledge and opinion is boundless. As I have already alluded to, with no hesitation and with absolute confidence, she told me that LF knew more about G&#8217;s condition than </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;anybody else in the court room&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> She asserts that each of the family members is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;trained&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;expert&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> in G&#8217;s care. She has appeared in person and cross examined the care staff. She was courteous, thorough, and well-versed with the documentation. She presented as confident; indeed, I sense she was relishing her opportunity to question the staff in a public forum. They were in the witness box; she was at the front of Counsel&#8217;s row. They, in her mind, were on trial. Of course, there is inevitably a highly adversarial complexion to this case but it is important not to lose sight of the fact that the overarching ethos of this hearing is investigative, non-adversarial and driven by the statutory obligation to promote the best interests of G. </span></p>

LF suggests that the staff have read and digested my findings relating to the family&#8217;s behaviour at the children&#8217;s hospital and adopted it as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;an algorithm that works&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> to construct a false narrative against the family. The phrase, coined by LF has, in my judgement, been carefully thought out. It was not a spontaneous concept conceived in the witness box. What LF means by it, as I understand it, is that the allegations which contend that he has been threatening and challenging have found favour in earlier judgments and the care and nursing staff have, dishonestly, copied them. It is suggested that this is motivated by a plan to conceal the depths and breadth of their own negligence. Inevitably, that has led to assertions that documentation has also been used dishonestly with the intention of discrediting the family. For this reason, LF tells me he felt justified in covertly recording the care home staff for many months. </span></p>

It is important that before I consider the detail of their evidence, I record the impact that they had on me as a group. They left a marked and lasting impression. I have never seen a group of professionals so deeply demoralised, profoundly distressed, devitalised and dispirited. They had been reluctant to come to Court, they yielded with disheartened resignation to many points put to them in cross examination, seemingly at times, prepared to agree to anything to get their ordeal over. Some felt unsupported by their senior management (not in my view without some justification), almost all of them felt that they were on trial. Some, and it is unnecessary for me to name them, were profoundly unnerved by the experience of coming to Court and having to give evidence. One witness was visibly shaking, at least two of them were suffering from depression. Each of them, without exception, was acutely conscious of the family in the courtroom and although they, mostly, retained their professional composure, I was left with no doubt that their experience was painful and for some, traumatising. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">My recollection is that requests had been made, at earlier hearings which must have been before Miss Khalique was instructed, requesting that the statements stand as evidence, with the attendance of their authors dispensed with (LF interprets this as the witnesses&#8217; wish to retract their evidence). Given the very serious nature of the allegations made, it was impossible to grant such a wide-scale request. Miss Khalique requested that the witnesses be permitted to give evidence on video-conferencing platform. I declined that. I did that because in my view, the complexion of the evidence, involving allegations and counter allegations, required parity of participation for both sides. Thus, if the parents were required to give evidence in the witness box, so too were those making the allegations against them. This, in my view, was essential to the fairness of the process. I am bound to say that even the trauma caused to the witnesses does not cause me to regret the correctness of the decision. Moreover, the hearing simply could not have been conducted fairly without, at least some oral evidence being heard and challenged. Only in this way could the voluminous written evidence in other statements and documents be properly evaluated. This is, for example, the approach I took to the evidence of Nurse CB i.e., by evaluating its reliability in the light of the wider canvas and examining its own internal consistency. This witness did not give oral evidence. Ultimately, I accepted that given a relatively recent diagnosis of a serious neurological condition, which was symptomatic, it would be unreasonable to expect her to attend, either in person or remotely. Whilst I of course bear in mind that her evidence could therefore not be put to the assay by way of cross examination, that does not render it valueless.  I was able to listen to extensive recordings of her, taken covertly and thus entirely without her own knowledge. This material, which involved her interactions with LF, helped me to assess the general demeanour of both. Though at risk of emphasising that which might be regarded as obvious, assessing individuals in audio recordings, in real time situations, may, as here, have qualitative advantages. Assessing people in the stressful artificiality of a witness box in a busy courtroom may carry inevitable disadvantages. The former has, in many ways, greater authenticity and most obviously so in the case of the individuals who do not know they are being recorded. </span></p>

Nobody watching these people give evidence in this courtroom could fail to see the impact that contact with this family had upon them. I agree with IW. I have found watching their evidence a disturbing experience. Their position had not been helped by the way the lawyers for the ICB had prepared their case. I am afraid this criticism requires to be levelled and must be faced. The initial statements of many of the witnesses had been taken by way of free flow narrative, from recollection, some months after events, with no or scant reference to the relevant forms and documentation. This is simply poor practice. It resulted in inevitable revisions when the exercise was properly completed and revealed, predictably, that statements taken entirely by way of memory test are unlikely to be accurate. This opened obvious forensic opportunity which Mr Patel exploited, both in detail and at length, as he was bound to do. Moreover, all this occurred in the face of my entreaties to the ICB, at several directions&#8217; hearings, to ensure that the evidence was presented with tight forensic care. Allegations of this kind, raising safeguarding issues of this complexion, is unfamiliar territory for lawyers acting for health bodies in the Court of Protection. It was for this reason that I tried to signal, in advance, the forensic discipline required. </span></p>

In the end, very few of the transcripts or recordings have been referred to. Most of those that have been considered, I should record, have tended to weaken LF&#8217;s own case rather than enhance it. As I have already commented but I consider to bear repetition, it is quite extraordinary how frequently that occurs in cases where lay parties compile covert recordings. For reasons that I will look at below, some of the most cogent evidence against the family is provided from this source. I raise the question of the recordings here, however, because it is important to identify the fundamental attack they represent on the professional privacy of those working at the care home. The recordings took place over many months. Moreover, it seems that IW knew they were continuing some considerable time before they were finally stopped. He appears to have accepted LF&#8217;s assertion that his actions were legal, they were not. The destructive impact of this fundamental breach of trust between the professionals and the family cannot be underestimated. </span></p>

Here, they involve, as so frequently they do, two completely different and essentially irreconcilable versions of the same incident and, commonly, with high level of agreement as to the language that was used. It is &#8216;a parallel universe&#8217;, a phrase which has been used with some regularity during the course of the evidence. The incident also provides a characteristic example of LF&#8217;s attitude to these confrontations taking place in G&#8217;s presence. Though it was twice pointed out to him that the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;heated disputes over her head&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> were entirely inappropriate, he simply was not prepared to acknowledge any substance in that at all. This attitude is reflected in his approach to the covert recordings. He simply does not recognise that G&#8217;s right to privacy is also engaged. When GR was asked about this on a different occasion, she said that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;[G] does a little shake&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> when she </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;hears raised voices&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. She went on to say that G liked the fact that her parents were arguing on her behalf. There remains no consensus as to what G can absorb of her surroundings but the proposition that she is understanding, let alone excited by arguments concerning the circumstances of her care, is vanishingly unlikely. Moreover, if it were the case that she understood what was going on, it is deeply concerning that her mother interprets G&#8217;s &#8216;shaking&#8217; (if that does occur) as reflective of her pleasure in the conflict rather than the far more obvious interpretation i.e., that she might be distressed. </span></p>

This would of course fit with GR&#8217;s belief that G is excited by LF&#8217;s persistent criticisms of the staff.

No example has been pointed out to me that shows anything other than the staff holding a professional line against softly spoken but persistent and withering criticism. Virtually all of this has occurred in the presence of G. Alongside all this, the family has launched a barrage of professional complaints. Though I have repeatedly asked, I have not been able to obtain the precise number. This is in part because they continue to grow. All I can say is that there have been over 100. These complaints sap time, energy and are caustic to professional morale. </span></p>

I have expressed my concern and I have not received any satisfactory answer.

Though this jars with me, I do not say it to be critical of the parents. I can understand why G might always be seen as their little girl. I observed in my earlier judgments that one of the many reasons that children&#8217;s hospital had become unsuitable for G was that she was infantilised by her surroundings. In a case where I am disappointed to be unable to identify very many positives, one has been obvious. The staff of CH treat G as a woman in her late twenties. I have noticed this on a number of occasions throughout the evidence. Nurse K told me that she was very conscious that she and G are the same age. She told me that when planning for G&#8217;s day, she asked herself what she would want to do and then tried to transpose that into G&#8217;s world. She told me that she liked meeting up with her friends and so she would ensure that G had some opportunity for socialising. She had formed no real impression of G&#8217;s capacity to connect with the world but worked on the assumption that she was able to gain some pleasure from her environment. I have paraphrased her exact words but I am confident that this was the gist of them. The staff of CH care for adults. Each of them treats G as an adult and, I find, has instinctive regard for her dignity. It is, for example, now the case that she is always dressed when she meets her father, regard being taken to promote her privacy. They have taken the view that is what any young woman of G&#8217;s age would prefer. I consider this to be an appropriate and sensitive approach. </span></p>

Her parents had telephoned ahead to say that they were having difficulty with public transport. In my view, the carer, HLS, was sceptical about the explanation. By this time, there were already strict restrictions in place setting clear boundaries for the family&#8217;s interaction with G at the home. The cut off time for return had been set at 6pm, by Court order. On this occasion, it was certainly past 7:30pm when they returned. HLS began her interactions with the parents politely and, I note, focusing on G, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;hello G, let&#8217;s get you in the warm&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Perhaps unwisely, in the circumstances, HLS intimated that the staff had no problems getting in from the same location. She then continued </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;as you&#8217;re not coming in, can I just have the midazolam&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. In my view, HLS had simply assumed that, given the late hour, everybody would focus on the priority of getting G comfortably to bed. Her remark, however, triggered an immediate, almost firework, reaction in both G&#8217;s parents. On this occasion, GR was particularly voluble. She is a very different personality from her partner, she lacks something of his subtlety and finesse. She reacted aggressively and, in a way, calculated to intimidate the staff. Her reaction to HLS&#8217; assumption that the handover would be quick was both immediate and extreme. She did not politely enquire whether they could enter and do their checklist as usual, she went directly to the offensive, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;what do you mean we&#8217;re not coming in?&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> she asked. HLS responded </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;because she&#8217;s late. I&#8217;ve just got to take her from here&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">GR&#8217;s arguments were to hand. Though she was fully aware that the family were not allowed in the care home after 6pm, she argued </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;the order doesn&#8217;t say we can&#8217;t take G in&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. I have not the slightest doubt that the parents were testing the boundaries and had anticipated a problem. HLS tried to diffuse the situation </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;right, well right, hold on. You can come to the door of the ward&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. GR did not back down </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;yeah exactly&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> she said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;you do not get G on the doorstep. I will tell you that. You do not get G on the doorstep&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> Given that HLS had already relented, that was unnecessarily combative. As if the situation were not difficult enough, LF ratcheted up the ante further, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;this is a gross insult to G&#8217;s dignity, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, he questioned. The exchanges continued with LF and GR sparking off each other. HLS asked, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;can you just sign the midazolam in?&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. LF immediately asserted his perceived authority </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;yeah, as soon as we&#8217;ve done the checks&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. HLS said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;you don&#8217;t need to do the checks&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. LF was having none of this, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;yeah we do.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">; he responded. Another nurse arrived and the altercation continued in a similar vein. It is important to recount that, in her determination to enter the building, GR, who I find on the clear evidence of the recording, was out of control, collided the wheel of G&#8217;s wheelchair with HLS&#8217; foot. At the time of preparing her statement, HLS perceived that as a deliberate act on GR&#8217;s part. In cross-examination, HLS recognised that she could not be sure. In her evidence, she stated that the foot had been sore for a few days afterwards. When challenged by Mr O&#8217;Brien KC, on behalf of GR, as to why she had not included that detail in her statement, she responded, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;her running over my foot and shouting. My foot being sore has nothing to do with G&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Expressly, she told me and I think with an understandable degree of frustration at this process, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;we should be focusing on G&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. For the avoidance of doubt, it was being suggested to her that she had deliberately exaggerated the incident. I do not consider that she had although her written account was inaccurate. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In her statement, HLS had described GR as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;screaming&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. This too was said to be an exaggeration. Again, I do not consider it was. Whether it is exactly the right word or not, however, does not matter. GR&#8217;s response was extreme and entirely unacceptable. After they had secured entry into CH, HLS says that they </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;barged&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> into the unit. That is certainly consistent with GR&#8217;s obvious state of mind and indeed the earlier incident with the wheelchair. The situation was, by this time, a very long way from the swift handover that HLS had planned. Not only had the parents gone into the unit, but they had also now gone into G&#8217;s room. I was also disturbed to hear that GR had taken G&#8217;s trousers down to check her incontinence pad. HLS was genuinely, in my judgment, disturbed by this. In her statement, she referred to it and described GR as having </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;pulled G&#8217;s trousers down&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> In cross examination, she accepted that she had only pulled them </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;halfway down&#8221;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> What emerges both from the statement and from her oral evidence is HLS&#8217; real concern for G&#8217;s privacy and the inability of both parents to recognise it. It was perfectly clear from the framework that had been put in place that a task such as checking the incontinence pad was a nursing responsibility. GR was well aware of that. I am left with the impression that she regarded this incident as a battle that she had to win. In the end, she got all her own way and then went further. In my judgement, she deliberately crossed the boundaries. In checking the incontinence pad, GR was making a point. It simply did not occur to her that her perceived victory was at the expense of her daughter&#8217;s dignity. There were a number of people present when the incontinence pad was checked and I accept HLS&#8217; evidence that the door to G&#8217;s room was not closed. All this conflicted with HLS&#8217; core medical values. It plainly struck her as wrong. It is for that reason, in my judgement, that she has remembered it and put it in her statement. GR does not deny this, but she lacks any insight into how her behaviour might be perceived by others. She was fully aware that she had breached the court order,</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> &#8220;yeah, we broke the order so you&#8217;d better go and report us&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

This process was a focus of anxiety for staff, particularly when the family were present. Accordingly, the court orders, provided that the family were not to be present. I emphasise that the objective of these orders, which reverberates through the earlier judgments, was to try to reset the parents&#8217; relationship with their daughter. The intention was to harness their undoubted strengths and love for her but in the role of parents, not as medics or care staff. Following the advice referred to in the earlier paragraphs of this judgment, the aim was to encourage the family to enjoy G as the young woman she is and for what she has to offer, rather than to focus upon her as a raft of medical needs. The ambition was to release LF, in particular, from his preoccupation with medical lexicon and to enable him to communicate with his adult daughter, both verbally and non-verbally, in a way which maximised the opportunities for both. </span></p>

It is impressive, but it is also obsessive. The latter has on occasions, occluded his objectivity. As I found, in my earlier judgments, the assertion of his own medical opinions, sometimes in the face of unanimous contrary views, expressed by very experienced doctors, have placed his daughter in peril. Though it is expressed in plain terms in my earlier judgment, LF cannot and I suspect never will, confront it. Neither can his family. Unfortunately, LF deploys his knowledge in a manner which is entirely counterproductive. He converts the gold that he has to offer into base metal. Were he to have chosen to share his experience, working collaboratively with the staff of CH, a great deal of painful conflict could have been averted. More than that, G&#8217;s care could have been enhanced. It is not a criticism of the CH staff to say that LF could have helped them with their patient. Indeed, I strongly suspect that there is not a single member of staff who would disagree with this as a proposition. </span></p>

In that context, the case law illustrates the singular importance of parents and relatives who can act as a conduit for P&#8217;s likely wishes and feelings.

G&#8217;s parents were outside the room, as they were required to be during the hoisting process. EB states that the moment G had been placed into her chair, the parents came in. She describes them as effectively hovering, compliant with the letter of CH&#8217;s decision nor that of the court order but not engaging with its spirit. EB said that the parents did not knock or ask if they had finished and that EB was still trying to get G comfortable. The parents were asked to take a step back but LF objected, reasoning that as the transfer had been completed, they were allowed back into the room. I find EB&#8217;s evidence here entirely convincing, it is congruent and logical. It has a banality to it which serves to reinforce its reliability. It has the hallmark of detail which points to its veracity. There is no conceivable reason why such an account should be made up. Moreover, it captures LF&#8217;s attitude to the framework of the orders. </span></p>

The behaviour being described in relation to LF is petulant, childish and, once again, some distance from promoting G&#8217;s own best interests. In fact, EB records that LF did step back, he was manifestly in the way of the carers who were trying to make his daughter comfortable. In his insistence that the embargo on his entry into the room ceased the moment G was sitting in the chair, comfortably arranged or not, LF was taking the same combative approach that I have described relating to his late return the day before. Essentially, he is taking a strict &#8216;legalistic&#8217; approach to the interpretation of the order and CH&#8217;s subsequent decision. The lay person would put it more bluntly; he is playing games with the staff, intending to make life as uncomfortable for them as possible, asserting his own dominance. This is, of course, entirely consistent with his stated avowal to do everything in his power to bring the placement at CH to an end.

I think LF&#8217;s concerns were addressed adequately at the time but, in any event, the way he raised them was characteristically critical and hostile. LF disputes all this. He also disputes that he said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;you&#8217;ve already hoisted her so why should we move&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. I reject his evidence on this. I find EB&#8217;s account channels LF&#8217;s authentic voice, thinking style and general behaviour. Indeed, I would say that the evidence of his rudeness and critical grinding, low level aggression is present in such abundance that it is almost redundant of any coherent denial. </span></p>

Ms S had been told that G was ready to be discharged and so went with Nurse KP and a senior HCA, SM, to transfer G back to the care home. Usually, G would be discharged by ambulance, but on this day there was a national ambulance strike. When Ms S arrived on the ward, the nurses asked if she would help transfer G to her wheelchair. She told me that she checked the equipment and the transfer was completed successfully. Immediately afterwards, LF and GR returned to the ward. LF pointed out that there was a very slight crack in one of the tubes for G&#8217;s ventilator. The nurses were asked whether there was a spare tube but apparently there was not. </span></p>

There is no doubt that it had a slight cosmetic crack but the nurses were satisfied that it was not affecting the function because the vent was secure and there was no risk of it coming loose. There appears to be agreement that G went back with the CH staff in the minibus and LF and GR travelled in their own vehicle. The minibus got back approximately 15 minutes before LF and GR. Ms S told me that they had managed to get G to her room and set up the equipment ready to hoist her back into bed. When LF and GR arrived, both were complaining that G had been exposed to risk of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;life-threatening&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">proportion. By this they meant the crack in the ventilation tube. CB was trying to diffuse the situation. She repeatedly asked the couple to leave but they declined. Ms S felt they were being particularly hostile to CB and intervened, eventually ensuring that they left the room. </span></p>

I care for all of my patients, their safety is a priority to me and I would never want any of them to come to any harm. If I had had any concerns that the ventilator wasn&#8217;t secure or that there was a risk to her life, I would not have transferred [G]. I had kept the piece and showed this to the managers and they also felt that as it needed as much force to disconnect as any other piece, my actions had not put [G]&#8217;s life at risk As a team, we decided it would be best if we put in safeguarding referral too, just to be sure, however it was unreportable as no harm had been caused and so we logged it as a Datix instead (this is the incident system we use for all of our incidents).</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In cross examination, Mr Patel put it to Nurse KP that the parents had raised this with her at the hospital and that they had offered to drive back to CH to bring a replacement port. It was further put to Nurse KP that she had told them that she would physically </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;hold it together&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> during the journey. My impression was that this was being suggested to emphasise the perceived precariousness of the situation. Nurse KP simply said she could not remember whether she had said that, nor could she clearly recall having heard the parents&#8217; offer to drive to CH and pick up a spare port, though she was prepared to agree that they might have. She also agreed that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;holding the port&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;was not an ideal&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">situation. Mr Patel pressed her as to whether this would, in fact, have been safe enough. Nurse KP conceded that it would not. The response, however, requires to be contextualised. Firstly, Nurse KP had made the assessment that notwithstanding the visible </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;tiny&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> crack, the port </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;looked and visually appeared and felt tight and secure&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. As I understand it, LF disagrees. Nurse KP felt confident in her own assessment but thought it appropriate to check with her colleague. Her colleague also confirmed that it was tight. This tiny crack, described as being on the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;top green piece&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, was not something Nurse KP had </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;ever seen before&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and she was unable to think how it</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> &#8220;could have happened&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. It is plain that Nurse KP carefully assessed the situation and was satisfied that G was comfortably receiving ventilation and oxygen. Moreover, and importantly in my view, Nurse KP asked the staff in ITU to examine the crack. They did so and were satisfied that it did not present a risk. Nurse KP took the decision that she would get G back to CH and change the vent there. Her answers to Mr Patel have to be considered against the full backdrop of her evidence and not in isolation. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is also clear that Nurse KP was deeply shocked by LF&#8217;s approach to her on his return to CH. He had travelled separately with GR and arrived 15 minutes after the ambulance. LF says, and I accept, that he went initially to G&#8217;s room and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;a minute later&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">he and GR went upstairs to speak with the manager (IW). I am satisfied that the parents did so to pursue a complaint. As it transpired, IW was in a meeting and so the parents returned downstairs and confronted KP. There can be no doubt, at all, that LF&#8217;s manner was markedly combative from the start of this exchange. He referred to keeping the circuit </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;as evidence&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, plainly insinuating a serious formal complaint or litigation of some kind. He referred to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;serious safeguarding concerns&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. This, it should be said, remains his position. What is striking from KP&#8217;s evidence, written statements and the evidence of her colleagues, is that Nurse KP was deeply shocked and clearly very shaken by the force and the gravity of the allegations that were being made against her. My findings thus far, in this judgment, and in my earlier judgment to which I will turn shortly, may have inured the reader to the significance of this incident. It requires to be seen for what it is, an unbridled attack on Nurse KP&#8217;s professional competence, in which it was being contended that she had risked the life of her patient. It was plainly a body blow for Nurse KP. In her statement, she said that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;it really upset me and it still does to this day&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. As I watched her, responding to Mr Patel&#8217;s questions, the evidence of this was all too clear to see. In her hesitant responses, she revealed not only the strain of giving evidence, but something rather deeper and more pervasive. I had the clear impression that her professional confidence had been shaken by the events of this day. LF is a forceful, prepossessing, and articulate man. He had succeeded in causing Nurse KP to doubt whether she had done the right thing for her patient and it is this that troubles her. Despite the strong and preponderant evidence that she has behaved with paradigm professional competence, she continues to review her actions that day with a self-critical eye. On the evidence I have heard, she need not do. Moreover, it is important to her and, for different reasons, to the family that I say this in the clearest and most unambiguous terms. </span></p>

The force of his behaviour, on his return to CH took her entirely by surprise. The extent and spontaneity of her distress, observed by others at CH was unmistakably authentic. It reinforces the accuracy of her account to the effect that LF had made far less of the cracked tube at the hospital than he did on his return to the unit. Where and to the extent that, KP&#8217;s evidence on this conflicts with that of LF, I prefer her evidence. </span></p>

In the record of the incident that she prepared, she noted that Nurse KP was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;visibly upset&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> by what had happened and that she had needed to take some time out to recover her composure. The situation had plainly escalated. The unit manager came down to support her staff. LF and GR were asked to leave the premises. In what is by now a pattern of behaviour, they declined to do so, preferring further to prosecute their perceived grievance. The earlier exchanges that I have set out were, unusually, not recorded. Alternatively, they were and the recording has been lost. Miss Khalique is highly sceptical about this. She submits that they have not been included because they would have been so strikingly inconsistent with LF&#8217;s own case. As the recordings resume a little time later and in respect of the same incident, Miss Khalique suggests that I can infer a deliberate doctoring of the evidence, particularly having regard to the many hours of recording and voluminous transcripts. I regard this as an entirely proper submission but I reject it. I am not prepared to draw the inferences Miss Khalique suggests I should. I consider that the absence of any recording or transcript for this part of the day attracts considerable suspicion but, ultimately, this is speculative. It is not sufficiently rooted in evidence of sufficient cogency to permit me to draw inferences. </span></p>

As far as I am aware, only [Dr H] has suggested [G]&#8217;s life expectancy to be into the fourth decade but this needs to be balanced against the very high level of ventilatory support that [G] requires which has negative implications for prognosis. Prior to that, [Dr R], Consultant Paediatric Neurologist, who cared for [G] from infancy, predicted neurodevelopmental progress plateauing and clinical decompensation in the second decade of [G]&#8217;s life. This has been borne out by progressively increasing technology related interventions, principally total dependence on a ventilator, being introduced to support [G]&#8217;s life. For the last five years, I am informed that her support from her ventilator has been at an abnormally high level and this will almost certainly be causing barotrauma to her lungs.</span></p>

Nurse G stated that she and other members of staff sometimes dread coming into work knowing they have to deal with him and several members of staff have left because of his unreasonable behaviour and the effect it has had on their mental health. Nurse G feared that if there was ever any incident involving G that his behaviour would escalate, as it has done in the past, and she would have to be the person to deal with him. Nurse G reported that he has a history of not abiding to restrictions which were put in place as a result of his actions, and this makes her nervous as coordinator of a busy HDU which cares for many sick children and their families. Nurse G recalled an incident where [LF] was banned from the unit due to an incident of poor behaviour which put G at risk, and he still secretly gained entry to the unit and security and senior management needed to be called to deal with the situation. Nurse G said many of the junior staff have similar concerns and have frequently expressed these concerns to her and other senior members of staff.&#8221;</span></p>

I have already mentioned, now on several occasions in this judgment, how he rationalises this. His explanation requires to be scrutinised carefully and his </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;algorithm&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> theory properly put to the assay. For it to be viable, it requires me to accept that the staff of CH, at all levels, have carefully orchestrated evidence of rudeness and aggression in which they have manufactured or exaggerated an incident and colluded together, in their evidence, to construct a false case against the family, skilfully replicating the tone and tenor of the earlier complaints. Some of the incidents are, in isolation, rather banal and ambiguous. If they are contrived, I am therefore required to impart a high level of subtlety and ingenuity to this conspiracy. Further, on my calculation, it requires me to accept that something in the region of 18 employees, worked together, over many months, effectively to manufacture a labyrinth of false evidence. Such behaviour requires a motive. LF asserts that the motive is to conceal wholesale incompetence and negligence in his daughter&#8217;s care. Miss Khalique, in her cross examination of LF, described this theory as &#8216;nonsense&#8217;. </span></p>

In attempting to encourage the witnesses to relax, I asked some general questions about their work and length of time that they had been at CH. What emerged was a clear impression of a staff who had, until the arrival of this family, been both proud of and fulfilled by their work. Many have worked at CH for a number of years. Some had been inspired and encouraged to apply for and take up more senior positions. Others had made the transition from Healthcare Assistants into Nursing. Without exception, each of those who gave evidence before me focused unswervingly on their patient. It is important to note that the many occasions in which they tried to diffuse conflict taking place in GR&#8217;s presence, occurred with absolutely no knowledge that they were being covertly recorded. Contrary to LF&#8217;s intentions, the recordings in their totality, as well as in relation to specific incidents, serve actively to undermine his own case. The forbearance, patience, courtesy and professionalism of the staff is evident in abundance. The occasional expressions of frustration are more than sorely provoked. What is revealed by the evidence requires to be identified in explicit and entirely unambiguous terms. This is bullying and controlling behaviour by LF, GR and, I regret to say, albeit in a rather more subtle and nuanced way, CJ. It is calculated to corrode the confidence of the professionals involved in G&#8217;s care with the deliberate intention of bringing about the stated aim of terminating the placement. Moreover, it also requires to be said that it is behaviour that is inimical to G&#8217;s interest, it is actively harmful; it threatens the stability of the placement, which I consider to be important to her. It has left her permanently surrounded by conflict, which contrary to the parents&#8217; views, I consider to be entirely irreconcilable with her welfare and it affords scant respect for her autonomy as an incapacitous adult. The fundamental right to autonomy does not evaporate with the loss of capacity, it requires vigilantly to be guarded by those charged with the responsibility and privilege of caring for her. </span></p>

I gave thought to this submission but, ultimately, I rejected it. These allegations, unlike the wider evidence relating to LF&#8217;s behaviour, serve only to raise suspicions of covert tampering with G&#8217;s equipment. They are undoubtedly similar to the allegations raised here but, in my judgement, an earlier suspicion which has never been put to proof evidentially, cannot logically provide corroborative evidential support for later allegations. In any event, its prejudicial impact would so strongly outweigh its probative value as to make the exercise intrinsically unsafe and, to my mind, unfair. For these reasons, I do not propose to take this earlier background material into account when evaluating the allegations of tampering with the machinery at CH. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The most striking allegation relates to G&#8217;s oxygen equipment. The professional consensus is that G should be permanently supported by 1litre of supplemental oxygen, 24 hours per day. I am satisfied that this was known to all staff and that, in light of what I have said, no member of staff would have intentionally turned the oxygen off. Historically, as noted above, LF considered that G was &#8216;overventilated&#8217;. I am not sure whether he still considers that to be the position but I note that he has expressed the opinion that G can maintain oxygen levels </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;for a few minutes, potentially longer when otherwise healthy and sedated&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. I think, LF is probably correct in his opinion. There is some evidence, derived from G&#8217;s admissions to hospital that she can maintain oxygen levels for short periods on room air only. In cross examining Ms W, CJ advanced the proposition that G had been on room air at A Hospital </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;for many days&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, with no oxygen. By contrast, when she was cross-examined herself by Miss Khalique, CJ said that G could not survive on room air </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;for a very long period of time&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. This last remark related to G&#8217;s present circumstances. I am unclear how CJ would know this. I should also say that the medical records also support the view that G could survive for some period on room oxygen alone. </span></p>

I have been told that they started to check the oxygen was on, with other members of staff, by opening the valve, turning on the flow meter and checking for the hiss of oxygen. As I understand it, this check had not been thought necessary in the past but had been devised to be absolutely clear what was happening in G&#8217;s case. </span></p>

CJ does not accept that this was a mistake. IW (manager) told me that he discussed this with Nurse LS and also concluded that it was a mistake. Again, CJ rejects this. She told me that she thought G can survive on room air based on her experience at A Hospital and some research that she has undertaken herself. </span></p>

Nurse CB recalls that Nurse W was undertaking the oxygen checks for all the rooms on that block with an HCA, after 8:15am. Nurse W says that only the HCA and CJ were present after she had checked the oxygen. Nurse W further told me, in the course of cross examination by CJ, that she was double checking G&#8217;s oxygen precisely because there was a concern, in effect, that something untoward might be happening. She said that they could all hear that the oxygen was on. </span></p>

I do not consider that there was any rush to premature judgement. Indeed, my impression of the staff is that they were far more ready to question themselves than to condemn the family. The audio recordings and transcripts reveal that members of staff&#8217;s first instincts were often to apologise to the family. The assumption was that if there was a problem with the oxygen equipment then that could only be attributable to an error on behalf of the nurses. It must be remembered that this is a family who have played an enormous part in their daughter&#8217;s care for 28 years. My assessment, both of the content and tenor of the evidence from CH, is that the staff were struggling to believe that anybody, let alone members of G&#8217;s family, would tamper with her oxygen supply. However, one fact which suffuses the records and statements is that it is a family member, almost invariably, who discovers that the oxygen supply is switched off. When it is a staff member, the enquiry as to whether the oxygen is on, is usually prompted by a family member. Predominately, this is LF. </span></p>

As I understand the evidence, Nurse B also walked in very shortly afterwards. It seems likely that CJ had seen Nurse B heading to the room. In text messages to her son much later that evening, she states </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;[Nurse B] was coming&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. When she came into the room, CJ told her that the oxygen was off. Thus, CJ could only have been in G&#8217;s room for a matter of minutes before the nurse arrived. When asked by Ms Roper whether G was exhibiting signs of distress, in consequence of a deprivation of oxygen, CJ said </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;I cannot remember&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. I find that response both disturbing and unconvincing. If G had been showing signs of struggling to breathe, I think it inconceivable that CJ would not have noticed. Nurse B makes no reference to her patient struggling to breathe or being in any way uncomfortable. Given that the oxygen provision was the focus of such attention, I am quite sure that had G been in difficulties, both Nurse B and CJ would have noticed. Moreover, CJ&#8217;s active resistance to her granddaughter&#8217;s placement at CH leads me to think that she would have complained vociferously, and rightly, if G had been struggling to breathe. I think it far more likely that there were no signs of G struggling. This raises the important question of what caused CJ to check the oxygen supply so quickly after entering the room. </span></p>

The preponderant evidence is that G could not have sustained this oxygen deprivation and certainly not to a degree such that by 10:50am the following day, she would be displaying no signs of respiratory distress.

Moreover, for this account to hold, it would logically require a double error i.e., errors by two separate professionals, in relation to the supply of oxygen, on two different occasions. Expressly, it would require the nurse on duty the evening before, (Nurse LS), to have failed to have turned the oxygen on and for Nurse W not to have checked the oxygen, at all, the following morning. It would also require Nurse B&#8217;s evidence to be either substantially embellished or entirely fabricated. I think that CJ accepts that this flows from her stated position. </span></p>

If this were a fabricated document, it is not entirely easy to see why it should have an inbuilt uncertainty to it. CJ insists that she simply did not have the opportunity to turn the oxygen valve off as she was in the constant sight of those present in the room. The HCA is stationed in the entry way to G&#8217;s room, the rather confused objective of which, was to give the family privacy. CJ suggested that she was under unrelenting scrutiny, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;being stared at&#8221;,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> to use her phrase. It is agreed that the HCA was sitting in the entry passage and, from this position, I am satisfied that would have afforded an opportunity quickly to switch off the oxygen without her seeing it.

The corrosive atmosphere that I have described in the allegations discussed above had not yet fully settled. Certainly, there was some anxiety and suspicion but this was nothing compared to that which followed. Having set out, in some detail, the events of this day, I am required, effectively, to choose between two entirely irreconcilable alternatives. In relation to the allegations against her, there is no burden on CJ to prove her innocence. The burden remains on the ICB throughout.  CJ&#8217;s account requires me to accept that two professional nurses negligently or deliberately jeopardised their patient&#8217;s life and subsequently fabricated adverse, but ambiguous, evidence against their patient&#8217;s grandmother. The alternative is that, for what can be no more than a matter of minutes, CJ took the opportunity to switch the oxygen off and immediately drew it to the attention of the staff. I consider, having analysed the evidence in the way I have sought to above, that the latter is far more likely. It was most probably motivated to make CH staff look incompetent, driven by the desire to destabilise the placement that CJ and the family have so consistently expressed. I emphasise that CJ&#8217;s account, would require G&#8217;s oxygen supply to have been off all night. I consider this to be extremely unlikely. </span></p>

I suspect that CJ may well be correct. She and her son, LF, have plainly given much thought to the question of G&#8217;s ventilation over the years. Indeed, LF claimed, at The children&#8217;s hospital and in the face of professional consensus, that G was </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;overventilated&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. This leads me to the view that CJ would be prepared to turn off the oxygen, confident that she could discredit the unit, without actually exposing G to risk. Objectively, of course, this is extraordinarily dangerous and reckless. If it was, as I believe, motivated to secure G&#8217;s release from CH, it is distorted thinking. </span></p>

That fact is part of the evidential matrix here. In the exchanges above, there is direct reference to it: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;next thing will be allegations of tampering again? Got to protect ourselves now x&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. LF has adduced this screenshot of part of a text message exchange. The extract cannot be evaluated in context, it is selective. The messaging appears to take place approximately 12 hours after the incident. Manifestly, it jars with some of the evidence that I have set out above. This is a further incident where LF&#8217;s material has obvious gaps in it. Miss Khalique has, in a different context (see para. 88 above) invited me to infer that LF has deliberately doctored the material. I declined to draw that inference and whilst I am suspicious that there is some contrivance here, I do not consider that two separate suspicions are sufficient to establish a finding. I do conclude, however, that this material does not dislodge my reasoning and finding, on the balance of probabilities, that CJ switched the oxygen off. </span></p>

In many ways, it crystalises the way issues are disputed in this case. The applicants contend that this was an incident of LF deliberately tampering with G&#8217;s oxygen equipment, by switching the valve off. The opposite explanation is that CH staff incompetently hoisted G, causing episodes of oxygen desaturation and distress. It is also said that CH staff failed to turn G&#8217;s oxygen on, thus depriving her of oxygen. I heard from three CH witnesses: Nurse W, EB and EL. On this occasion, GR was not present and the alternative account rests on the evidence of LF alone. By this stage, CH had devised a Family Interaction Form, which was intended to monitor their concerns. On the 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> September 2022, Nurse W was responsible for writing up the record.

It seems clear and it was confirmed in evidence that by this stage, staff were actively trying to assess whether LF was tampering with his daughter&#8217;s treatment. As a fact, this is not disputed. Of course, it lets in the possibility that heightened anxiety might lead to the wrongful interpretation of an act which might have been entirely innocuous. Mr Patel trailed this in cross-examination, understandably, but it is not in fact LF&#8217;s case. He believes this to be a deliberate conspiracy against him to conceal CH&#8217;s general nursing incompetence. </span></p>

NS, who was not in fact present for the hoisting, also states that she had checked G&#8217;s oxygen was on. Nurse W said that she had not checked the O2 valve herself but had trusted her staff to have done this. She had, however, checked the flow meter.  Hoisting G had always been fraught. Staff felt uneasy and found the family&#8217;s criticisms undermining. On this occasion, there is no doubt that LF had become agitated. Those present describe LF as distressed when he came into the room. Characteristically, as I have found, LF was critical of the staff: </span></p>

What is most striking to me and strongly inconsistent with LF&#8217;s case, is the extent to which the staff are both personally respectful to LF and prepared to yield to his care experience.

It is IW to whom LF usually complained. This signal would have been clear to the staff. What is significant in my mind is that it is requested at what appeared to be a crisis point and was inevitably increasing stress and conflict where, again, calm co-operation would have been the more obvious approach. There is also, I am bound to say, despite the apparent politeness of LF&#8217;s language, an imperiousness in asking the nursing staff to bring IW to the room. By this stage, the nurse (female speaker) has manifestly lost confidence in her own professional judgement and is explicitly blaming herself. </span></p>

On this date I was waiting outside her room (as the family had been requested to do) when she was being hoisted. During this time, her alarm went off continuously. After a period of at least 5 minutes, concerned that the alarm was still going, I knocked on the door and entered the room. I asked if I could tweak her position to open her airway. When this did not have the desired effect, I asked how much oxygen she had and I was told it was 10 litres. This did not make sense to me so I asked if the oxygen was on. One of the nurses checked and the oxygen was not on, and by that time [G] had been without oxygen for approximately 22 minutes, as this was the length of time the alarm had been going off on the desaturation monitor&#8221;.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Three of the nurses have stated that they saw LF go around the back of the chair. LF strenuously protests that was not true. He goes further and suggests that it would not have been possible. As I understood his evidence on this point, he was saying that he was comforting G, facing the front of the chair, whilst Nurse W was standing behind it, thus making it physically impossible for him to have gone behind the chair and switch the oxygen off. There is no room for mistake or misunderstanding here. LF is accusing the three nurses of concocting a false account against him. A moment&#8217;s reflection on the nurse&#8217;s comments and behaviours in the above extracts signals how unlikely this is. If the nurses had got together deliberately to traduce LF, their evidence might be expected to show some level of similarity or consistency, perhaps even in the words used. It does not, indeed, quite the reverse. Nurse CM said that she </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;believed&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> that LF had gone round the back of the oxygen </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;whilst asking what number it was&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Nurse EB said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;dad went round the back of the chair and said, &#8216;have you checked the oxygen&#8217;&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Nurse L recorded LF as having </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;reached behind the chair and then said, &#8220;is the O2 even on&#8221;&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Anybody listening to this recording can hear the stress in the nurses&#8217; voices (Nurse W described herself in evidence as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;unbelievably stressed&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> on this occasion). Having listened to it, I consider her description to be entirely accurate. Her stress is almost palpable on the recording. All this stress was greatly increased by what I identify as LF&#8217;s running manipulative, insidiously critical commentary. It is hardly surprising, in this heated situation, that the detail of accounts vary. However, those variations are only on the margins of the central observations. What remains consistent is the observation that LF went, in some way, behind the back of the chair. The differences in the account serve only to illustrate the fallibility of human memory for detail in stressful circumstances, conversely, I find that here, they reinforce the intrinsic honesty and accuracy of it. Where the evidence of the nurses conflicts with that of LF, I have no hesitation in preferring the former. </span></p>

Though skilfully cross-examined by Mr Patel and prepared to acknowledge both her own panic and distress, she withdrew, with the benefit of hindsight, her apology, heard on the recording. That apology was, in my judgement, the instinct of a nurse who was unable to reconcile LF&#8217;s apparent concern for his daughter with a deliberate interference with her oxygen supply. Her first instinct was to assume that the professionals had made a mistake. It is an indication of her own professionalism that she not only apologised but did so immediately. This of course, is not easily irreconcilable with the conspiracy that LF advances. The withdrawal of the apology is, I find, genuine not least because the whole episode still plainly causes her sadness. She suggested that LF may have turned the valve off earlier when G&#8217;s chair was in the lounge. This, in my view, is speculative. I place more weight on the evidence of the three nurses who saw LF reach behind the chair in G&#8217;s room. Mr Patel pressed Nurse W by suggesting that the earlier explanation might be a mistake by staff who had failed to turn the valve on. Again, Mr Patel is required to ride two forensic horses. LF contends that the oxygen supply was switched off in consequence of professional incompetence but also asserts that the evidence of the nurses is dishonest, to conceal their negligence and to place the blame on LF. To Mr Patel&#8217;s question, the nurse replied </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;it sounds great, but it is not reality&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. </span></p>

Nurse W was prepared to go along with this. I found her to be diffident in the witness box in much the same way that she is on the recording. However, as I have said above, I found the evidence of the three other nurses to be forensically robust and essentially consistent. Miss Khalique addresses this in her written submission: </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I agree with Miss Khalique that it is more likely that the resolution of G&#8217;s positioning resulted in her improvement. The importance of correct positioning has been a feature of this case and indeed has been emphasised and insisted upon by LF. I consider this to be the most probable explanation for G&#8217;s recovery at this incident. Moreover, it is important to emphasise that whilst I find this allegation proved on its individual facts, my finding is reinforced by the fact that, as will become clear below, LF behaved in this manner, tampering with his daughter&#8217;s medical equipment on other occasions. Thus, this allegation does not exist in a vacuum of its own. In coming to an alternative evaluation of this incident, it strikes me that the Official Solicitor has failed to afford sufficient weight to this point. Moreover, with respect to Ms Roper, I am unclear how she reconciles her submission that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;the Official Solicitor does not consider that it would be safe to conclude that this allegation is made out&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">with her ultimate conclusion (which I presume she does consider to be safe) that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;there was a mistake and G was left without her necessary oxygen&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. It does not follow inexorably, at least to my mind, that if the ICB&#8217;s allegation is not established, LF&#8217;s alternative explanation must be. This fails fully to engage with the evidential exercise or to identify and analyse the weight of the preponderant evidence. A further feature of this evidence which also requires to be emphasised is that LF was effectively raising the alarm to check whether the oxygen was on. As nursing staff have noted, this was a recurrent feature. As my analysis of the recording and transcripts reveals, LF was carefully taking every opportunity to insinuate his way back into control of G&#8217;s care. The panic and stress in the nurses&#8217; voice is quite notably absent from his. This may well have been what led Nurse W to say (see para. 141) </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;just got the feeling [LF] knew what the problem was&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. For the reasons I have given above, I find this allegation to be established. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">When evaluating the behaviour alleged against KP on 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> October, it is obviously important to place it in the context of what I find had occurred on 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> September 2022. The events of that day inevitably made the staff particularly cautious and wary. In her oral evidence, Nurse KP confirmed that on 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> October, Nurse S had undertaken the initial checks on the oxygen cylinder and that they had both heard the hissing sound, indicating that the oxygen was on. It has been part of LF&#8217;s and CJ&#8217;s case that it was possible for there to be a hissing sound even if the valve was off. Nurse KP had not encountered that. In both her oral and written evidence, she was clear that she had seen LF, at the back of G&#8217;s chair, which is where the oxygen cylinders are located. She was also very clear that as she was coming around the chair to do the final checks and before she had a chance to look at the cylinder, LF told her it was switched off. In her evidence, she said that LF&#8217;s hand was on the valve but she had not seen him actually turn it off. Again, when it was put to her that LF was being intensely scrutinised and could not have done this unnoticed, Nurse KP said </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;that everyone was doing their own job focusing on G&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. She explained that it would only be possible to see LF move the valve if they had been at the back of the chair. Mr Patel diligently pursued LF&#8217;s belief that the oxygen cylinder only </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;clunks&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> when the valve is opened for the first time. Nurse KP disagreed. With fidelity to his instructions, Mr Patel suggested to Nurse KP that the family had told them that they needed to be careful to ensure that the valve was opened as well as the flow meter. Nurse KP agreed that the family had indeed told her that but politely reminded Mr Patel </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;we knew that anyway&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. It is instructive to step back from this exchange to note the implication in Mr Patel&#8217;s question i.e., that &#8220;the family&#8221; consider that they were in charge, instructing the professionals as to how they should operate. Even Mr Patel&#8217;s question illustrates the distortion of the dynamics in this case, the underlying assumption of it, would be regarded as quite ridiculous in any other case. </span></p>

Certainly, this is what LF believes. But Nurse KP&#8217;s response was, effectively, that she did not know the answer to that. She emphasised that the care plan for G mandated oxygen on a permanent basis, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;24/7&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. For this reason, Nurse KP said that she had never attempted to support G without oxygen. She plainly considered that such an experiment would be unethical. </span></p>

The fact that there was a clunk would contradict the evidence that the oxygen was on as this sound only happens when turning the oxygen cylinder on for the first time. I note the evidence in [NS]&#8217;s statement that the &#8220;clunck&#8221; sound is made each time the cylinder is turned on. This is not correct. It is contradicted by the evidence from [Nurse CS] at paragraph 10 of her witness statement who says that the &#8220;clunk sound can sometimes be heard when the valve on the oxygen opens first&#8221;.

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">It is a sad feature of this case that LF remains so preoccupied with tasks like </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;completing his daily checks&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, as he puts it. Once again, LF had been busy covertly recording G and the nursing staff. Yet again, though he appears unable to comprehend it, the recording undermines his own case. Immediately after LF stated that the oxygen was not on, several members of staff spontaneously express their clear astonishment, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;we tested it&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> one voice said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;the oxygen was on&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Another voice said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;I heard it hiss&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.

There is none of the self-recrimination and professional doubt exhibited by Nurse W at the similar incident, four days earlier but a clear team confidence that the oxygen had been on. Along with the factual evidence, that I have analysed above, these recorded responses, revealing the nurses&#8217; reactions are important. I emphasise I am hearing responses in real time and not solely evaluating a witness&#8217;s recollection in the witness box. Miss Khalique and Ms Roper refer to the evidence in respect of this allegation as compelling. I agree. I find that LF deliberately tampered with G&#8217;s oxygen equipment by switching the valve off. As is plain from Mr Patel&#8217;s questions, LF plainly considers that G can breathe independently, at least for short periods. I am confident that in his own mind he would not wish to hurt his daughter but the danger generated by his actions is obvious. It also is important to say that it is a terrible violation of his daughter&#8217;s autonomy. It risks physically jeopardising her wellbeing, triggering, at very least, real discomfort. It also compromises her dignity. LF has real capacity to sooth, pacify and reassure his daughter. I believe that the professionals consider that G receives pleasure and reassurance from her father&#8217;s touch. It is profoundly sad that the man to whom she looks for protection has become a danger to her. </span></p>

She presented to me as professional, clear thinking and strikingly fastidious in her attention to detail. She described herself as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;paranoid&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> about checking and getting things right. Before she said that, I had already formed that impression of her. I also sensed that her role, because it is essentially supervisory, had enabled her greater protection from the forceful behaviour of this family which has so demoralised the CH staff. She had retained a professional distance. I emphasise that in saying this, I imply no criticism of those who struggled to do the same. This professionalism is also evident in her dealings with CJ on this occasion. I found Nurse SJ to be firm but polite and ready to recognise that CJ herself is always at pains to be courteous even when she is being critical of staff. I also formed the strong impression that Nurse SJ was disinclined to be distracted by the family&#8217;s own agenda and to concentrate unswervingly on G. I have seen Nurse SJ&#8217;s contemporaneous note relating to this incident. Nurse SJ&#8217;s conversation with CJ, reflected in the note, reinforces my view of her. I strongly suspect that Nurse SJ rarely makes mistakes but she volunteered to CJ that she had made a mistake the previous evening concerning G&#8217;s humidifier. She told CJ that it was not a mistake she would normally have made but she rationalised it as having become </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;flustered&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> by G&#8217;s parents. It is, to my mind, an indication of Nurse SJ&#8217;s experience and integrity that she declared her mistake, when she had no need to do so, to a family who were vigilant in finding fault. She used it as an opportunity to try to communicate to CJ that the family&#8217;s constant questioning of the staff&#8217;s professionalism was counterproductive and that the impact on them risked having an impact on G. </span></p>

I agree with the thrust of Ms Roper&#8217;s submissions in relation to it. CJ&#8217;s reaction was entirely without grace, kindness or any generosity of spirit. She told Nurse SJ that she already knew about her mistake because LF had told her. Her response was to say, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t leave a poor driver to drive on their own&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. There are a number of features about this remark which capture the character of the relationship between the family and the staff. First, the family regard the staff, virtually without exception as far as I can see, as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;poor drivers&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> i.e., incompetent professionals.

CJ&#8217;s failure to grasp the hand being offered to her signals, I regret to say, that there is very little hope of a constructive collaborative working relationship between this family and any care or medical professionals. Any family has a right to challenge a doctor or nurse. Sometimes families do know better. They know their relative in a way that strangers do not. But all this is a far cry from the behaviour of this family. What they do not accept is the professional&#8217;s right to challenge them in the best interests of their patient. </span></p>

SS said that they had all just checked this and were clear that the oxygen was on. CJ responded by asking if SS was calling her a liar. Nurse SJ also had a conversation with CJ almost immediately after the oxygen was discovered to have been switched off. She told me that she addressed CJ in these terms: </span></p>

However, I agree with Miss Khalique and Ms Roper that there are key and consistent features in the evidence. First, two HCAs and an extremely experienced nurse (who all agree has a fastidious personality) all insist that they checked G&#8217;s oxygen that morning and were clear that it was on at the valve. Second, the collapse of the shelf created a disturbance and CJ was seen to go around the back of G&#8217;s wheelchair. Third, at that point, despite the checks, CJ announced the oxygen to be off. </span></p>

It also records that the O2 had been checked prior to transfer and set to 2L and that there had been &#8220;auditory confirmation [a hiss] that valves were open&#8221;.  The record states that [Nurse SJ] only arrived after the O2 had been checked, that the transfer was smooth and that [G] &#8217;s SpO2 did not drop at all.

Neither [SS] nor [Nurse SJ] say in their written evidence that [CJ] had done this, and [Nurse SJ]&#8217; recollection is that she was there at an earlier stage.

She engaged confidently and openly with Mr Patel&#8217;s questions, had a demonstrably clear recollection of events, openly recognised the discrepancies in some of the documentation but was clear that she had followed her usual meticulous regime and checked the cylinders. G&#8217;s SpO</span><span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">2</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> might reasonably have been expected to drop in hoisting had the oxygen been disconnected, the contemporaneous records all state that it did not. I found SS to be a similarly impressive witness. Her evidence had the hallmark of detail, her responses to Mr Patel were kind and measured, particularly in response to CJ&#8217;s deft and clinical testing out of the inconsistencies in the evidence regarding when she was said to have gone to the back of G&#8217;s chair. Those discrepancies I have found, ultimately, to be eclipsed by the wider preponderant evidence. I also reject CJ&#8217;s assertion that the notes had been falsified. As Ms Roper says, these were prepared long before any fact-finding hearing was in contemplation. Ms Roper submits that CJ momentarily switched off the oxygen valve on G&#8217;s portable oxygen cylinder and contends that this accords with </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;a pattern of behaviour&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.

I agree with this submission but would emphasise that whilst CJ may well have thought this action would not expose G to risk, it is self-evident that tampering with the oxygen supply of a vulnerable young woman must carry inherent risk. Accordingly, I find that CJ did switch off the oxygen valve on this occasion. Having made a similar finding in relation to events on the 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> August 2022, I consider that both findings, separately arrived at, serve to reinforce each other. </span></p>

On this occasion, it was the ventilator attached to her wheelchair. LF&#8217;s contention is that the staff had failed to set up the vent circuit correctly. The tubing for G&#8217;s ventilator has an extension tube, the purpose of which is to provide additional length when transferring G either from her bed to her chair or vice versa. The account of the nurses, particularly that of Nurse SJ, in her statement, is that when transferring G, the regular ventilator tube is unclipped for what I understand to be a matter of seconds and the extension tube is then attached, thus the ventilator continues to work throughout. I do not think the family disagree with this as a mechanism. Self-evidently, speed is the essence of the process. It is for this reason that Nurse SJ emphasises that the extension tube is always set up carefully and checked prior to the transfer, to avoid delay, which might result in an interruption of the O</span><span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">2</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> supply. </span></p>

Also present was SS and TC both HCAs. Nurse SJ had been on duty the night before and had assisted with G&#8217;s transfer from bed to chair. She recalled this day with some clarity. In particular, she was very clear that the night before she had set up the extension tube for the ventilator on G&#8217;s chair, ready to be used the following morning. Moreover, the next day, she checked the extension tube, in accordance with her usual practice. Whilst G was being dressed, the chair was placed in the lounge. LF and GR deny that they were anywhere near the chair. When G was ready, the chair was brought from the lounge to G&#8217;s room. In the context of my analysis of the other allegations below, I note that on this occasion, it was Nurse SJ who noticed that the extension lead was set up incorrectly. One of the ends of the tube extension had been put in the wrong way round. There was no incident because it had been spotted before G&#8217;s ventilator had been removed and, accordingly, she had not been exposed to risk of harm. However, Nurse SJ was quite certain that she set it up properly the night before and rechecked it that morning. As I have already mentioned, Nurse SJ is very experienced, including in ICU. She described herself as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;intense&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> when it came to checking. </span></p>

On a practical level, that overcrowds the room, given what is involved. It also avoids compromising her dignity and privacy as a young woman. The fragility of her bones makes her constantly vulnerable and she requires sensitive handling at all times. On this day, Nurse SJ recalls that the parents attempted to sit in the &#8216;patients lounge&#8217; and had to be redirected to the quiet lounge. This struck her as odd, she told me, as they usually wait in the &#8216;quiet lounge&#8217;. Mr Patel points to a discrepancy in the records. The records state that the parents were </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;attempting to sit in the patient&#8217;s lounge&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, whereas the oral evidence was that they were already </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;sitting in the patient&#8217;s lounge&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and needed to be redirected. I find this discrepancy, if it can truly be interpreted as such, to carry little, if any, evidential significance. In a short time, Nurse SJ recalls that the parents were knocking on the door of G&#8217;s room, asking to come in, before G had been fully dressed. Nurse SJ asked them to wait. She recalls that they did wait but they continued to knock. Again, the parents dispute this. </span></p>

I am satisfied that the parents were both sitting in the patient lounge this day, before they were moved, and that this was unusual. I am also entirely satisfied that the extension tube had been set up correctly by Nurse SJ and checked. Thus, I find that the tube was tampered with and that the parents had the opportunity to do so. One further characteristic of Nurse SJ&#8217;s evidence which requires to be identified and which I consider reinforces her reliability as a witness is her candour and willingness to accept mistakes. On an earlier day, she had forgotten to put G&#8217;s coat on before hoisting. She was going out with her parents that afternoon. Mr Patel put this error to her as part of his case that the staff were generally incompetent. She immediately accepted her mistake, I sense that she was frustrated by her error mostly for the inconvenience it would cause to G. Given Nurse SJ&#8217;s general approach to her responsibilities, I consider this error was very much out of character. It is also important that I say that the distractions repeatedly created by the parents generate an environment in which mistakes are likely to be made. Nurse SJ did not proffer this as an explanation.  Moreover, I was left with a clear impression that despite this high-octane corrosive conflict, Nurse SJ recognised the importance of LF&#8217;s relationship with G and, on some level, respected the degree of knowledge that he has acquired over the years. Indeed, I agree with Ms Roper that she demonstrated empathy with rather than hostility towards G&#8217;s family. I recall that she spontaneously volunteered praise to LF regarding the professionalism with which he managed the straps for G&#8217;s chair. </span></p>

Though Mr Patel has cross-examined thoroughly on the alleged errors of the staff, LF goes, at least on occasions, a good deal further. In response to Counsel he confirmed, without any hint of ambiguity, that it was his case that the staff had raised this false allegation against LF and GR deliberately to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;cover up&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> their own error. The more he was pressed on this, the greater his invective became. His assertion that the care home had conspired to create a raft of false allegations to cover up their own incompetence is one of the highest gravity. Neither is it possible easily to reconcile with the alternative view he sometimes expressed that the staff at the care home were </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;well-meaning but overwhelmed&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.

I do not recognise the logic of that last remark, particularly given the hesitancy of the care home initially to accept G&#8217;s care in the face of LF&#8217;s proactive opposition. By way of completeness, it is important that I record that LF&#8217;s theory of conspiracy extends beyond the care home.

It is most likely that excessive turning force was applied once the knob had reached its end-stop. My tests indicate the force applied was probably at least a factor of 8 greater than the force required to adjust the knob in normal operation. The only reasonable conclusion is that this excessive force was applied with the intention of damaging the flow meter. I note that any reasonable and well-intentioned person could be expected to have known they had damaged this item, that it was safety-critical and that it should have been reported to staff. I also note that secondary damage to the adjustment knob is consistent with it being forced back into place after the primary damage had occurred. This suggests that the damage to the flow meter was apparent to the perpetrator, and that it should have been reported to staff&#8221;. </span></p>

All those who have given evidence have been clear that they wish the best for [G], that they value caring for her, and there is no evidence that any one of those individuals would intentionally have exposed [G] to risk due to faulty/damaged equipment. Indeed, this case was not advanced on behalf of any family member to any of CH&#8217;s witnesses in cross examination. Similarly, as to &#8216;B&#8217;, no evidence has been advanced to support a case that an individual staff member, or a collective of staff, would maliciously cause damage to [G]&#8217;s equipment and such a scenario is nothing more than fantastical&#8221;. </span></p>

It is significant that [GR] will have been alone in the room (or with a 1:1 at the door who is likely to have given her some privacy with [G]).

It is damage caused by excessive force, most likely in frustration and anger. It occurred on a day when both parents were manifestly frustrated and angry. It may not be entirely without significance that the damage was caused to the oxygen flow meter, given my earlier findings. So much of the evidence in this case has centred upon the provision of oxygen to G. As is clear from this judgment, I have already found that LF had tampered with his daughter&#8217;s oxygen supply on other occasions. I also accept the evidence of Nurse B and SJ that LF had asked questions concerning the equipment on the wall earlier that day and that those questions struck the nurses as odd, given that nobody had suggested that it was not working. LF denies that he had any conversation with the nurses about the flow meter earlier that day. I am, either directly or inferentially, invited to conclude that the nurses have lied or in some way </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;made up&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> this earlier conversation. I entirely reject this alternative account, not least, because Nurse SJ&#8217;s evidence on the point was both clear and measured and also rather tangential to the substantive allegation. The proposition requires a highly cynical, subtle dishonesty. There was no attempt to overstate the significance of the conversation by Nurse SJ, which she seemed ready to accept did not necessarily carry any evidential significance. I am entirely satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that it was the parents who deliberately damaged the flow meter, acting in anger and frustration. It also strikes me that given the intensive regime of care provided to G, the damage was likely to have been observed reasonably quickly. I do not consider that the evidence points strongly to one or other of the parents, either could have caused this damage. </span></p>

G had plainly been having a difficult day. She was experiencing abdominal spasms. It was certainly the nurses&#8217; view that she was in pain. CJ had come to visit her and she too considered that G was distressed and in pain. The nurses gave PRN (pro re nata) medications to try to provide immediate pain relief. This continued throughout the day. When G was having the spasms, her oxygen levels were dropping quite low. The pain relief did not appear to have sufficient effect. CJ was noted to be anxious and was asking that G be given more midazolam. Nurse M considered CJ&#8217;s anxiety to be entirely natural, however, CJ repeatedly asked for G to be provided with a suction procedure which is undertaken in Intensive Care Units where additional saline is poured. The staff at CH do not follow such a procedure and declined to do so. The nursing staff were in regular communication with the General Practitioner who eventually advised that G should go to hospital. CJ is described as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;pushing for more midazolam&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This was notwithstanding that Nurse M had decided that this was not appropriate. Midazolam is, she told me, a strong medication which requires to be administered cautiously and as had become clear, it was not being effective in relieving pain. Benzodiazepine is a medication used for anaesthesia and procedural sedation. Eventually, the ambulance was called. </span></p>

I accept the predominant evidence that CJ was frustrated and angry when it was decided by the paramedics that G should go to S Hospital. She contacted her son, who spoke to one of the paramedics on the telephone. LF pressed the case for A Hospital. The paramedics could find nothing in the paperwork to suggest that G needed to go to there. In any event, S Hospital was the closer hospital. It has been suggested that this dispute caused a delay in the transfer. In the event, I do not consider the evidence supports that suggestion.

It is also notable that despite his strong opposition to this account, LF was not present at the care home, nor was he in the ambulance and he did not arrive at the hospital until G had already been transferred to A &amp; E from the ambulance. Of course, it requires to be identified that if the ambulance staff had failed to switch the oxygen on then LF would have had to address an apparent contagion of poor practice or negligence spreading from the care home nursing staff to the paramedics. This would not fit with his critical narrative against the staff of the care home. Whilst this is theoretically possible, it is unlikely to the point that it stretches credulity. I also note that the nursing records state </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;Dad shouted to carer that O</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:sub;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">2</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> was not switched on whilst transferred.

I have very little difficulty in coming to the conclusion that LF switched the machine off. I also note that LF took the opportunity, on this admission, to broadcast his litany of complaints against the care home. It is to be remembered that on any view, G was unwell and in a great deal of pain on 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> December. As I have previously mentioned, this was distressing to staff and to CJ. The pain was such that midazolam had not helped. LF&#8217;s focus, at this point, ought to have been on G&#8217;s wellbeing and not upon his criticisms of the care home staff. Manifestly, it was neither the time nor the place. It was also a distraction to the staff. As recorded above, he told the hospital staff that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;60 plus safeguarding complaints&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> had been raised and that they were all in the process of being </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;dealt with&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. He complained that G was dehydrated, because of neglect by the staff at the care home. This was comprehensively disproved by the blood gas tests. It must also be noted that LF volubly criticised Nurse M for having failed to turn the O</span><span style="vertical-align:sub;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">2</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> on. On my findings, he would have known this to be untrue. It was a shameful incident calculated to intimidate the nurse. I regret to say that this was bullying and highly manipulative behaviour. Miss Khalique speculates that LF was taking the opportunity, G having been transferred from the care home to the hospital, to ensure that she was not returned. Though I find that to be entirely plausible, I am not prepared to speculate on LF&#8217;s motivations. That said, the vituperative hostility to this placement is abundant. They do not dispute it of course, contending that it is justified. </span></p>

That would serve merely to expand this already extensive judgment and further to feed into the high-octane &#8216;lawfare&#8217; that this case has become and which I am resolved to stop. To describe the closing written submissions I have received as voluble, is an understatement. Ms Roper and Mr Harrison&#8217;s submissions alone are 182 pages. I do not say that as a criticism but as an illustration of the body of material that has been presented. In my judgement, I have identified what I consider to be the key incidents. These enable me properly to evaluate the nature and extent of any future risk and provide a foundation for a forensically objective evaluation of G&#8217;s </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;best interests&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, predicated on a substratum of determined facts as opposed to allegations. To each alleged breach, is a countervailing allegation of negligence or malpractice. My findings make it clear that the countervailing allegations made by LF, on the issues I have addressed, are entirely without substance. It is unnecessary for me to traverse each of the family&#8217;s allegations of negligence against the care home, just as it is unnecessary to resolve every alleged breach. These proceedings are structured to resolve facts for the purposes that I have set out i.e., where G&#8217;s best interests lie. They are not apt to facilitate a trial on essentially tortious allegations, especially where the investigation of those allegations casts no light or further light on the issues in focus. This keeps G at the centre of the process. The Court of Protection must be vigilant to guard against its process being hijacked in such a way. </span></p>

Once again, this revolved around the tension generated by the hoisting process. CJ was at the care home on her own on this occasion. She was asked to go to the quiet lounge to enable there to be some hoist training given to a relatively inexperienced member of staff. On any view, that is a perfectly reasonable request. In light of the background to this case, it was also a sensible request. CJ had a characteristically detailed recollection of the incident and engaged with the questions surrounding it. I repeat, CJ is an eloquent woman, presenting her case impressively and, it seemed to me, with a striking level of confidence. The notes taken by Nurse B record the following: </span></p>

In some ways, this incident is far less significant, in isolation, than many of the others that I have been addressing but, in the context of the wider evidence, it is illustrative of CJ&#8217;s mindset and how overbearing she has become. I asked her whether her presence in the room might cause a young trainee to be nervous and whether they might be more confident and able to learn better if left to train with colleagues alone. CJ reluctantly conceded that this &#8216;might&#8217; be the case but, she told me, she was not there doing </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;a job&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">, she was there as G&#8217;s grandmother. This, I am afraid to say, is entirely disingenuous. It is spinning language and playing word games. It mirrors many of LF&#8217;s own responses. CJ is well aware that one of the central objectives of the move to CH was to &#8220;reset&#8221; the roles, to enable the family to let go of their burning need to control G&#8217;s medical care and to enable them to regain something of the enjoyment of an ordinary family life. In other words, to be a grandmother and parents and not doctors and nurses. CJ did not remain in the room to provide grandmotherly support for G, she was there, under her son&#8217;s instruction, specifically to monitor the staff&#8217;s professional competence. She was there as a self-appointed supervisor </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;for safety reasons</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;, to use her own words. She was not there as a grandmother. A grandmother would have left the room at the request of the professionals. Moreover, CJ was looking to find fault rather than to help. All this generated a febrile atmosphere which enhanced the prospect of human error by staff who were uncomfortable and intimidated. Time and again, when she conducted her own cross examination, I was struck by CJ&#8217;s condescending attitude to the CH staff, wreathed though it was, in a veneer of courtesy. The staff/family dynamic in CH had become dangerously distorted and dysfunctional. </span></p>

The objectives were to restore something of her own personal dignity, to afford respect to her as an adult and to promote her autonomy within the limited spheres of her circumstances. Having accepted the evidence which concluded that she was now in the final stages of her life, I was attracted to the family&#8217;s plan that she moved to a home environment with the support of a bespoke and necessarily extensive care package. I was also persuaded that before this could realistically be contemplated, it was necessary for G to live, for a period, outside the hospital environment in order that the full range of her needs could realistically be assessed. I had in mind a period of decompression that would afford a home placement a real prospect of success. I also expressly stated that even if that plan would risk shortening G&#8217;s life, its potential to improve the quality of it, for the remaining time she had left, would likely be worthwhile. </span></p>

They had opposed it at the hearing and they did not accept the judgment. Given the way I had framed it i.e., as a conduit to a move home, it is difficult to understand what ignited the fire of such hostility. Objectively, it was without any foundation but LF could not have been more determined to sabotage the placement, even before the move. This, he has admitted. Having watched him in court, now over many hours, I consider LF&#8217;s reaction was driven by fear. I have already commented that he uses that word a great deal. He expresses it as being afraid for his daughter but as I have listened to him, I have become increasingly convinced that his fear stems from his sense of being marginalised and losing control over his daughter&#8217;s day-to-day medical care. The two have undoubtedly become conflated in his own mind, he believes that only he can deliver the care his daughter needs and that only he can keep her safe. I do not doubt that this fear is genuine. It causes him visible distress. During this hearing, I have seen that distress, which is painful to watch, not least because of his determined but ultimately futile efforts to control and conceal it. The more distressed he becomes, the more extreme his allegations. None of this is tempered or assuaged by his mother or partner. On the contrary, they feed it and exacerbate it. The adjectives used by each of the family in their criticisms of CH have ratcheted upwards, they now include: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;abusive&#8221;, &#8220;dangerous&#8221;, &#8220;frightening&#8221;, &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">They characterise the home as a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;prison&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> and the regime as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8220;torture&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Most distorted of their perceptions is their belief that G enjoys the conflict that rages over her bed because she perceives it as her family fighting her corner. The tremors that she displays, on the family&#8217;s account, on these occasions are interpreted as exhibiting pleasure. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The instinct of every doctor, nurse, carer and, if I may say so, Judge, is one of sympathy to the family of a young woman whose body and brain has been ravaged by this profound degenerative neurological condition. LF&#8217;s entire life and that of his partner GR, has been focused on his daughter, especially since the diagnosis. For 10 years, the couple lived in the hospital grounds. This was unprecedented in the hospital&#8217;s experience. Their own personal life has been almost entirely sacrificed. They would not see it as a sacrifice. I think that they would regard it as a privilege. However, it has, in my judgement, been unhealthy for them. Their parental energies have become distorted and misdirected. They are angry, hostile and combative. Their behaviour to the nursing staff in the children&#8217;s hospital has been not merely replicated at CH, it has been intensified. It is necessary for me to identify it for what it is, a pattern of sustained, controlling and bullying behaviour. Nobody listening to the evidence of the staff of CH, at this hearing, could doubt the wounding psychological impact it has had on so many of them. Their experience has been traumatising, the process of giving evidence was retraumatising. Some of them, I have no doubt, will struggle for a long time in consequence of their encounter with this family. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I have found that each of these family members was involved in tampering with G&#8217;s ventilatory support. I have made direct findings against LF and CJ and have been constrained to find that GR was, with her partner, in a pool of two potential perpetrators on two occasions. GR rarely uses her smartphone or email. I have commented in my earlier judgments on how isolated her life appears to have become. LF and CJ are in constant communication. Their perspectives and mindsets are entirely enmeshed. This said, GR provides total support for them both. The gravity of these findings is self-evident. Part of the family&#8217;s wide-ranging explanations for what has occurred has extended to asserting that CH staff have deliberately fabricated allegations of tampering with machinery, to provide a cloak for their own incompetence. The allegations of intimidation, it is suggested, have been falsely and dishonestly lifted from the statements of the children&#8217;s hospital nurses, again, as a foil for their own negligence. These feverish allegations, I consider, are not only contrary to the preponderant weight of the evidence, they are a reflection of the family&#8217;s own desperation and distorted thinking. In this context, the inherently improbable proposition that an otherwise loving parent would compromise their daughter&#8217;s ventilatory support becomes conceivable. Not only does the evidence I have analysed establish the findings but what I find to be the irrationality of the family&#8217;s damaged belief structure supports the view that they would do anything to cause the breakdown of this placement. The interference with the ventilatory support was, in my view, calculated to provide evidence of negligence at CH. As some of the recordings demonstrate, staff were at least initially, prepared to contemplate their own negligence before suspecting the family. That is the intuitive instinct of committed professionals, it is the antithesis of the extreme and calculatedly dishonest activity that the family accuse them of. </span></p>

What is clear to me though is that they continue to look for it, remain open to the possibility of it and, even more, genuinely hope to discover it. What they are clear about, however, is that the parents, both in equal measure, have the capacity to soothe and comfort their daughter in the way that only a parent can. It is in this role that they make their greatest contribution and it is precisely this that the care plan was designed to &#8216;unlock&#8217; and enhance. </span></p>

That was also unprecedented. This is a hospital for very sick children. At CH, this regime has continued, albeit now less frequently. Whilst out in the community, there has never been a single incident of concern regarding G&#8217;s general welfare or more particularly, any real difficulty relating to her ventilatory support. The quality of practical care afforded by her parents and grandmother is unimpeachable. They are meticulous about G&#8217;s appearance and attentive to it. The difficulties with G&#8217;s care are all confined to CH. There has been no significant problem with G&#8217;s mobile ventilatory support. This long-established pattern reinforces my view that interference with the oxygen and other equipment, in the way that I have found, is intended to discredit the care home staff. It does not seem to be directly intended to harm G, though the risk of harm must surely arise.</span></p>

To an anxious parent, the system will, perhaps inevitably, be perceived as lethargic, bureaucratic, inconsistent and even heartless. As the family themselves accumulated a body of knowledge about their daughter&#8217;s condition, they would, over the years, have encountered newly qualified, eager, young professionals with limited experience, in whom they may have struggled to reposit their trust and confidence. There are inevitable tensions in these relationships. What has happened in this case however is far beyond this. This was a family utterly determined to engineer the breakdown of their daughter&#8217;s placement at CH. The lengths that they were prepared to go to are not only alarming, they are quite chilling. Objectively, interference with the ventilatory support must be regarded as creating a risk to life. </span></p>

Thought will also have to be given to the scope and ambit of any further proceedings in the Court of Protection. The court itself has become a theatre of conflict. The family&#8217;s enthusiasm for litigation, as I find it to be, is a different facet of their behaviour within the care home and earlier in the hospital. It is disruptive, calculated to cause distress. It has, at times, degenerated into &#8216;lawfare&#8217; and rather than promoting G&#8217;s welfare, the court process risks becoming inimical to it. </span></p>
