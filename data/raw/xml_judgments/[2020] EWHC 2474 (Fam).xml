His father&#8217;s genetic material and a donated egg were used to create embryos which were implanted into the surrogate mother D. Therefore, in law, prior to the making of a parental order, C&#8217;s legal mother is D, the surrogate mother. There is no doubt, however, that B is C&#8217;s social, psychological and emotional mother. Accordingly, in this context and for ease of reference I shall refer to B as &#8216;the mother&#8217; and I shall use the term &#8216;the parents&#8217; in like vein. </p>

The approach in R v Lucas is not confined, as it was on the facts of Lucas itself, to a statement made out of court and can apply to a "lie" made in the course of the court proceedings and the approach is not limited solely to evidence concerning accomplices. </p>

Where the "lie" has a prominent or central relevance to the case such a self-direction is plainly sensible and good practice.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.01in;text-indent:0.5in">One highly important aspect of the Lucas decision, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges. It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the "lie" is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt. As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in Lucas, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is "capable of amounting to a corroboration". In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of R v Middleton [2001] Crim.L.R. 251.  </p>

Judges should therefore take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8221;. </p>

The father was shocked and surprised. Plainly his adverse reaction was not one the mother wanted to hear. She alleged he also threatened her on the afternoon and evening of 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March which led her to contact the police. </p>

In my judgment it is not a case of happenchance or mere coincidence that the report to the police was made the day after she had told the father of the second surrogacy. Further, she stopped all contact between the father and C for three months. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">There is one peripheral aspect of the evidence I should deal with. Despite telling the parents&#8217; counsellor that he had been having an affair, which he denied saying, the father was adamant he had not had an affair with a female colleague at work. The weight of the evidence, especially his mobile telephone records which disclose a very large number of calls and messaged being sent to and received from his colleague, very strongly suggest there was some sort of liaison. Nevertheless, the father&#8217;s lack of candour on this issue does not materially affect my overall assessment of him being a reliable and credible witness. There may be all manner of reasons for why he has adopted this stance, none of which, in my judgment, undermine his credibility. </p>
