They had seen this on other occasions and this issue had led to a drop in his blood pressure.  She explained that Archie passes large amounts of urine which leads to &#8220;big swings&#8221; in his blood volume and in his blood pressure.  The drop in blood pressure was not linked to the rise in CO2 and neither were connected to the apnoea test carried out by Dr Playfor.  </span></p>
