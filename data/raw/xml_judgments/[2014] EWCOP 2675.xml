	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This application concerns an elderly lady of 79 years whom I shall call &#8220;Mrs J&#8221;.  She has longstanding mental health problems and now also cancer.  Many professionals concerned for her welfare have with much care and diligence come to the view that it is in her best interests for her to have investigations and to receive treatment; but she is resistant and, in spite of all professional efforts and advice, not willing to consent.  Accordingly, on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span>&#160;July 2014, the relevant NHS Trust issued a notice of application in the Court of Protection seeking declarations: (1) that Mrs J lacks capacity to litigate in these proceedings; (2) that she lacks capacity to take decisions about the proposed medical investigations and treatment; and (3) that it is in her best interests to have those investigations and treatment.</p>

He set the application down before me with a time estimate of two hours this week.  He further gave permission to Mrs J&#8217;s son, whom I shall call &#8220;Mr J&#8221; and who is in his 50s, and to her two adult daughters, to file Position Statements prior to the hearing.  He (Holman J) invited them quite strongly to attend at this hearing whether or not they had filed such Position Statements.</p>

Mr J has not attended, although he has given his views on a number of occasions, including to the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July 2014, of which there is an attendance note, and in an email of 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July 2014.  I have also read a letter by him dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;April 2014 to Dr Stephenson (Consultant Plastic Surgeon Reconstructive and Burns Surgeon) setting out his views.  On 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span>&#160;July 2014 he (Mr J) left a voice message with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative to say that he would not be attending at this hearing.  Neither of Mrs J&#8217;s adult daughters has attended the hearing, although it is not clear whether they have been notified of it, since Mr J told the Official Solicitor&#8217;s representative on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;July 2014 that they are totally estranged from Mrs J and that he was, therefore, reluctant to pass on their contact details.</p>

However, in the circumstances of this particular case, having considered them separately, I propose to deal with them together because I consider that they do stand and fall together.  Consultant psychiatrist Dr Whittingham has been responsible for Mrs J&#8217;s mental health for many years.  On 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;May 2014, he prepared an Assessment of Capacity for the Court of Protection.  At paragraph 7.1, he stated:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;Mrs J suffers from mental disorder in the form of schizophrenia.  This was diagnosed in 1985 and she has been under the care of mental health services continuously since 2005.  The nature of the disorder is that of a chronic psychotic condition characterised by persecutory delusions, which achieves only partial remission on treatment.  Treatment concordance is always poor outside of hospital, but she is able to manage her life in the community in spite of this over long periods of time.  The degree of disorder is that Mrs J is deluded that people who care about her conspire against her.  She believes that she is lied to about having skin cancer.  She refuses medical treatment as a result of her delusions of being lied to about the medical facts.  She is currently medically stable and safely mobile, but reluctant as to basic care for her leg ulcers and nocturnal urinary incontinence.&#8221;</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;It is unlikely that Mrs Y would demonstrate a response to antipsychotic medication which result in her accepting the advice given regarding her legs and skin cancer.  She has characteristically formed her own beliefs about health matters in the past and, even when taking antipsychotic drugs during a previous admission seven years ago, she did not gain insight into her condition...  Antipsychotic drugs could only be given at present by injections against her will and it is unlikely that she would accept such treatment in the community after discharge.  Even if it were accepted, it would be likely to be many months before any remission of her delusions, particularly given the chronic nature of her condition.&#8221;</p>

In a letter dated 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>&#160;June 2014, a community psychiatrist nurse, Tim Wheeler, summarised some of the things which Mrs J has said to him, showing the delusional nature of her views as relied on by Dr Whittingham in reaching his opinion.  Mr Wheeler refers to Mrs J saying of cancer, &#8216;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve got it&#8217;; &#8216;You are ganging up on me&#8217;; &#8216;Mr J is behind this&#8217;; &#8216;I&#8217;m not letting people experiment on me&#8217;; &#8216;I&#8217;m sick of the sight of hospitals&#8217;; &#8216;There is nothing wrong with me&#8217;; and &#8216;There is no mass in my groin&#8217;.  Further, Mrs J informed Mr Wheeler that the suggestion her pet dog had died was a lie and she made it clear to him that she believed that the attempt to investigate and treat her was part of a plot orchestrated by Mr J so that he could live off her pension.</p>

He too set out a number of Mrs J&#8217;s delusions as reported in documents, for example that there were people in her attic, that people had keys to her house and could enter it when she was out, that there were tape recorders in her house and that she was able to treat her leg ulcers with antiseptic cream.</p>

Her speech was coherent and normal in tone and rhythm with no evidence of word finding impairments or word substitutions.  She was without apparent comprehension difficulties.  He continues:</p>

She told me there was somebody in her attic because she can hear them banging around.  She said she believed there was a cannabis farm in the attic and that her neighbour was stealing her electricity in order to propagate the cannabis.  She told me there were tape recorders installed in her house and that Mr J was in collusion with Dr Whittingham who was responsible for getting her &#8216;sectioned&#8217; and getting her seen regarding her leg.&#8221;</p>

However, for many decades, her patterns of thinking and interacting have been pathological and destructive...  The greatest burden of her psychopathology has been borne by her family who are now mostly estranged from her.  The impact of her condition on her health has been limited until recently with the development of Basal Cell Carcinoma, its associated investigations and a general decline in her physical health requiring action from professionals.&#8217;</p>

I do not think there is anything that can be done to enhance Mrs J&#8217;s decision-making at this stage and in the context of my discussions regarding antipsychotic treatment above.&#8221;</p>

She would not be placed at the inevitable risk which a person at any age (but particularly at a considerable age) faces of an adverse reaction to surgery; nor would she have to face the demands on her resources of a period of recovery which could be painful and uncomfortable.  She would not have to deal with the difficulty of managing skin grafts which would have been taken against her will.  Nor would she have to put up with the likelihood of some diminution of mobility and movement together with discomfort which, if it occurs, would probably be permanent.</p>

She would not have to undergo the real risk of the cancer and ulcers spreading.  In that respect, Dr Stephenson says:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;Without treatment, the right leg ulcer will increase in size and may interfere with the blood vessel and/or nerves causing wound leakage, bleeding and possibly significant pain to Mrs J.  <span style="font-style:italic">[There would be]</span> persistence of the ulcer risks infection, which has occurred previously.  Leaving the groin mass (the enlarged inguinal lymph-node which can be felt) untreated means that the mass will increase in size and may ulcerate overlying skin.  There is a risk that an enlarged groin mass may obstruct the blood flow in the groin and/or compress local nerves.  There is also a risk of tumour invading the nerves, although I am unable to quantify the chance of this occurring.  Invasion of nerves would be likely to cause Mrs J considerable pain, which would be likely to be difficult to manage.  If cancer has spread into the pelvis, this may invade or compress the nerves in the pelvis.  I am unable to quantify the chance of this occurring.  Compression of nerves and invasion of nerves would be likely to cause Mrs J considerable pain, which would be likely to be difficult to manage and may not be controllable.  Once the cancer has spread beyond the pelvis, curative opportunity will be lost.&#8221;</p>

The unanimous recording of the medical experts at that meeting (which Mr J and his two sisters did not attend) was that there were concerns about the family members having reached their views (against treatment) without having had the benefit of medical advice on the likely outcome in the absence of treatment.  The note continues:</p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;The likely outcome <span style="font-style:italic">[without treatment]</span> is significant pain, high infection risk, possible metastasis of the cancer and a painful death.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The meeting, therefore, caused the minutes to be sent to Mrs J&#8217;s family members with a request that they read them carefully and indicate their views as a consequence.

I recognise that there are significant difficulties and risks.  However, the experienced professionals have unanimously come down in favour of going ahead with investigations and surgical intervention as being in Mrs J&#8217;s best interests.  They have done so having carefully and conscientiously weighed up the advantages and disadvantages and being very alive to the risks and likely problems.  That is clear from the documents I have read.  In their conclusion, they are now supported by the Official Solicitor, whose role and experience is to protect the interests of vulnerable individuals.  </p>

That right to decide for oneself is, of course, generally sacrosanct and is recognised in the Mental Capacity Act; but it ceases to be applicable where the individual, as here, cannot weigh up the decision for herself, although the individual&#8217;s wishes and feelings are still of course taken fully into account.</p>
