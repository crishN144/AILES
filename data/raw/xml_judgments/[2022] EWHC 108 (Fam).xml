		<p class="FootnoteText"> It is agreed by the parties that the subject child of the proceedings should be given a forename rather than an initial. The name &#8216;Jane&#8217; was proposed by the parties at the hearing.</p>
	      </authorialNote>. She is 4 years and 11 months old. She is the only child of the Applicant (&#8220;the father&#8221; or &#8220;BY&#8221;) and the Respondent (&#8220;the mother&#8221; or &#8220;BX&#8221;). This judgment sets out my findings following a 5-day hearing in which I considered the parties&#8217; cross-allegations of domestic abuse. The proceedings were remitted by the Court of Appeal to the High Court for hearing following the conjoined appeals which were reported as <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-N</span>. This case was then known as <span style="font-style:italic">B-B</span>, and is discussed in particular at &#167;79-115 of the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment.</p>

Hence this hearing was set up. No doubt considerably to the frustration of the parties, this is the seventh occasion on which this case has been listed for fact-finding hearing, and has been the first <span style="font-style:italic">effective</span> listing; the first such listing was in 2018. Previous attempts at a dedicated fact-finding hearing were thwarted by a range of difficulties: <span style="color:#000000">judicial unavailability, legal aid issues, and in December 2018 because the mother had only very recently made a new set of serious allegations (of sexual assault and/or &#8216;rape&#8217;) to the police. </span>Unsurprisingly, at the pre-hearing review the parties expressed themselves keen to proceed at this hearing, notwithstanding that &#8211; to my considerable surprise given the history of the case &#8211; the disclosure of extensive police material had only recently been made available; indeed, in some respects it was still outstanding.</p>

	      </authorialNote>. Inevitably, the evidence relevant to each form of abuse overlapped in places, but in looking at the evidence by reference to the different forms of alleged abuse, a picture was built up of the nature of the relationship under scrutiny, and it was easier to see whether patterns of behaviour emerged. This may not have been so apparent had the matters been looked at by reference to individual / free-standing items on a <span style="font-style:italic">Scott Schedule</span>. I accept the Court of Appeal&#8217;s view that <span style="color:#000000">it is the </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">cumulative effect</span><span style="color:#000000"> of individual incidents within each of those clusters of abuse-type, and of each type of abuse on the other, which give the clearest indication of the experience of abuse;</span></p>

Like many abused partners, the mother in this case became immunised to the emotional volatility of the damaging relationship which she saw as normal and acceptable; like many abused partners, she clung to what she knew.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Preparation for this hearing was regrettably adversely impacted by what I considered to be the rather casual adherence by the solicitors for the mother to the court-ordered directions; I note that earlier hearings before HHJ Scarratt had similarly been afflicted by non-compliance with court directions (see &#167;91, 100, 110 of <span style="font-style:italic">Re H-N</span>). Until the fact-finding hearing itself, the father was acting in person; he had, in my view, been rather more assiduous than the mother&#8217;s solicitors in observing court directions, and in alerting the court to difficulties in compliance. Strict adherence to orders, and efficient management of family hearings, particularly given the current pressures on the system, is essential if the work of the court is to be done effectively.</p>

I acknowledge that her anxiety in trying to remember things accurately in the pressure of a court setting will only have served to aggravate her confusion. Further, I accept that she has probably tried over the years since the end of the relationship to banish memories of her experiences with the father, and this in itself will undoubtedly have affected her capacity for recall. I find that many aspects of the mother&#8217;s evidence were credible, and feel able to make a number of the findings she seeks, particularly those supported by extraneous evidence.

I am satisfied that she was truly intimidated by the family court process, and in all likelihood carried with her considerable distress from her earlier experience of a family court hearing (August 2019) in which the judge threatened the removal of her child, and whose utterances essentially founded her successful appeal to the Court of Appeal<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="16">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">On the other hand, there were aspects of the mother&#8217;s evidence which I found difficult to accept. For instance, although I accept her admission that she took cocaine on only a very few occasions, I find that she underplayed the occasions when she drank alcohol to excess during the relationship. I was told of a number of occasions when she drank to excess, and assume that I had not heard of them all; when drunk, her behaviour (particularly towards the father) became more volatile and erratic. I accept that her periodic abuse/bingeing of alcohol may have been an escape route for her; it may have been her coping strategy. </p>

On another occasion, I find that she became extremely drunk in a nightclub and was then escorted from the club by a group of men, some of whom were probably unknown to her; they drove off with her in a car. The father&#8217;s friend (Mr D) rescued her and in the process became involved a fight with the group. I reject the mother&#8217;s denial of this incident, and accept Mr D&#8217;s account, which is indeed corroborated by the mother&#8217;s social media messaging with Ms C at or about that time.</p>

I find that the mother&#8217;s minimisation of her drinking and drug-taking was probably caused by embarrassment. It may be that she realised the hypocrisy of criticising her own mother for excess drinking. Further, it seems likely that she thought that it would serve materially to discredit her in the eyes of the court; perhaps she did not wish to acknowledge that conduct to her own family who she knew were to take part in this hearing. I find that other aspects of her false testimony were motivated by a wish to demonise the father before the court, to bolster her case.</p>

Moreover, he showed minimal empathy in his evidence, for the mother who, on any view, was obviously very distressed; he was brazenly self-justificatory in his explanations of his own behaviour.

I note an early text message from the mother in August 2017 in which she told the father how she experienced the &#8216;hate&#8217; from his family (&#8220;your sister hated me from day 1&#8221;); this was consistent with the content and manner in which Ms B gave her evidence. She told me of an event in July 2018 when the mother was alleged to have punched and kicked Jane; given the tone in which all of her evidence was given I found it hard to credit her with accuracy of this account and I reject it. Not only is Ms B the father&#8217;s sister, she is also a director of the family company for whom the father works. This is a care agency working with vulnerable people in the community.

Ms C was clearly, and in my finding to some extent justifiably, angry that the mother had acted so inappropriately in her home which she lives with her partner and two young children. She refuted (again justifiably) the mother&#8217;s allegation that she had been locked in Ms C&#8217;s house. Perhaps predictably, Ms C had &#8216;taken sides&#8217; in this dispute and her evidence &#8211; strongly supportive of the father, and overtly critical of the mother &#8211; has to be seen in this light.

It was nonetheless a considerable surprise to me that he was not able to identify the key issues of domestic abuse clearly or at all. While rightly pointing out that &#8220;all cases are different&#8221;, he struggled to articulate or identify even common themes or indicators in domestic abuse cases. Surprisingly for a man who claimed to be one of the father&#8217;s closest friends, he appeared to have no knowledge of the father&#8217;s disciplinary history or his dismissal from work. If this is right, it shows the ease with which the father can apparently lead a &#8216;double life&#8217;, shielding his disagreeable side even from those close to him.</p>

He told me that &#8220;at the time, I would not have thought anyone could have heard it [i.e. their conversation]&#8221;. He explained how he and a colleague had also played cards and had written &#8220;stupid notes&#8221; to each other; he told me that he must have dropped one of the cards in the group therapy room by accident.

At one point in her evidence she simply said that he &#8220;played with my emotions&#8221;, adding &#8220;he played my depression to his advantage&#8221;, and in my finding &#8211; having heard all of the evidence &#8211; I find that she was justified in that assessment. She referred to the fact that he would call her &#8220;woman&#8221; rather than her name, and would shout and scream at her. The father did not dispute that he called the mother &#8220;woman&#8221; but did so as &#8220;a joke&#8221;. I find that it was neither intended nor received as a joke. I find that at times they both shouted at each other.</p>

Once Jane was born, she complains with justification that he was unsupportive to her: &#8220;he did his own thing, I was left to raise [Jane]&#8221;. The mother at times threatened to leave the father &#8211; which she now describes as a &#8220;cry for help&#8221;; all of that rang true too, both in the manner in which the mother delivered the evidence and in the context of the relationship as a whole. The mother told me (the father confirmed) that she would regularly call the father on his mobile phone; it seemed to me that she probably called excessively while he was at work, and the father reacted badly to this.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">I am satisfied on the evidence that the father did indeed repeatedly allege that the mother suffered from bipolar disorder; I further and significantly find that there was no clear medical evidence that she did suffer such a condition. Although there was a <span style="font-style:italic">provisional</span> diagnosis at one time (though unclear on what basis), the mother&#8217;s GP explicitly reported that he did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> consider that she had a bipolar disorder. On the evidence which I have seen, it seems to me likely that the mother did suffer from depression, anxiety, and mood swings; her mood was affected by excessive drinking and/or very occasional drug-taking and/or by the inconsistency of the father&#8217;s relationship with her. In this state, at times she threatened to self-harm. I find that the father made this purported diagnosis in an attempt to characterise her to third parties as mentally unstable and/or unreliable; I find that it was immensely disparaging and undermining of the mother, damaging to the mother&#8217;s self-confidence and self-esteem, and caused her to doubt her own mental health (&#8220;he made me believe that I was mentally unwell &#8230; He convinced me that I had bipolar when I was never diagnosed with it&#8230; He made me out to be mentally ill&#8221;). Dr. Proudman&#8217;s use of the term &#8216;gaslighting&#8217; in the hearing to describe this conduct was in my judgment apposite; the father&#8217;s conduct represented a form of insidious abuse designed to cause the mother to question her own mental well-being, indeed her sanity. The assertion to the mother and others were ostensibly given greater credibility by the fact that at the time the father was a mental health nurse; he may be thought (and doubtless wanted to be thought) to have drawn on specialist expertise or experience to make his diagnosis/assertion. </p>

I deal with the issue of sexual abuse separately. Therefore, in this section I focus on an incident about which I heard much evidence from the mother, father, and Ms C, namely the mother&#8217;s allegation that the father and his friends (Ms C and her partner) physically falsely imprisoned the mother in the friends&#8217; home in July 2018 for a period of about 24 hours, having removed Jane from her care. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">In relation to this incident, I find that the parents went to the home of Ms C and her partner for an evening; possibly for a barbeque. During the course of the evening the mother became very drunk indeed; it is likely that both the mother and the father took cocaine. I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s state of inebriation caused her to be unable to care for Jane; indeed, on the father&#8217;s case the mother pushed Jane away and swore at her during the evening but I am unpersuaded of this and make no finding. When the mother fell asleep &#8220;half on the floor and half on the sofa&#8221; the father removed Jane to his own flat for her own safety in the middle of the night. The mother woke and reacted hysterically to finding that her daughter had been removed; she threatened suicide. This reaction was in my finding provoked or exacerbated by the effects of drink/drugs, and/or her sense of shame at having neglected Jane. The mother claims that the father&#8217;s friends denied her access to a phone to telephone the father; this is not supported by the evidence and I reject this. I nonetheless find that the father then wrongly manipulated the situation by failing to respond to the mother&#8217;s desperate attempts to contact him and Jane, and declined to hand Jane back to her mother when requested. The father&#8217;s friends were so concerned about the mother that they called the ambulance service as they felt that she needed medical help. The police attended the home; significantly, although the mother later alleged that Ms C and her partner had falsely imprisoned her, she did not ask the police to help her to leave. The police concluded that the &#8220;character of the complainant (the mother) called into serious question&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;She was not of clear mind&#8221;. The mother further alleged that when she went to retrieve Jane from the father&#8217;s home later that day, he locked her and the MGM into the house. I reject this too. I have seen photographs of the door. The door could easily be opened from the inside; there was no separate key. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in"><span style="font-style:italic">Infidelity</span>: The mother complained that during the relationship the father degraded her by being unfaithful to her during their relationship. She pointed to the fact that at a time when he claimed to have been at work on 31 October (Hallowe&#8217;en) 2016, he was in fact photographed at a party semi-naked being massaged by a woman. The mother was waiting up for him, at home; she was 5-6 months pregnant at this time. The father accepts that he was at the party and accepts that he was massaged, but claims that it was impromptu invitation (hence he had not advised the mother of his intention to go), and the woman massaging him was an old friend with whom he was not in a relationship. The father told me that he should have kept the mother informed of his whereabouts, and acknowledged that, in relation to this incident, he could have been &#8220;a better boyfriend&#8221;. I find that the father did attend the party, and both at the time, and in his evidence to the court, he was wholly inconsiderate about the impact of this revelation on the mother. I make no finding that the father had any sexual relationship with his &#8216;masseuse&#8217; on that or any other night. But this incident was illustrative of the father&#8217;s chauvinistic attitude to the mother and to their relationship which I find underpinned much of his attitude, and his lack of sensitivity, towards her. </p>

The father told me that he accepted that his ex-girlfriend in Uganda thought that she and the father were still in a relationship, albeit he assumed that it had come to an end. He told me that he could understand why the mother thought he was being unfaithful with this woman. I find that the woman probably was an <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">ex</span>-girlfriend given that the father had limited scope for maintaining the relationship with her long-distance. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It seems likely, on the evidence that I have seen and heard, that the father had sexual relations with the mother in 2018 after he had commenced a relationship with a woman who is now his fianc&#233;e; this was at a time when the mother was still craving a resumption in her relationship with the father (and she had no relationship with anyone else). I find that the father knew that the mother wished to rekindle the relationship, and by having sexual intercourse with her at this time he wrongly led her to believe that he still had feelings for her. This also illustrates the father&#8217;s lack of moral code and his capacity to prey on those who he sees as vulnerable. </p>

She told me that she regularly gave him cash. She told me that she had to pay bills which she felt were primarily his responsibility. The mother explained that the father had told her that he was unable to work at the early stage of their relationship because his DBS checks (for his employment) had not been completed; it is now known that he was in fact probably in receipt of an income throughout the relevant period but he may not in fact have been working because he had been sanctioned at work (awaiting transfer to another unit) or (later) dismissed (see above).</p>

I further accept, as the mother alleged, that the father often took the mother&#8217;s bank card from her (nicknamed the &#8216;goldfish&#8217; doubtless because of the image on the card) and used it for his own purposes, including his own personal entertainment.</p>

However, I do note that during a period in which the father was making no financial contribution for the upbringing of Jane and indeed was in arrears, he made at least two trips to Uganda, ostensibly for family events. Contemporaneous social media messaging suggests that the father was planning to enjoy, while in Uganda, &#8220;a few weeks of absolute degeneracy&#8230; breaking the laws of decency one party at a time&#8230;&#8221;. Though he claims that his family funded the trips, this provides a very strong clue about the father&#8217;s financial irresponsibility, his lack of empathy for the mother, and his general absence of moral integrity. </p>

He has analysed these inconsistencies with care in his most recent statement. He uses this in an attempt to buttress his own case.</p>

I am not persuaded that the mother &#8216;abused&#8217; the father verbally any more than he &#8216;abused&#8217; her in this regard. Both parents were verbally abusive to each other at times, and it would be wrong for me to ascribe blame to one rather than another. The voluminous reams of printed text exchanges which I was taken through abound with examples of expletives and obscenities which the parents hurled at each other; while the father is seen to be insensitive and at times aggressive in his correspondence, the mother is equally shown to be capable of insulting father, mocking his sexual performance, the size of his penis, and insulting his family.</p>

On 1 May 2017, the mother and father had a night out to celebrate the father&#8217;s birthday; I find that the father was (as the mother alleges) inattentive to the mother, and flirted with other women. The evidence reveals that the mother became drunk (she was later described by the police as &#8220;highly intoxicated&#8221; and incoherent), and on return home, she was angry, and they argued; she behaved irrationally and aggressively and threatened the father. I am satisfied that the parents were verbally abusive to each other; I am satisfied that the mother pushed over a television in the argument; I am satisfied that the mother threatened the father with a knife. The father called the police and quite wrongly told them that the mother suffered from a bipolar condition. I do not regard this incident as illustrative of &#8220;domestic abuse&#8221; of the father by the mother; I find both were responsible for the ugly scene and their behaviour towards each other.</p>

He complains that he had no contact with her from September 2017 through to February 2018, and from March to May 2018. The father told me that the mother had said to him that &#8220;they [the mother and Jane] come as a package&#8221;, and that if he wished to see Jane, he would have to see the mother too. I accept this evidence which is consistent with my view that the mother was desperate to reconcile with the father after May 2017 and wanted to deploy any strategy available to her to be with him. The mother told me that she had at times threatened to &#8220;cut off&#8221; the father&#8217;s contact with Jane (&#8220;when I got annoyed&#8230; I said a lot of stuff that I did not do&#8221;).</p>

The father could have pursued contact through the courts, but he did not do so. Nor did the father make any financial contribution towards the maintenance of his daughter in the relevant period, nor did he send her gifts or cards. So, although the mother did use contact as a form of control, the father did not avail himself of effective remedies to address this.</p>

I reject this specific allegation. Jane was born in Kent; the father was working in London. There had been one &#8216;false alarm&#8217; and the father had indicated his readiness to set off then to the hospital. When Jane was actually born in the middle of the night, I am satisfied that the father was working (night shift) and then had a prearranged commitment to care for his nieces and nephews the following day. I am satisfied that he visited Jane as soon as he reasonably could.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is obvious to me that when the mother came to London, she was both young and na&#239;ve. She was (and is) a vulnerable young woman with low self-esteem. She had plainly had a difficult relationship with her own mother. The mother had no support network in London, with neither family in London nor friends. In my judgement, the father took advantage of the mother&#8217;s youth, vulnerability, and naivety and the relationship was one (from the outset) where he was the dominant partner. The mother was, I sensed, quickly infatuated with him, and perhaps particularly because of the inconsistency in which he treated her, and his changeable attitude to her, she became obsessed with him and with keeping the relationship going, defaulting to jealousy and anxiety if he was not physically with her. She became possessive of the father. This does not mean that she was not abused by the father, as he sought to persuade me. Indeed, the mother&#8217;s description of the relationship is to my mind entirely recognisable as the behaviour of someone caught up in the whorl of abuse, who has lost any objective sense of what is acceptable and unacceptable in a relationship. I remind myself that she had no experience against which to judge this relationship and in all likelihood become co-dependent on her partner in an unhealthy way. I find that her self-esteem and sense of worth has been eroded to the point where she could not look beyond the relationship with the father; she became immunised to the emotional volatility of a relationship which she had come to believe was normal and acceptable. She simply sought to cling to what she knew. </p>
