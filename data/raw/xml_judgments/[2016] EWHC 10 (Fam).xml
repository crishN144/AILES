It is his case that the non-disclosure upon which he relies was a material factor in that he entered into the agreement to compromise his financial claims arising in the divorce proceedings on the basis of incomplete (and, on his case, misleading) information.  </p>

The case has been before various judges of the Family Division since then and very significant costs have been incurred on both sides.  Whilst each has during the currency of the litigation instructed top flight London firms of solicitors, neither can now afford that level of representation.  W now acts in person, assisted by a McKenzie friend.  H is represented by a firm of solicitors in which his brother is a partner.  He instructs Nicholas Yates who has been his junior counsel of choice throughout.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">The application to set aside the consent order was due to be heard over five days by King J (as she then was) in March 2014.  For reasons which I shall explain, there was deemed to be insufficient time to conclude that hearing and the matter was relisted before me as a ten day fixture, some fifteen months later in June 2015.  At that stage both sides were represented by leading counsel and I suspect that their availability and the court&#8217;s ability to accommodate the case in the lists led, in part, to that delay.  At the pre-trial review before me on 8 May 2015, Mr Yates, on H&#8217;s behalf, made an application to adjourn the forthcoming hearing.  He did so on the basis that the Supreme Court was about to hear the final appeals in <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland v Sharland </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/95" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 95" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 95</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Gohill v Gohill </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/274" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 274" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 274</ref>.<span style="font-style:italic"/>Judgment was not expected in those cases until the start of the Michaelmas term in October 2015.  Because of the significant delay which had already been incurred (a delay of almost three years since the issue of H&#8217;s set aside application), I dismissed the application to adjourn but agreed to reserve my judgment at the conclusion of the set aside hearing until the judgments from the Supreme Court became available.</p>

They married on 15 November 2008 having lived together since the beginning of March 2007.  It was a second marriage for W and a third marriage for H. Each had a child or children from their previous marriages.  Whilst there is a dispute as to the date upon which the marriage came to an end, it is clear from the evidence that, by June 2009, they were no longer living together in the same household.  W contends that it was not until July 2010 that they abandoned their final attempt to repair the marriage.  She speaks of holidays and times spent together during those last few months.  In my view, the precise date upon which the marriage came to an end matters not in the context of this case since each accepts that, on any view, it was a short marriage which, on H&#8217;s case, lasted no more than 7 or 8 months.  Even on W&#8217;s case, they were married for less than two years.</p>

However, as is clear from the accounts, external investors were supporting the business on a speculative basis since the company was, and had been from the outset, loss-making.  There was no tangible benefit in any of its underlying assets and expenses exceeded profits on a year on year basis.  It is abundantly clear to me from everything I have heard and read in this case that W had put her heart and soul into her business venture and was working diligently to ensure its success.  She was adept at securing good publicity as a means of encouraging the necessary further investment in the business.  The ongoing development costs of the B Ltd product and its operating expenses were high; external investment was the company&#8217;s lifeblood at this stage.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">When the divorce litigation commenced, W was in urgent need of funds to pay her then solicitors, Withers LLP.  In 2010, she sold 50,000 of her founder&#8217;s shares and raised &#163;50,000 towards her legal costs.  That transaction was the only sale she has made of her own shares since she started the company.   It was the basis upon which she valued her remaining 162,000 shares in her Form E.  That valuation, which she accepts to be her own, was the product of the financial consideration she had received in the 2010 share sale seen against the backdrop of ongoing corporate losses.  By the end of the 2009 financial year, B Ltd had lost just over &#163;668,000.  By 2010, the loss had increased to c. &#163;762,000.  By the time she swore her Form E in December 2011, the loss had risen to &#163;1.364 million.  The company then had cash reserves of &#163;1.53 million to see it through its next year of trading.  The provenance of that cash is something to which I shall return shortly.</p>

This supports W&#8217;s assertion that H was in possession of the 2010 update and gave a copy to his solicitors.  Whilst there is no equivalent entry on the chronology in respect of the 2011 update, I find it is likely that H did indeed receive a similar document in or around December 2011 (which he may or may not have read with any care).  However, apart from those updates and the other documents which were available to all the company&#8217;s shareholders, I accept his evidence that he had no wider knowledge of B Ltd&#8217;s affairs.  His evidence, which I accept, was that, on this basis, he assumed that his shares in B Ltd had little or no value over and above that which he had attributed to them in his Form E.</p>

However, matters never reached that point because on the day the parties decided to negotiate with a view to achieving an overall settlement.   Each decided to take a view and compromise so as to avoid months of future costly litigation.  On W&#8217;s case, as I accept, one of her essential objectives was to put into effect a complete clean break between herself and H so that neither would need to have any future involvement in the other&#8217;s life or business interests.  In this context, securing the return of H&#8217;s shares in B Ltd was an essential prerequisite for W and one for which she was prepared to sacrifice the opportunity of further exploring the disclosure which he had made in his Form E.  She was also prepared to abandon any claim to share in what she contended was a potentially significant marital acquest.</p>

H has referred to this clause as the &#8220;anti-embarrassment clause&#8221;.  H contends that these types of clauses are a fairly regular feature of commercial contracts and, typically, operate at the behest of the seller so as to require the purchase price to be recalculated and subject to upward adjustment in the event that the buyer sells on, at a higher price, within a specified period of time following completion of the original transaction.  In a commercial context, they are said to be designed to protect the seller&#8217;s position in the event that, for example, the buyer sells shares in a business at a significant mark-up shortly after acquiring its interest from the seller.  A seller might typically insist upon such a clause if, for example, it suspects that the buyer might be attempting to put together a back to back deal with another buyer waiting in the wings.  Other instances where such a clause might appear at the seller&#8217;s stipulation are those where there may be a lack of clarity as the underlying value of the business or other asset which is the subject of the sale contract, or if the seller simply wants to share in any possible future uplift in underlying value.  H told me during the course of his evidence that these types of clauses were a regular incidence of his commercial business dealings.  He said that it would have been natural for him to have asked for the inclusion of such a clause.  W, on the other hand, relies upon the insertion of this clause in the consent order as being fundamental to the issues which H now seeks to raise.  On her case, there was no non-disclosure but, </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">even</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> if there was, and </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">even</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> if it were to be considered material, this is the mechanism to which she points for redressing any financial imbalance.

In a letter dated 21 May 2012, Vardags asked Withers to ensure that the &#163;200,000 part-payment of the lump sum which had already been paid was secured pending the outcome of these enquiries and that no further steps were taken to execute the stock transfer form in relation to the B Ltd shares. There was also a request for a significant quantity of documents which W claims were confidential to the company.

It was during this period that she became aware that H had approached the press making allegations of financial irregularities against her.  W refutes that there was any truth whatsoever in these allegations.  However, because she was then in the throes of competitive negotiations with the Ministry of Justice in relation to the widely advertised tender for tagging offenders, she saw his actions as a potential threat to the success of that bidding process.  She instructed her solicitors to apply for an injunction preventing H from speaking about her to the press.  H filed a statement in response to her application.  In it, he admitted that he had used his corporate contacts to approach a well-known Daily Mail journalist because he wanted to discuss with that journalist a story he had previously written about another female entrepreneur (not related in any way to W).</p>

However, there has been a director of Odey&#8217;s on the B Ltd board as a non-executive for some considerable time and your client is well aware that our client is constantly talking to potential investors.  It is for that reason that the structure of the settlement that was negotiated took the form that it did &#8211; your client wanted to be able to benefit if B Ltd comes good.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">Certainly our client hopes that Odey will make a proposal because in order to bid for the Ministry of Justice contract, she needs to demonstrate that there are backers who will provide financial support.  However, what Odey is being asked to do is to provide financial support in the event that the bid is won by B Ltd.  That bid will only be determined mid-late next year.  As our client is quoted as saying in the Sunday Telegraph article, winning the MOJ bid would definitely mean having to secure significant investment.</p>

In that letter they reminded W&#8217;s solicitors that she had made numerous representations about the value of B Ltd and its shares.  Those representations, it was said, were relevant not only to the value of the shareholding which H had agreed to transfer to W but also to the merit of further investigation of the other issues referred to in his questionnaire which pertained to the valuation of the shares which she herself was retaining.  Her non-disclosure of the Odey investment, if indeed it was such, was &#8220;material to the understanding upon which [H] compromised the cross-claim between our clients&#8221;.</p>

As I have said, by that stage, H&#8217;s advisers had produced a formal questionnaire in relation to the alleged material non-disclosure.  This had been sent to W&#8217;s solicitors on 15 October 2012.  W was directed to respond to H&#8217;s questions although the scope and the reach of the enquiry was restricted in terms of the time line in respect of which she was obliged to provide primary or source documentation.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">The publicity in the financial press was clearly the catalyst for H&#8217;s set aside application.  As he had contended in his statement in support of that application, W had not disclosed during the course of the proceedings or the negotiations at court on 6 February 2012 that there was any potential investment deals on the horizon in respect of B Ltd.  The lack of any positive or helpful response to his solicitors&#8217; enquiries since then had fuelled his suspicions that she had yet to reveal the true position. In fact, she had referred in one of her circulars to &#8220;several new investment prospects&#8221;. H also confirmed in his oral evidence that he realised raising money for the company was an important part of her role as CEO of B Ltd. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">W&#8217;s case that she was trying to do what she could at that stage to answer H&#8217;s questions is evidenced in part by the fact that she had asked H to allow her to provide the B Ltd board with a copy of his questionnaire.  That request was turned down by him on the basis that to do so would breach his own confidentiality in the matrimonial proceedings.  His solicitors maintained his position that W did not need the Board&#8217;s consent to produce the material he had requested since, as a director, she was entitled to it.  In my view, the position was not quite so straightforward:  W was wearing two hats in these proceedings.  In the normal course of events, the disclosure of relevant financial information is protected by the implied duty of confidentiality which attaches to financial remedy proceedings :  see <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allen </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2002/45" uk:canonical="[2002] EWCA Civ 45" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWCA Civ 45</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] Fam 261" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] Fam 261</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 FLR 565" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 FLR 565</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">DL v SL </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/2621" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2621 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2621 (Fam)</ref>. W might well have been entitled to see the various documents and information which were being requested by virtue of her status as a director but the board&#8217;s stated position in relation to production of that information to H was clear, for reasons which they had explained.   The information sought was commercially sensitive in the extreme concerning, as it did, negotiations which were ongoing with third parties who had an expectation that confidentiality would be maintained.  In the view of both the company and W, H had not respected the confidentiality of her financial disclosure in these proceedings in the past and the board of B Ltd had withheld its permission in response to her request to be allowed to disclose what was sought by him and his legal team.  I shall return to this aspect and W&#8217;s position in due course.</p>

Of relevance in the present context and the value of W&#8217;s shares as 6 February 2012, Lord Stevens&#8217; letter laid out the following points:-</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">On 17 May 2013, a firm of solicitors instructed by B Ltd, Jones Nickolds, wrote to H&#8217;s solicitors in relation to his pending application for disclosure against the company.  They pointed out that W was a minority shareholder and there were a number of registered institutional shareholders on the register.  She was but one of six directors and a separate sub-committee had been set up to deal with these matters in her absence.  She had no part in the preparation or presentation of the board&#8217;s position and would not see the letter until her solicitors were copied in.  That letter contained the company&#8217;s proposal that an independent expert should be appointed to value W&#8217;s shares and the company would provide to the expert instructed whatever documentation was necessary to enable that process to be undertaken.  It described the breadth of the existing questionnaire as a &#8216;fishing expedition&#8217; which was seen as an attempt to &#8216;cause commercial &#8220;trouble&#8221;&#8217; for the company. The letter continued in these terms:</p>

[H] is aware that the production of documentation bearing on those third parties will naturally cause them a high degree of concern at a particularly sensitive stage in our negotiations.&#8217; </p>

By this point in time, H and his advisers had obtained copies of the 2012 accounts for B Ltd which had been filed at Companies House.  H contends that these were filed late.  A reconciliation of those accounts with the earlier accounts appeared to show that a sum of approximately &#163;3.5 million had been injected into B Ltd in an apparently unconventional manner.  According to H&#8217;s written evidence, this investment appeared to have been made before W&#8217;s Form E in which she represented that the value of her founder&#8217;s shares was &#163;1 each.  In terms of the company&#8217;s share capital, the notes to the accounts recorded that, whilst 438,206 ordinary shares had been allocated and fully paid, there were a further 102,248 shares which had been paid up but not yet allotted.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">Much of the substance of her written replies to these questions was explored in forensic detail during the course of her cross-examination by Mr Yates.  I shall come to that evidence in due course.  However, at this point, the broad thrust of her narrative response in August 2013 was in these terms.  She said that the only shares purchased in B Ltd in 2011 were new shares issued to a named individual at &#163;25 per share.  The shareholders had been informed in 2011 that the company was in dire need of a further cash injection but none (including H) had been prepared to advance new working capital.  A South African businessman (Nathan Kirsh) had been prepared to support the company financially.  Through one of his holding companies, KI Corporation (&#8220;KI&#8221;), he had provided &#163;2 million in 2010.  This loan had been channelled through the vehicle of a formal Convertible Loan Agreement dated 9 July 2010.  The initial agreement provided for a loan of &#163;500,000 which sum could be converted into equity at the price of &#163;25 per share on the basis of put and call options.  The loan was repayable at the end of one year.  The intention underpinning the initial agreement was that KI would carry out its due diligence in relation to B Ltd with the objective of determining whether to provide the company with an additional amount of up to &#163;1.5 million.  W contends that this information would have been available to H since it was included in the shareholder updates for the relevant year.</p>

She had never been able to sell her shares for any more than &#163;1.00 per share because the company was not making a profit and had no underlying assets.  Without her presence driving the company forward, investment was likely to dry up altogether.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">Without securing the Ministry of Justice contract, W was concerned as to whether B Ltd would be able to repay the &#163;2 million loan.  By 2011, KI was in any event refusing to convert the loan into equity on the basis that it regarded the conversion price of &#163;25 per share to be too high.  In addition, the lender was insisting on securing preference shares to the detriment of the existing body of shareholders.  Relations between the two companies deteriorated further and KI threatened to sue B Ltd.  It was at this point that W secured the new funding from Odey.  On W&#8217;s case, the cash which was provided (&#163;3.5 million) was to be held to the order of Odey and had to be repaid in the event that completion of its investment did not take place.    With the threat of litigation by KI, part of the Odey funds was used to redeem the loan of &#163;2 million due to KI.  Final settlement with KI was concluded in February 2013.  The balance of Odey&#8217;s advance of &#163;1.5million was earmarked as cash flow which would be needed to keep the company solvent for the next 12 months.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in">According to W&#8217;s evidence, the proposed investment agreement with Odey required B Ltd to comply with an extensive range of conditions.  These conditions had not been satisfied by the company&#8217;s financial year end (31 December 2011) and, thus, the transaction could not be completed and the shares could not be issued.  When the time came to file year end accounts, the company was presented with two options.  Either the Odey funds could be treated as a loan (with the result that the company would have finished the year with a significant negative balance sheet) or they could be treated as what they were (i.e. paid up but unissued share capital).  Given that B Ltd was then pursuing the Ministry of Justice bid, it was important that the company was seen to be in a position of solvency.  It is for this reason that W maintains she was justified in not disclosing this information either at the time of the original agreement with H on 6 February 2012 or subsequently over the intervening months during which H was seeking further information after the publication of The Daily Telegraph article.  On her case, Odey&#8217;s injection of cash had made no material difference to B Ltd&#8217;s underlying share price.  It had simply enabled the company to repay its existing loans and carry on trading.  The fact that the Odey funds had become available some five months before the compromise of the matrimonial proceedings was no more nor less than part of the financial <span style="font-style:italic">modus operandi </span>under which the company had operated more or less since its incorporation.  It was a small technology company with significant development costs.  Not only did those costs have to be serviced by means of external investments or loans, the company also required cash flow for its day to day operational expenses.  Odey was simply one such potential investor, on W&#8217;s case, and she saw no reason to disclose this aspect of the company&#8217;s internal affairs in the context of her obligation to make full and frank disclosure in the matrimonial proceedings.  She points to the fact that H was, and would throughout have been, well aware that her role as the company&#8217;s CEO was to secure investors precisely so as to ensure the company&#8217;s survival and its ability to become profitable through securing contracts such as that which was on the horizon with the Ministry of Justice.</p>

Secondly, he says that had he known that a blue chip investor of this calibre was prepared to back the company, he would not have agreed to part with his shares on the terms he did.  His case is that the Odey investment in B Ltd was transformational in terms of potential future value and he maintains that case from the perspective of an experienced venture capitalist.</p>

W was represented on that occasion by leading and junior counsel, Mr James Turner QC and Mr Deepak Nagpal.  Mr Richard Todd QC and Mr Yates appeared for H.   The first day of that hearing was set aside for the judge&#8217;s reading day.  By the time the parties appeared in court on the second day, negotiations to settle the case had started.  King J (as she then was) attempted to assist the parties to narrow the distance between them but, by the time it became clear that negotiations were not going to be productive, there was insufficient time for the case to be completed.  I suspect that by that stage, the judge may have felt herself to be conflicted in any event as a result of what must have been an agreement that she should enter the settlement arena on the basis of a quasi-FDR type of hearing.  The matter was listed before me with time estimate of 10 days, along with a pre-trial review.  Both parties have since filed further updating statements.  As I have said earlier in this judgment, I subsequently rejected Mr Yates&#8217;s application on behalf of H for an adjournment of the final hearing in view of the inordinate length of time which it has taken this litigation to reach the end of its journey in the Family Court.</p>

By that stage, I had additional written statements not only from the parties but from Barry Stiefel, a witness upon whose evidence H wished to rely.  Mr Stiefel is a director of KI Corporation and H wished to adduce at trial his evidence in relation to the repayment of that company&#8217;s loan to B Ltd in October 2011 on receipt of the injection of the Odey funds.

Although she had the assistance of one or two McKenzie friends throughout, she conducted her own cross-examination of H and his witnesses herself.  In my view, she discharged her task with an impressive command of the case.  She was a courteous advocate who typically addressed the court with an economy of language which was almost invariably on point and in context.  Notwithstanding the exquisitely sensitive task which fell to her in her cross-examination of H, she remained calm and in control of her personal brief.  Her questions were invariably on point and, in terms of the areas which needed to be covered forensically, she needed little assistance or guidance from either me or her McKenzie friends.  That I do not make similar remarks in relation to Mr Yates&#8217;s presentation of his client&#8217;s case is no reflection of any shortcomings on his part.  Characteristically, his advocacy was of the highest standard and he pressed H&#8217;s case and his cross-examination of W with complete mastery of his facts.  However, Mr Yates stood firmly on his familiar professional ground in discharging this task whilst W had no such advantage.  I wish her to know that she has assisted me considerably, both in her written and oral submissions in this case.</p>

It does not surprise me that she has succeeded in her business career to the extent about which I have read and heard.  She is plainly intelligent, focused and driven in her desire to make a success of the various projects and commercial enterprises into which she invests so much of her time and energy.  She is also charismatic and extremely personable.  I have little doubt that her communication skills and her ability to persuade potential investors across the corporate threshold justify the reputation she clearly has as CEO of B Ltd. </p>

On several occasions whilst she was being cross-examined by Mr Yates, she challenged his use of a particular word or phrase which he had attributed to her.   I am satisfied that this was not mere pedantry on her part but a wish to ensure that the court was not misled about the smallest detail of her case.  I did not find her to be a devious or evasive witness, despite the challenges which Mr Yates properly made to some parts of her evidence.  On a number of occasions, she was prepared to accept that a particular statement, or the impression it sought to convey, was not accurate or entirely truthful when looked at in the light of this litigation&#8217;s timeline.</p>

It was quite clear to me that each of these parties carries significant emotional scars from their failed marriage and the subsequent court proceedings which have flowed from it over the course of what is now years of expensive litigation.  H is himself an impressive individual who has carved out over many years a highly successful track record in the field of commercial investment.  He is by profession an accountant and has a clear grasp of both the financial and commercial undercurrents which permeate the case.  He was, like W, a courteous witness despite his evident exasperation at times when he was unable to contain his obvious feelings that W had &#8216;duped&#8217; him into the agreement reflected in the consent order.  I found him to be a fundamentally truthful witness although his grasp on the underlying detail of the history and events now long past was not as clear as parts of the evidence which emerged from W&#8217;s recollection.</p>

Both agreed that it was very difficult to value shares in unquoted start-up technology companies since these can often be loss making over a number of years.  H told me that one of the most reliable indicators of value is the last price at which an external investor was prepared to put money into the company.  He explained about the tax breaks which are available to an individual investor, but not to a corporate or institutional investor.  He confirmed that he knew that shares in B Ltd were being traded at &#163;25 per share when he completed his Form E since the 2010 accounts (which he had seen) contained that information.  However, he qualified that evidence by telling me that an investment by an individual at a particular price is not necessarily a reliable indicator or benchmark of value at that particular time since the actual net cost to the investor is likely to be less.</p>

He spoke of a corporate &#8216;pivotal moment&#8217;, being one where, as an investor, you realise a company has significant potential value and will start &#8220;motoring&#8221;.  The fact that Odey had been willing to inject &#163;3.5 million into B Ltd to support its potential bid for a government contract was such a &#8216;pivotal moment&#8217;.  That investment, in his eyes, had given the company a status, standing and access to a high level of expertise and support.  It opened up a &#8216;back room&#8217; to B Ltd which provided the collective support of Odey&#8217;s analysts and researchers.  This was, in H&#8217;s experience, a very unusual investment for Odey to make and stood quite apart from the scenario whereby a private individual (such as himself) made an investment in a start-up company in order to secure, amongst other potential benefits, a significant tax saving through the government&#8217;s enterprise based schemes which were then available.</p>

It was H&#8217;s case that W had told him during these conversations that the company was &#8216;in trouble&#8217; and the contract had been delayed.  This was disputed by W who told me that there were no discussions at all between them about B Ltd once they had separated.  H was asked when these conversations had taken place.  He was unable to give me any specific information as to when, or in what circumstances, he had spoken to W about the company&#8217;s financial fortunes.  He told me about his recollection that she was constantly telephoning to &#8216;pester&#8217; him, although most of the time he tried not to take the calls.    He told me that he had a number of girlfriends at the time and W would call early in the morning on occasions when it would be difficult or embarrassing for him to take the calls.  On balance, I am prepared to accept W&#8217;s evidence that there was no direct discussion between them about the financial health of the company once they had formally separated.  I am quite prepared to accept that, in the months following June 2009 when H told W he did not wish to live with her any longer in the South Kensington property, there may well have been several anxious telephone calls between them as they entered a difficult &#8216;no man&#8217;s land&#8217; in terms of their marriage.  It is W&#8217;s case that the marriage limped along for another few months, albeit that they were living separately.  In her mind, there was still a prospect of saving the marriage during this period.  On the balance of probabilities, I am prepared to accept that the telephone calls to which H was referring had happened during this period and related to the difficulties in which this couple then found themselves rather than to any issues surrounding W&#8217;s work with B Ltd.  I accept that, once the separation became final (in W&#8217;s mind, at least, by July 2010), there was little &#8211; if any - direct discussion between them about the company.  This is consistent, I find, with H&#8217;s earlier evidence that W was not forthcoming with information about the company.  He said at one point of his oral evidence that he did not ask questions because he knew that she would not tell him anything.  Thus, on his case, he was dependent upon her for information at the time he struck the deal in February 2012, a case which W appears to accept save only in respect of the information he received (or could have ascertained) in his capacity as a shareholder of B Ltd.</p>

He said that he had been unaware of the circumstances of the redemption of the KI loan until he had spoken to Barry Stiefel.

Her point of contact with Odey was Mr Wolfson, an affiliate of Odey&#8217;s who sat on B Ltd&#8217;s board.  She continued to maintain her case that the injection of funds by Odey into B Ltd in 2011 was not an equity investment.  At the point of receipt, it could not properly be characterised as the provision of long term capital (i.e. an investment of more than 12 months) because the 28 day window which was specified as the deadline for agreeing terms had closed without agreement.  The terms being proposed by Odey as a condition of its investment involved wide-ranging provisions which included a change to the company&#8217;s Articles of Association.  The agreement into which the company entered had a specific clause which provided that Odey&#8217;s offer would lapse if terms had not been agreed within the specified time frame.  Of course, by that time, the outstanding loan from KI had been repaid using a significant part of the Odey funds. The balance was retained within B Ltd as working capital.  </p>

If we had won that contract it would have been a, as [H] describes, pivotal moment and anybody would want to have been invested.  But there was a very, very &#8211; the odds of winning were so outside, so by doing what they did was very clever.  They provided cash, but they didn&#8217;t reach an agreement and they sat on it.  So it gave them effectively an option at any time.  We didn&#8217;t give the money back because we didn&#8217;t have it, we had spent it, so we didn&#8217;t raise our head above the parapet to get shot down.  And I thought, well, worst case, if they ask and it&#8217;s a year&#8217;s time they ask or three months&#8217; time, at that stage I will work hard to negotiate something with them or I will try to find somebody else to replace them.  In the same way I did when KI reneged on their agreement, and with KI we actually had a fully executed signed agreement and they still reneged on it and said they wouldn&#8217;t convert it.  So I was in the context of knowing that this is what investors do, they sit there and keep the option open, which gives them a preference &#8230; effectively then it&#8217;s a loan, which is a preference.  So if the company falls over they get their money out before anybody else does, and we were not offering that.  We were only offering them &#8211; if they were going to invest it was going to be in ordinary shares.  Now when they finally did complete their investment in February 2013, three things had happened.  We had qualified to bid for the MOJ, which is extraordinary, so the MOJ had changed the criteria for the bidding and allowed small companies to bid for one part of it, and we had qualified for that.  So that was amazing.  It was an incredible achievement.  We had completed our disagreement with KI &#8230;. But one of the terms of the Odey proposal was that we could all warrant as directors that there were no outstanding legal issues, and [H] knows full well that that is something any investor would require.  We couldn&#8217;t do that until that agreement was reached and that agreement was reached in February 2013.  And the third thing was in 2013, February, that we had run out of money again.  We had spent the working capital and we needed to go out and raise, and I went to talk to [N Co] and they said they&#8217;d come in at a higher price, so Odey went, &#8220;Well we want to complete&#8221; and at that point said, &#8220;We want to complete and we want to complete on this price&#8221; and then there was a negotiation and they completed.  But they had managed to keep for 14 months the option of investing.&#8221; </p>

It was W&#8217;s clear view, expressed forcefully from the witness box as I have set out above, that it had not occurred to her that the identity of the investor was in any way relevant to the value of her shares in B Ltd.  She did not then, and does not now, consider that she was under any obligation to refer to the investment in her Form E and she questions its relevance in terms of the set aside application being pursued with such determination by H.   She told me that she believed to this day that she had completed her Form E honestly and accurately.  At that point, as far as she was concerned, B Ltd was holding the balance of Odey&#8217;s &#163;3.5 million investment (&#163;1.7 million of which had been applied to redeem the KI loan) and those funds were repayable on demand.  She did not consider the funds to belong to the company.  Had the accounts been drawn to reflect a greater burden of debt, it would have significantly prejudiced the company&#8217;s position in its bid for the Ministry of Justice contract.  She described the position as being &#8220;in no man&#8217;s land; technically we should have given the money back but it was not in our interests to do that&#8221;.</p>

She pointed to another early investor in B Ltd, Anthony Bolton, whose fund (Fidelity) had made an investment in B Ltd some 12 months before H&#8217;s initial investment.  That investment was made on the basis of &#163;5.75 per share.  Despite the considerable reputation of that particular investor, it had made no material difference to the price at which she had been able to attract future investment in B Ltd.  She told me that she had learned from a very early stage that  investors do not make commercial decisions based upon the identity of their fellow investors.  In this context, she was in agreement with H that the price at which new investors were prepared to put money into B Ltd had no relevance to the value of her founder&#8217;s shares. She rejects H&#8217;s argument that Odey&#8217;s arrival as an investor opened doors to valuable networks of contacts and/or that it provided so-called &#8216;backroom&#8217; facilities which offered new opportunities which would otherwise have been unavailable to B Ltd.  In this respect, there was no evidence before me of any such opportunities having being introduced to B Ltd by Odey.</p>

His solicitors&#8217; initial response to The Daily Telegraph article had been a demand to see several categories of documents which she was being prevented by her board from disclosing.  She told me that she had construed these requests as H&#8217;s attempt to continue and prolong the highly acrimonious litigation which had then been ongoing between them for two years.  She had felt exhausted by that litigation and had all but run out of funds to continue it.  Because of his earlier approach to a Daily Mail journalist and his disclosure of confidential court documents (or, at least, a page from her Form E), she was extremely anxious about releasing to H in the context of the ongoing litigation any further commercially sensitive documents which he might use to damage B Ltd&#8217;s bid for the Ministry of Justice contract.  She had no confidence in any undertakings he might give to keep this information private and, further, the board of B Ltd was telling her that she could not release the documents which were being sought.  On her case, it was a combination of these factors, rather than any reluctance on her part to provide information, which prolonged the disclosure process over the course of 2012.</p>

She told me that she should have read that letter with greater care but had never anticipated that this correspondence, written after they had concluded their agreement, would be the subject of such rigorous scrutiny.

There was already a basis for that suspicion in terms of the information which had been given by him to the Daily Mail journalist.  W told me that she had written a personal letter to her board asking for their assistance and for permission to disclose the information which was being sought.  Although that letter was not included in the bundles of material before the court, she provided me with a copy the following morning.  The letter confirms her evidence and sets out in clear terms her request to be released from her contractual obligations to the company to the extent of providing the information sought by H and his legal team.  She accepted that she could have gone privately to H to inform him that the company was holding cash belonging to Odey which might have to be returned.  She did not do this because she believed he would have used the information to damage her and the company.  She described H as &#8220;an angry man&#8221;.  In my judgment, that was probably an entirely apt description of his feelings towards her at the time.  It was not until May 2013 when the lengthy questionnaire directed towards W was distilled by order of Parker J into 5 direct questions that the board agreed to assist W in her disclosure obligations to this court.</p>

Mr Yates asked W why, with the Odey investment having been agreed in February 2013, she had not instructed her solicitors to write prior to the hearing before Parker J on 22 May 2013 (the occasion for further scrutiny of H&#8217;s schedule of deficiencies) to reveal the fact that Odey&#8217;s &#8220;loan&#8221; (on her case) had since been converted into an investment.  W very fairly conceded that she had not done so because she did not consider it relevant.  I mention that here because, on Mr Yates&#8217; case, it goes to the heart of her credibility in relation to what she believed about her obligation to disclose Odey&#8217;s involvement at the time she concluded the February 2012 agreement with H.  He relies on that failure as a further brick in the evidential wall he seeks to erect to support his case against her in relation to a deliberate intention to deceive both H and the court in relation to the information which was provided in her Form E.</p>

That narrative explanation coincides with the evidence which she has subsequently set out in her written evidence and as she explained matters during the course of her oral evidence.  She set out in that narrative that Odey had agreed to convert its loan to shares in B Ltd following the company&#8217;s settlement with KI in February 2013.  As a result, Odey then held 119,920 shares with preferential rights.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Mr Stiefel confirmed in his written statement that KI had entered into a convertible loan agreement with B Ltd on 9 July 2010.  I have seen a copy of that agreement which provides for an initial loan of &#163;500,000 to B Ltd which, at KI&#8217;s sole discretion, could be converted into shares in B Ltd at a price of &#163;25 per share.  The loan was stated to be repayable in full on the first anniversary of the agreement (i.e. 9 July 2011).  Clause 7 of the agreement provides that, after carrying out a due diligence examination of B Ltd&#8217;s affairs, KI would consider lending a further &#163;1.5 million to the company.  Thereafter, sums totalling &#163;1.5 million were made available to the company.  Those loans were never converted into equity in accordance with the loan agreement.  I heard evidence from both Mr Stiefel and W as to why that was not done.  Had the loan been converted into shares, there would have been no need for part of the Odey cash injection to be used to repay the debt.  Mr Stiefel stated in his written evidence that, in October 2011, W had visited his office and told him that she no longer wished KI to be involved with B Ltd.  She handed over a cheque made out to KI in the sum of &#163;1.5 million.  He says that this came as a surprise to him since there had been no earlier indication from KI that repayment of its loan was required.  He made reference to an earlier disagreement between KI and B Ltd/W in relation to the production of a share certificate to which KI was entitled as a result of buying the shares of a previous investor in the company.  Litigation was threatened but never proceeded as a result of an out of court settlement.  This litigation related solely to the transfer of shares; it did not concern the loan which KI made to B Ltd.</p>

He said they told him that they could not issue KI with a share certificate because W had sold the shares twice and there were none to allocate.  I heard evidence about the reasons why KI had refused to sign a Deed of Adherence in relation to B Ltd&#8217;s shareholders agreement.  Mr Stiefel told me it was because of W&#8217;s failure to produce a certain business plan.  I heard about Mr Stiefel&#8217;s opinion that W was the controlling shareholder on the B Ltd board.  I heard about his &#8216;impression&#8217; that W was the alter ego of a company called Zinc Ltd (which was itself a shareholder in B Ltd).</p>

There was no consensus as to the circumstances in which the Convertible Loan Agreement had been signed.  W produced on the third day of the hearing a different version of the signed agreement which had been signed by &#8220;L S Coomer&#8221; on behalf of Zinc, as one of B Ltd&#8217;s shareholders.  Frankly, none of this evidence assisted me in relation to the core issues in this case.   Lord Stevens was to tell me that there was a very difficult personal relationship between the directors of B Ltd and Mr Stiefel.  Much of what Mr Stiefel told me appeared to be based on incomplete knowledge and assumption.  The issue of the ownership of the shares in Zinc Limited is a good example.  W told me during the course of her oral evidence that she had never provided funds to Zinc to enable that company to purchase shares in B Ltd.  Initially she had owned 99.9% of the shares in B Ltd as its founder.  Zinc Ltd became a shareholder in September 2005 during the first stage of external funding. W&#8217;s own shareholding at that point reduced to about 80%.  Over four further rounds of external investment, her interest in B Ltd was further reduced so that, by 2009, she held a 38% equity stake in the company.</p>

I am entirely satisfied that W was telling me the truth when she denied any relationship or connection with that company.  I am also satisfied that neither she nor Lord Stevens made any representations to Mr Stiefel about selling shares in B Ltd twice.  W denies this and her denial is supported by Lord Stevens and Professor Kay who told me that this is something which Mr Stiefel himself had not surmised until the facts were explained to him by Professor Kay himself.</p>

This was shortly after the hearing before Parker J in November 2012 when W&#8217;s application to strike out H&#8217;s application to set aside the consent order was dismissed.  In that letter, he confirmed that Odey began discussions with B Ltd in May 2012 with a view to providing financial support to the company for its discussions with the Ministry of Justice.  He explained that Odey&#8217;s particular interest was in &#8216;offender management&#8217; because of the company&#8217;s belief that pressures on public expenditure created a potential worldwide market for tracking solutions in substitution for custodial sentences.  Under W&#8217;s leadership, Odey considered that B Ltd might be capable of providing the basis for the development of such a business.  His letter continued in these terms:</p>

In that letter, which was addressed to W and H&#8217;s solicitor and copied to me, Mr Fletcher queried the basis of the reliance which was being placed by the parties on his first letter.  He claims not to have remembered writing it although he did recall some discussions about W&#8217;s divorce case &#8220;and the possibility of us helping rebut some untrue claims by stating the facts&#8221;.  He explained that his lack of recollection did not mean he had not signed the first letter since he would frequently sign letters drafted by others in the normal course of his work.  As to any suggestion of &#8220;collusion&#8221; with W, he fully and firmly rejected any suggestion that he had been involved in anything underhand or improper.  When cross-examined by Mr Yates on behalf of H, Mr Fletcher said that Odey had about five hundred &#8216;live&#8217; investments at any one time and he would often sign letters in this way.  He said that the purpose of the letter had been to restate clearly the circumstances of Odey&#8217;s investment in B Ltd.  That investment had occurred in October 2011 at a time when the shares in the company were valued at &#163;34.23 each.  That would have valued the company at about &#163;15 million which was a far cry from what was being represented in the Daily Telegraph article which spoke of the company being worth &#8220;tens of millions&#8221;.  He said he had no idea as to the provenance of the report and he had had no conversations with W prior to writing this letter about information she was being asked to provide in these proceedings.  He was unaware of what information had been provided to Odey by W and/or B Ltd in order to persuade the company to invest in B Ltd although he had seen Odey&#8217;s own financial projections.  He explained that Odey would have undertaken the normal due diligence procedures before investing and would have reserved the right to appoint one of B Ltd&#8217;s board members.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Significantly, Mr Fletcher confirmed that when Odey paid over the &#163;3.5 million to B Ltd in October 2011, it was viewed by his company as an equity investment rather than a loan.  Odey received a share certificate and it was recorded as such in Odey&#8217;s own accounts.  Odey had signed a subscription agreement. When Mr Yates put to him the description of the &#8220;investment&#8221; as it was reflected in B Ltd&#8217;s own accounts, Mr Fletcher confirmed, again, that there was no doubt in his mind that Odey had acquired an equity stake in B Ltd at the time it had provided funding in October 2011 and it had been recorded in Odey&#8217;s financial records as such from the outset.  He accepted that there was a technical glitch which prevented the company from formally completing the conditions of the investment since various changes were required to the B Ltd Articles before Odey was prepared to sign the shareholder&#8217;s Deed of Adherence.  He accepted that W and B Ltd may not have been aware that this was how Odey had recorded its investment.  He was adamant that there had been no collusion between him and W and/or any other employee or representative of Odey in relation to the letter written on 5 December 2012.  He told me that he had met W once in the summer of 2011 and they might have spoken once or twice on the telephone after that meeting.  He was aware that Odey had written to the Ministry of Justice to support B Ltd&#8217;s bid and to confirm that the company was willing to provide financial support to B Ltd in the event of it securing the government contract.</p>

I accept that, as far as Odey was concerned, it had made a commercial investment in B Ltd from the outset, i.e. in October 2011 when its relationship with B Ltd was formalised beyond the exploratory discussions which had been taking place up to that point in time.  In relation to the content of the letter dated 5 December 2012, I accept that neither Mr Fletcher nor W were directly concerned in the drafting of the letter.  Nonetheless, it was, as I find, presented to H&#8217;s lawyers in support of the case which W was then running in relation to Odey&#8217;s involvement with B Ltd and it does not on its face reflect Odey&#8217;s position in relation to its equity stake in B Ltd as it was explained to me during the course of Mr Fletcher&#8217;s oral evidence.</p>

Since June 2011 he has been the Chairman of B Ltd&#8217;s board of directors and is well known as a former Metropolitan Police Commissioner.  His written statement is dated 4 March 2014.  In that statement he dealt with his knowledge about the company&#8217;s financial situation in the early days of his involvement and the circumstances in which Odey came to be involved with the company.  He spoke of the financial difficulties with which the company was struggling when he joined the board and of problems he encountered in his dealings with Mr Stiefel with whom he had many telephone calls and discussions over KI&#8217;s unwillingness to provide the balance of the cash funding which had been promised.  B Ltd was then losing about &#163;100,000 per month in terms of its cash flow and, during the Summer of 2011, W had been involved in many discussions with potential investors with a view to replacing KI&#8217;s financial backing for the company.  Whilst Lord Stevens told me during his oral evidence that he respected Mr Stiefel as a good businessman, his view was that he was witholding the funds earmarked for investment in B Ltd as a means of control and to give KI some standing in decisions made in relation to the process of governance of the company.</p>

I have referred to the contents of this letter in paragraphs 118 and 119 of my judgment and do not repeat them here.  When cross-examined by Mr Yates about the content of that letter, Lord Stevens told me that the board had taken legal advice following the hearing before Parker J in November 2012 and had instructed independent counsel for the purposes of the next hearing in May 2013 when the company was separately represented.  (It was at that hearing, on 22 May 2013, when counsel instructed by the company made the open concession that Odey had invested in B Ltd.)  He told me that W had had no part in the drafting of the letter dated 20 February 2013; the information relating to B Ltd had been provided in the form which appears in that letter since the company accounts for the year end 31 December 2011 were already in the public domain.  Those accounts show that the company was then holding cash reserves of some &#163;1.53 million (i.e. the balance of the Odey funds paid in October that year, although there is nothing by way of further narrative in those accounts to alert the reader to the provenance of the funds).</p>

This offer was never accepted and the company was thus obliged to instruct counsel to attend the hearing on 22 May 2013 in order to oppose H&#8217;s outstanding application for a production order against the company.</p>

He told me that, at one stage, matters had deteriorated to such an extent that a board meeting was called: the company was unable to pay staff salaries when they were due the following week.  He recalled the directors offering to &#8220;put their hands in their pockets&#8221; in order to ensure the staff were paid.  The deal with Odey had provided the company with a vital source of cash flow and enabled the company to carry on trading and investing in the resolution of a number of technical problems which were occurring in the manufacture of its main product.</p>

He was honoured with a CBE in the 2014 New Year&#8217;s Honours List.  He had prepared a written statement dated 3 March 2014.  Much of his statement was redacted.  I suspect that the redacted material went to his opinion of the value of the shares in B Ltd and there was no permission or agreement in this case for expert valuation evidence.

He had joined the board of B Ltd in September 2012 but appears to have been giving informal advice to the company for a period of time prior to his formal appointment.  He was brought in specifically to assist the company with a number of administrative matters including the termination of its corporate relationships with KI and with the former chairman, Mr Kanter, the completion of the 2011 accounts, and the finalisation of the company&#8217;s investment agreement with Odey.</p>

He was aware that the company was preparing to bid for a number of contracts, including the Ministry of Justice tender, and he could see the disadvantage of filing accounts which showed a negative net worth on the balance sheet.  The reason for the deficiency was the fact that the Odey investment had been treated in the draft accounts prepared by Mazars as a loan to the company, repayable within twelve months.  This was because Odey had provided funds in contemplation of a formal equity investment but their terms had not been met within the required time frame.  Under the terms of the agreement, the monies received from Odey were repayable if the conditions precedent to an equity investment were not completed within 28 days.  Thus, in Professor Kay&#8217;s eyes (and in the opinion of the company&#8217;s external accountants), the monies were technically repayable on demand as at 31 December 2011 (the company&#8217;s year end) and continued to be repayable on demand in September 2012 when his appointment to the board took effect.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.12in">Professor Kay was well aware of the continuing discussions which were ongoing with Odey.  He knew that the intention was that the Odey monies would be converted into equity, allowing the company to meet its liabilities and continue trading.  The ongoing discussions confirmed his belief that the equity investment would crystallise.  He told me during the course of his oral evidence that he had spoken to Julian Wolfson, Odey&#8217;s appointment to the board of B Ltd, who confirmed that Odey was not likely to require the return of its funds.  Having spoken to Mazars, the company accountants, Professor Kay was of the view (shared by Mazars) that the shares which were due to be issued to Odey could not be shown as such in the 2011 company accounts since they had not been formally issued by the time of the preparation of the 2011 accounts in September the following year.  In these circumstances, it was his specific advice to the board that the Odey investment should be treated in the accounts as subscription monies which had been paid in contemplation of a subsequent equity investment albeit that the shares to which the subscription related remained unissued.  On this basis, and with the agreement of the partner at Mazars who was responsible for B Ltd&#8217;s affairs, the accounts were drawn on the revised basis.  Professor Kay was aware by this time that W was in dispute with H in relation to the value of the shares in B Ltd.  He pointed out to her that the revised treatment of the Odey investment in the accounts might be to her detriment since the debt was removed and replaced by a positive cash balance thus displaying a stronger financial position than would have been the case on the basis of the original draft accounts.  She responded by telling him that &#8220;we should do what is best for [B Ltd]&#8221;, or words to that effect.  He was not challenged in relation to that response and I believe that is more or less exactly what she told Professor Kay.</p>

I learned that the change to the Articles (undertaken as a condition of the Odey investment) took longer than expected and that, to some extent, it suited both parties to leave matters in a state of some ambiguity.  Professor Kay told me that, despite holding a share certificate, Odey was never registered as a shareholder at that time.  In Professor Kay&#8217;s view, they were more properly described as preferential creditors in respect not of a loan but of monies repayable on demand.  </p>

He did not agree that the investment had been either transformational or a pivotal event.  Had the availability of the initial investment and the agreement in principle to support the Ministry of Justice bid if the contract was awarded to B Ltd resulted in success for that bid, he agreed the Odey effect would have been transformational.  But that did not happen. The company did not secure the contract and the funds made available by Odey merely enabled the company to develop its products and carry on its business.  He had no knowledge of Odey&#8217;s investment having acted as a magnet or prestige factor in terms of attracting other investors.  </p>

I have no doubt that he was doing his best to present the position in relation to the company&#8217;s internal accounting procedures in what he genuinely believed to be an accurate reflection of the true state of affairs at the time. However, I am left in real doubt as to the extent to which all this actually assists me with resolving the fundamental issues in this case.  My focus must be on the duty of disclosure imposed by law upon W at the time she concluded her agreement with H and the extent to which she complied with that duty of disclosure.  I accept that the circumstances of the Odey investment are relevant to an extent to her own state of knowledge and to the existence (or otherwise) of an intention on her part to mislead or hide information which might have been relevant to H&#8217;s decision to do the deal.</p>

I remind myself that <span class="Emphasis">Livesey v Jenkins</span> itself was a case involving a consent order.&#160; <span class="Emphasis">B v B</span> arose in very different circumstances.&#160; A wife was attempting to set aside an order on <span class="Emphasis">Barder</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] 2 All ER 440" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] 2 All ER 440</ref> principles, complaining about an allegedly inaccurate valuation of a matrimonial home.&#160; In such circumstances, each party is in a position to test the valuation evidence by reasonable enquiry and cannot complain if they fail to do so.&#160; A more pertinent example would be a case in which there is &#163;100,000 in a bank account that happens to be in the joint names of the parties.&#160; It is not disclosed by either party.&#160; If the Wife knows that the account exists, she can make reasonable enquiry herself (as she is a joint holder of the account) and cannot complain if she fails to do so.&#160; It is just possible, however, that she might not know about the account.&#160; If that is the case, she cannot make reasonable enquiry herself and she must rely on her husband's disclosure being full and frank.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>55.&#160;In this particular case, the Wife did not have access to the trust deeds or accounts.&#160; She was reliant on the Husband making full and frank disclosure in that regard.&#160; Her solicitors did ask questions but both parties (not just the Wife) decided to abandon the formal Form E procedure and negotiate.&#160; In doing so, the duty of both parties to provide full and frank disclosure did not disappear.&#160; A husband cannot simply rely on an offer to provide full disclosure in a future Form E.&#160; He has to provide sufficient disclosure to give the wife a proper picture of his financial resources.&#160; In such circumstances, a Wife is entitled to rely on the information that is provided.&#160; <br/><br/>56.&#160;I therefore have to decide three things:-</p>

		<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland</span>, the parties had reached a settlement in circumstances where one of the main issues in the case had been the value of the husband&#8217;s shareholding in a software business which he had developed.  Both parties instructed valuers who provided valuations on the basis that there were no plans to float the company by means of an Initial Public Offering (IPO).  The husband had represented to the court that there was no IPO &#8220;on the cards today&#8221;.  Under the terms of the settlement, the wife agreed to receive 30% of the net proceeds of sale of the company, whenever that took place, together with further assets including &#163;10 million in cash and property.  As a result of various press reports, and before a consent order was sealed, she became aware that the company was being actively prepared for an IPO.  It was anticipated that this would value the company at a figure significantly in excess of the valuations prepared for the purposes of the court hearing.  The wife immediately invited the judge not to seal the consent order but to resume the hearing in respect of her application for financial remedy orders.  The judge found that the husband&#8217;s evidence had been dishonest and that, had he disclosed the true state of affairs, the court would have been like to adjourn the wife&#8217;s claims to establish whether the sale of the company was likely to have gone ahead.  By the time the hearing resumed, the IPO had not gone ahead and was no longer in prospect.  The judge declined to set aside the consent order on the ground that he would not have made a substantially different order, applying the principle set out above in <span style="font-style:italic">Livesey (formerly Jenkins) v Jenkins</span>.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Livesey</span>, the House of Lords had made it clear that the parties&#8217; duty of full and frank disclosure continued after they had reached agreement on their financial arrangements.

The wife in <span style="font-style:italic">Livesey</span> had failed to disclose her engagement to another man before the agreement was put into effect by means of a sealed court order.  This was not a case where she had deliberately set out to deceive either the husband or the court.  As Lord Hailsham observed, &#8220;I do not think she was fully aware (though she should have been) of the vital nature of the information she was witholding&#8230;&#8221; (p 430).  Thus, there was neither a misrepresentation nor deliberate non-disclosure. </p>

It does not, however, follow that the parties&#8217; agreement is not a sine qua non of a consent order.  Quite the reverse: the court cannot make a consent order without the valid consent of the parties. If there is a reason which vitiates a party&#8217;s consent, then there may also be a good reason to set aside the consent order.  The only question is whether the court has any choice in the matter.</p>

			<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Although not strictly applicable in matrimonial cases, the analogy of the remedies for misrepresentation and non-disclosure in contract may be instructive.  At common law, the general effect of any misrepresentation, whether fraudulent, negligent or innocent, or of non-disclosure where there was a duty to disclose, was to render a contract voidable at the instance of a party who had thereby been induced to enter into it.  This has now been modified by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1967/7" uk:canonical="1967 c. 7" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Misrepresentation Act 1967</ref>, which empowers the court to impose an award of damages in lieu of rescission for negligent or innocent misrepresentation.  This does not, however, apply in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation, where there is no power to impose an award of damages in lieu.  The victim always has the right to rescind unless one of the general bars to rescission has arisen.</p>

			<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no need for us to decide in this case whether the greater flexibility which the court now has in cases of innocent or negligent misrepresentation in contract should also apply to innocent or negligent misrepresentation or non-disclosure in consent orders whether in civil or in family cases.  It is clear from <span style="font-style:italic">Dietz </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Livesey</span> that the misrepresentation or non-disclosure must be material to the decision that the court made at the time.  But this is a case of fraud. It would be extraordinary if the victim of a fraudulent misrepresentation, which had led her to compromise her claim to financial remedies in a matrimonial case,<span style="font-style:italic"/>were in a worse position than the victim of a fraudulent misrepresentation in an ordinary contract case, including a contract to settle a civil claim.  As was held in <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v Kay </span>(1859) VII HLC 749, a party who has practised deception with a view to a particular end, which has been attained by it, cannot be allowed to deny its materiality.  Furthermore, the court is in no position to protect the victim from the deception, or to conduct its statutory duties properly, because the court too has been deceived.  In my view, Briggs LJ was correct in the first of the three reasons he gave for setting aside the order<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="12">

But in my view, the burden of satisfying the court of that must lie with the perpetrator of the fraud.  It was wrong in this case to place upon the victim the burden of showing that it would have made a difference.</p>

			<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In my view, the second and third reasons given by Briggs LJ for setting aside the order flowed from the first.  Sir Hugh Bennett had been clear that the misrepresentation and non-disclosure as to the husband&#8217;s plans for the company was highly material to the decision made in July 2012.  Indeed, it could not have been anything else.  It had coloured both valuers&#8217; approach to the valuation of the husband&#8217;s shareholding.  That in turn had coloured the wife&#8217;s approach to the proportionality of the balance struck between her present share in the liquid assets and her future share in the value of the husband&#8217;s shareholding.  Sir Hugh may have been right to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that had he known the truth then he would have waited to see what transpired.  But in doing so, he would have had to bear in mind the husband&#8217;s ability to manipulate the timing and manner of any offer to the public in a way which suited him best.  Be that as it may, it is enough that Sir Hugh would not have made the order he did when he did had the truth been known.</p>

			<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It being clear that the order should have been set aside, it is also clear that Sir Hugh should not have gone on to re-make the decision then and there on the basis of the evidence then before him.  The wife was entitled to re-open the case, when she might seek to negotiate a new settlement or a rehearing of her claims when all the relevant facts were known.  Thus, in my view, Briggs LJ was also correct in the third reason he gave for allowing the appeal.  The wife had been deprived of a full and fair hearing of her claims. &#8230;&#8221; </p>

In making his financial presentation to his wife and the court, Mr Gohil, a former solicitor, had asserted that all of his ostensible wealth represented assets which he held on behalf of his clients.  He produced a balance sheet which he said was representative of his personal assets.  Once his liabilities were set off against those assets, he claimed to have a net deficit of just over &#163;310,000.  Despite misgivings that her husband had not disclosed the full extent of his wealth, Mrs Gohil was persuaded to settle her financial claims at an FDR hearing.  The deal was struck in 2004.  Under its terms, he was to pay her a lump sum payment in full and final settlement of her claims (which he eventually paid) together with periodical payments (which he stopped paying after about four years).  The consent order which was approved by the court contained a recital recording the wife&#8217;s suspicions but stating that she had agreed to compromise her claims in order to achieve finality.  Some three years later, in 2007, the wife applied to set aside the consent order on the basis of Mr Gohil&#8217;s fraudulent non-disclosure.  He was charged with serious money-laundering offences dating back to mid-2005.  A period of imprisonment followed his subsequent conviction.  It was evidence which had emerged during the criminal proceedings which provided Mrs Gohil with the material on which she made her application to set aside the matrimonial consent order.  Following a lengthy contested hearing Moylan J set aside the 2004 consent order on the basis of findings that Mr Gohil had been guilty of serious non-disclosure and the result would undoubtedly have been different had the court been in possession of the full facts.  Mrs Gohil was permitted to rely upon the fresh evidence she sought to adduce on the basis that she had satisfied the well-known criteria set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1954] 1 WLR 1489" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1954">[1954] 1 WLR 1489</ref>.</p>

Leading counsel for Mr Gohil had relied on a recent Court of Appeal decision in a civil case called <span style="font-style:italic">Hayward v Zurich Insurance PLC </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2015/327" uk:canonical="[2015] EWCA Civ 327" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWCA Civ 327</ref>.  The claimant alleged that he had sustained an injury at work as a result of the negligence of his employers.  Their defence included an allegation that he had not been truthful and had exaggerated the extent of his injury.  The claim was settled.  Some five years later, the insurers received fresh evidence that the claimant had in fact made a full and complete recovery before settlement was achieved.  They sought to reclaim most of the award in an action for deceit.  The Court of Appeal held that their claim must fail.  Having pleaded in the original action that the claimant&#8217;s presentation of his injuries had been dishonest, they could not be said to have relied on that presentation when they decided to enter into a settlement with him.  Permission has been given to the insurers to appeal that decision in the Supreme Court.</p>

However, as the non-disclosure alleged by the wife in this case is said to be intentional, then, if there was such non-disclosure, the 2004 order should be set aside, unless the husband could satisfy the court that the 2004 order would have been agreed and made in any event &#8211; see per Lady Hale in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Sharland v Sharland </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2015/60" uk:canonical="[2015] UKSC 60" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] UKSC 60</ref>, paras 29-33.  In other words, where a party&#8217;s non-disclosure was inadvertent, there is no presumption that it was material and the onus is on the other party to show that proper disclosure would, on the balance of probabilities, have led to a different order; whereas where a party&#8217;s non-disclosure was intentional, it is deemed to be material, so that it is presumed that proper disclosure would have led to a different order, unless that party can show, on the balance of probabilities, that it would not have done so.&#8221;</span></p>

		<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The issue of whether or not there has been non-disclosure is a question of fact which involves an evaluative assessment of the available admissible evidence: see para 49 of <span style="font-style:italic">Gohil </span>per Lord Neuberger. Part of that evaluation involves an assessment of the degree of culpability which should properly be attributed to the non-disclosing spouse.

			<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">&#8220;During the course of argument there has been some debate as to whether a distinction is to be drawn between the various vitiating factors including: fraud, mistake, misrepresentation, duress and material non-disclosure.  The authorities suggest that in other fields fraud stands alone, such is the public interest in its suppression.  However the duty of full and frank disclosure that operates in ancillary relief is distinctive.  In almost every case the application to reopen will rest on an allegation of material non-disclosure.  Litigants are invariably informed of the duty. I find it hard to conceive of non-disclosure, material because of its significant scale, that was unwitting or unintentional.  At some level of consciousness the party in breach of the duty acts in the hope or with the intention of diminishing the other party&#8217;s allocation.  Thus differing degrees of culpability depend upon either the scale of the undisclosed assets or the lengths to which the offender has gone.  But distinctions important in other fields, such as the distinction between innocent and false misrepresentation, do not seem to me to have much validity in ancillary relief litigation.  In practice there is probably but a single vice, namely intentional non-disclosure achieved either by active concealment or passive failure to mention.&#8221; see para [44](ii) in <span style="font-style:italic">Shaw v Shaw </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 2 FLR 1204" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 2 FLR 1204</ref>, 1217.</p>

The case concerned a situation where a husband had failed to disclose during the course of negotiations which led to a consent order that he was in discussion with new employers in relation to a position which would have provided him with a significantly higher level of remuneration.

She is concerned not only for her personal reputation but for the consequences and potential impact upon her commercial standing in the business community.  In this context, it is important to remember that the subject matter of the allegations of non-disclosure in this case go to the manner in which she was operating her business in circumstances where, in addition to her duty of disclosure to H and the court, she had contractual obligations of confidentiality to B Ltd and its board of directors.   Very frequently in cases involving applications for financial remedy orders such as these, courts will be dealing with individuals who are daily at the centre of sophisticated corporate activities which will inevitably involve commercially sensitive information and decision-making which has, or may have, the capacity to influence share value in the wider sense.  Such is the modern coal face of today&#8217;s entrepreneurial world. Are all these dealings to be exposed to the glare of forensic scrutiny on the simple basis that the individual concerned is engaged in contested matrimonial proceedings ?  At one end of the scale, the answer will be obvious.  Even where the answer is less obvious, the duty of confidence which exists between the court and the parties as established in <span style="font-style:italic">Clibbery v Allen </span>will usually mean that disclosure is the safest route in cases of doubt.  The information remains entirely private and confidential as between the parties and the court and the party making the disclosure will not be exposed to the risk that any order flowing from an agreement or court order made at the conclusion of contested proceedings may be liable to be set aside in the future.  In cases of extreme commercial sensitivity, the information can, if the court considers it necessary, be protected by means of an injunction.</p>

I have to look at the reality of the situation: per Glidewell LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Thomas v Thomas </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 668" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 668</ref> at 678 and Moylan J in <span style="font-style:italic">SK v WL Ancillary Relief: Post-Separation Accrual) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 FLR 1471" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 FLR 1471</ref> at 1475.  In my judgment, the spotlight in this case is properly focused on the First Appointment on 6 February 2012, the disclosure which was then available to the parties and the court, and the negotiations which took place on that day.  Both parties arrived at court with first class teams of lawyers.  Each had come armed with lengthy questionnaires and schedules of issues which might have suggested that any possibility of settlement on that day was remote.  However, the parties took a view and decided to call a halt to the litigation.  I have already alluded to the fact that one of W&#8217;s principal objectives was to secure the return to her control of the shares in B Ltd which H then held.  She herself accepts as much.  For her part she was willing to abandon her arguments about the extent of the marital acquest and her right to a share in that.  It had been a very short marriage which had ended in the midst of much rancour and unhappiness.  Each wanted to move on without the prospect of lengthy and expensive litigation hanging over their heads.</p>

All the evidence I have read and heard points to the fact that, despite the fact that formal terms had not been agreed, Odey was likely to have supported B Ltd in meeting the ongoing costs of its contractual obligations had it won that contract.  </p>

Mr Fletcher&#8217;s evidence is that Odey received a share certificate in return for what it considered to be an equity investment in the company.  Professor Kay confirmed that to be the case despite the fact that he had been unaware of that fact at the time and the shares were not then registered in Odey&#8217;s name.  Whatever W&#8217;s view may have been about the ability of Odey to demand repayment of its &#8220;investment&#8221;, she was clearly anxious to avoid that possibility and accepts that neither she nor B Ltd&#8217;s board of directors did anything to crystallise the position in relation to those funds to the possible detriment of the company.  Happily, matters were resolved and, by February 2013 when Odey signed B Ltd&#8217;s Deed of Adherence, the shares were formally allocated.  There had never been a formal loan agreement between Odey and B Ltd and, as W herself confirms, the discussions with Odey which took place prior to October 2011 when the cash injection was received envisaged that there would be an equity investment.  That is the nature of the transaction which the Chairman of Odey thought he was undertaking at the time.</p>

Throughout the course of the negotiations which took place on 6 February 2011, H remained in ignorance of that development.  He was unaware of both the investment / cash injection and the identity of the investor.  He says that had he been aware of those facts, he would never have agreed to surrender his shares as part of the overall deal which was agreed on that occasion.  W points to the fact that the so-called &#8220;Odey effect&#8221; is pure illusion in terms of its impact on the fortunes of B Ltd.  She relies on the hard figures represented in the company&#8217;s accounts.  B Ltd was a loss-making making entity in 2011 and it has yet to make a profit to this day.  Nevertheless, the shares in the company have continued to rise in value over the currency of this litigation.  That fact, in itself, cannot be a reason for setting aside the consent order since the focus of the court&#8217;s enquiry must be on the extent to which W had complied with her disclosure obligations at the time agreement was reached.</p>

In her Form E, W had attributed to her own shares a value which would suggest the company was worth no more than &#163;&#189; million in very broad terms.  In the weeks between signing off on her Form E and the negotiations at the First Appointment, no further representations had been made which might have alerted H to the investment / cash injection into the company by Odey.  It is perfectly true that there was no legal or other requirement on W during that window to make any such representations or to update her disclosure.  She is quite entitled to rely on her legitimate expectation at the time that any further issues or questions going to valuation would be the subject of further directions at the First Appointment.  However, in my view, her duty in relation to disclosure continued as the day spent in negotiations progressed.  It would have become clear by a certain point in those negotiations that the court was not going to be asked to make further directions since the agreement, once approved by the court, would operate to halt the litigation in its tracks.</p>

She says that the figure of &#163;5 million in paragraph 5(i)(a) of the consent order (the notional disregard in relation to calculating the sum due to H in the event of a sale) was a reflection of the higher value which H had attributed in his Form E to his own shares in B Ltd, a position which H accepts.</p>

But I am not prepared to go as far as finding that this was a deliberate fraud or deception perpetrated by W.  Having listened to her evidence very carefully over the course of more than two days in the witness box, I am persuaded that she believed at the time that she had properly complied with her obligations of disclosure in the representations she made in her Form E.   I am not prepared to find on the basis of the evidence before me that settlement was achieved at the First Appointment because of her anxiety to rush through an agreement so as to avoid having to disclose any further information about B Ltd as was suggested to her by Mr Yates.  In my view, it was incumbent upon her to disclose the existence of Odey&#8217;s involvement with, and financial support for, the company prior to allowing H to commit to their agreement in ignorance of that fact.  But I absolve her of any deliberate attempt to mislead him or the court on that occasion.</p>

		<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Where I believe W&#8217;s conduct does properly attract censure is her response to the enquiries which were subsequently raised on behalf of H.   Much time and expense would have been avoided had she responded openly and at an early stage to his solicitors&#8217; questions.  I accept that their initial letter sought the answers to a significant number of questions and required her to produce documentation which was confidential to the company.  Nevertheless, despite the constraints under which she was put by the demands of the B Ltd board and her obligations of confidentiality, her responses were, in my judgment, unhelpful at best and misleading at worst.  I understand that, having concluded their agreement, she was extremely reluctant to become further embroiled with H in yet another round of litigation which was likely to be expensive and time-consuming (as it has proved to be).  However, the rearguard action which she fought over many months to suppress his challenge to the consent order was, in my judgment, misplaced and gave rise to some exquisitely nuanced presentations which have not withstood the forensic scrutiny to which they were exposed.  I find that she placed undue reliance on the terms of her employment contract in order to avoid some of the more penetrating questions which were asked of her.  In this respect it is not without significance that her contract specifically provided for the provision of confidential information <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;where this is required by law&#8221;</span>.  Once Parker J had ordered her to provide the information, there could have been no justification for anything other than a full and frank exposition of the position.</p>

The same letter spoke of her hope that Odey <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">would</span> make a proposal but what Odey was then being asked to do was to provide financial support in the event that the bid for the Ministry of Justice contract was won.  It specifically stated, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;There has been no injection of cash&#8221;</span>.  That, in my view, was thoroughly misleading as even W herself accepts.  I do not regard as a sufficient excuse her explanation that she did not read the letter with sufficient care before it was sent out.  As I have seen for myself, W is a woman who has a meticulous eye for detail and who is careful in the extreme about her choice of words.</p>

She further denied that any legal documentation had been prepared or exchanged in relation to any investment.  We know now from the evidence adduced during the hearing that a share certificate had been issued to Odey at the time it made funds of &#163;3.5 million available to B Ltd.  I accept that Professor Kay did not know about that fact until very recently.  Whether or not W knew is unclear to me but someone at the board&#8217;s direction must have dealt with the administration and issue of that share certificate even if the shareholding was not formally registered until February 2013.</p>

I accept that W had no part in drafting that letter but she produced it as part of her response to H&#8217;s allegation that she had not made full and frank disclosure of all the circumstances surrounding Odey&#8217;s involvement with B Ltd.

There was further reference to an approved share option scheme for company employees but nothing more to shed light on the true state of affairs which were then the subject of enquiry in the context of this application.  The first open admission of an investment by Odey in B Ltd did not come until the dissemination of the note prepared by Mr Erskine of counsel for the hearing on 22 May 2013.</p>

		<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Finally, I have stepped back and asked myself whether W&#8217;s evident reluctance to disclose the full circumstances of Odey&#8217;s financial relationship with B Ltd once the challenge was raised by H should cause me to reconsider my finding that she did not have any dishonest intent at the time of the First Appointment.  It was a great shame that W did not respond with a full narrative explanation at the time she was asked about the article in The Daily Telegraph.  What I find to be her actively misleading responses in subsequent documents have led in no small part to a ten day final hearing with a further hearing to deal with the judgments of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Sharland </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Gohill</span>.  I am prepared on balance to accept that she was desperate to disengage from further litigation with H; that fact can be collected very easily from the numerous attempts which have been made to settle this case from the foot of the open offers which have been exchanged.  As the situation in relation to Odey&#8217;s investment in B Ltd crystallized in February 2013 when the company signed the shareholder&#8217;s Deed of Adherence, she probably felt the tide pulling against her.  H was to issue his application for disclosure against B Ltd within less than three months.  The cat was seemingly out of the bag by the time of the hearing before Parker J in May 2013.  Notwithstanding all these matters, I do not believe that W had a guilty intent to deceive either H or the court at the time of the First Appointment in February 2012.  Whatever occurred subsequently is not sufficient, in my judgment, to contaminate my initial finding or to cause me to reflect on its fundamental soundness. </p>

		<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">I have no hesitation in finding that non-disclosure to be material.  First, the order was presented to the court as a consent order to which both parties had given their full agreement.  Its terms brought to an end significant legal rights which each had against the other to bring financial claims and seek orders.  Those rights were dismissed by the court in order to give effect to the clean break which each wished to achieve.  H was deprived of the opportunity of deciding whether or not to agree to the terms proposed on the basis of a fully informed decision.  He was not provided with the disclosure of information which he says would have been highly material to his decision to accept or reject the terms proposed, or to insist upon a renegotiation of those terms.  In such circumstances, it is difficult to see how he can be said to have given full consent. </p>

		<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Secondly, his evidence throughout was that he would not have agreed the package of terms reflected in the consent order had he realised the potential value of his shares.  I accept his evidence on this point.  It seems to me that, in this context, it matters not whether the Odey investment in B Ltd had been &#8220;transformational&#8221; in the window between October 2011 and February 2012.  In his eyes, as an experienced venture capitalist, Odey&#8217;s involvement had the potential, if not the guarantee, to make his personal investment in B Ltd significantly more valuable than the notional figure he had presented in his Form E.  Because of W&#8217;s far greater holding of shares, it also had the potential to increase her personal wealth to a point where the net benefit passing from H to W under the terms of the consent order became an unfair adjustment to their respective capital positions.  That factor alone is one which would have had to be weighed by the court in deciding whether or not to make an order in the terms sought.</p>

		<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In my judgment, the &#8216;anti-embarrassment clause&#8217; is not a sufficient defence to the failure to disclose.  It provided that H might benefit during a limited period of time to any uplift in value secured by W over and above &#163;11.59 per share in the event she were to dispose of her interest in B Ltd.  Any such uplift over and above that &#8220;floor&#8221; would be shared by H.  That clause was part and parcel of the agreement they reached but I do not accept that its limited reach was intended to provide W with a shield to any set aside application in the circumstances which have since occurred.  If H was to elect to limit his recovery in respect of the shares to this extent and for this period, it follows that he was entitled to make that election from a position of full information.  He did not have that information and, in my judgment, this clause stands or falls as an integral part of the consent order.  </p>

		<p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">In my judgment, H has discharged that burden without difficulty.  Disclosure was, in my view, essential in order to enable the court to assess what each party&#8217;s financial position was likely to be not only in the immediate aftermath of the making of any order but in terms of the court&#8217;s review of the foreseeable future.  Odey had, by the admission of its chairman, acquired an equity stake in B Ltd in return for its &#163;3.5 million of funding.  It had undertaken due diligence as part of its decision to invest and that due diligence had persuaded Odey to invest at a price of slightly more than &#163;33 per share.  H&#8217;s evidence was that that sort of bench-mark valuation would be highly persuasive in terms of share value to an experienced equity investor.  Given his many years of professional standing in this field, it seems to me that I can properly attach significant weight to that evidence.  I accept that Odey was a &#8220;major player&#8221; in its field and it is highly unlikely that, having completed the process of due diligence, the company would have been persuaded to invest at an artificially inflated price at the request of a struggling young technology company which had yet to make a profit.  That information was plainly relevant to outcome and is thus material in the context of the present set aside application.</p>

Her case in relation to H&#8217;s own alleged non-disclosure and her entitlement to a share of the marital acquest (whatever it might have been determined to be) was never tested, far less adjudicated upon.  I am certainly not encouraging any proliferation of the issues in this case but, in my view, the potential undervalue of both parties&#8217; shares in B Ltd is a fundamental obstacle to the integrity of the 2012 consent order.</p>
