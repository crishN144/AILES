I just kind of was like really sad at seeing&#8230;how he was like hitting her all the time. So, I built up the courage to tell him to stop. And then he shouted at me about it, and said, &#8216;If you were my kid, I would have hit you or something.&#8217; And then there was this other time, it was about erm Easter time, because there was these decorations about&#8230;[&#8216;T&#8217;] asked for  a chocolate and he hit him, he landed on the floor near the front door&#8230;He slapped him across the back of the head, he fell on the floor&#8230;he was just crying&#8230;that really hurt them&#8230;he used to like shout at [&#8216;U&#8217;] like a lot like all the time&#8230;he used to just call her lazy all the time and err yea he&#8217;d just be horrible to her. Like shout at her and that lot&#8230;there's been incidents where I've done stuff like that are wrong, like, years ago. He&#8217;s just bring it up in front of other people, and he'd usually just like shout at me sometimes&#8230;he was angry at me about something. He basically threw my phone onto the sofa, got one of the baby&#8217;s toy buses and smashed it against the phone...smashed up my phone with it&#8230;It makes me feel sad&#8230;I like got a mixture of anger and like sadness mixed with it. Like sad about like how I see him hitting and I haven&#8217;t done anything about it&#8230;there was one time when I told him to stop, it&#8217;s like&#8230;I see him hit the kids like a few times, like why have I not done anything about it? I feel that guilt as well&#8230;for like ages like I, I was, I was actually really scared of him when I  saw what he did to the kids&#8230;I was more scared that he was gonna hit my sister [&#8216;U&#8217;], or my Mum&#8230;I was more scared he was gonna hit one of the people in the house, like obviously I was a bit fearing like is he gonna hit me soon or something but it was more about if he hit my other family members&#8230;like every few days or something or every like couple of days like hit the kids, if they did something&#8230;he said to me, he feels sorry for my dad for having like me as a son&#8230;He&#8217;s like, just angry&#8230;he&#8217;d usually get quite angry at them&#8230;it was usually when mum went out&#8230;he would usually like hit them or something&#8230;it just made me sad like how someone could say that to me.  Or something like, how can someone say that?...He&#8217;d used to, like, hit [&#8216;C&#8217;] when he had his nappy changed when he was whinging cause [&#8216;C&#8217;]&#8217;s a bit different to like the other ones. He doesn't really understand&#8230;about stuff. So yeah, he'd usually start whinging if he had his nappy changed. He'd usually, like, slap him or something&#8230;At the dinner table&#8230;there&#8217;s like only&#8230;a couple of times when he had to feed him. If [&#8216;C&#8217;]&#8230;messed about or something, he&#8217;d hit him as well, he'd get violent at him. And [&#8216;C&#8217;], at this, at this point was like, he didn&#8217;t understand what he was doing and it wasn't really helping him at all&#8230;I found&#8230;if we wanted to hug [the children] or something, or pick &#8216;em up, they would like flinch if we raised our hand &#8216;cause he used to hit them so they'd usually like flinch when he&#8217;s hit them. So, they obviously were frightened of it when someone raised their hand, so that's what he's done to them.&#8221;</span></p>

In determining that a separate Fact Finding Hearing was necessary, the allocated Judge gave further directions to identify that only those allegations which are necessary to support the processes should be listed for determination. Directions were given by the allocated Judge for the provision by the parties of a schedule of allegations, narrative witness statements and disclosure of documents, including evidence held by the police. A decision was taken in the course of the proceedings not to permit the older, non-subject children to give oral evidence in Court.

The Court had the benefit of receiving written submissions from Counsel for each party for which the Court is grateful. It is neither possible nor necessary for the Court to address in this judgment each piece of evidence read or heard nor to address each submissions made.

There is only one civil standard of proof, namely that the occurrence of the fact in issue must be proved to have been more probable than not. Neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the seriousness of the consequences makes any difference to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the facts. If the Court finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place. If the Court finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. Where a fact is required to be proved, a 'fact in issue,' the Court must decide whether or not it happened. There is no room for a finding that it&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">might&#160;</span><span style="font-size:11pt">have happened. The law operates a binary system. The fact either happened or it did not. If the Court is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, the fact is treated as not having happened.

This was due to [the father] frequently putting his hands around my neck very tightly and applying pressure. Although I have clearly been crying, I have not told [him] to stop but I have also not consented to this...in March 2019 I was having sexual intercourse with [the father]&#8230;during this  he has grabbed my neck firmly with both hands and squeezed hard for around 4-5 seconds&#8230;this restricted my breathing and caused me to feel a numbing sensation in my face&#8230;I was crying when this happened as it was causing me so much discomfort. It is my honest belief that if he held me down any longer then I could have died. At the time I accepted this as anormal part of the relationship. He would often pinch me, slap me and pull my hair and I would often have bruising on me. My family often commented on this bruising&#8230;on reflection, I believe that [he] would use sexual intercourse as a way of exerting his domination and power over me. On every occasion that I had sexual intercourse with [him] I saw it as one of my chores such as ironing and cooking and I felt as if I had to have sexual intercourse with [him] as it was my duty and due to my Multiple Sclerosis (&#8220;MS&#8221;) it often feels painful. I informed [him] of this and that I did not enjoy it mainly because of my MS. He was initially upset by this and said that he felt neglected by me.&#8221;</span></p>

[The father] has returned home from work at this time after leaving at 0800hrs and has started a verbal conversation with me inside the bedroom and has shut the door behind him. He immediately told me to sit down, and I sat at the end of the bed. He was standing in front of me and pointed at me and said, &#8216;You&#8217;ve been cheating on me with the builder.&#8217; [The father] looked visibly angry at this point. He then pulled out a silver Dictaphone device out of his pocket with his right hand and played what sounded like a recording of me breathing heavily. He said &#8216;I&#8217;ve got proof. I&#8217;ve got the recording. I put in the room last night. I&#8217;ve been recording you for several weeks&#8217;&#8230;[He] has instantly jumped on top of me and has put both of his hands around my neck. There was not pressure being applied but it felt uncomfortable. [He] continued to shout in my face and his face was around 10cm from my face and I could feel his spit hitting my face as he shouted. I have then bit him on the nose for my own safety to get him off of me as I was trying to protect myself and this has caused him then to apply further pressure to my neck. [He] has then jumped up out of anger&#8230;His elbow then struck my mouth and went inside it. This made my lip bleed and caused swelling and a small lump. I then bit his elbow trying to protect myself. [He] has then thrown me on to the floor to the left of the bed and has then lent over me and has held my neck with his right hand and punched my right eye with his left hand which was clenched into a fist. I know that [he] used a lot of force as it caused me an extreme amount of pain and nearly 2 weeks on I am still in a lot of discomfort. I was kicking my legs out in desperation to get away from [him] and managed to stand up. At this point, [he] threw me into the door frame forcefully to our ensuite bathroom door frame. My head struck the door frame and I fell to the floor. At this point I did not feel that I would be able to stand up as I was in so much pain. I felt a sharp throbbing to my head and felt dazed however I did not lose consciousness. [He] has then got hold of me again and I recall his hand being around my throat again. [He] has then gone to swing at me again however did not make contact as at this point my eldest son [&#8216;D&#8217;] and my eldest daughter [&#8216;U&#8217;] had entered the room due to hearing the commotion. I noticed that [&#8216;U&#8217;] was in the room too and [&#8216;D&#8217;] immediately ran at [the father] as his fist went into the air and pushed him to get him off me. [&#8216;T&#8217;] has also then run outside of the bedroom door, following his siblings but never entered the bedroom. The children were all shouting at [the father] that he was being ridiculous and that I had been with them the whole night previously. Shortly after this happened [the father] has then run downstairs towards the back garden, and I threw his keys and his vape outside of the house on to the patio. The verbal argument continued at this point in the garden. At this point [he] has </span></p>

I was made aware of this because my eldest daughter's father also works at the garage, and he informed me of this over the phone at the time. I was also told that [the father] was telling people that I had attacked him and had inflicted injuries to myself.

I couldn't accept that I had just been the victim of what I now know to be domestic violence or that I had been assaulted...[he] showed no remorse at the time towards me despite me crying hysterically in front of him and screaming in pain and anger. I honestly believe that had the children of not entered the room and intervened at that time that I would be left with much more serious injuries. I was fearful for my life at the time. I then noticed swelling around my eye and forehead within an hour and bruising around my left eye appeared not long after this, the lip was starting to swell as well&#8230;I am now fearful for my safety because although [he] was initially displaying what I would deem as violent behaviour during sexual intercourse, he has now assaulted me in a normal setting outside of sexual intercourse leaving me with visible injuries. I believe that if I was to still be living with [him] and had not ended the relationship, he would have assault me again and that it could cause me even more serious injuries. At no point has [he] showed any remorse for assaulting me and leaving me with visible injuries. [He] is aware that I suffer with diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis. I had an MRI the day before this incident, and he is aware that I have a very fragile skull and that one knock to the head can be very serious. He is also aware that I was going through an MS relapse at that time and I was very weakened by the steroid treatment that I was taking at the time.&#8221;</span></p>

She records in her statement, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">I suddenly had an episode of paralysis. I couldn&#8217;t feel from the chest down, stand without aid or falling, use of my left arm/hand.  I was admitted to [hospital] for testing.  I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.  After steroid treatment and physiotherapy, I was discharged with a walking frame as some sensation had come back. It was agreed that [the father] would take care of me at home with home visits from medical professionals. Ideally, I would have gone to a rehabilitation but this was the height of Covid and the concern of me catching an infection after steroid treatment was too great. On my first night home, [the father] laid me on the sofa and went for a shower. I cried, I was devastated at the diagnosis of an incurable illness that can be so disabling.   The uncertainty of the unknown future and what impact this might have on my family, my children and their care as well as my relationship.  I didn&#8217;t know how much I could recover between relapses and was deeply scared. I really wanted a hug and reassurance, comfort and love from my partner which was the opposite of what I was experiencing which was cold and uncaring. [The father] pestered me for sex saying &#8216;I haven&#8217;t had it is ages&#8217;, I said &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to, it hurts when you touch my torso or arm.  It feels like I am being burnt&#8217;.  MS is a nerve condition and causes burning sensations. I added that I have numbness down below too.  I thought he understood that.  He seemed sympathetic. He helped me up to bed.  I was naked in bed as clothing made my skin uncomfortable.  Once in bed, he was pestering me again, trying to make me feel guilty. I reminded him &#8216;It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s that I&#8217;m in pain and don&#8217;t want to be hurt&#8217;.  In bed, [he] went to put his arm around my torso area. I was laying on my left side. I asked him to move his arm as it felt like fire.  He leaned over to kiss me, I kissed him back and said &#8216;I don&#8217;t want this to lead to sex and it always does.&#8217;  He said &#8216;he hadn&#8217;t had it in ages and won&#8217;t last long&#8217;.  He wouldn&#8217;t give up.  I gave up explaining why.  He put his penis inside me and had sex with me. I was crying in pain from my torso area where he was holding me.  I couldn&#8217;t feel much down below. There was no violence on this occasion.  Our 10 month old son was sleeping in the cot beside our bed so I was aware of this and stayed quiet. He ejaculated and it was over quickly. I lay there silent after.  He tried to talk to me but I ignored him.  He gave up and went to sleep. This was rape. I thought that because I hadn&#8217;t fought him off then it wasn&#8217;t rape. I now understand that this was and he should&#8217;ve respected my wishes at the time and that I didn&#8217;t want to on that particular occasion. I was shocked that he could do this to me when he could see how poorly I was.  I thought he would take care of me. I felt vulnerable and reliant on him as I was now facing a life with an unpredictable disability. I thought I would never walk far without an aid again.  I wished I was back in hospital but didn&#8217;t want to be without my children.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The mother&#8217;s evidence was clear and compelling in respect of each of the core issues. The mother gave her evidence in in a direct manner. The mother was extensively challenged under cross-examination. She maintained a consistent account answering questions without evasion. Further, her oral evidence was supported by documentary evidence where available.  The mother did not report each allegation to the police at the relevant time. The mother reported events to the police after receiving emotional support and encouragement from her aunt. The mother&#8217;s reports to the police were not made by way of a single disclosure The allegations came out over a series of interviews. This is not a case, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, of faulty recollection or confusion at a time of stress. The mother was clear in her oral evidence that she made various reports over a period of time to different police officers from different investigation teams, whose focus was the investigation of different events, including the assault on the mother in August 2022 and subsequently the investigation into the father&#8217;s mistreatment of the children. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the assertions made by the father that the mother has added to her account over time to bolster her claim against him lacks in merit. This is not a case, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, where the mother&#8217;s evidence has been undermined by any significant inaccuracy or mistake of recollection. Further, this is not a case, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, where the mother&#8217;s evidence has been impacted negatively by the effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory. Further, this Court takes into consideration the traumatic and emotional nature of giving evidence before a Court. This was plainly a difficult experience for this mother who was at times tearful and visibly distressed both when giving her oral evidence to the Court and hearing the oral evidence of the father. In making that observation and in appraising the witnesses in the emotionally charged atmosphere of this contested family dispute, this Court warns itself to guard against an assessment solely by virtue of the parents&#8217; behaviour in the witness box and the Court expressly indicates that it has done so.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:11pt">The Court further has the benefit of considering evidence by way of video recorded Achieving Best Evidence police interviews of the older non-subject child, the detail of which is summarised in the opening paragraphs of this judgment. Both children were the subject of a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Re W</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> consideration by the allocated Judge with the benefit of an analysis by Cafcass. The allocated Judge determined that neither child should give oral evidence at this Fact Finding Hearing. No application was made for permission to appeal the decision of the allocated Judge. This Court approaches the evidence of the non-subject children with caution, mindful of the fact that no party has had the opportunity to cross-examine the children. Further, the Court acknowledges that &#8216;U&#8217; and &#8216;D&#8217; are not children of this father. They are likely to have loyalty towards their mother. They have lived with her as their primary carer throughout their lives.  This Court concludes, nevertheless, that the evidence of the non-subject children is reliable. Their evidence given in interviews with the police was detailed and convincing. The account given by each child is consistent with the account given by the other child and with the evidence of their mother on all material key issues. Whilst the father asserts that the non-subject children are lying and there has been collusion, there is no reliable evidence in support of that assertion. Indeed, there are incidents involving the younger children which the mother freely indicates she did not witness directly but those incidents were witnessed by one or both of the elder children. Whilst critical of the accounts given by the non-subject children, the father accepted in his oral evidence that he had not viewed the police ABE interviews of either child, despite having the time and opportunity to do so. In this Court&#8217;s judgment, the non-subject children have behaved courageously in intervening when witnessing their mother being physically attacked by the father. Furthermore, the non-subject children have each bravely endured the ordeal of being subjected to a police interview in the knowledge that they may be required to give evidence against the father.</span></p>

The sentence was increased on appeal to 170 hours of unpaid work.

Further, the father accepts editing the recordings. It is evident that the various statements given by the father to the Court are not consistent. When it was put to the father that he was invading the mother&#8217;s privacy by recording the mother covertly in the bedroom and living areas, the father told the Court, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">I wasn&#8217;t invading anything. It&#8217;s the same way someone could record me on a dashcam.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt">   The father thereafter accepted &#8216;tracking&#8217; the mother, telling the Court in his oral evidence, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">I did track her because I was suspicious.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> He accepted going to the location where he had tracked the mother, without calling her to check upon her safety. When it was put to him that his behaviour was controlling, the father then told the Court, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">I didn&#8217;t track her</span><span style="font-size:11pt">.&#8221; Once again, the father gave directly inconsistent and contradictory evidence. It was put to the father that he had been dishonest with the police. The father told the Court, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">I&#8217;ve not read all the way back. Yes, we did have a tracker.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> The father denied telling the mother what she could wear. He then proceeded to accept under cross-examination that he had told the mother, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">You need to put something appropriate on&#8230;I told her what she was wearing was inappropriate.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> Further, the father accepted in oral evidence being outside the property at 3am, three days after assaulting the mother. He told the Court, &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">It was our house&#8230;the intention was to collect my stuff.&#8221;</span></p>

The evidence of both parties in this case suggests that both parties consented to an app being downloaded to their respective devices so that they could monitor the movements of the other party.  The evidence in this case leads the Court to the conclusion, however, that the father used the tracking app on the mother&#8217;s mobile device as part of a pattern of behaviour designed to </span><span style="font-size:11pt">deprive the mother of the means needed for her independence. The Court rejects the father&#8217;s assertion that he was monitoring the mother&#8217;s movements through concern for her wellbeing. His assertion in this regard was entirely undermined by his oral evidence when he accepted that he made no attempt to contact the mother by telephone or message to check upon her welfare. Further, the father&#8217;s use of the tracking app must be seen in the context of his admitted use of covert recording devices around the home, including the bedroom and living areas. The audio recordings were made as a form of surveillance of the mother by the father. The recordings were made </span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#282828">without the express knowledge and permission of the people being recorded, namely the mother and the children. The audio recordings made in the privacy of the family home were not used by the father for a legitimate purpose. The recordings invaded the privacy of the mother and the children. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the nature and content of the covert recordings made by the father were not pertinent in assisting the Court to make informed welfare-based decisions for the children.  On the contrary, the evidential value taken from the recording is to support the mother&#8217;s assertion that she has been subjected by the father to a significant degree of invasion of her privacy. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the audio recordings and the monitoring the mother&#8217;s movements formed a pattern of covert surveillance which was controlling and abusive. </span></p>

His oral evidence was internally inconsistent. Further, his oral evidence was not consistent with his written evidence on many of the key issues. In respect of each of the disputed allegations, in this Court&#8217;s judgement, the mother&#8217;s evidence was patently more reliable.   As Ms Betsworth of Counsel, observed on behalf of the Guardian, the Court was hampered in its exercise by the father&#8217;s lack of candour and an absence of explanation for events, save for bare denials. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the father&#8217;s bare denials, denial of the established facts behind the relevant criminal conviction and requiring the mother to be subjected to cross-examination on such painful and sensitive issues was unreasonable. </span></p>

The judgment is structured in that way for convenience. The Court makes clear that in reaching its findings and drawing its conclusions, it has considered the totality of the evidence, looking at the wide canvass of evidence holistically </span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">rather than adopting a compartmentalised approach. The Court has come to a view about the totality of the evidence before deciding the facts in issue. Few fact-finding exercises can construct an entirely coherent narrative which can explain all the evidence before the Court. </span><span style="font-size:11pt">The mother deposes to serious domestic abuse and sexual abuse of herself and of serious physical and emotional abuse of the children. Her evidence generally is not without some inconsistency as to detail. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, however, her evidence is nonetheless compelling and convincing as to the central core. </span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">In this Court&#8217;s judgement, the mother&#8217;s version of events struck the Court as being entirely the more plausible. U</span><span style="font-size:11pt">ndertaking an impartial, objective consideration of all the relevant evidence, the Court is left with the powerful conviction that on the essential core issues, the mother is telling the truth.</span></p>

The mother&#8217;s account includes evidence of sexual assault including repeated non-fatal strangulation, restricting her breathing and causing her to fear for her life. In this Court&#8217;s judgement, there is a strong relationship between the incidents of sexual assaults, non-fatal strangulation, physical abuse of the mother and the children, emotional abuse of the mother and children and coercive controlling behaviour as a pattern of abusive behaviour. It is plain from the mother&#8217;s evidence that the repeated strangulation of her by the father was particularly traumatic. On the evidence, the Court concludes that the father&#8217;s behaviour included spontaneous and angry assaults, together with determined threats aimed at exerting control. The events described by the mother and found by the Court to be true, were not one-off incidents but involved cumulative and interlinked physical, psychological, sexual and emotional abuse that have had a particularly damaging effect on the mother and the children who were directly assaulted and who witnessed the abuse of their mother. </span></p>
