On 7 July 2013, M was delivered of their daughter who was subsequently removed from their care and finally made subject to care and placement orders on 23 September 2014.

However, she attracted the attention of the relevant social work department there, so that when S was born on 11 September 2017 in RoI, the CFA commenced proceedings under the Child Care Act 1991 removing S into foster care.  On 8 January 2018, the District Court granted an application for the transfer of jurisdiction from RoI to E&amp;W, a decision that was upheld in the Circuit Court by HH Judge Donnabhain on appeal on 6 February. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.27in;margin-right:0.03in">On 27 February, the transfer request came before Mr Justice MacDonald sitting in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice in E&amp;W and an order nisi was made accepting the transfer of jurisdiction. Thereafter Mr Justice Francis, having heard the parents&#8217; representations, made a final order on 12 April accepting jurisdiction. Subsequently, LA issued an application pursuant to part IV <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> that was transferred to the Family Court sitting in the area where the orders were made for S&#8217;s sister, but not before Francis J made an interim care order approving the plan for S to remain in the care of her foster carers in RoI pending final determination. Furthermore, Francis J declared that &#8220;the transfer of jurisdiction to this court under Article 15 is emphatically conclusive and this court now exercises jurisdiction as if by Art 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003&#8221;. </p>

At the same time, a final hearing was fixed to commence on 14 January 2019 preceded by an issues resolution/early final hearing on 14 December 2018, both allocated to the same Circuit Judge. Although there has been some slippage in the timetable, the proceedings remain on course for resolution in January, if not before. </p>

It is common ground that in respect of X, if proceedings are issued in RoI as seems likely, the CFA does not intend to request transfer of jurisdiction to E&amp;W, although clearly that does not prevent the Irish court making a request of its own motion. </p>

If Recital 13 is intended to prevent more than one transfers in all circumstances, it is expressed in a rather clumsy and ambiguous choice of words to give effect to that intention. Whereas, if it is intended only to prevent the onward transfer to a third Member State, then the turn of phrase makes much more sense to my mind. </p>

I have therefore come to the conclusion that it is open to me to request a transfer back to the RoI if the tripartite conditions in Art 15 (summarised at paragraph 9 above) are satisfied.  It is to the analysis of those requirements, therefore, that I now turn. </p>

The CFA do not intend to apply to transfer jurisdiction for X to E&amp;W. In these circumstances, a transfer of jurisdiction for S back to RoI would enable one court to consider the futures of the S and X together. This is an obvious advantage that could lead to both children being assessed together with both parents either in a residential setting as M would desire, or otherwise. This process would be made easier because S is still living in RoI and local agencies are managing the parents and S&#8217;s placement in foster care on a day to day basis. It is not disputed that the parents are also positively cooperating with agencies in RoI. </p>

Firstly, the Family Court in this jurisdiction has already received considerable evidence about this family, including expert psychiatric evidence regarding M, and come to judgment in respect of S&#8217;s older sibling. In common with the judgments of the District and Circuit courts in RoI earlier this year, I find that all that evidence and the factual findings are more easily admitted in these proceedings here than before the court in RoI. </p>

The social workers have already travelled to RoI, met with the parents and completed their parenting assessment. The court appointed psychologist has made arrangements to see the parents in RoI. I am told and I accept that both reports are on course to be filed in advance of the IRH in December. M and F have been unable to provide any reassurance to me that the RoI court would accept the admission of this evidence after transfer and it may be the case that they would have to start again with the appointment of experts acceptable there.  </p>

No other witnesses who are likely to be at the heart of the final decision about S are based in RoI. It is also properly conceded on behalf of the parents that any final hearing in RoI would most likely take place a number of months after the proceedings here will be completed. </p>

It is obviously in S&#8217;s best interests, it is said, if her future can be considered and decided alongside X, in a country where she has always lived and where her parents are settled. Assessments can be undertaken by agencies and professionals already involved with the family in RoI thereby minimising any adverse effect on S. Furthermore, S is settled in her foster placement in RoI with the same carers for virtually her entire life, carers who can continue to care for her until final decisions are made.  Any delay that there may be would not be significant given S&#8217;s settled placement and, in any event, it is three months until the final hearing in this jurisdiction.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.27in;margin-right:0.03in">Two other arguments, however, point to it not being in S&#8217;s best interests to transfer to RoI.  Firstly, only this court has the power to make either a placement order or a special guardianship order, either of which could secure S&#8217;s placement with her older sibling and her adoptive parents. Having regard to this statement of fact does not offend against comity: it is the very position that was acknowledged by the Circuit Court in RoI when it considered transfer here to be in S&#8217;s best interests so as to keep all options open. In this, I respectfully agree with Judge Donnabhain.  In my judgment, transfer would in all likelihood deprive S of the possibility of being placed with her older sibling, a welfare outcome that may be in her best interests. It is plainly in S&#8217;s best interests that all realistic options for her future are able to be considered. I note that transfer is not necessary to enable S to be placed in RoI (see Para 19(3) Sch II <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>) if that proves in due course to be in her best interests. </p>

	  <num>29.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.27in;margin-right:0.03in">Secondly, as discussed at paragraph 26 above, transfer is likely to delay the resolution of these proceedings for S. S has already been subject to proceedings for her entire 13 months, more than twice as long as Parliament has determined appropriate. It is axiomatic that delay in deciding a child&#8217;s future is contrary to her best interests. In particular, in S&#8217;s children&#8217;s guardian&#8217;s opinion, S is now of an age where a move soon to her permanent future placement is crucial.  The realistic prospect of a decision not being made in RoI until next summer is well beyond what can be described as S&#8217;s timescale for permanence. </p>

In my judgment, that cannot be in S&#8217;s best interests and is likely to be detrimental to her welfare.  Although I accept that the detriment may be mitigated to some extent because she is settled in her placement and will continue to be so until a decision about her future is made, S has already been waiting for a permanent placement for far too long and I accept the Children&#8217;s Guardian&#8217;s opinion that time is of the essence, especially given S&#8217;s age. </p>

In particular, only this court is able to dispense with parental consent and make a Placement Order placing S with her adopted sibling in England, should that be the only option that meets her welfare needs. In my judgment, a transfer of jurisdiction that would limit the available future outcomes for S (i.e. a transfer to RoI) cannot be in her best interests and is likely to be detrimental to her welfare, a situation readily acknowledged by the RoI courts when requesting transfer here. </p>
