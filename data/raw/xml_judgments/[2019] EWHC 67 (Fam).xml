Ms Sutton represented the Health Board, and she had her instructing solicitor and two clinicians, Dr L and Dr J on the phone. JK was not represented, having been assessed to have litigation capacity, and having declined representation (as told to me by the Health Board). JK had told Dr J that he did not wish to speak to me by phone, but did wish to participate in the hearing. As I will explain further below the issue appeared at that stage to be extremely urgent, given that JK had been refusing to eat for a fairly prolonged period and, in those circumstances, I decided that the best course was to adjourn the hearing and continue the hearing the following day at A Hospital. However, on 24 October 2019 when I met JK at A Hospital, JK told me that he did want representation and that he would eat up to the next hearing, as long as that was the following week. Given the importance of the issue, and the legal complexities, I therefore adjourned the application again in order for JK to instruct a solicitor and counsel. </p>

It seems that a significant cause of difficulty for him, and something that has caused him great anxiety and frustration, has been his interactions with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the assessments that he had to undertake over many years. He reports that problems with the DWP, both for him and his ex-partner, contributed to the breakdown in his relationship. </p>

JK had had some interactions with psychiatric services since 2016. He has reported that he has made five suicide attempts over the years, with one resulting in hospitalisation. There is no reported history before the index offence of anti-social behaviour or violence. There is a record of being prescribed Sertraline for depression in the past, but according to JK this had little or no benefit.  In October 2018 he was diagnosed with ASD. JK had no support for his autism before the diagnosis, and it may well be that this was a strong contributing factor in many of the problems and frustrations he had with governmental agencies and decision making over the years. It was notable that when he gave his oral evidence he was still preoccupied with problems that he had had with the DWP and his view was that if he now returned to the community he could not cope with dealing with that and other governmental agencies.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The index offence took place in recent weeks.  It is described in the reports as a frenzied attack using a knife or screwdriver. JK called the police after the index offence and admitted to it. He was arrested and remanded in custody at A Prison on 14 September 2019. Perfectly appropriately he was advised by his legal team to say nothing in evidence to me about the index offence.  He was assessed by two medical practitioners on 10 October 2019 as suffering from a mental disorder which makes it appropriate for him to be detained under the MHA. A transfer direction was made by the Secretary of State for Justice on 21 October 2019 and he was transferred to A Hospital on 23 October, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.48</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. He has been resident at A Hospital since, under the clinical care of Dr J and her team. He was very unhappy about the way that he had been transferred, and felt that it had been deceitful. However, as far as I could tell the way the transfer was done was intended to minimise the impact upon him.  </p>

Between 10 September 2019 and 2 October 2019 (i.e. 23 days) he refused food. He then ate limited food for a few days, because he was concerned that he might be found not to have capacity to make the decision if he was in a weakened state. After 2 October 2019 he has largely been refusing food, but he has started eating again at A Prison because he wished to be able to attend and give evidence before the court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">His clinical team, including those at A Prison and at the hospital were very concerned about the impact of his refusal to eat. He is at severe risk of re-feeding syndrome, even if he does decide to eat at some later point. This would include hypophosphatemia, with increasing weakness leading to collapse, hypoglycaemia and cardiac arrest. If he chooses to continue not to eat then he will die, although as he is continuing to drink this may take some time. It is not possible to give specificity regarding life expectancy however the Guidelines for the clinical management of people refusing food in immigration removal centres and prisons (January 2010) produced by the Department of Health states that if a person is well nourished at the beginning of the fast and is prepared to take adequate fluid, they are usually at little risk of dying from malnutrition for at least six to eight weeks.  </p>

There was originally an issue raised by the Health Board that this advance decision was not valid. However, the Health Board now accept that it is valid, and in any event JK has made a fresh advance decision in effectively the same terms dated 31 October 2019. Therefore, there is a lawful advance decision in place, subject to the findings I make below about JK&#8217;s capacity.   </p>

Dr L met JK on 16 October 2019. He has also reached the view that JK has capacity to make the decision to refuse food and medical treatment. His report is detailed and careful. He goes through each stage of the criteria in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> for assessing capacity. JK has been given the relevant information as to how his condition is likely to deteriorate if he continues to refuse food, the risks associated and the likely mode of death. He concludes that JK has capacity to refuse food and to refuse medical treatment including palliative care. Dr L also considered whether JK had litigation capacity and concluded that he did. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In his written report he records that JK has a history of sensitivity to noise and of secretive obsessions/rituals around food which means that he cannot eat in front of other people. He describes JK as being rigid in his thinking, needing control and liking routine. Misunderstandings due to miscommunications have occurred on a number of occasions since his detention. Dr L explained that all of this is common in people with ASD.  He also described JK as being someone who wanted to do the right thing. All of this accords very strongly with my impression of JK when he gave evidence, and when I met him on 24 October at A Hospital.  </p>

Dr L had talked through with JK the consequences of starving himself, in terms of physical impacts such as weakness, pressure sores and organ failure. He also discussed refeeding syndrome which can affect the brain and the heart. JK was aware of these impacts and discussed them quite coherently with Dr L.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr L was of the view that JK had capacity both to litigate and in respect of decisions as to whether to eat and whether to accept forcible feeding. In his reports he carefully went through the various stages under the MCA in order to assess whether JK had capacity, and was satisfied that he did in respect of all decisions relevant to this application. He said that JK fully understood and retained the information about refusing food and medical treatment, and could communicate back his decision. In relation to weighing up the information Dr L thought JK&#8217;s decision was heavily influenced by his perception of his family and social circumstances. He said that there was no reason to think any of this information is false. He said that JK&#8217;s evaluation of his situation is that it is hopeless and unbearable, but that was a capacitous decision. He also took the view that depression is not a prominent feature of JK&#8217;s case, although he did suggest that JK may have suffered from chronic depression for a long time.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Dr L was careful to draw a distinction between the test for capacity in the MCA, which is necessarily a relatively low one, and the question of whether JK&#8217;s decision not to eat was a manifestation of his ASD, for the purposes of the MHA.  Dr L&#8217;s evidence is that it was such a manifestation and that there was potentially treatment available which could alleviate that disorder. Dr L referred to the fact that JK&#8217;s diagnosis of ASD came very late in his life, and prior to that he had had no support for the condition, and many of the problems that he had faced with the DWP and other authorities may have stemmed at least in part from the ASD. Dr L explained that for many people with autism when they face a crisis situation they become overwhelmed and effectively choose &#8216;demand avoidant&#8217; behaviour when facing a crisis. He phrased this as being &#8220;demand avoidant&#8221; and that being a characteristic feature of ASD. At that stage they may pass through the crisis, or in some cases try to commit suicide. However, JK has very limited choices, because he is detained and this has led to him seeking control through the decision not to eat and end his life by that means. In Dr L&#8217;s view JK&#8217;s decision not to eat is his response to the crisis he finds himself in, and as such is a manifestation of his autism. </p>

People with ASD often present in a demand avoidant way, e.g. by refusing to eat or trying to commit suicide. He said that JK was an intelligent thoughtful man, and it was possible that given time and appropriate interventions, his rigid thought processes could be overcome.

Much of Dr L&#8217;s evidence focused on JK&#8217;s lack of emotional understanding or response, particularly on issues around his family. He felt that with time and professional support JK could be assisted to understand wider concerns, including the impact of his actions on his family, and to consider this further before making an irrevocable decision. </p>

He was completely straightforward in accepting that it would be a distressing and unpleasant process which would be likely to be harmful (although not necessarily fatal) to any therapeutic relationship with JK. He said that there was often a process of negotiation with a patient as to how any feeding took place. The practicalities of force feeding in terms of the sedation that would be required, and the steps to ensure that the tube could be placed and removed safely was a matter for other expert clinicians.  </p>

It was clear from her evidence that a clinical decision that it was in JK&#8217;s best interests to force feed him if he continued to refuse food had not yet been made, and would only be made once a full treatment plan had been drawn up, and JK&#8217;s situation at that date fully considered. </p>

He appeared to me to be an intelligent and thoughtful man, who was greatly troubled by his situation. He was very rigid in his thinking, and in particular in respect of how he responded to his current position and to thoughts about the future. He took a wholly fatalistic view of the future, and thus saw it as hopeless. He was unwilling and probably unable to contemplate that matters could change. For example, his first response when asked why he wanted to end his life was that he could not cope with the DWP again if he was released into the community in the future. He could not envisage that by getting help with his ASD and practical help with dealing with public bodies this issue might be mitigated.  He was also completely rigid in his thinking about his family, and the possibility that he or they might shift their position.  </p>

She does not consider that the administration of artificial nutrition and hydration to Dr. A. in the circumstances of this case to be a medical treatment for his mental disorder, but rather for a physical disorder that arises from his decision to refuse food. That decision is, of course, flawed in part because his mental disorder deprives him of the capacity to use and weigh information relevant to the decision. The physical disorder is thus in part a consequence of his mental disorder, but, in my judgement, it is not obviously either a manifestation or a symptom of the mental disorder. This case is thus distinguishable from both the Croydon case and Brady&#8217;.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Mr McKendrick argued that JK&#8217;s decision not to eat was not a manifestation of his autism, but rather a response to the situation he found himself in. Mr McKendrick said that it was not possible to conclude that the decision was primarily a consequence of his autism, without &#8220;longitudinal&#8221; evidence, by which he meant evidence of JK&#8217;s presentation over time and before the index offence and detention. He argued that JK&#8217;s desire to starve himself to death, although potentially having some link to his autism, was not primarily a manifestation of that condition. Although Mr McKendrick accepted that there was a legal difference between a finding that JK had capacity to decide to refuse to eat, and whether the test in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref> was met, he did submit that the fact JK had capacity was a strong indicator that the decision was not primarily caused by his autism.  </p>

The first is whether JK has capacity to litigate and to make a decision to refuse food and subsequent treatment. Dr L&#8217;s assessment is that he has capacity in respect of both matters and this is supported by the earlier assessments of the other consultant psychiatrists.  I heard JK give evidence and I have no reason to doubt Dr L&#8217;s assessment. Dr L explains that JK understands the information that he has been given, can process it and understand the consequences. In relation to litigation capacity, the very fact that JK decided he did want representation indicates that he had weighed up the material and the choices and could come to a decision. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The MHA gives the power to decide whether to compulsorily treat a patient to the responsible clinician and not to the Court. This is a fundamentally different scheme to that in the MCA where many decisions are given by statute to the court. The difference makes sense because the MHA is a statutory scheme for, inter alia, detention and compulsory treatment in the public interest, where the responsible clinician has a specific role in the statutory scheme. There is no statutory process in the MHA to question the decision of the clinician. However, if the clinician decides to impose treatment then the individual can judicially review that decision, as happened in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R v Collins ex p ISB</span>. However, in the present case what is in issue is a proposed future treatment where the clinicians have not yet drawn up a treatment plan, and not yet weighed up the factors for and against force feeding. In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A NHS Trust v A</span> Baker J at [80] said; that in cases of uncertainty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.63</ref> MHA &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">where there is doubt whether the treatment falls within section 145 or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/19/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>, the appropriate course is for an application to be made to the court to approve the treatment&#8221;</span>. Baker J did not explain what jurisdiction the Court would be exercising in order to make any such declaration and judicial review would not be apposite at this stage as an actual decision to treat has not yet been made. However, the inherent jurisdiction can be used to make declaratory orders, and I can see no reason why a similar principle would not apply here.  I therefore will consider the making of declaratory relief.  </p>

As appears later in this judgment, the rigour of that ruling may be qualified to the extent that resolution of challenges to section 58(3)b) decisions may not always or even mostly require oral evidence. However, it is authority for the proposition that a court, albeit exercising a judicial review function, does so, not on a Wednesbury basis, but by deciding the matter for itself on the merits after a full consideration of the evidence whether oral or in writing. The importance of this is the further safeguard it provides to vulnerable, detained mental patients in addition to that of the independently appointed SOAD for scrutiny of medical decisions with a potential to violate their human rights. </span></p>

Dr L is not only a consultant psychiatrist but also one with a particular expertise in the assessment and treatment of patients with autism. Dr L appeared to me to be a measured, highly knowledgeable and careful witness, whose evidence I can give the maximum weight to. He had met JK twice, once for quite a prolonged interview, and had clearly listened carefully to what JK had said and the information he had gathered. It is true that Dr L and the court, have relatively little information about JK&#8217;s mental health before the index offence and the fact that none of the clinicians have been able to speak to JK&#8217;s family limits their understanding of his presentation outwith the highly traumatic recent circumstances. However, I do not accept Mr McKendrick&#8217;s submission that without such &#8220;longitudinal evidence&#8221; it is not possible to conclude that the refusal to eat is not a manifestation of JK&#8217;s autism.  </p>

JK has been through a quite exceptionally difficult and traumatic few weeks, and it should not be forgotten that the index offence only took place two months ago. It is hardly surprising given his mental disorder perhaps exacerbated by chronic depression, that his response is suicidal. Issues around food and eating appear to have been a feature of his autism, and possibly also OCD, and a refusal to eat therefore has an obvious relationship to his mental disorder.  </p>

I also accept that it is possible that many people faced with JK&#8217;s situation would feel despair and potentially be suicidal. However, I do not think the task for me is to try to compare JK&#8217;s response to his situation with that of a hypothetical person without autism. It is rather, to try to analyse the degree to which JK&#8217;s own response relates to his condition, and the way his mind works because of that condition.  </p>

It is apparent that force feeding is a highly intrusive process, which involves sedating the patient whilst the naso-gastric tube is inserted and potentially having to restrain the patient for fairly prolonged periods. This process would be extremely upsetting for any patient, but for JK with his ASD and his aversion to eating in front of other people, the process would be even more traumatic. JK said in oral evidence that he viewed the possibility as abhorrent, and it was clear from that response how incredibly upsetting for all concerned having to go through that process would be. If it came to that stage close consideration would necessarily have to be given to the terms of article 3 ECHR and the caselaw such as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Herczegfalvy v Austria</span> [1993] 15 EHRR 437 and the test of medical necessity.  </p>
