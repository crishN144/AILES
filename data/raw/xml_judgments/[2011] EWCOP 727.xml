	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A was born on 25 June 1925 and is 85 years old.  He has been diagnosed as suffering from dementia, and from memory and cognitive impairment. In December 2009 he was admitted to hospital under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>. He was discharged home on 11 January 2010, only to be readmitted to the same hospital following an incident on 17 January 2010. Following a best interests meeting, A was discharged from the hospital on 9 June 2010 and placed at the Nursing Home. The Nursing Home was chosen by S and is what is known as an Elderly Mentally Infirm (EMI) home. An urgent authorisation was requested and  approved on 30 June 2010. A standard authorisation was then applied for and approved on 6 July 2010. The authorisation was then reviewed and approved on 30 September 2010.</p>

However, S did not support A in exercising his right to challenge the authorisation, with the result that a different RPR was appointed. After a further review of the standard authorisation to which reference has already been made it was approved on 5 January 2011, and these proceedings followed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position of the Official Solicitor  was that, at this stage, it was appropriate to make only interim declarations in relation to A&#8217;s capacity to litigate and to decide where he should live, and that these matters should be the subject of further, independent assessment. Through counsel, he pointed to the fact that the last  capacity assessment undertaken by a psychiatrist in December 2010 noted that A was able to retain the information that he could understand and was able to retain the information for a sufficient duration for him to try and weigh it up. A was, moreover, able to communicate his views and so passed that element of the second part of the test under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Official Solicitor  submitted that pursuant to his duty to represent A&#8217;s interests in the proceedings there should be a further, up to date and independent assessment of A&#8217;s capacity. He referred me to paragraph 101 of the judgment of Charles J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">GJ v The Foundation Trust and others </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2009/2972" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCOP 2972" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWHC 2972 (COP)</ref> in which the judge had held (inter alia) that the court should focus on the position when the case was before it rather than the position  when the standard authorisation was granted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Official Solicitor also took the view that the question of A&#8217;s best interests should also be investigated and made the subject  of an up to date independent report.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the same time, the Official Solicitor was anxious to approach the proceedings in a proportionate manner. His proposal, accordingly, was  that the court should direct a Court of Protection Visitor to produce a report relating to both capacity and best interests under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 49</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. Should the outcome of the report be that A lacked capacity and that the maintenance of the challenge was unwarranted, and if the parties agreed, the matter could be disposed of by way of a written consent order, subject to the approval of the court.  However, should the outcome of the report raise questions regarding the appropriateness of the standard authorisation, a further directions hearing would be necessary.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the local authority, counsel argued that there was adequate evidence before the court on which  I could properly conclude that A lacked capacity in the material respects, and that it was in his best interests to remain living in the Nursing Home.  As to capacity, counsel relied on the authorisations and the reviews, and submitted that the medical evidence was sufficiently recent to enable the court to be satisfied that it reflected A&#8217;s current lack of capacity. At best it could be said that A had a fluctuating  capacity, although even that was unlikely.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority received considerable support from S,  who appeared in person, and from whom I took oral evidence. S saw his father regularly, and frequently took him out. He was a patently honest witness, and  I had no difficulty in accepting the good faith of his evidence which, in summary was to the effect that his father both lacked capacity, and was in the best possible place. The deprivation of A&#8217;s liberty, S thought, was a &#8220;red herring&#8221;. A disliked the Nursing Home, but he would dislike wherever he was. He could not live at home &#8211; it would not be safe either for him or for any carer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I did not find it easy to adjudicate on the Official Solicitor&#8217;s submissions, particularly in the light of the evidence from S which was, as I say, both clear and realistic. As I  said during the course of argument, had this been a family case in which the outcome depended upon the court&#8217;s discretion to act in the best interests of a child,  I think I would have taken the short cut and brought the proceedings to a summary conclusion: - see <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">Re B  (minors) (application for contact) </span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 2 FLR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 2 FLR 1</ref>.</p>

In the instant case, A wishes to challenge  the authorisation, which deprives him of his liberty. Parliament has decreed that he should be entitled to do so, and has created safeguards to protect those deprived of their liberty against arbitrary action. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances, I came to the clear view that the submissions of the Official Solicitor were to be preferred, and that  he must be allowed to carry out his duty of representing A in the proceedings as he thought fit. Whilst the present case has every appearance of being a true bill, I am very conscious that the next case may look different, and that safeguards need to be in place to ensure that the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> are not abused.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the same time, I am acutely conscious of the overriding objective, and thus find myself in agreement that the best way forward is; (1)  via a report from the Court of Protection Visitor on both capacity and best interests; and (2) that if, as anticipated, the outcome is agreement between the parties that  A both lacks the capacity to decide where he should live and how he should be cared for  and that a continued deprivation of his liberty at the Nursing Home is in his best interests, then the case can properly be dealt with by way of a written consent order, which I can deal with on paper without the need for a further attendance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances it seem to me entirely appropriate to direct that the report from the Court of Protection Visitor should be funded by the Court of Protection. The absence of a further hearing (if that proves to be the result) will also save the local authority the costs of a second appearance.  </p>
