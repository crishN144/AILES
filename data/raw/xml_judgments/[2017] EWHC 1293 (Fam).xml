This position in relation to a case where a Children&#8217;s Hearing has made a compulsory supervision order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/36/section/83" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 83</ref> of the 2011 Act thus stands in stark contrast to the position in relation to a case where the Sheriff Court has made a permanence order under section 80 of the 2007 Act: compare the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>, paras 48, 55-60, 70.</p>

In particular, and this was not challenged by Ms Cavanagh on behalf of the parents, a compulsory supervision order requiring a child to reside at a specified place, does not prevent a (Scottish) local authority which is an adoption agency from exercising its powers under the 2007 Act and the Adoption Agencies (Scotland) Regulations 2009, 2009/154, by, for example, placing the child at that place with prospective adopters (as to which see regulations 13-20).</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The Council&#8217;s usual practice would be to raise proceedings for permanence orders with authority for adoption in the local sheriff court where we would use our own solicitors (such as myself). In order to raise an action in the Court of Session we would require to instruct a firm of solicitors to act as Edinburgh agents as well as an advocate to appear for us in court. The court would require to instruct another advocate to act as curator ad litem for [A and O] who would have to visit [them] in placement with your clients. The experience of other councils with regard to litigation in the Court of Session is, I believe, that it is both long-drawn out and expensive even in childcare cases like these which have a measure or priority. If permanence orders with authority for adoption were to be sought in the Court of Session, especially if it is true that [the father] has made progress in his personal life, much of the Council&#8217;s case is likely to revolve around the progress [A and O] have made in your clients&#8217; care and around questions of future contact. In the circumstances there I would regard at least one of your clients as being an essential witness in any proceedings raised in the Court of Session. Besides, conventional wisdom has it that questions of adoption as open as these ones appear potentially to be are best resolved in direct adoption proceedings where the judge can deal directly with the issues from all angles rather than in permanence order with authority for adoption proceedings where at best he or she can make a provisional order regarding contact which may again come under challenge in the ensuing adoption proceedings. Effectively if permanence orders with authority for adoption are applied for in these cases two battles may have to be fought instead of one, and your clients may find themselves directly in the firing line in each.&#8221;</p>

Dundee City Council was directed to &#8220;use their best endeavours to be in a position to either disclose the material from the proceedings before the Children&#8217;s Hearing and any proceedings before the Sheriff or provide an update on the date by which a decision for disclosure will be made&#8221; and to apply by 28 April 2017 &#8220;to the Principal Reporter to the Children&#8217;s Hearing and the Sheriff Court for copies of and permission to disclose all papers in respect of proceedings before either body in relation to these children and that Dundee City Council shall disclose to the parties such papers on the receipt of permission for disclosure.&#8221;</p>

Secondly, and whatever the effect of all this may have been as a matter of Scots law, as a matter of English law it would not, in my judgment, affect the proceedings in the English court or the operation of the relevant provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I go further. Mr Inglis submits that A and O have been placed with the applicants pursuant to a lawful order of the Children&#8217;s Hearing, acting within the power conferred upon it by statute. I agree. He goes on to submit that it is no part of the functions of a court in England and Wales to conduct a review of the propriety of the conduct of a Scottish public authority &#8211; Dundee City Council &#8211; leading up to a lawful order which has not been appealed. Judicial review of Scottish bodies is, he says, restricted to the Court of Session. Ms Cavanagh&#8217;s submissions, he contends, fail to distinguish between the role of the English court in determining an adoption application and the privative function of the Court of Session in its supervision of public bodies in Scotland. I am inclined to agree. Other considerations will, of course, arise where the English court is, by statute, given extra-territorial powers: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>, para 66. More narrowly, Mr Inglis goes on to make what in my judgment is an unassailable point. If the parents had any ground of objection to the orders of the Children&#8217;s Hearing, their remedy, as provided by statute, was appeal to the Sheriff &#8211; a remedy which they have never sought to exercise. </p>

Whether A and O are habitually resident in England is, as I have said, in issue. This, it is said, creates two problems, unless it has first been found that A and O are indeed habitually resident in England. First, Mr Buchan and Mr Blackburn question, and Ms Cavanagh disputes, the ability of the Family Court and Family Division properly to perform their functions in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(6)</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">In re B-S</span>, indeed to meet the procedural standards mandated by Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention, if their powers are limited by the lack of any ability to make a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(a) order.

Secondly, and this is a separate point, how is the court to proceed if, having decided <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>to make an adoption order, it lacks the ability to make a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(a) order giving effect to some alternative form of placement?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, there is nothing in these points. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 1(6)</ref> requires the court to have regard to such orders as are available in the circumstances of the particular case &#8211; cf the words &#8220;powers available to it in the child&#8217;s case&#8221; &#8211; not to what might be a longer list of powers available in some other case. The <span style="font-style:italic">In re B-S </span>discipline requires the court to evaluate the various options available in fact &#8216;on the ground&#8217;, as it were &#8211; adoption, long-term fostering, kinship care, rehabilitation to parents, etc. The court is not merely selecting a particular legal option from a legal menu. In any event, the fundamental premise &#8211; that the court lacks power to make private law orders unless the child is habitually resident in England and Wales &#8211; is unsound. The (English) Family Division has jurisdiction to make a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(d) order, that is, &#8220;an order made &#8230; in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court with respect to children &#8230; so far as it gives care of a child to any person or provides for contact with&#8230; a child&#8221;, if (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2(3)</ref>(b)(ii) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref>) &#8220;the child concerned is present in England and Wales on the relevant date [as defined in section 7(c)] and the court considers that the immediate exercise of its powers is necessary for his protection.&#8221; So, any judge sitting in the Family Court who is either a judge of the High Court or authorised to sit as a judge of the High Court in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54/section/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref> (as Judge Singleton is) can, by making an order under the inherent jurisdiction, in essence achieve the same outcome as by making a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref>(a) order.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second matter prayed in aid of the <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens </span>argument is based on the fact that the Children&#8217;s Hearing continues to have, and to exercise (as it did as recently as 10 April 2017), jurisdiction over A and O. So, it is said, the adoption proceedings are better tried in the Court of Session. The short answer to this contention, in my judgment, is the point made by Mr Inglis. Even if an adoption order was to be made by the Court of Session, the matter would still have to be returned to the Children&#8217;s Hearing for the proceedings there to be brought formally to an end. So, there is, on the face of it, no advantage from this point of view to be gained from a trial in the Court of Session. And bearing in mind that the placement of A and O in England with a view to their adoption has been sanctioned by the Children&#8217;s Hearing, there is no reason to believe that the Children&#8217;s Hearing will be any less willing to make whatever consequential orders may be appropriate just because the adoption proceedings have been heard by the Family Court in England and not by the Court of Session in Scotland.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Two other factors point in favour of England and not Scotland being the more appropriate forum. One is that, if the present proceedings are stayed so that an application can be made in the Court of Session, there will, save only for Mr Inglis, be an unavoidable need to instruct new counsel and solicitors and to appoint a new guardian &#8211; something productive only of delay and undesirable discontinuity. The other is an important factor identified by Mr Inglis, namely that rule 67.14(a) of the Rules of the Court of Session provides that an adoption petition shall be &#8220;put on the By Order Roll before the Lord Ordinary not less than 6 and not more than 8 weeks&#8221; after the petition has been lodged, and rule 67.17(b)(ii) provides that at the hearing on the By Order Roll the court shall &#8220;fix a diet of proof [final hearing] not less than 12 and not more than 16 weeks after the date of the hearing on the By Order Roll unless, on cause shown, a longer period is appropriate.&#8221; So, a minimum period of 18 weeks has to elapse after the petition has been lodged before there can be a final hearing. That further delay would be most undesirable, not least given the time which has already elapsed since these proceedings commenced.</p>

It is imperative in the interests of justice &#8211; not merely justice to them but also justice to A and O &#8211; that the parents be present throughout, not just while giving evidence, so that they are in the best possible position to see and hear what is going on and to give instructions to those representing them. I add that in a case such as this the imperative demands of justice and fairness, both in the general sense and as mandated by Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention, march in step with the equally pressing demands of humanity and common decency. That they should not be able to be there throughout, as they would wish, is, in my judgment quite unthinkable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Data gathered by Ms Cavanagh, and not disputed by anyone, demonstrates that the road journey for the parents to Lancaster and back is 332 miles, the round trip by the cheapest bus lasting a little short of 11 hours and costing in all &#163;90 for the two of them. The corresponding figures for Preston are 374 miles, a little over 11 hours and a cost of &#163;66. They were unable to pay the cost of travelling to London for the hearing before me on 3 May 2017 &#8211; their savings having by then become too depleted &#8211; but with enormous dedication and commitment had managed, despite their limited resources, to travel by bus to the hearings before Judge Singleton, at Preston or Lancaster, on occasions travelling overnight to be at court by 9.30am. I am simply not prepared to contemplate such arrangements for a final hearing. Ms Cavanagh puts the point powerfully, if in understated language:</p>

There is potential for this disadvantage to affect the justice of the cause and the outcome.&#8221;</p>

If and to the extent that these, in my judgment wholly necessary, costs will not be met by the Legal Aid Agency, which I assume is funding the parents&#8217; legal representation, then they must be met by Dundee City Council. In fact, I am told, Dundee City Council has, very properly, agreed to pay the parents&#8217; travel expenses for hearings dealing with welfare issues, including their accommodation costs as I have described them above.</p>

He suggests, for the future, that where an adoption application is made to an English court relying upon a Scottish order, whether, as here, a compulsory supervision order or, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A</span>, a permanence order with authority to adopt, the papers should be referred to the Designated Family Judge at the outset, with a view to making an order joining the Scottish local authority <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>the first directions hearing.
