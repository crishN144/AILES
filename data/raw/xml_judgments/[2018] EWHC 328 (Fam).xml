This has been largely due to the inordinate delay by HMCTS and Ubiqus to deal with the transcripts. A request for the transcription of the judgments and the evidence of two of the witnesses were made on 18 July 2017, the judgements were not made available to the appellant until four months later, on 16 November 2017. There were further difficulties in seeking to obtain the transcripts of the evidence of Dr Harrison and Mr Wood, it took until 23 January 2018 for the court to confirm that those files were corrupted and therefore not available. I will send the chronology of these requests to the FDLJ, so he can bring this issue to the attention of the relevant person. </span></p>

This was done without informing the father. In these proceedings the court endorsed the instruction of a joint psychologist, Dr Harrison, who reported in May 2017. She concluded that T had suffered some degree of emotional harm and that if the mother&#8217;s application was granted T would have some distance from the ongoing conflict between his parents but would experience the loss of the relationship he had with his father; although that could be mitigated by ensuring extended contact during the holiday and skype contact in between.</span></p>

Recorder Howe heard evidence from both parents, the mother&#8217;s partner, Dr Harrison and Mr Wood.  The draft judgment was circulated on 29 June which set out the court&#8217;s decision to refuse the mother&#8217;s application to remove T to Poland. The parties did not attend court on 29 June as they sought time to negotiate the shared care arrangements following the court&#8217;s decision. A further hearing was fixed on 14 July. The parties attended that hearing when the competing proposals were as follows. The mother sought a two week on/two week off arrangement, as that division in time would enable her to return to Poland when T was not in her care. The father sought an arrangement that split T&#8217;s time between the parties on a rolling four-day arrangement. The parties were unable to reach agreement, although they agreed the court could determine the arrangements on submissions. The two judgments on 14 July dealt with the shared care arrangements and the mother&#8217;s application for permission to appeal. Recorder Howe refused permission to appeal and determined that T should spend one week with one parent and one week with the other.</span></p>

Although this is a finely balanced decision, when this risk is taken together with the loss to T of all that is familiar to him in England and the loss of care by his father that he has enjoyed on an equal basis to the care of his mother since around the end of 2014, in my judgment the balance falls in favour of the dismissal of the mother&#8217;s application for permission to relocate with T to Poland. I agree with Mr Wood that the mother has by her conduct demonstrated a greater degree of hostility towards the father than the father has towards the mother and given the misrepresentations I have found to have occurred, I find that there is a risk that the mother will not promote contact between T and the father in the way that she assures the court she will&#8217;.</span></p>

As Mr Downs put it in his oral submissions there was a failure to properly evaluate the consequences other than record that the mother would be </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8216;extremely upset&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> by the refusal. What he submits the Recorder did not do is properly evaluate what underpinned that, and how it would impact on T. The evidence was that the mother&#8217;s living arrangements were going to change. The property she rented with her sister and her son, T&#8217;s cousin, was going to cease when the sister moved to Wales. T would lose that relationship with his cousin, who Mr Woods described him as being very close to. These changes were not factored in to the Recorder&#8217;s analysis of the option of remaining here. The mother&#8217;s position, whereby she would be unable to continue her business or realistically earn any income whilst she was effectively locked into the shared care arrangement was also not specifically factored in. Neither were the legitimate reasons why her partner could not come to this country (his business, his son and his lack of English).

The judgment, he submits, fails to mention, or weigh in the balance, a number of material facts. First, the mother unreservedly accepted Dr Harrison&#8217;s conclusions in the position statement filed on her behalf prior to the hearing in June. Second, the mother did not challenge Dr Harrison&#8217;s conclusions either when Dr Harrison gave evidence or when the mother gave her own evidence. There was no exploration of the fact that the school had reported some deficits in T&#8217;s attention/ability to follow instructions (as reported to Dr Harrison) and that the mother had sought to obtain advice about this in Poland and had been generally concerned. This is not a case, Mr Downs submits, where the mother had simply invented problems that did not exist, rather she had overstressed or exaggerated them. The Recorder, submits Mr Downs, failed to properly examine whether such behaviour would continue, he failed to factor into his conclusions the mother&#8217;s acceptance of Dr Harrison&#8217;s conclusions.

The judgment does not deal with the evidence about the effect of the mother&#8217;s sister moving, the consequent loss to T of his relationship with his cousin. It does not consider the impact on the mother&#8217;s ability to earn a living if she remained here, or her inability to pursue her relationship with her partner or factor in her partner&#8217;s legitimate reasons for being unable to move here. There was no analysis of how these factors would impact on the mother and, in turn, her ability to care for T, both in the short or the long term. Acknowledging the impact with no more does not give any understanding of the reasoning or evaluation that lies behind it and how that has affected the balancing exercise that has been undertaken. This is particularly important when it is clear from paragraph [82] it played such a critical part in the judges reasoning for his conclusion. </span></p>

It was a factor that supported the mother&#8217;s position, along with her proposals for contact, that the Recorder failed to properly consider. An important feature of the circumstances of this family was that the paternal family lived in Poland near to where the mother was planning to live with T, and the fact that the father had his own accommodation there as well and was a regular visitor. These factors, in favour of the mother&#8217;s application, did not feature in the Recorders final analysis and were therefore not given any consideration or weight, as in my judgment they should have been. </span></p>

The failure to mention this aspect, which was in the mother&#8217;s favour, meant the adverse conclusion reached against the mother lacked a proper or fair balance of the available evidence. It was clear this finding was the foundation upon which the conclusions regarding risk at paragraph [82] was based. It follows that without that balance the conclusion is undermined, it was a critical feature in the Recorder&#8217;s reasoning; in particular regarding future risk, as set out in paragraph [70]. </span></p>
