Paragraph 8 of the order dated 3 November 2008 directed that there be &#8220;an inquiry into the amount of the outstanding loan account, if any&#8221;. I emphasise the important qualifying words &#8220;if any&#8221;, which reflect what I had said in my judgment (see further below). Paragraph 8 of that order also set out directions for the trial of the loan account issue; the timetable was subsequently adjusted by orders I made on 1 December 2008 and 22 January 2009. The directions provided for pleadings and the filing of written evidence and made clear (for the avoidance of doubt) that the evidence I had received during the original trial in April 2008 was to stand as evidence in the inquiry. I reserved the matter to myself.</p>

Her application came before the Court of Appeal (Thorpe, Scott Baker and Sullivan LJJ) on 22 July 2009 and was dismissed for reasons given by Thorpe LJ: <span style="font-style:italic">Hashem  v Shayif and ors</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/984" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 984" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 984</ref>.

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I digress to say that that satellite case seems to me to be completely pointless given that the wife as claimant was not in a position to fire any ammunition. The effective creditor will take no part in the proceedings whatsoever, and all that is likely to emerge is sterile outcome with further bleeding of whatever monies there are in this jurisdiction in favour of eminent and expensive lawyers. So it is not surprising that thoughts of mediation have entered judicial minds. Mr Wagstaffe has emphasised that the wife is very keen to mediate, and Miss Evans-Gordon, without instructions, recognises the good sense of mediation and has, through her instructing solicitors, sought instructions to take that sensible path.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Unsurprisingly, the company had given the wife notice to quit 17 Kensington Heights as soon as it was in a position to do so, that notice expiring on 14 May 2009. At that stage, of course, the wife&#8217;s application for permission to appeal was still pending in the Court of Appeal (it had been issued as recently as 8 May 2009), so equally unsurprisingly perhaps, she did not vacate. But, as it was entitled to, the company issued possession proceedings in the West London County Court on 19 May 2009. A hearing of those proceedings listed for 7 July 2009 was adjourned pending the hearing in the Court of Appeal. Following the outcome in the Court of Appeal on 22 July 2009, the possession proceedings were re-listed for hearing on 3 August 2009, on which date an order was made requiring the wife to give vacant possession on or before 17 August 2009. She failed to do so and the company had to take steps to have her evicted on 22 August 2009. The contents were not removed until 19 October 2009, in circumstances which gave rise to the complaint by the wife shortly thereafter to which I refer below. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I have said, the hearing of the loan account issue which had been fixed for 30 April 2009 had to be vacated. It proved impossible to find any date convenient both to the court and to counsel either before the end of the July 2009 sittings or during the period in August 2009 when I was sitting as a vacation judge. However, the parties were informed by my Clerk on 29 July 2009 that I would be able to accommodate the hearing in October, November or December 2009. On 28 September 2009, by which time I had read the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the parties were told that, if they still wished for a hearing of the loan account issue, they should contact my Clerk with a view to fixing a date in either October or November 2009. On 19 October 2009, by which date I had become aware that the wife was experiencing difficulties in relation to her public funding, the parties were told that I was anxious, if at all possible, to deal with the matter &#8211; that is, to hear and determine the loan account issue &#8211; before the end of term.</p>

To reach a conclusion on that issue, the court will have to consider the quantum, and the nature and character, both of the payments by the husband to the company and of the payments by the company to the husband.

Furthermore, it is not immediately obvious that the company&#8217;s case for the discharge (as opposed to the further amendment) of the injunction is that compelling. Whatever the merits (or otherwise) of the wife&#8217;s claim in relation to the loan account issue it is far from clear that the balance of convenience calls for the discharge of the injunction given that it protects one of only two assets within the jurisdiction and, in particular, given that the company is in principle entitled, as I have already held (<span style="font-style:italic">Ben Hashem v Ali Shayif and Radfan Ltd</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2009/864" uk:canonical="[2009] EWHC 864 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWHC 864 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 FLR 896" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 FLR 896</ref>), to raise money on the security of the property to meet its normal business expenses notwithstanding the existence of the injunction. And it is a fact that the primary cause of the delay in the trial of the loan account issue was the inability of the court to honour the fixture on 30 April 2009 rather than the wife&#8217;s dilatory conduct of the proceedings since then.</p>

In addition it has legal costs (including counsel&#8217;s fees and other disbursements) of &#163;41,591 billed but not yet paid and anticipates having further legal costs of something in the order of &#163;30,000. The grand total comes to &#163;116,527, an amount which, as Miss Emberton points out, does not make allowance for any rental income that may in due course be received as and when 17 Kensington Heights is let. Miss Evans-Gordon acknowledges that the amount being claimed &#8211; a further &#163;130,000 &#8211; in any event exceeds Miss Emberton&#8217;s figure but says that past estimates have usually been too low. She says that the company seeks the whole of the sums required for the next year in order to avoid the costs of a further application. She seeks to sugar the pill for the wife by suggesting that it may not be necessary to borrow the full amount and that it is hoped that a stream of income will be generated by renting out the property. That said, as she points out, the ongoing expenditure and lack of income can be attributed largely, if not entirely, to the wife&#8217;s actions. Finally, and seeking to meet Mr Squire&#8217;s obvious objections in anticipation, she says that it is difficult to see what evidence the wife could adduce in relation to this application, as none of the relevant matters are within her knowledge.</p>

That, after all, as she rightly says, is <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> between the parties. The question therefore is simply one of fact, as to which Miss Emberton&#8217;s latest evidence is clear. I confess to having some difficulty in seeing how the wife can realistically hope to displace Miss Emberton&#8217;s evidence and I recognise that I am adopting a course that some might think unduly pusillanimous. But given that the wife&#8217;s new legal team has had little time to master the case, let alone to grapple with an application made at such a late stage, and given that the question of the injunction is in any event coming back before the court in early course, I propose to grant Miss Evans-Gordon&#8217;s application, but at this stage only to the extent necessary to carry the company through to that hearing. Miss Evans-Gordon suggests that, on that footing, what will be required is a further &#163;30,000 or so. She may be right, but focussing on those liabilities the non-payment of which might expose the company to irretrievable loss, I think that a further &#163;23,000 will suffice to tide the company over for the next eight weeks at most until the matter returns to court. I shall accordingly increase the level of the permitted borrowing on the security of 17 Kensington Heights by &#163;23,000 from &#163;177,000 to &#163;200,000.</p>

First, I am <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>finding that the company&#8217;s liabilities as they are today or as they will be by 5 March 2010 are such as to necessitate only a further &#163;23,000 of borrowing. On the contrary, those liabilities are almost certainly higher &#8211; much higher &#8211; bearing in mind, for example (and it is only one example; I could take others), that the company has outstanding legal bills of over &#163;40,000, as to which it is difficult to see what conceivable argument the wife would be able to put forward as to why they should not be paid, and paid now rather than at some vague time in the future. Second, the wife and her legal advisers need to think very carefully before deciding to continue their resistance to this part of the company&#8217;s application. The point of principle is concluded against them; and what basis do they have for challenging Miss Emberton&#8217;s evidence? Although I have given them a breathing space in which to consider matters at more leisure than has thus far been afforded them, they should be under no illusions as to the reason why I have given them this liberty: it has everything to do with procedural fairness and little if anything to do with the substantive merits.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I must deal finally with the costs &#8211; that is, to be precise, the costs of the hearing before me on 14 December 2009 (the costs of the company&#8217;s application generally will, of course, be matter, at least initially, for the judge who hears the adjourned application early next year). Unsurprisingly the parties differed as to how these costs should be borne. Having heard what both Miss Evans-Gordon and Mr Squire have had to say on the topic, I propose to adopt the following course. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There were, in substance, two quite distinct matters before me on 14 December 2009: one, brought before me at my direction and in circumstances where the parties had been unable to reach the agreement which would otherwise have avoided the need for the hearing on this point, the directions hearing in relation to the loan account issue; the other, brought before the court at the company&#8217;s insistence, its application to discharge or amend the injunction. In relation to the first, the appropriate order, in my judgment, is that the costs should be costs in the cause. The reasons are so obvious as not to require elaboration. In relation to the second, the appropriate order, in my judgment, is that the costs should be reserved to the judge hearing the company&#8217;s adjourned application, for he or she will, as it seems to me, be in a better position than I am to assess whether there really was justification for the adjournment. I shall so order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is plainly highly undesirable that it should be left to a taxing judge to apportion the costs of the hearing on 14 December 2009 as between the two topics. Indeed, I am, in the nature of things, in a much better position than a taxing judge to come to a view. Apportionment in such circumstances is, almost inevitably, a matter of somewhat rough justice, but doing the best I can, and evaluating what took up the time at court on 14 December 2009, I think that justice will best and most accurately be served if I say that the costs of the hearing are to be apportioned equally between the two topics. </p>
