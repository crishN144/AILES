The mother has been faced with a series of appalling losses: the violent death of B, the removal of C and J, enforced separation from a husband who she loves, and the removal at birth of M.  Dr Asen described her as having suffered more losses than an ordinary person can stomach.  She is frozen in a state of shock and has been left alone with all these issues.  She has not been able to grieve for B and has found the thought of acknowledging the unthinkable too overwhelming.  Dr Asen described her as a shipwreck survivor, metaphorically hanging on to the plank of her certainty, so that even when she is now on dry land she cannot trust herself to let it go.   The mother acknowledged in her evidence that Dr Asen had described how she feels.  It is as if she is continually eating without digesting and is now full up.</span></p>

He has continued to maintain his innocence, including by exercising his right to pursue an appeal.  The timing meant that the case was in the Court of Appeal on the Wednesday before the Monday on which this hearing began, permission to appeal having been granted in June.  Although the mother was formally neutral, she must have hoped that the findings against the father would be reopened, if only on the basis of the incident involving C in May.  While that issue remained unresolved, it has been difficult for M to move on in her thinking.  </span></p>

Despite stating that he was not aware of details of the police investigation, the officer is recorded in the official minutes as stating that the Coroner&#8217;s court is the highest in the land, that the police have accepted that verdict, and that the verdict of the civil court is not legally binding.

Faced with clear police records of her having made complaints about violence by the father in November 2008 and May 2010, her evidence was completely unsatisfactory.  She played down or even erased these events, making excuses for the father and thereby underlining how difficult it is for anyone to trust that she will act protectively in any situation where he is involved.  I do not think that she has gone backwards, but she is stuck on this issue.  How can she be trusted to keep social services informed if the father comes to her address in future when she casts doubt on clear evidence that she called the police when he did so in November 2008?</span></p>

The Guardian sees this as a single issue, but one that the mother will be unable to resolve.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I agree with Ms Ode that the mother is hard to fathom.  My assessment is that she has changed her position only to the extent that she now acknowledges that she has a problem.  If she were to undertake therapy, there can be no confidence that by the end of the year there will have been a real change in her outlook sufficient to allow the children to return safely to her care: it is more likely that time would have passed with the situation remaining the same.  On the other hand, the possibility that she will make a shift of some kind cannot be ruled out.  At least we have some understanding of the problem.  In the mother&#8217;s current psychological state, surrounded by the influences I have outlined, it is not hard to see why she has so far been completely unable to move forward in her thinking about how B died.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Ms Stephens rightly described this as a difficult and challenging decision.  Given the high quality of the parenting of which the mother is capable, it is, she said, extremely difficult to contemplate placing the children elsewhere.  Nevertheless, both she and the Guardian consider the risks too high and the chance of change too low to justify keeping the children waiting any longer for a decision.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I have narrowly concluded that it is in the children&#8217;s interests for their mother to be given a final chance to become a parent who is able to protect them from their father.  Accepting all the disadvantages that are entailed, I am going to postpone my decision on the local authority&#8217;s applications until a hearing on 14 January 2013, to which I will give a time estimate of two days.   I will give the local authority permission to restore the matter before me at short notice in the meantime if it is apparent that no effort is being made by the mother to engage in therapy.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The reason for my conclusion is that I consider that the prize for these children of being cared for by their mother is so valuable that they should only be denied it if the disadvantages of waiting are too great or the chances of success too small.  On the evidence, I find that the risks arising from delay are sustainable.  They are relatively slight for C.  The chances of J finding adopters, given the uncertainty about his development, are not great.  The brunt of the disadvantage is borne by M, but even this is outweighed by the possibility of a lifelong relationship with her mother.  </span></p>

I would like to say this to her.  Everyone understands what you have been through, but the children now need you to do more.  The time for clinging on to your belief in your husband is over.  The time for minimising his violence towards you is past.  The time for thinking that the Coroner&#8217;s verdict justifies your beliefs about how B died has run out.   You can no longer put the responsibility for your actions onto other people.  How you use therapy is a matter for you, but unless you can come to acknowledge the threat that the father poses to you and your children, you will have stood in the way of the local authority finding them new homes that can protect them.</span></p>

Indeed I am expecting to have to make those orders.  It is up to the mother to make a different outcome possible.  Unless she can persuade Ms Stephens, Ms Shepherd and Dr Asen that she has significantly moved on, there is no chance of her persuading the court that she can be trusted to bring up these children.</span></p>

I hope that there can be some further thinking on its part about how to neutralise the effects of the police attitude and the Coroner&#8217;s verdict, and that a meeting might be held to help the mother&#8217;s family and friends to learn more about what has happened and what has to happen.  Otherwise, these influences may continue to be a sheet anchor against progress.  But in the end, it will be up to the mother herself.  There will need to be inner change, but there are also certain outward actions that she can take to show that she is serious about distancing herself from someone who is a danger to her children.</span></p>
