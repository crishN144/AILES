I&#160;am advised that whilst security for an Order of this sum would be expected, I&#160;am at the whim of the bank that is being incredibly difficult.  &#8230;  I&#160;am gravely concerned as to the impact [the Bank&#8217;s] actions will have on the overall agreement and the Claimant&#8217;s refusal to discuss the matter causes me greater cause for concern.&#8221;</span></p>

The parties seeking to uphold a concluded agreement for the compromise of such an application cannot sue for specific performance.

Thirdly, it is legitimate where a mandatory injunction is sought, to consider whether the court does feel a high degree of assurance that the plaintiff would be able to establish this right at a trial.  That is because the greater the degree of assurance the plaintiff will ultimately establish his right, the less will be the risk of injustice if the injunction is granted.  But, finally, even where the court is unable to feel any high degree of assurance that the plaintiff will establish his right, there may still be circumstances in which it is appropriate to grant a mandatory injunction at an interlocutory stage.  Those circumstances will exist where the risk of injustice if this injunction is refused sufficiently outweigh the risk of injustice if it is granted.&#8221;</span></p>

Although Mr. Carden, in the course of his submissions, touched on the floodgates argument, I consider that the essence of the dispute between the parties is whether, what is called in the particulars of claim the &#8220;February agreement&#8221;, is a distinct agreement between the parties, or whether it is an agreement which forms part of the process leading to the compromise of the financial remedy claims.  If the agreement is part of a compromise or sufficiently linked with the process leading to the compromise of the financial remedy claims, then in my view it would not give rise to a contract or an agreement enforceable in law.</span></p>

It, clearly, does not form part of and did not form part of the compromise because, when it was reached, there had been no compromise of the wife&#8217;s financial remedy claims.  I do not consider that the subsequent compromise those claims, which incorporates reference to the payment of &#163;10 million in part satisfaction of the husband&#8217;s overall liability to pay &#163;33 million, in any way undermines that conclusion, namely that it is a separate and distinct agreement.  I&#160;also do not consider that it is so linked to the process leading to the compromise of the wife&#8217;s financial remedy claims that to enforce it as a contract would undermine the principles set out in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Xydhias </span><span style="font-size:14pt">or would undermine the manner in which parties seek to resolve financial remedy claims.</span></p>

The respective consequences are enumerated in Mr. Hornett&#8217;s submissions, which I&#160;have already summarised.  The husband accepts, as set out in his statement, that the potential loss of &#163;1.8 million would reduce the parties&#8217; assets significantly and would be &#8220;in neither of our interests&#8221;.  Further, in view it is very likely, if I&#160;do not make the order sought by the wife, that this would lead to the deposit of &#163;1.6 million being forfeited and to the other financial losses being incurred as referred to above.  </span></p>
