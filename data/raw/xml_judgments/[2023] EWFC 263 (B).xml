	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During these proceedings, I permitted the instruction of three eminent experts. Dr Karl Johnson is a Consultant Paediatric Radiologist based at Birmingham Children&#8217;s Hospital. He reviewed an x-ray of CM&#8217;s right leg taken on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January 2023, and then two full skeletal surveys, from the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January and the 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_4">
	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Johnson found no evidence of any underlying metabolic bone disease or abnormal bone density. There was no radiological evidence of a healing response related to the fracture to the right femur, meaning it was likely to be less than 8 days old on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> January. There was some evidence of healing in the rib fractures, and so Dr Johnson considered that they were most likely to have been sustained 2-4 weeks before the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. The metaphyseal fractures to the right and left tibias near the ankle were no older than 11 days on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January, given the lack of healing response. The healing fracture to the right fibula was between 2-4 weeks old at the same time. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_5">
	  <num>5.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course, Dr Johnson gives those timeframes recognising that the dating of fractures is uncertain, imprecise, and subjective. Dr Johnson was of the view that the fractures to the ribs all occurred at the same time and from a single episode of chest trauma. Each fracture was likely to be the result of significant force having been applied to the bones, and whilst the precise level of force required is unknown, it was likely to be significant, excessive and greater than one would expect to see during the normal handling of an infant. </p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time that CM sustained the injuries, she would have been in pain and distress, although Dr Johnson appropriately defers to the paediatricians in relation to the clinical presentation of CM. Rib fractures are commonly the result of a &#8216;squeezing&#8217; mechanism. The incomplete fracture of the right fibula is likely to have been caused by a blow, impact or bending force having been applied to the leg. The same mechanism is likely to have also caused the transverse fracture of the right femur. Metaphyseal fractures are typically the result of severe twisting/torsional forces being applied to the end of the limbs. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">
	  <num>7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Overall, it was the opinion of Dr Johnson that CM had suffered <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;at least two separate episodes of trauma (potentially including birth injury), but five separate applications of force.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kathryn Ward is a Consultant Paediatrician of many years&#8217; experience. She has provided the court with a detailed report, in which she provides a chronology of all involvement of medical professionals with both the mother during her pregnancy but also with CM during her delivery and afterwards. It is an unusual feature of this case that CM was seen many times by a number of professionals during her first four weeks of life. I have copied this table from the opening document prepared by Mr Watson for the local authority. </p>

It is most likely that CM would have cried in pain immediately after the injury and that she would have remained irritable for more than 30 minutes after the injury. It is likely that there would have been signs to the carer, including a carer who was unaware of the presence of the fracture, those signs being reduced movement of the limb, pain on passive movement of the limb and swelling. The fracture would have required a considerable force. Dr Ward also notes that CM required treatment with morphine, diazepam and paracetamol for several days after she was admitted to hospital, indicating that she was, as Dr Ward would have anticipated, in considerable pain.</p>

Children&#8217;s ribs are difficult to fracture as a result of being flexible. Anyone present at the time will be aware of the force applied and that it would be likely to cause injury. However, once the acute pain has settled, rib fractures are difficult to detect and are often missed clinically. A carer who was unaware of the injury might notice that the child was irritable and may attribute the discomfort to other non-specific factors, such as colic. </p>

It was also reported that she had assaulted her mother causing a fracture to her mother&#8217;s arm. It was reported that K had described E as being &#8220;rough&#8221; with their daughter, describing him as pulling at her limbs and snatching her hands away from her face if she went to scratch herself. K also alleged that E would shove the bottle into CM&#8217;s when she was struggling to feed. An assessment of K took place on 20th February 2023. K&#8217;s affect and mood were described as appropriate and she made good eye contact and was verbally responsive with the psychologist. However, K was poorly orientated and was unable to recall the correct date and gave incorrect information regarding the location of the building in which the assessment took place. K confirmed that she had ADHD and autism having been diagnosed at age 14. She stated that she had trouble in controlling her anger from a young age and had weekly sessions with CAMHS in relation to this &#8220;for years&#8221; as a child. She alleged that her mother stopped the sessions and the medication following her diagnosis because she did not consider it to be effective in managing K&#8217;s anger.

She was of the opinion that she had been more successful in controlling her anger more recently. She had begun to self-harm by cutting at the age of 16 due to being bullied at school; this lasted for a period of three or four months and stopped when she discovered that she was pregnant with CM. However, since the incident with CM, the self-harming behaviours had started coming back and it would calm her and get rid of the thoughts. She was clear that this was not an attempt at suicide. She described feeling down and sad all the time, wanting to stay in bed and not wanting to see her friends. She reported that she had been seeing people in the corner of her eye and shadows walking. She said that she could also hear screeching, buzzing and blowing several times a day. She denied any use of illegal drugs and claimed to have a glass of wine occasionally.

The court is not limited to considering the expert evidence alone. The court invariably surveys a wide canvas. Thus, the opinions of medical experts need to be considered in the context of all of the other evidence. The evidence of the parents and of any other carers is of the utmost importance. It is essential that the court forms a clear assessment of their credibility and reliability. The parents must have the fullest opportunity to take part in the hearing and the court is likely to place considerable weight on the evidence and the impression it forms of them. </p>

However, the correct legal approach is to survey the evidence as a whole as it relates to each individual in order to arrive at a conclusion about whether the allegation has been made out in relation to one or other on a balance of probability. Evidentially, this will involve considering the individuals separately and together, and no doubt comparing the probabilities in respect of each of them. However, in the end the court must still ask itself the right question, which is not "who is the more likely?" but "does the evidence establish that this individual probably caused this injury?" In a case where there are more than two possible perpetrators, there are clear dangers in identifying an individual simply because they are the likeliest candidate, as this could lead to an identification on evidence that fell short of a probability. Although the danger does not arise in this form where there are only two possible perpetrators, the correct question is the same, if only to avoid the risk of an incorrect identification being made by a linear process of exclusion.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important that I take some time to express my concerns in relation to the failures of the local authority in their handling of this evidence. Firstly, as I have already mentioned, there is no record within the SWET of three important visits undertaken by the then allocated social worker, LB, to the family on the 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2023, nor any mention of the accounts given during those visits. The impact of this cannot be understated and has led directly to this situation. It is of fundamental importance that a SWET document gives an accurate and comprehensive summary of the evidence available to the social worker. Further, it would appear to be the case that the social worker was shown K&#8217;s handwritten note, and no copy was kept on the file. When the local authority was asked for its records relating to this period, Mr Watson tells me that there was a misunderstanding as to what was being asked for (someone thought that handwritten notes were the subject of the request rather than case records) and then the person charged with the task of undertaking the search went off sick before the task was completed. When no records were provided, the legal team assumed (wrongly) that this was because there were no records, rather than that the task had yet to be done. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is right to note that everyone knew about K&#8217;s vulnerabilities, including her age and parenting experience, throughout her pregnancy. K was offered the Family Nurse Partnership Parenting Programme, which she engaged well with. K looked after herself and her unborn baby well during this time, and I accept N&#8217;s evidence that everyone around K noticed an improvement in her emotional regulation. Therefore, it is hard to see how the local authority can suggest that K&#8217;s past behaviour was a red flag for N at the time that CM was born. </p>

This tends towards a focus upon blaming staff and professionals closest in time to the incident. Outcome bias occurs when the outcome of the incident influences the way it is analysed. For example when an incident leads to a death it is considered very differently from an incident that leads to no harm, even when the type of incident is exactly the same. If people are judged one way when the outcome is poor and another way when the outcome is good, accountability becomes inconsistent and unfair.'"</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In short, it appears to me that this is the &#8216;trap&#8217; which the local authority has fallen into when it asks me to effectively use hindsight to fit all of N&#8217;s pieces of knowledge together, with the known outcome being that CM sustained significant injuries, and then to find that N failed to protect her granddaughter. But that does not reflect real life. N saw her daughter pull CM across the bed once, and she advised her not to do that again. She overheard both parents speak inappropriately to their daughter, and she told them not to do so. But nothing that she saw or heard could possibly have alerted her to the fact that one or other of the parents would harm CM, even within the context of these parent&#8217;s own challenges. The local authority&#8217;s case also ignores the fact that N would have also been seeing some wholly positive interactions and care during this period which would have indicated to her that K and E were taking on board her advice. </p>

In fact, I think it is important that this court offers her some reassurance that, in my view, there was nothing more that she could or should have done to prevent CM being injured in the way that she was. I am sure that N has spent much of the last year blaming herself in one way or another for what happened, but she should not. </p>
