The Father attended remotely from an undisclosed location and was represented by counsel.  He elected not to give evidence.  The Judge, Mr Justice Cusworth, found that the Mother had proved that the Father was in contempt of court and sentenced the Father to a period of imprisonment of 12 months.  That sentence was suspended for a period of 28 days to allow the Father an opportunity to return EF and apply to purge his contempt.  The Father did not take advantage of that opportunity and so, if the Father were to return to the UK, he would be arrested and, subject to any application to purge his contempt, would be required to serve that sentence of imprisonment.</p>

Nonetheless, it seems to me that this is a potentially meritorious application because the Mother is only having to incur the expenses of litigating in the UAE because of the Father&#8217;s failure to comply with orders made by this court.  However, even though I am sympathetic to the Mother&#8217;s position, there are a series of reasons why, at this point, it does not appear to me that I have power to make the order that the Mother seeks.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The law relating to the use of sequestration orders to assist parties give effect to a High Court order where a child is abducted abroad has some history.  Sequestration has long been used as a method of enforcing monies which ought to have been paid as part of family orders:  see Part 33 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold">FPR</span>&#8221;).  FPR 33.1 provides that Parts 50, 83 and 84 of the Civil Procedure Rules apply to enforcement and a sequestration order can be applied for under CPR 83.14A.  The underlying basis a sequestration order in family proceedings was explained by Scarman J (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Romilly v Romilly </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1964] P 22" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1964">[1964] P 22</ref> who said at p24 &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Sequestration is, however, a process of contempt</span>&#8221;.   However, in this case the Mother is not seeking to sequest the Father&#8217;s property in order to pay monies that are owed to her but for an entirely different purpose, namely to fund the costs of her litigating in the UAE where the need to do so has only arisen as a result of the failure by the Father to comply with return orders.  Any such application, as Mr Jubb rightly recognised, now needs to be made under Part 37 FPR and not under Part 33.</p>

Legal aid is not available for that purpose. The father has no funds. There is evidence from Irish solicitors, Messrs. Matheson Ormsby &amp; Prentice of Dublin, that in the ordinary way the Irish court will not look behind the United Kingdom order, and that an application would have a reasonable chance of success. They estimate that a one-day hearing would cost in the region of 5,000 Irish punts. At an exchange rate of 1.18 punts to the pound, this would be &#163;4,237.28 sterling.</span></p>

The evidence is that the house was bought in the mother's sole name on 17 June 1988 for &#163;35,750, with a mortgage from the Woolwich Building Society of &#163;31,000. On 14 March 1989 the sum necessary to redeem the mortgage was &#163;31,111.68. That is the latest figure available. It is said that the property would fetch &#163;60,000 to &#163;62,000, thus leaving an equity after deducting the costs of sale of something approaching &#163;30,000.

In that case the mother of a ward, who had been removed from the jurisdiction by his father without leave of the court in contravention of an order made in wardship proceedings, applied for the father to be committed to prison for contempt of court and for a writ of sequestration in respect of his property. On 13 June 1991 Sir Stephen Brown P. committed the father to prison for six months, suspended on his compliance with the court's order within one month, and granted the writ of sequestration so that sequestrators, acting on the court's instructions, might take possession of the former matrimonial home and let it or use it as security for a loan in order that the mother might finance litigation in Pakistan directed to seeking the return of the ward to the jurisdiction. The father having failed to return the ward to the jurisdiction, the mother applied for the sequestrators to be granted leave to sell the property.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">There are two points which arise relating to the new power of &#8220;confiscation&#8221;.  Firstly, there does not appear to be any limitation on the type of property of a person in contempt that can be considered for potential confiscation.  I thus consider that this real property could be subject to a confiscation application, as could any bank account standing to the credit of the contemnor or, for example, the contemnor&#8217;s beneficial interest in any pension fund.  Secondly, it seems to me that the change in the rules has probably not affected the range of powers open to the Court once an asset has been confiscated.  Thus, whilst damages are not available as a remedy for contempt (see Arlidge, Eady and Smith on Contempt and <span style="font-style:italic">JSC BTA Bank v Ablyazov &amp; Anor</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2016/230" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 230 (Comm)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 230 (Comm)</ref>).  Nonetheless, on an application for contempt in the Family Division, it appears to me that it is open to the court to confiscate the assets of a person who is held in contempt and then to direct that those confiscated assets should be made available to another party as a means of putting right the wrong which led to the contempt finding.  That appears to be the effect of CPR 37.1(2) which provides &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">This Part does not alter the scope and extent of the jurisdiction of courts determining contempt proceedings, whether inherent, statutory or at common law</span>&#8221;.</p>

The Mother could have sought a confiscation order at that stage in relation to the property, but I accept, of course, that the Mother could not have made an application to use the proceeds to fund the costs of litigation in the UAE because, at that point, she did not know where the Father was living.</p>

Chamberlain J must be right in saying that a person who fails to comply with a mandatory order by the stipulated date remains under a legal obligation to comply with the terms of the order, albeit he will perform the obligation at a later date than specified in the order.  If the court makes a mandatory order to require a party to take a defined step, such as to cease to live in a dwelling house by a defined date and the person fails to vacate the property by that date, the person cannot thereafter say that they are free from the obligation to leave the property.  It would be nonsensical to suggest that such a person is no longer under any duty to comply with the eviction order because they have failed to leave the property by the defined date.  It thus seems to me that the statement made by Chamberlain J that a failure to comply with a mandatory order by the defined date does not relieve the order of legal effect must be right and that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the obligation to comply remains&#8221;.</span></p>

Thus, it seems to me that, unless the Father seeks to purge his contempt, it is open to the Mother to bring fresh contempt proceedings against the Father arising out of his continuing failure to comply with the orders to bring EF back to the UK.  If such an application were to be made and the contempt was proven, it would then be open to a judge to make a confiscation order in respect of the property under FPR 37.9 and then direct the sale of the property and make order to provide that part or all of the proceeds of sale can be used to fund the Mother&#8217;s litigation costs in the UAE.
