They married in Nigeria in 1998.  Mr. A has a child from a previous marriage, who is now 23 years old and has recently graduated from university in Nigeria, studying law.  Unfortunately, and very sadly, her mother died in child birth, so Mr. A has been her main carer, responsible for her upbringing.</span></p>

She reports that following the death of her daughter she consulted a herbalist in Nigeria about fertility treatment.  In 2011 she presented for ante-natal care in this jurisdiction, stating to medical professionals that she believed she was pregnant.  Subsequent medical investigation found no evidence of that pregnancy, but did confirm a diagnosis of fibroids.  Mrs. A returned to Nigeria in April 2012 not returning back to this jurisdiction until September 2012.  She informed the professionals that during her stay in Nigeria she gave birth to B at the Ayodele Natural Specialist Hospital in Okitipupa, Southern Nigeria.</span></p>

The local authority completed their initial assessment in December 2013.  This raised no concerns about the day to day care being provided to B, but recommended, because of the circumstances outlined above, that a s.47 investigation was carried out due to the concerns about the risk of possible child trafficking.</span></p>

She concluded that neither of the parents presented with any symptoms of mental disorder which would prevent them from adequately caring for B.  In relation to Mrs. A's belief that she was pregnant and her reporting of physical symptoms consistent with pregnancy, Dr. Dove considered that this would be consistent with a diagnosis of a condition known as pseudocyesis, which is known to be associated with women who have never had children, or experienced a death of a child.  She advised that Mrs. A may benefit from an assessment to consider whether she would be amenable to any psychological intervention.</span></p>

The aim of the work was to assist Mr. and Mrs. A to support B to have an understanding of her identity, and the issues surrounding her birth and her birth parents.  Mr. and Mrs. A are the only parents she has ever known and this is evident, it is said, within their relationship.  The Schedule 1 report in the adoption proceedings describes both Mr. and Mrs. A having made good use of the sessions they have attended which have now concluded.  It is reported that it is evident from these meetings that both parents have a better understanding and acceptance of the circumstances that led to B's birth, and how they are going to communicate these events with B both now and in the future.  That report confirms it is evident from the observations during the social work visits that B remains happy and thriving in the care of Mr. and Mrs. A.</span></p>

The report prepared by Ms. Coker indicates that the clinic visited by the first and second respondents, Mr. and Mrs. A, is well-known to the Nigerian authorities as a result of allegations that it is involved in the practice of so-called "baby farming", in which the children of young mothers, who have often themselves been the victims of human trafficking, are sold for financial gain.  The particular clinic identified in Mr. and Mrs. A's evidence has now been closed by the authorities in Nigeria, and Ms. Coker was unable to make any further investigations in relation to the identity or location of B's birth mother or father.  She concludes that there is now no realistic prospect of any further steps being taken to identify B's birth parents.</span></p>

The relevant one in relation to family proceedings is the Child's Rights Act 2003. He confirms that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1971/77/section/146" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.146</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1971/77" uk:canonical="1971 c. 77" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> provides where a person has been adopted under any law in force in any part of Nigeria, or under the law of any other country other than Nigeria, the adoption shall have like validity and effect as if the adoption had been effected by an adoption under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1971/77" uk:canonical="1971 c. 77" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>.  He confirms by virtue of this section, an adoption order made by a court in England and Wales will be recognised and enforced in Nigeria.  There is no similar provision made for enforcement in Nigeria of a child arrangements order made here.  What he confirms is that an adoption order made by this court, or by a court in Nigeria, will give Mr. and Mrs. A parental responsibility over B.  Assuming that they intend to reside in Lagos state, the adoption order can be registered in the Adoption Children's Register by completing the form in Schedule 7 of the Child's Right Law of Lagos State 2007.

The evidence demonstrates Mr. and Mrs. A are able to provide the secure environment that her welfare requires. I am satisfied having considered the welfare checklist and looking at the life-long welfare needs of B in the very unusual circumstances she is in, the order that will best meet her welfare needs is if the court makes an adoption order.  I will give the local authority permission for leave to withdraw their care order and the application for a declaration of non-parentage.</span></p>
