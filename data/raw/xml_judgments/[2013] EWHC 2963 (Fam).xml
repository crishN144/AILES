If he did so, he did not learn anything from it, for in December 2011 the mother was subjected to a prolonged and vicious assault.  She describes amongst other acts being stabbed, punched, kicked, dragged by her hair, strangled to the point where she feared she would die, and being the victim of a sustained and degrading assault.  A part of that assault was witnessed by the children.  She has suffered a perforated eardrum and many soft tissue injuries.  He threatened to kill her and to have the house shot at with the children in it if she went to the police.  The full detail of this horror is spelt out in her two statements of 7</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;March and 25</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;June of this year.  It would be gratuitous to continue with this recital of her degradation at his hands.  In his post-arrest police interview under caution, though he baulks at some of the allegations made by her, he makes a series of admissions sufficient to ground the charges referred to below on any view.</span></p>

This was not his first brush with the courts.  To give some flavour of his criminal past, one has only to look at the list of his previous convictions provided to me in the police disclosure.  I&#160;can summarise it quickly.  Between 1997 and 2012 he has run up a daunting number of convictions, 10 offences against the person, three offences against property, six offences of theft and kindred, one public disorder offence, 14 offences relating to police courts and prisons, seven drug offences, one firearms/shotguns/offensive weapon charge, and miscellaneous others, amounting in all to a further 21.</span></p>

It is the assessment of the police that when the father is released from prison, possibly as early as September this year, that the mother, if ever found by him, would face a real risk to her life and limb.  It is an important feature of the case on any view, and has particular relevance to the two issues of change of name so that A and, of course, R and the mother herself, are not traceable, for A&#8217;s full names are particularly distinctive, and the question of how in practice in these circumstances the father could exercise parental responsibility should he continue to hold it.</span></p>

This finding rests significantly but not exclusively on the mother&#8217;s evidence, which I&#160;accept, that this father is interested in controlling her above all else and, frankly, not in A at all.
