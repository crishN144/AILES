Camilla Adeane has failed to apply to the Costs Court for standard assessment of her costs, and neither Respondent Desmond Fitzgerald nor the Patient&#8217;s estate have any liability to her for any costs arising from the Court of Protection proceedings. Camilla Adeane is no longer entitled to hold security against standard costs assessment in the Costs Court, and justice requires that the President of Family Division direct a hearing to revoke his Orders of 22 &amp; 24 March granting her such security.</p>

By her Letter of Instruction on 10 June 014 to the independent expert, personally authorised by the President, Frances Hughes asserts that she is in possession of the Patient&#8217;s medical affidavits for her committal in person and estate by the Court of Protection in July 1959. It is a matter of record in the President&#8217;s court that the Patient&#8217;s 1959 medical affidavits, which are central to any assessment of her capacity and best interests, were never given by Frances Hughes to either the independent expert or the Respondent. Justice requires the President to refer Frances Hughes to the Attorney General for falsification of her Affidavit of 16 December 2015 under Court of Protection Rule 14 at hearing in open court.</p>

These have been brought to the attention of HHJ Wright and a hearing has been requested in HHJ Wright&#8217;s court at which these issues can be addressed. Until the solicitor concerned is formally cleared of any dishonest connected with the transaction or her own evidence leading up to it,  HHJ Wright abuses her court&#8217;s own process by directing that a solicitor alleged to have engaged in dishonesty in these proceedings conduct the conveyance and sale of the Respondent&#8217;s home without any reference to the Respondent,  and extending even so far as to threaten the Respondent with imprisonment if he attempts to obtain information which transparent and just proceeding demands he be given. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s applications have six limbs. The first relates to the orders dated 22 and 24 March 2016, which he seeks to have revoked. This is a matter which I initially dealt with in my first judgment, footnote 9, and more recently by the order I made on 29 September 2016. As I have twice made clear to Mr Fitzgerald, this is an application, properly to be made in the Court of Protection, for which, as required by the ECRO, he first needs to obtain permission. He has never sought permission, and cannot evade this requirement, as seemingly he seeks to do, either by attempting to make a spurious link with the proceedings in the Family Court or by making an application in the High Court. If he is dissatisfied with the order of the Family Court, he can seek permission to appeal. So far as I am aware he has not done so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second limb of the application relates to Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s desire to see Frances Hughes committed for contempt of court. This is a matter which was canvassed extensively before me on a previous occasion and which is dealt with in some detail in my first judgment, where I said this, paragraph 40:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s application is, in all its aspects, misconceived, devoid of factual merit, in major part legally groundless and totally without merit. His allegations against Ms Hughes are scurrilous, fatuous and should never have been made. His application for her committal is a farrago of nonsense.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">I refused Mr Fitzgerald permission to bring a further application for the committal of Ms Hughes, pursuant to rule 14, as being totally without merit (see paragraph 24). This further application is equally devoid of merit. Moreover, it relates to the issue of A&#8217;s capacity, a matter I determined in a judgment delivered on 20 January 2015 which, as I pointed out in my judgment of 10 August 2016 (see footnote 2) has never been challenged by Mr Fitzgerald. Moreover, as is obvious if one looks at how Mr Fitzgerald puts his case in the application notice, there is no factual, logical or legal nexus between the alleged contempt and the proceedings in the Family Court. So even if there was any substance in Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s complaint against Ms Hughes (which there is not), I fail to see how it could possibly justify the stay of Judge Wright&#8217;s order which Mr Fitzgerald seeks.</p>

In the first place, Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s remedy, if he has one, is to seek to appeal Judge Wright&#8217;s order, not to seek relief in the Administrative Court. Secondly, if the order is to be stayed pending the outcome of proceedings in the Administrative Court, the application for a stay should be made to the Administrative Court, in the judicial review proceedings, and not to the Family Division or in the proceedings in which Judge Wright made the order.</p>

These allegations, largely un-particularised and, so far as the material Mr Fitzgerald has chosen to put before me allows me to judge, entirely devoid of merit, are scurrilous. Their pursuit in the manner in which Mr Fitzgerald has chosen to proceed is the plainest possible abuse of process.    </p>
