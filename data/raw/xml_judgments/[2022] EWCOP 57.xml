This has, in the Court&#8217;s view, served only ultimately to blight the relationship with P for them all in one way or another. By way of example, this Court was to hear evidence that family members felt unable or unwelcome to visit P spontaneously or without tacit agreement of the applicant resulting in consideration at the end of this case of a memorandum of agreement to visits by family members to see their mother. I understand that this has not been agreed but has been overtaken by effluxion of time.</span></p>

The Court heard evidence from a social worker for the Authority Social Social Services, primarily concerning the building works application element. Thereafter the applicant was heard and was allowed to be cross examined by respondents on questions that related to the decision to be made.

The evidence was that these carers came from 9.15 to 3pm and again in the evening but did not attend every day. These carers were employed directly, and I believe that these payments can be identified and taken into consideration as against the headline figure reached of &#163;96,775.74. Counsel set out in submissions the calculations, but the headline figure equated to &#163;71,158 crediting the &#163;40,629.16 left a net balance of &#163;30,528.84.

The remaining family members did not support this expense and the office of the public guardian positively objected for reasons this court found magnetic namely that the space at present was shown on balance to be sufficient for Ps current needs, the costs lacked clarity the quote not having been updated to enable the court to approve an exact amount and the court ought not to provide tantamount to a blank cheque and most crucially the OPG did not believe having heard all evidence this expenditure was ultimately in the best interests of P given her 96 years and potential short term use. I accept having considered the evidence that the OPG&#8217;s case is overwhelming and so do not approve that expenditure.  The consequential issues that may have flown from that element of the case fall away.
