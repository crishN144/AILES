The local authority could, therefore, have sought to challenge Dr Rippon on her conclusions in her report, but did not do so.

The crux of the local authority&#8217;s case in relation to the declaratory relief sought, was that it had provided evidence and a schedule of findings sought earlier in these proceedings which demonstrated the context in which it was operating. An analysis of the context was necessary to make the findings of fact and to provide a clear evidential basis for the declarations sought to be made. Such analysis could only have been carried out by hearing evidence. The other parties had had the opportunity to have those factual matters examined but had not sought to do so, and thus the subsequent application for declaratory relief was an abuse of process. </p>

Prior to that, the local authority had not been concerned with ND&#8217;s behaviour given his improvements.

The Court of Protection Rules do not include an express power to strike out a statement of case or to give summary judgment, but such powers are provided for in the Civil Procedure Rules, which apply in any case not provided for so far as necessary to further the overriding objective. The overriding objective is to deal with a case justly having regard to the principles contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> (Court of Protection Rules 2007, rule 3(1)). Dealing with a case justly includes dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate to the nature, importance and complexity of the issues and allocating to it an appropriate share of the court&#8217;s resources (rule 3(3)(c) and (f)). The Court will further the overriding objective by actively managing cases (rule 5(1)). This includes encouraging the parties to co-operate with one another in the conduct of the proceedings, identifying the issues at an early stage, deciding promptly which issues need a full investigation and hearing and which do not, and encouraging the parties to use an alternative dispute resolution procedure if appropriate (rule 5(2)(a), (b)(i), (c)(i), and (e)). The court&#8217;s general powers of case management include a power to exclude any issue from consideration and to take any step or give any direction for the purpose of managing the case and furthering the overriding objective (rule 25(j) and (m)). It was held in KD and LD v Havering London Borough Council <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 FLR 1393" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 FLR 1393</ref> that the court may determine a case summarily of its own motion, but their power &#8220;must be exercised appropriately and with a modicum of restraint&#8221;. </p>
