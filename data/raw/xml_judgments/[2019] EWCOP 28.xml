	    <p style="margin-left:0.78in;margin-right:0.08in">I did consider in both cases whether I should adjourn the applications in order for SR and JTA to be represented. However, it was quite clear on the evidence that both individuals, although assessed not to have capacity, were strongly supportive of being allowed to live at the named placements and of being &#8220;deprived of their liberty&#8221; in those placements. For the reasons set out below I also reached the clear view that it was in their best interests that this should happen. In the case of SR if I had adjourned the matter then it is likely that this would have led to a yet longer period in which he was unnecessarily (though not unlawfully) detained in a psychiatric hospital when he could have been in a more suitable community placement. In those circumstances I decided that the most appropriate course was to proceed to hear the applications and not adjourn for SR or JTA to be represented. I am confident that they have not been prejudiced by this course, and there is no interference in their article 6 or article 8 ECHR rights.  </p>

The assessment recorded that SR is highly socially embarrassed around women. SR considers that he requires 24-hour supervision around women in order to keep them safe from him. He focuses on his sexual thoughts and desires which obsess his thoughts. The opinion of the assessor was that SR has a distorted and egocentric perception of the world that makes him unable to weigh up the information needed to have capacity to consent to the care, treatment and support he needs to live in the community. He was therefore assessed as not having capacity in this regard. This is therefore a somewhat unusual case where the patient thinks he needs more supervision and more restrictions on his liberty, because he over estimates his needs and the risks he poses.  </p>

She gave three reasons for this conclusion. The first was that there would be an interference with the fundamental right to liberty if the Secretary of State could impose a condition depriving someone of their liberty, with no appropriate safeguards under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. The second, that the MHA imposes no coercive powers over the conditionally discharged and so practically any such deprivation of liberty would not be legally enforceable. The third reason was that to find such a power would be contrary to the whole scheme of the MHA because of the provisions on discharge of patients.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.08in">In the case of SR, it might be argued that the purpose of the deprivation of liberty and some of the other elements of the care package is the protection of the public, rather than the care of SR. However, for the reasons given by Moor J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">ZZ</span> I think that is a false dichotomy. It is strongly in SR&#8217;s best interests not to commit a further offence, or to place himself at risk of recall under the MHA, if the Secretary of State were to conclude that the risk of other offences was too great. In those circumstances the provisions of the care plan in terms of supervision and ultimately deprivation of liberty is, as Moor J put it, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">to keep him out of mischief&#8221;</span> and thereby assist in keeping him out of psychiatric hospital. This is strongly in his best interests, as well as being important for reasons of public protection.  </p>

However, on the facts of this case I have found that both patients would fall into the first category in any event. </p>

There is no inconsistency between the two orders, it is merely that under the MHA, as interpreted in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">M</span>, there is no power to deprive the patient of his/her liberty.
