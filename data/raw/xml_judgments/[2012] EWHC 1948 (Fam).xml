The psychologist made a school visit, two home visits and four contact observations.  In a detailed report, she reported that the children have a strong, secure emotional bond with their mother and a positive bond with their siblings and with Mr A.  Their relationship with their father was anxious-avoidant in J&#8217;s case and anxious-ambivalent in B&#8217;s.  The children were doing well at school and thriving at home, which was a calm and caring family environment.  The psychologist advised that the children should have </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">&#8220;regular, timetabled consistent experiences of direct contact&#8221;, </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">supervised in the first instance.  She also recommended therapeutic intervention for the children and parallel therapy for the parents.</span></p>

Had she applied the welfare checklist to this case she would have seen that it is not just about the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings and that it is not just about short term problems, but about medium to long-term issues.  Had she analysed the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings correctly she would have seen that they cannot be taken at face value.  They are instead, in my view, a reflection of the children&#8217;s loyalty to one parent, who happens to be, in this case, their mother.  I find that Miss H takes no account of the losses and the effective estrangement of the children from their father arising from her proposals. </span></p>

If you disrespect people, make up things about them and go on doing so you will, in the end, be in control of your situation.  J and B ought not to be in control of their situation.  Their views should be carefully considered, as I hope I have done, but I think that it would be directly contrary to their welfare to act upon the sorts of expressions of view that they have presented to adults.

At a stroke, this placed a geographical distance of 300 miles between the children and their father.  Given the very limited financial resources within the family, this is a huge practical obstacle.  It also amounts to a psychological obstacle: the children are old enough to get the message that their mother would not take them to live in Devon if she thought that it was important for them to see their father and family in Blackpool.</span></p>

The proceedings have been going on for over two years, with all the disadvantages that continual litigation brings.  The realistic alternatives now are to make a residence order to the father, immediate or conditional, or leave things as they are.  In that case, the children will not see their father or extended family in the foreseeable future unless the children live with him or the mother changes her behaviour.  A simple contact order has been tried repeatedly and will not be effective.  The question is whether the mother will change her approach if a change of residence is inevitable and not just possible.</span></p>

For instance, their behaviour at school and in the community appears to be acceptable, although their School notes that they are stressed after attempts to provide contact have been made.  The boys are not displaying antisocial behaviour or medical or depressive conditions which might also indicate confusion.  Overall, J and B display good communication and social skills and are able to interact in a pleasant and interesting way if the topic is not to do with contact with their father."</span></p>

I believe that once J and B realise that the Court is determined to see that its orders are carried out, and once they experience a return to familiar people and places, they will be relieved of the need to challenge and disrespect their father.  </span></p>

Although leaving the children to grow up in relative isolation of their mother's home is the easier short-term solution, it does not provide the foundations that they need for a healthy, rounded future.</span></p>
