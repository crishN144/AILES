Desirable as that may be, and such a regime may well provide the optimum care outcome for P, but it may also be the case that unless, regular contact can be facilitated to a particular family member, the distress and confusion caused to P would be such that it would be no longer in her best interests to be detained, and that what might amount to sub optimum physical care would ultimately be preferable to no, or insufficient contact&#8230;.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">Dealing with the legal submissions first, in my judgment the Applicant&#8217;s scope of consultation argument is misconceived. Paragraph 39(d) of PD11A is expressed in ordinary plain language and should be understood accordingly. The description of &#8220;anyone engaged in caring for the person&#8221; is plainly not limited to primary carers but is wide enough to include those who give care only for part of P&#8217;s living arrangements, including care during contact periods; and the description of anyone &#8220;interested in his or her welfare&#8221; does not import any limitation only to concerns about &#8220;P&#8217;s immediate welfare or near-future welfare.&#8221; I agree with Mr. Hallin that Mr. Paget&#8217;s suggestion otherwise artificially denies the obvious link between P&#8217;s long-term and immediate interests. Moreover there is nothing in paragraph 39 which <span style="font-style:italic">limits </span>the consultation to three people &#8211; &#8220;if possible, <span style="font-style:italic">at least</span> three&#8221; people in categories (c) and (d) should be consulted. It would clearly <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> meet either the letter or the spirit of paragraph 39 for the Applicant to &#8220;decide&#8221; whom to consult in such a way as to &#8220;bypass&#8221; those most obviously within the required categories. Mr Paget&#8217;s exposition of &#8220;apparent tensions&#8221; in paragraph 39(d) and how its requirements can be met in practice is, in my judgment, a strangulation of the plain language of the Practice Direction.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">I further agree with Mr. Hallin that the Applicant&#8217;s subjective view argument is a fundamental misunderstanding of the duty of full and frank disclosure. If it were to be up to the Applicant to determine whether a view which differs from its own is valid and therefore to be brought to the attention of the court or not, the duty of disclosure would be neither full nor frank. As set out in paragraph 46(2) above, it is a well-established principle of a duty of full and frank disclosure that the materiality of relevant information is to be determined by the court. If a person sensibly within the categories of person who ought to be consulted holds a view which is contrary to the Applicant&#8217;s, the Applicant must make that clear in the application, irrespective of its own view of the merits of that other view. In the context of a procedure designed for non-contentious applications, such factors clearly include indications that the proposal is in fact disputed, irrespective of the applicant&#8217;s view of the merits of that dispute. If explanation is needed as to why this is so, the Court of Appeal has set it out: the validity of the streamlined procedure as a mechanism for compliance with the obligations of Article 5 depends upon it.  </p>

The suggestion of a literal meaning which requires consultation with &#8220;anyone, except the most insensitive person, who has met P&#8221; is an unattractive resort to <span style="font-style:italic">reductio ad absurdum</span> which fails to give credit to the professionalism, experience and judgment which may reasonably be expected of social workers and best interest assessors. If the duty of disclosure extended only to concerns where alternative options were already identified, inactivity on the part of person under the duty would be rewarded and opportunity for proper enquiry denied. There is no threshold for bringing a challenge to a deprivation of liberty and any applicant for authorisation under the streamlined procedure must proactively inform the court of contrary views.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">Turning to the evidence of what actually happened in this case, I do not accept that JDO&#8217;s placement, at the time of filing the COPDOL11 application in November 2018, could reasonably have been considered by the Applicant as non-contentious. The Local Authority was clearly aware at least from the best interests meeting in May 2018 that JDO&#8217;s case managers and parents had significant concerns about whether the placement was meeting JDO&#8217;s needs. It was reminded in the Official Solicitor&#8217;s letters of May and August, and those concerns were confirmed again by the Official Solicitor in October. If Ms. Malomo really did not expect in November 2018 that this matter would become contentious, her expectations flew in the face of the available information.    </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In so far as the Applicant explains its expectation of this application being non-contentious as because it was &#8220;a renewal of the existing order,&#8221; I do not accept that such approach was either accurate in the circumstances of this case or appropriate generally to the streamlined procedure. The authorisation granted in June 2017 had expired (as Ms. Malomo recognises) so what was being sought was a new authorisation, not a renewal of an existing one. Even if a COPDOL11 application is appropriately made within the review period, the review process is <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> a rubber-stamping exercise. The purpose of the review is to enable a judge to make a fresh determination on up to date information. Authorisation in 2017 does not automatically lead to further authorisation in 2018. The whole purpose of the review is to scrutinise &#8211; on a proportionate basis, but scrutinise nonetheless - whether authorisation continues to be appropriate.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In so far as the parents&#8217; position is concerned, I am not persuaded by Ms. Malomo&#8217;s statement that &#8220;There was never any doubt about [OD]&#8217;s competence with regards to being Rule 1.2 representative for her son.&#8221; In my judgment, the information available to the Local Authority by November 2018 strongly indicates that there should have been doubt. Having voiced concerns at the best interests meeting, and initially refused to sign any form, if OD showed no disagreement when she met the social worker at the Local Authority offices on 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> October, such change of position at least called for exploration, of which there is no sign in Ms. Malomo&#8217;s statement. It is easy for persons in the position of OD to be overwhelmed by formality and procedures.  Having listened to OD and DD at the June hearing, in my view this risk should have been apparent to the Applicant. It is incumbent on those charged with the obligation to consult them to consider this risk and take appropriate steps to ensure that genuine views are obtained and reported. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In my judgment, it is not appropriate for the body with consultation obligations to &#8220;present&#8221; OD (or any person in her position in the proceedings) with a pre-prepared statement. The purpose of consulting with OD is to ascertain <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">her</span> views, so that they can be relayed to the court. It is not to put words into her mouth, or to persuade her to adopt the Applicant&#8217;s views. The contrast between the statement ostensibly made by OD and the letter written by DD is stark. There is significant distance between assisting a lay person to write their statement, and presenting them with a pre-prepared document for signing. The latter approach is highly unlikely to elicit genuine views. In this matter it amounts to a breach of the duty of full and frank disclosure. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In so far as the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position is concerned, such as was described in the COPDOL11 form is very far from a full and frank account by the Applicant and, in my judgment, knowingly so. The Local Authority does not deny that it received the Official Solicitor&#8217;s letters, and it offers no explanation for why they were not provided to the court as requested. Mr Paget accepts that &#8220;a lot of the initial confusion in this application&#8221; could have been avoided if they were. Including the letters with the application papers would not have been onerous to the Applicant. Its failure to put this information clearly before the court is a breach of its duty of full and frank disclosure. </p>

However, having received a response which was not to the Applicant&#8217;s liking, the Applicant then failed to put the result of the consultation before the court fully or indeed at all. Such as was included in the COPDOL11 form reflects the Applicant&#8217;s position, not the Official Solicitor&#8217;s. Thereafter, the Applicant went to extraordinary lengths to seek to avoid the Official Solicitor&#8217;s participation in proceedings, including apparently choosing an alternative solicitor for JDO. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">In fact this COPDOL11 application never progressed through the streamlined procedure further than issue. Its removal from the streamlined procedure was most immediately due to the receipt of DD&#8217;s letter, and then proactivity on the part of the JDO&#8217;s own representatives, but it is also some testament to the robustness of the streamlined procedure itself. However, the period spent working out whether the application had appropriately been made represents a delay in the progress towards final judicial determination. I have no doubt that had the application in November 2018 been made on form COP1 as a disputed welfare issue, it would have been put before the Urgent Business Judge (as is usual procedure at the central registry) and would have been listed for Case Management Conference within something like 28 days of issue. Instead, its first listed hearing was not until 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2019.   The very real consequence of the Applicant&#8217;s approach was delay and a longer period of unauthorised deprivation of JDO&#8217;s liberty.   </p>
