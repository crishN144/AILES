He is the subject of section 31 Children Act (CA) 1989 care proceedings issued by a Local Authority in November 2016 and of a subsequent oral application for declarations in respect of withholding medical treatment brought under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court (pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>). His mother (MC) does not agree to treatment being withheld; nor does she agree to there being a care order made. C is separately represented through his children&#8217;s guardian.

His lungs are damaged because of previous infections and he is susceptible to infection generally because he suffers chronic malnourishment. In addition, C has suffered from chronic severe acid reflux. C&#8217;s epileptic symptomology includes involuntary movements and dystonic spasms. When distressed his tone heightens (he becomes stiff); this occurs when he is suctioned to remove secretions. His life expectancy is limited. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There have been chronic concerns about C being underweight and under-nourished which are well-documented and had previously led to him being fed through a naso-gastric tube (NG). He was fed by an NG tube until 2011 after which he was fed orally. In 2012 C was the subject of a child protection plan under the category of neglect; care proceedings were issued in October 2012. In April 2013 the local authority was granted permission to withdraw proceedings to enable further intervention with the family in co-operation with MC.</p>

In March 2016 a NG was fitted to provide C with feed to supplement his oral intake of food. He was discharged on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April having had NG tube inserted; C gained weight during his admission to a weight of 21kg. On 14th April 2016 C was again placed on a Child Protection Plan under the category of neglect. On 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016 MC said that C had removed the NG tube; she resumed oral feeding and C&#8217;s weight fell again. MC declined to consent to an NG tube re-insertion. In May and June 2016 MC cancelled arrangements to visit a Hospice for an assessment of C.</p>

At some time between the middle of July to 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016 MC took C to Romania; she did not inform the local authority of this trip and so C was reported to police as missing person.

By 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016 C&#8217;s school had advised MC not to bring him into school because of concerns regarding his weight and high tone (stiffness in his limbs).</p>

There were previous care proceedings in 2012 which were withdrawn with the intention of being able to work in co-operation with MC. It is the local authority&#8217;s case that these proceedings were issued because of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;increasing concerns about the mother&#8217;s ability to co-operate with [C&#8217;s] treatment plans, medication and feeding.&#8221; </span>C&#8217;s weight has been a long-term concern of medical professionals responsible for his care; his low weight leading to occasions when he has been admitted to hospital for feeding tubes to be put in place. The local authority contends that there is evidence of MC&#8217;s difficulties in working with professionals over the years and her &#8220;disguised compliance&#8221;. The local authority&#8217;s case is that when discharged C should not return to the care of his mother but live in a specialist foster placement identified for him that can best meet his needs. </p>

It is their intention to put in place a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;redirection of management from life sustaining treatment to palliative&#8221;</span>. This would mean that all invasive treatment would be withheld and that only non-invasive interventions with the aim of improving C&#8217;s quality of life should be continued, such as the provision of oxygen, some suctioning, peripheral IV antibiotics, physiotherapy, CPAP, analgesia and secretion control. The Trust say that their application is urgent, principally because C&#8217;s condition fluctuates, and they seek an immediate order, a matter to which I shall return.</p>

Despite the many criticisms of her behaviour, and of some of the care she has given C, it is clear from his guardian&#8217;s observations, and those of his care support worker in hospital, that C gains comfort from her presence and is happy when she is there. Unfortunately, MC finds it difficult to take accept and act on advice that she does not agree with, or which does not coincide with her view of what is best for C. During his last, and present, admission to hospital, since October 2016, as the result of MC not complying with medical and nursing advice she was supervised when on the ward with C; and her time on the ward restricted to between the hours of 09:00 and 18:00. This time was increased to 24 hours a day while C was in ICU. </p>

Dr M has seen C the week prior to his admission and had said that if he did not gain any weight the intervening week he should be admitted to hospital; the concern was that C was not receiving sufficient nourishment whilst in the care of his mother. He did not gain any weight so was admitted to hospital where he was under the care of Dr N, one of the three paediatric gastroenterologists who have rotating duties for the in-patient children. As Dr N is on sick leave another consultant Dr K, a locum consultant who had taken over responsibility for C from Dr N, gave oral evidence before me. </p>

While it does not mean that such treatment would not prolong his life in certain situations I have to consider whether it or they are likely to result in an improvement for C or whether it is likely to leave him more disabled than before. The example is of CPR and its limited prospects of success and the risk that, if revived, C would be even more seriously disabled than before; a real risk for C is that he will sustain further injury as a result of the treatment such as broken ribs, or infection which could even lead to fatality by acquiring a central line infection or ventilation induced pneumonia. The curvature of his spine compromises his ability to breathe as it restricts his lungs and limits his respiratory capacity; this condition has worsened and will continue to do so; it makes aspiration more likely and more serious and has reduced his ability to recover from any further insult or infection. </p>

The impulse to take whatever action possible to prolong C&#8217;s life is entirely understandable, certainly from his mother&#8217;s view point but it is more questionable when one considers the fact that doing so is more likely than not to further compromise his quality of life. The intensity of the process of applying invasive treatments would mean that for the period the treatment is required C would have little or no contact with his mother and carers. All of these treatments carry significant risk and offer no guarantee of the prolongation of C&#8217;s life; indeed, they bring with them measurable costs. Every tube that is inserted is an invasion to his body and carries a risk of infection and/or further ventilator-associated lung injury. If the risks of invasive treatment are most likely to cause C increased suffering and produce no commensurate benefit it cannot be in his best interests; even given C&#8217;s or any human being&#8217;s desire to survive. C&#8217;s life expectancy is short and nearing its end, those treating him (and Dr D) have explained to me carefully how they wish to provide him with the optimal care and comfort to make the remainder of his short life as pain-free and as comfortable as is possible. </p>

This evidence was supported by the oral evidence of the care support worker J. She had clearly made considerable efforts to work along with MC and to build a positive relationship with her, and, she had spent many hours over several weeks supporting C and providing care for him, she had been with C five days a week from 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October to the end of November 2016. Her observations of C and his mother were sympathetic, empathetic and humane. She demonstrated physically and orally what C could do, how he moved and what he sounded like. Of the witnesses the court heard, J&#8217;s was the evidence that most brought C to life in the courtroom. J demonstrated how C much could move his hands, albeit in a very limited way, across and over the side of his face, and that he could not remove or even significantly move the NJ tube and the plasters. </p>

Dr K gave evidence that on more than one occasion he had to threaten MC with being removed from the ward to get her to comply with the decision to stop feeding C orally; on one occasion security had to be called (and remain on the ward for an hour) to ensure that MC did attempt not feed C orally with food she had brought to the ward on a tray. To do so would have put him a grave risk of aspiration, so that his already compromised lungs would be at risk of further damage and he would require further painful suctioning; this was explained to MC repeatedly, by the doctors and other medical staff. </p>

Dr K gave evidence about the length and placement of the NJ tube which is inserted down to the second part of the small bowel and the need for a radiologist to perform this procedure.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Clearly, C does not have the strength, physical co-ordination or ability to do so; nor is he able, as suggested by his mother to remove the plasters which kept the tube in place. Even though C&#8217;s epilepsy means he is susceptible to seizure and dystonic spasm, Dr K explained that while, and at most, this could explain the tube being dislodged it would not lead to a complete extraction of the NJ tube. The court is well aware that each time the NJ tube was removed it had to be re-sited using x-rays which exposed C to repeated doses of radiation as well as the discomfort of re-insertion for which he would have to be immobilised. When Dr. K had spoken to MC about it on 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016 she said the tube had &#8220;just fallen out&#8221;. This incident was witnessed by J and a health care assistant (HCA). J described MC lifting C who was lying in his bed with the working end of the NJ tube passing between the bars of the panel on the side of the bed. When MC did so the tube became dislodged by several centimetres but most remained inside C&#8217;s body. The HCA went to summon a doctor or nurse because this had happened leaving MC with J. J then described seeing MC holding the tube in her hand fully removed from C saying <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Oh! How did that happen!&#8221; </span>J said she did not see MC actually taking the tube out, but her evidence leads the court to the unavoidable conclusion that MC deliberately removed it, and was holding it in her hand. I have no doubt that this would have caused C some pain.</p>

J was not, as I have already said, unsympathetic to MC and was a witness who had tried to work with MC and to encourage her to heed the advice she was given, as well as offering her some personal support which she greatly needed. J described C enjoying the taste and texture for some foods in his mouth. She vividly described his way of communicating his pleasure by smiling, his pain (moaning and crying) and his dislike of persons and situations (when he would hiss &#8211; I was told he would sometimes hiss when doctors came near him). J was obviously much more attuned to C&#8217;s reactions than the doctors or nursing staff who had not spent as much time with C.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I found MC&#8217;s oral evidence in respect of the two removals of the NJ tube lacked any credibility; she said that it had happened, accidentally. She then claimed that C had removed the plasters holding the tube as they were no longer on C&#8217;s face when the HCA returned. This is incredible C simply does not have the ability to pull plasters off using his fingers; he is not even able to hold a spoon to feed himself. She also claimed the tube fell out because the plasters were not properly attached to C and that it had occurred accidentally. Her evidence was contradictory and inconsistent; her assertions that C himself was somehow responsible for removing the tube from his gut is both disturbing and telling. As his mother she must be very aware of the limits of C&#8217;s abilities, he is unable to make movements with his limbs voluntarily, that is quadriplegic spasticity. To suggest to me, in answer to a direct question, that he can use his fingers to pick at a plaster or grasp objects, something that is so patently obviously untrue, is an extraordinary example of hubris. In her determination to cover up for her own actions she has sought to &#8220;blame&#8221; her disabled son. </p>

Given the history of the removal the NG tubes in the past and MC then resuming oral feeding regardless of the malnourishment C suffered as a result, along with the inherent unlikelihood, if not impossibility, of the NJ coming out accidentally, it is more likely than not that she was responsible for pulling the NJ tube out deliberately on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2016.

He told me that she had brought a tray of food to C&#8217;s bedside and was intent on feeding him despite the fact that she knew C was not to be fed anything orally. He had to warn her that she would be removed from the ward if she persisted, which she did, security had to be called. Nurse Y gave similar evidence.  I find that the evidence of Dr K and Y is credible and that MC behaved in the way they described, and that her behaviour put C at risk both directly and indirectly. These are incidents that occurred prior to care proceedings being issued and, by the removal of the NJ tubes alone, MC caused C to suffer significant harm.</p>

J described MC&#8217;s behaviour; she was difficult to deal with and argumentative before, during and after the journey. When they got to the Hospice she lifted C onto her lap, despite having been told that to do so was contrary to his welfare. Once on her lap she proceeded to try to clothe him, she wanted to put a jumper on C. The jumper was in or on furniture behind where she was seated. The tube protruding from C&#8217;s gut was attached to a feeding drip on a stand; MC leant back in her seat towards the jumper which was out of her reach, she was demanding that she be given the jumper, in doing so she was pulling the PEG-J tube until taut. MC was perfectly well aware of what she was doing because, according to J, MC said that she (J) was to get the jumper and to observe what she (J) had made MC do to the tube. This was reckless and aggressive behaviour, and I accept J&#8217;s evidence, that this incident took place as she described. J was a careful witness who returned to her contemporaneous notes during her evidence to ensure that she was giving her best evidence. She had no reason at all to make up or falsify any account she gave, as was suggested by MC. Once again MC put C&#8217;s safety and well-being at risk in a bid to ensure that she was in control of the situation, and of C himself.</p>

Missing from the evidence before the court is a neurological assessment which will inform the treating physicians and thus the parties and the court as to the best treatment for C to alleviate his epilepsy and other symptoms. Any order or declaration made by the court regarding C&#8217;s treatment will be an interim measure until the neurologist has reported.

These potential benefits are to be considered beside the burdens to C of such treatments; to provide them would necessitate the use of a central venous line (via the neck or groin) or by using intra-osseus route which requires forcing a needle into the bone (usually the tibia) or by drilling a hole in the bone: this extremely painful. The insertion of a central line would, in turn, require C to be put under sedation or anaesthesia; it will also raise the risk of infection of the line and of hospital acquired infection. These treatments will reduce further the already diminished blood platelets thereby increasing risk of bleeding, pain and discomfort. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Trust contends that to provide continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is not in C&#8217;s best interests. The benefits of CRRT is that it would provide C with short-term replacement of his renal function which, if successful, would allow his kidneys to recover their natural function or, if unsuccessful, would enable kidney dialysis in the longer term. This treatment, which would potentially prolong C&#8217;s life, has to be given in a specialist unit, and would probably require intubation for transfer from RH to the unit; as happened previously when C was transferred to M Hospital. Intubation requires large intravenous catheter to be inserted into a central vein of C&#8217;s. The treatment is as, indicated, a short term measure only and if it does not work, C is unlikely to be a candidate for kidney dialysis because of his other conditions or co-morbidities. </p>

The benefit to C would be that if successful, it reverses the respiratory or cardiac arrest potentially prolonging C&#8217;s life. The burden to C would be that CPR does not treat the cause of the cardiac or respiratory arrest and, if ineffective, often results in a reduction in the oxygen being supplied to the brain causing hypoxic brain damage; C&#8217;s brain is already damaged. As already referred to, a burden of intubation is that it involves sedation and would immobilise C for a period potentially of days or weeks; which would be uncomfortable and reduce his ability to interact with anybody, including his mother and carers.  More seriously, as far as C&#8217;s health is concerned, intubation inevitably causes lung injury, which in turn, diminishes even further his already limited respiratory capacity, so substantially increasing the risk of lung infections such as ventilator associated pneumonia and ventilator associated lung injury. The former would be life-threatening for a child in C&#8217;s condition; the latter will add to the &#8220;vicious cycle&#8221; described by Dr D. </p>

Insertion of a tracheostomy tube would mean, of course, further invasive treatment bringing with it the risk of infection and associated burdens. It would also mean the loss of C&#8217;s already limited, precious and restricted means of non-verbal communication. His carer, J, whose evidence I have referred to above, explained C&#8217;s manner of communication and how she, his mother and others familiar with and to C, were able to understand C communicating pleasure, pain, happiness, contentment, enjoyment, discomfort and displeasure; it would be a considerable burden to C to lose this inestimable connection with others, including his mother.  </p>

J described to the court what it was like for C when it happened in December 2016 and in January 2017 after the PEG-J was inserted; C was not able to enjoy his surroundings or those around him as he had done previously.

MC undoubtedly brings to C comfort and reassurance, to reduce his ability to receive this solace is a very considerable burden to place on this very vulnerable child; it is clearly something that is of great significance in his life. The treatments which the Trust wants to withhold, have a limited potential to prolong C&#8217;s life for an unknown period, but most probably transient period before his condition deteriorates once more. None of the treatments offer any prospect of recovery for C nor can they halt an inevitable deterioration leading to his death.</p>

I keep that in mind, but it is C&#8217;s best interests that I must consider. In doing so it has to be recognised that C already suffers and experiences pain and discomfort and it is most likely that he already endures this regularly; in order to deal with secretions which would otherwise seriously compromise his respiratory function, C has to be routinely suctioned. The effect of suctioning clearly causes discomfort and likely pain for C displays it, not least by his limbs becoming stiff (dystonic) each time this procedure is carried out. </p>

All will cause him considerable pain and discomfort; they will all weaken this already vulnerable, fragile child and will all compromise his physical, psychological and emotional well-being, as well as reducing his ability to participate in and enjoy the society of others, including and especially, that of his mother. His frangible ability to communicate, at all, with MC and others will be removed. By allowing the medical treatment and the procedures associated with them, his decline towards his inevitable death will be all the more frightening, isolated and detached from the possibility of receiving, and in his limited way, giving, human warmth, love and comfort, directly as a result of the treatment he has received. It is clear to the court that C seeks and wants to be close to his mother (and to the carers that he likes) and would not want to end his life without being able to do so. It is in his best interests, taking all aspects of his life, medical, social, familial and emotional into account, that the Trust is granted the declarations that it seeks. They will be interim declarations until they can be reviewed and refined in the light of a comprehensive neurological assessment.</p>
