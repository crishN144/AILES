The Husband in this case is an obstetrician. At first blush, he is not typical of Court users who are assessed for the support of an intermediary. By whatever means the Husband manages his autism in his own professional environment, is not the concern of this Court. The concern of this Court is to ensure the Husband is able fully and fairly to participate in this process to ensure the Court has the best evidence available to reach a just result. Nothing less will ensure the appropriate application of the Overriding Objective.</span></p>

The Respondent placed money into a joint bank account that the Respondent had access to for bills/mortgage/household items/shopping and anything needed for the children. The surplus of monies was kept hidden from the Petitioner and she had no idea what these funds were used for.

The marital home at Sheppard Avenue was purchased by borrowing funds from the Respondent&#8217;s parents, which they obtained by way of a mortgage. The Petitioner was never shown any paperwork and was given the page for the signature only and would never see the entire papers. The Petitioner would never know what she was signing and went along with it as she felt conditioned by the Respondent to simply do as she was told. She was taken to the parents&#8217; home where a neighbour was present with both of the Respondent&#8217;s parents and was asked to sign the papers so that they could obtain funds on behalf of myself and the Respondent this was because the Respondent had a poor credit rating because he had been in arrears with his previous ex-Wife. The Petitioner was pressured by all three particularly the Respondent into signing the paperwork and this was witnessed by the neighbour. The Petitioner was never given full details of all the paperwork, all the papers or how the mortgage was being set up. The Petitioner didn&#8217;t even know who they were borrowing the funds from. All the Petitioner was told was that it was an interest only mortgage as this was all they could get and we then owed the monies to them.</span></p>

The Petitioner would say she managed to get a cot in one corner of the room and I put posters on the wall trying to make it more child focused.

The Respondent notes that he has a diagnosis of Level 1 Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Although this diagnosis has only recently been given to him, the Respondent considers that his behaviour throughout the purported marriage was very similar in nature to that prior to when the Petitioner first met the Respondent. In addition, the Respondent believes that the Petitioner&#8217;s description of the behaviour of which she complains as having been present &#8220;throughout the relationship&#8221;, indicates that she considers his behaviour to have not changed during the relationship. In the light of the fact that there is no suggestion of the behaviour complained of by the Petitioner amounting to a change in behaviour from prior to the purported marriage, the Respondent cannot see how such behaviour can fulfil the statutory requirement for it to constitute behaviour such that the Petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, as the Petitioner would have clearly have been aware of the nature of the Respondent&#8217;s behaviour prior to the purported marriage and effectively accepted it by entering into the purported marriage.</span></p>

In any event, he believes that even if the Court were to find that this was the case, such behaviour is a part of his personality (particularly having autism) and was present before the purported marriage such that the Petitioner was well aware of it when such a marriage allegedly took place and cannot constitute behaviour such that the Petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Respondent.</span></p>

The Respondent believes that the fact that it is the Petitioner&#8217;s case that she proposed marriage to the Respondent in 2012, shows how the Petitioner is clearly willing to be completely untruthful with the Court and that even her Amended Petition is totally without merit.</span></p>

The Respondent believes that such safety measures were put in place by both parents as a matter of common sense and there was nothing controversial about this whilst the Petitioner and Respondent lived together.</span></p>

The Respondent is clear, however, that the Petitioner thought that installing a safety gate was a good idea for the safety of the children and was totally in agreement with his installing it.</span></p>

For the avoidance of doubt, the Respondent disputes that he was controlling during the relationship, that he is manipulative or that he behaves in a bullying manner. The Respondent notes that he has a diagnosis of Level 1 Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Although this diagnosis has only recently been given to him, the Respondent considers that his behaviour throughout the purported marriage was very similar in nature to that prior to when the Petitioner first met the Respondent. In addition, the Respondent believes that the Petitioner&#8217;s description of the behaviour of which she complains in her initial Petition as having been present &#8220;throughout the relationship&#8221;, indicates that she considers his behaviour to have not changed during the relationship. In the light of the fact that there is no suggestion of the behaviour complained of by the Petitioner amounting to a change in behaviour from prior to the purported marriage, the Respondent cannot see how such behaviour can fulfil the statutory requirement for it to constitute behaviour such that the Petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, as the Petitioner would have clearly have been aware of the nature of the Respondent&#8217;s behaviour prior to the purported marriage and effectively accepted it by entering into the purported marriage.</span></p>

		<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">During cross examination the Wife amplified this particular issue and having explained her concerns she went onto explain how she found a solution. Essentially, the Wife took the advice of her friends and utilised a travel cot with a new matress as a short term solution pending the house move. Regarding the Husband&#8217;s reaction to this the Wife said: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say it was against his wishes, because I hadn&#8217;t discussed putting that travel cot up in the bedroom; it was just an idea that someone had and said, &#8220;so your child can be safe&#8221;.  I&#8217;d said beforehand to the Husband, &#8220;you know this isn&#8217;t safe; we ought to buy a cot&#8221;.  And his words were, &#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t need to buy a cot because we&#8217;re going to be moving soon and then [the child] will eventually go in a bed and he could use that cot&#8221;.  So, he didn&#8217;t want to purchase something, but I was concerned about the safety of our child, so obviously, that was sorted out.  And then, I remember the Husband coming home that evening and going to the bedroom; I was in the bedroom at the time when he walked in.  And he just looked at the travel cot and went, &#8220;hmm&#8221; and walked off.  But no, there was no conversation about, &#8220;How dare you have a travel cot&#8221;, it was just; it happened, it was dealt with, so he [the child] was safer.&#8221;</span></p>

This was consistent with the Husband&#8217;s response in evidence whose response to this example was to say that he had questioned the efficacy of replacing beds prior to removal saying that he thought it not to be a good idea to buy packaged furniture which would then have to be taken apart on moving. He said that he was unable to understand this allegation until it was fully explained in cross examination and having listened to the Wife&#8217;s explanation, he recalled that whilst his Wife did see the bedding to be a problem, she nevertheless found a solution by using an alternative bed for the child.</span></p>

Each of the quotes is derogatory in its content and if said would be unpleasant to hear no matter what the context. Neither the statement nor the Wife&#8217;s oral evidence is specific as to when any of the phrases were used. Indeed, there is no corroborative evidence that any of the phrases were used during the time the Parties were living together, or whether the Parties had lived together for 6 months following any of the alleged phrases having been used. Whilst it would normally be reasonable to assume that allegations of the Husband&#8217;s behaviour contained within the Petition and the statement would be restricted to the period when the Parties were living together, when I consider the Wife&#8217;s evidence as a whole, and the Husband&#8217;s flat denial to use such statements are not find myself able to assume or indeed to find that these comments were made by the Husband, let alone during the course of cohabitation.</span></p>

The Wife says, &#8220;The Respondent would never allow free access to our home for the children. They were only allowed in the back living room of the house. The Respondent put a safety gate across the area between the living room and the kitchen area and I therefore filled this room with toys to try to make it as entertaining for the boys as possible as they were only allowed in this area each day behind the safety gate.&#8221; In the Wife&#8217;s evidence she conceded that the two living areas in the house and the main living area was part of the kitchen. In his evidence the Husband explained that the house had an open plan living area, that there was a small living room at the front which was reserved as an adult room and at the back of the house was much bigger and have patio doors leading to the garden. The Husband explained that this was the room for the children, and they use it as a playroom/family room. The Husband confirmed that he had put a gate restricting the movement of the children into areas of the house where they could come into danger although consider this to be perfectly reasonable and explained that as he was out of work all day, when the Wife had exclusive control of the children, she was perfectly at liberty to let them wander wherever they chose. It was clear from Husband&#8217;s evidence that he was at an absolute loss as to how this behaviour could be described as giving rise to the Wife concluding that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him, and I agree with the Husband&#8217;s position.</span></p>

The Wife also accepts that during the evening the Parties conversed. Considering this allegation in the context of the marriage it seems to me that this is a further example of the Wife exaggerating. There may have been the odd occasion when the Husband has been busy working on his computer and focusing on a matter when he&#8217;s asked not to be interrupted. I do not accept that the Wife has sufficiently made out a case that this was even a frequent event or even that it was usual.</span></p>

The Parties evidence differs as to how the Wife became involved in Avon the material allegation is that the Wife maintains that the Husband effectively controlled the Wife&#8217;s engagement to the extent that he was dictating where she should canvas and when she should leave the home to distribute sales literature. It is the Wife&#8217;s stated case that she took on the agency for some independence, but the Husband&#8217;s controlling nature would not allow this. The Husband&#8217;s position as stated in his oral evidence was that the Wife informed him that she had signed up to Avon and told him, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to have to do all the computer stuff&#8221;. He says that far from interfering in the agency he was supportive and carried out the administrative function which the Wife was unable to undertake. During the Wife&#8217;s evidence I formed the view that she had overstated her position. I refer particularly to the allegation of the Wife that the Husband directed where she should canvas and where she must work when those directives came from the company itself. In my judgment, the Wife again exaggerated to the point where she presented a false picture in an attempt further to present the Husband as controlling. </span></p>

It may be that the Wife regretted having committed herself to undertaking quite strenuous and demanding work while pregnant but there is no cogent evidence that the Husband&#8217;s approach was controlling or disproportionately intrusive. Any impression of this, the Wife had should have been regarded by her in the context of the Husband&#8217;s autism, as I explain later.</span></p>

It involves the Parties signing mortgage guarantee documentation at the home of the Husband&#8217;s parents. The Wife presents a picture of the Husband and his parents conspiring to have the Wife sign documentation the results of which would give the Husband&#8217;s parents an interest in their future property. I am troubled by this having been given as an example of financial control within the marriage. Firstly, because whatever occurred, and it is impossible to establish exactly what did occur, it certainly did not occur during the marriage. This means that the Parties married after such behaviour occurred and that they remained living together for a far greater period than six months after the event.</span></p>

		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">An incident occurred on 9 March 2017 which the Wife claims was the final straw in the relationship between herself and the Husband and which prompted her to leave him. The Parties did separate, and they had not lived together since. The Wife&#8217;s account of the incident as set out in paragraph 29 of her statement presents a rather different picture to the way in which the incident is referred to by His Honour Judge Baker in a judgement handed down in the Parties&#8217; Children Act proceedings, to which I have been referred. According to the Wife in her statement in these proceedings, whilst dropping Joseph at nursery she became convinced that she had brought Daniel with her and that he was not in her car. His Honour Judge Baker was rather more forthright in his description of what happened and describes the incident as a, &#8220;Bizarre set of circumstances caused by the Wife having forgotten that she didn&#8217;t have Daniel in her care and that he was in the safe hands of the father&#8221;. What followed was the Wife reporting to the police that Daniel was missing and the police visiting the family home. Whatever the Wife told the police resulted in the police accusing the Husband that he had abducted Daniel. This incident has to be set in the context of a father being at home looking after his child while the child&#8217;s mother took the other child to nursery and then suddenly being confronted by uniformed police officers making allegations of child abduction. An event of this type would be difficult enough for any father to comprehend let alone cope with but for this Respondent an autistic person, the police allegations must have been horrific. What followed is not contentious and was little short of a nightmare for the Husband who was arrested under the Mental Health Act and detained for assessment. Meanwhile his child was removed from his care and placed with social services. The Husband was subsequently (after several hours wait) assessed by a psychiatrist and fortunately immediately released. This incident has been (and remains) the subject of findings in other proceedings and I have no intention of attempting to make findings which may not be consistent with those already found as I understand they remain contentious. My finding on the information, which is uncontentious, is that the Husband&#8217;s behaviour in this overall context is not such as would meet the relevant test. </span></p>

The law is clear, though, that the behaviour referred to need not have caused the breakdown and need not have even taken place during the Parties&#8217; marriage. As stated above, provided the behaviour did not come to the knowledge of the Petitioner more than 6 months prior to the date of separation, it does not matter that the behaviour may have occurred prior to or even on the day of the Parties&#8217; marriage.</span></p>

Whatever the Husband alleged, the Wife confirmed that at no time did she feel the marriage was not valid. When Mr Thomas says he will leave it to the Court to measure this aspect of the Husband&#8217;s behaviour against the test, he was right to say this in the context of their being a dearth of evidence to draw upon. It could have been pleaded that the Husband&#8217;s behaviour had a devastating effect on the Wife as the denial goes to the very heart of their union; this is not how this issue was pleaded to the Court. If I look at this aspect of the Husband&#8217;s behaviour wholly objectively, I could reach a conclusion that no party to a marriage could reasonably be expected to live with their spouse when the spouse is in absolute denial of the lawful existence of the marriage. However, the application of the test is, as I have stated above, more nuanced; I have to reach a conclusion as to how this behaviour has affected this Petitioner. The evidence of this is limited to the wording contained in the Wife&#8217;s statement. It is not even pleaded in the Amended Petition. While I accept that the Wife was extremely pleased to be able to prove that she had been lawfully married to the Husband there is insufficient evidence before the Court for me to find that the Husband&#8217;s continued denial has so much impact on the Wife that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">this Wife</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> cannot reasonably be expected to live with</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> this Husband.</span></p>

As I stated in my introduction, I must consider the effect of the Wife&#8217;s knowledge of the Husband&#8217;s late diagnosis of autism and how this informs my application of the test. The evidence I have, suggests that the Wife did not know the Husband had a formal diagnosis of autism until after the Parties separated: after the proceedings were issued but before the Petition was amended. </span></p>

		  <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.55in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I am satisfied, having heard the evidence and considered the reference material I have named, particularly the ETBB, that the Husband&#8217;s autism is likely to have had a significant impact upon the manner he has behaved throughout the marriage (and where relevant, before the marriage). In so far as there was a period the Wife did not know of the diagnosis of autism it may be understandable that she may have reacted badly to aspects of the Husband&#8217;s behaviour. Once, though, the Wife (as a trained and qualified social worker) was put on notice of the diagnosis, either formally or otherwise, it is appropriate to expect her to make such allowances or adjustments as are reasonable. Rather than making simple allowances, my view is that the Wife has sought to capitalise upon the Husband&#8217;s autistic traits as evidence of behaviour to attempt to satisfy the test. I am not suggesting that any type of behaviour from someone who is autistic has to be tolerated; that would make a nonsense of the way the Court of Appeal has directed the test should be applied. I am looking at this marriage and this Petitioner and this Respondent. Here we have a marriage between a doctor and a social worker; both professionals who can reasonably be expected to show a level of empathy and professional understanding of the personalities of the other within the marriage they have committed to.</span></p>

My view is that it would be potentially wrong to make this finding at this stage. Upon the dismissal of these proceedings either party may commence fresh proceedings under the new law, and it will be for a judge in those proceedings to make such a declaration if appropriate. It is unnecessary that I do so, and to do so may be seen as to fetter the discretion of the Court in any future applications.</span></p>

In the appellate proceedings they have run up costs of about &#163;15,000 each. It can therefore be seen that the sums paid in costs completely dwarf the sums they were arguing about. Time and again judges point out the madness of litigating in this way; and time and again their admonitions fall on deaf ears. At the end of the day all we can do is to express concern about such extreme folly, and if it is ignored then the parties will have to live with, and take responsibility for, the consequences of their decisions.</span></p>

The essence of the defence to the divorce was in two parts. The first and most significant element of the defence was that the parties were never legally married. It was the Respondent&#8217;s case that the parties had undergone a ceremony of marriage in Australia but that the marriage was not legally recognised by the Australian authorities as amounting to a lawful marriage upon which a petition could be issued. The Respondent took advantage of the Petitioners inability to locate a certified copy of the marriage certificate; the petition was supported by a record of the marriage ceremony which was considered sufficient by the Court staff to issue the petition and for the divorce to progress to a decree nisi (subsequently appealed and rescinded for unconnected reasons). During the proceedings the Petitioner&#8217;s solicitor faced immense challenges in obtaining a certified copy of the certificate from Australia and incurred significant expense in doing so. Once the copy was obtained, I struck out this element of the Answer and ruled in an extempore judgment that the Respondent had known all along that the marriage was lawful. The Respondent attempted to appeal this decision and ruling but was unsuccessful. In my judgment the Respondent&#8217;s approach in this regard was conduct which it is appropriate to take into account when considering the question of liability for costs.</span></p>

In addition, the parties have been extensively involved in private children proceedings which began in this Court and have been subsequently transferred to the Family Court at Lancaster. My assessment of the offer made by the Respondent is that it was entirely reasonable and appropriate for the Petitioner to refuse the offer. I go further to say that the making of an offer in these terms was more likely than not an attempt by the Respondent to place inappropriate pressure on the Petitioner and was an attempt to extend the course of this litigation unnecessarily and in contravention of the Overriding Objective.
