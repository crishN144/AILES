	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I agree with the reasoning of the District Judge. It seems to me that reference to &#8216;protective measures&#8217; in Schedule 3 is intended, and generally understood, to refer to arrangements that have been made or approved by a foreign court. It may not be spelled out explicitly but the language of paragraph 19(3) in particular confirms that intention and understanding: each of the circumstances in which the mandatory requirement can be disapplied clearly envisages court proceedings. I have not found any authority which casts doubt on that understanding. JMK&#8217;s Power of Attorney has been through no court process at all. It is not even subject to a system of registration.  It therefore does not fall within the general understanding of the term &#8216;protective measure&#8217; for the purposes of recognition by this Court pursuant to Schedule 3.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">More widely, it seems to me that PH&#8217;s understanding of the Power of Attorney at the time when it was granted (as set out in paragraph 16(a) above) captures a more accurate understanding of the nature of the instrument executed by JMK. If validly executed, a Power of Attorney is better characterised as an exercise of autonomy (even if it provides for a time when the donor is no longer capable of autonomous decision-making) than as a &#8220;protective measure.&#8221;    </p>
