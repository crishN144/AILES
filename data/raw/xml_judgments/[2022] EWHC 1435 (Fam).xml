	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with Archie Battersbee, a boy aged 12, who was born on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2010.  He is the much loved and loving son of the First and Second Respondents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee.  For convenience I have referred to the Respondent parents as &#8220;Archie&#8217;s mother&#8221;, &#8220;Archie&#8217;s father&#8221; or as &#8220;Archie&#8217;s parents&#8221;.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Barts Health NHS Trust is making two applications in relation to Archie.  The first is for the Court to make a declaration that Archie is brain stem dead and that he was dead on a particular date and second, if the Court is not able to make that finding, then the Court should consider whether it is lawful and in Archie&#8217;s best interests to continue to receive mechanical ventilation.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The applications are opposed by Archie&#8217;s parents.  Archie&#8217;s mother has been sitting at his bedside for the past eight weeks.  His father has been visiting frequently.  They rightly say they know their son best.   They rely on recent video evidence that they say shows Archie gripping the hand of his mother and tears coming from his eyes.  The family argue that Archie needs to be given more of a chance for his brain to recover.  They would like to take him home although more recently it appeared that they accept that he will not be able to go home but that they would like him to die naturally in the hospital as that accords with their Christian faith. </p>

Proceedings of these kinds although rare, are a particular strain on everybody involved and I was very grateful to counsel for the parties for their kind and sensitive approach to the issues raised by this unusual case.   Mr Quintavalle and those instructing him were acting pro bono for some if not all of this time and my thanks to him for his considerable work on behalf of Archie&#8217;s family.  </p>

His mother, and Ms Carter, his brother&#8217;s partner and the family spokesperson, were also present.  They were holding his hand.  From what I know, the mother has hardly left his side in the eight weeks since his accident.  I saw the bedside chair which converts into a single bed which she has been sleeping on. </p>

When they arrived he had had a cardiac arrest and had no pulse and spontaneous circulation was only achieved at 4.48pm.  During this period of cardiac arrest, it seems Archie&#8217;s brain was starved of oxygen and blood supply for a number of minutes.  </p>

As I observed during the hearing, the law clearly recognises that physical harm can be caused to an unconscious person. In the criminal law, for example, an unconscious person can suffer actual or grievous bodily harm and it would be no defence to a charge under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100" uk:canonical="1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict.) c. 100" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Offences against the Person Act 1861</ref> that the victim was unconscious. The judge was in my view entirely justified in citing examples from the law of tort in which it has been recognised that physical harm can be caused to an insensate person. As Mr Mylonas observed, if the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant was correct, there would be no limit on a doctor's ability to perform any surgery upon any insensate patient. For my part, I fully endorse the judge's reasoning for rejecting the appellant's proposition at paragraph 76 of his judgment.</span></p>

That case was decided on very different facts. Unlike Pippa, Tafida retained a minimal awareness, was in a stable condition, was not suffering life-threatening episodes of desaturations, and had received ventilation for a significantly shorter period. The level of support required by Tafida was not of the same degree of complexity and there was unanimity amongst all the doctors, including the treating clinicians, that she could be ventilated at home. Her condition and the treatments she received for it did not give rise to physical harm on the scale endured by Pippa in this case. In cross-examination, Dr Wallis acknowledged that the treatments given to Pippa were "on a spectrum of burdens". Furthermore, as demonstrated in the passages cited above from MacDonald J's judgment, the arguments advanced on behalf of the hospital trust in that case to the effect that it would be detrimental for Tafida to undergo the treatment proposed by her parents notwithstanding the fact that she could feel no pain were expressed in terms of dignity. In the present case, the Trust has not presented its arguments in those terms and the judge concluded that it would not assist him in this case to adopt any supposedly objective concept of dignity. In any event, it is worth noting that the argument presented to MacDonald J, as quoted in paragraph 176 of the judgment in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Raqeeb</span><span style="color:#000000">,</span></p>
