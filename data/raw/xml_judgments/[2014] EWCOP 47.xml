For this I am extremely sorry. I have acted in the way I did believing that it was in CS&#8217;s best interests. Whilst I failed to keep full receipts of the expenditure, the money was used towards the upkeep of the family home in the same way as CS acted before he lost mental capacity and it was necessary for me to act as attorney.</p>

However, should the court not be minded to allow this, I would not object to the appointment of a panel deputy to act on their own.&#8221; </p>

If the court decides to restore to Marvin the power to make health and welfare decisions, he must understand his responsibilities as an attorney and that the actions and decisions taken on behalf of CS must comply with the Code of Practice. In addition, they must be decisions taken solely in CS&#8217;s best interests, having consulted with the relevant people - professionals and family members &#8211; and having considered all the options available.</p>

The Public Guardian&#8217;s statutory duty is to investigate concerns about the actions of attorneys when they are brought to his attention. If he finds that the concerns are without foundation, then no further action is taken. Unfortunately, in this instance, the Public Guardian has seen nothing in the witness statements of Marvin or MM which allay his concerns that Marvin may still not be fully aware of his role and responsibilities as CS&#8217;s attorney for health and welfare.</p>

If the court decides to revoke the health and welfare LPA, the Public Guardian suggests that the court would want to consider if there is any need for the appointment of a deputy for health and welfare.&#8221;</p>
