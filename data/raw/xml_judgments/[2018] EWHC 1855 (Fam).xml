	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Real ownership can differ from formal or nominal ownership. A property may be held in someone&#8217;s name but be really owned by somebody else. This is the very essence of the idea of a trust. One can see many reasons, even in ancient times, why someone would wish to obscure his or her real ownership of an asset. However, an obvious presumption or starting point in any enquiry about real ownership is that the formal owner is the real owner<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0in"><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Kernott</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/53" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 53" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 53</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 AC 776" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 AC 776</ref> at [17] and [51(1)] </p>
	      </authorialNote>. Another presumption or starting point is that the real ownership jumps or springs back (in Latin <span style="font-style:italic">resultare</span>) from the formal owner to the person who actually paid for it. This is the idea of the resulting trust, the name of which derives etymologically from the Latin. But these presumptions only tell you where you should start, and not by any means where you should end. Presumptions have been described by an American judge over a hundred years ago as the &#8220;bats of the law, flitting in the twilight, but disappearing in the sunshine of actual facts&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Fundamentally, an enquiry about the real ownership of a piece of property seeks to discover what were the intentions of the relevant actors when it was acquired. If the court discovers a common intention between the relevant actors then it will be given effect. Sometimes, there is an express written agreement and in such a case, in the absence of fraud, that will almost invariably be the end of the matter. Sometimes, less commonly one would imagine, there is no express written agreement but it is said that </p>

	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">there has been an oral one. Here the court has to determine whether there has in fact been such an agreement, and if so what it was. Sometimes, there is not even an oral agreement, but the court is nonetheless able on the evidence to infer the existence of a tacit agreement from the conduct of the actors. In what must surely be the exceedingly rare case where one simply cannot infer the existence of even a tacit agreement or understanding the Supreme Court has held that the court can impute to the parties the fair agreement they would have reached had they thought about it<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">
		  <p class="footnotedescription" style="margin-left:0in"><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Kernott</span> at [87]. </p>
		</authorialNote>. Given that one would expect a relevant starting point or presumption to operate in the absence of a common understanding I would have thought that the unfairness which the imputation process redresses would have to be very extreme for that process to apply. I am unrepentant in my view that this process of imputation can be utilised whether the property is held by one single actor or more than one. Fortunately, I do not have to grapple with this issue, as I am perfectly satisfied in this case that the issue can be decided by reference to the common understanding to be deduced from the actors&#8217; conduct. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The search is thus for the actors&#8217; intentions. In order to discover those intentions, the relevant evidence surrounding the acquisition is examined and in many cases swathes of evidence both following and preceding the acquisition, perhaps stretching over decades, is also scrutinised.  A principle, which derives from common sense, is that if a person has repeatedly proclaimed to all and sundry that he does not own a piece of property, and that it is held by others, then he will find it difficult, but not necessarily impossible, to persuade a court that he in fact really owned it all along<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">

The company had been formed as a holding vehicle for the main trading entity, Fast Fones Direct Ltd (as it was originally named). Fast Fones Direct Ltd had been incorporated on 17 May 1999. On 21 May 1999 its two issued one-penny shares were transferred from the formation agents to Ray Goodwin and Charmaine. As I will explain, there were good reasons for Ray Goodwin to act as nominee for Richard, but none whatsoever for him so to act for Wanda.

It is especially remarkable when you reflect on the fact that in the 1980s Wanda had engaged in fierce High Court litigation with Richard&#8217;s father about the real ownership of 45 Addison Gardens. In that case Wanda argued that she was the real owner even though there was nothing in writing to say so. Eventually she won, but only after a massive trial. Of all people, Wanda must have realised in 1999 the importance of recording in writing the real ownership of something she claimed was hers. </p>

I am satisfied that he did so in order to pursue a business venture in mobile telephony, the germ for which had formed in the minds of him and Charmaine during her year in France which endured from September 1995 to June 1996. I am absolutely satisfied that Wanda did not contribute to the idea or to its execution beyond providing space for the venture at 45 Addison Gardens. Wanda had no business experience and did not have any knowhow in the emerging modern world of mobile telephony.  It was for this reason that she was not a partner in the business. She held no shares in it. They were registered in the sole name of Richard. Charmaine alleges that all material times she was a real co-owner of those shares. That may or may not be true, and I do not need to decide that, but what is clear beyond any </p>

I have the initial accounts of the company for the period 10 June 1997 to 30 June 1998. These accounts, signed by both Richard and Wanda on 26 March 1999, proclaim that Richard was the beneficial owner of the two issued one-penny shares in the company. There was no reason whatever, if it had been intended that Wanda should be a shareholder in the company, for her not to have been made one and for that to have been recorded in the accounts. I do not see how Wanda and Richard, having signed a public document that recorded Richard to be the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">beneficial</span> owner of the issued shares in the company, can be allowed to repudiate that declaration.  </p>

As mentioned above, Fast Fones Direct Ltd was incorporated on 17 May 1999 and on 21 May 1999 its two issued onepenny shares were transferred from the formation agents to Ray Goodwin and Charmaine. Ray Goodwin is a retired lecturer in chemistry and biochemistry and an old and very close friend of Wanda. His address in Roehampton was used as the new company&#8217;s registered address. It is true that Charmaine&#8217;s address on the stock transfer form was given as 45 Addison Gardens. This might suggest that the policy of camouflage was not being well implemented. However, this fact would only become publicly available on the filing of the annual return in May 2000, by which time the problem with Orange would have been well in the past. It is perfectly obvious that Ray was being used as a front man for Richard for the reasons set out by Richard in his witness statement. Ray said to me, in very emotional evidence, that he was as sure as hydrogen and oxygen make water, that Wanda was the true owner of the company, but I am sorry to say that I believe that his blind loyalty to Wanda has led him to give evidence which is not true. He admitted that notwithstanding his status as shareholder and director he did not know what the records of the company stated. As stated above, following the formation of the holding company 31E Ltd in 2000 the shares in Fast Fones Direct Ltd were transferred to it, and the shares in the holding company were held 50:50 by Richard and Charmaine. It is, frankly, absurd for it to be suggested that the real or true ownership of the business was at this time, or at any time thereafter, held otherwise than 50:50 by Richard and Charmaine<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="8">

This is of course nonsense - Fast Fones Direct Ltd was an entirely new company. She told me that the shares were held one by Ray Goodwin and one by Richard, when in fact they were held by Ray Goodwin and Charmaine. It was clear that she had no knowledge at all about this company of which she asserted ownership. She was unable to give me any coherent evidence as to what she might do to prove her ownership were disaster to befall the nominal owners or if she were to fall out with them. </p>

It was dissolved on 30 December 2014, but had become dormant by 2003. It was formed in order for property ventures to be undertaken. Initially two one-penny shares were issued, one in the name of Richard and the other in the name of Ray Goodwin. The registered address was Ray&#8217;s address in Roehampton. The accounts state that Richard owns his share beneficially. I do not need to decide for whom Ray was holding the share in his name. It is equally arguable that it was either Charmaine or Wanda. In late 1999 a decision was reached that money would be raised on 45 Addison Gardens in order, among other things, to enable Vantage Property Management Limited to purchase a piece of commercial property. Apparently, a cheaper mortgage deal would be obtainable if Charmaine was a mortgagor, and for this purpose Wanda&#8217;s lease of 45 Addison Gardens was transferred into the joint names of herself and Charmaine. </p>

For example, it does not mention Charmaine&#8217;s asserted interest in Fast Fones Direct Ltd and misleadingly described her as a self-employed consultant for Duke Office Services. I do not think that these blows in any way help me to decide whether it is true that Wanda owned Fast Fones Direct Ltd. Similarly, Mr Molyneux QC sought to make much of what he would characterise as an entirely misleading mortgage application form completed in late 1999. The irony is that that form was filled in by Richard; it is his handwriting. In the employment section it described Charmaine as being an accountant employed by Vantage Corporate Consulting Ltd in which business she had no percentage shareholding. I agree that this document does not sit easily with Charmaine&#8217;s assertion that at that time she was a co-owner of that business. However, it is equally harmful to Wanda&#8217;s case because it describes her as a self-employed antiques trader with no shareholding in any business. If she were really and truly the owner of Fast Fones Direct Ltd then this form, completed by her son, would have said so. </p>

It proposed that all businesses and assets would be split 50:50. Plainly Richard had input into this. He could not have thus contributed if the assets and business were all owned by Wanda. </p>

This schedule asserted that the business and the properties were owned equally by Richard and Charmaine. Zoe Bloom replied on 31 January </p>

Instead, she merely stated that the spreadsheet had been examined and that the valuations were not agreed. She invited Charmaine to make an offer dealing with the income and capital elements of the family assets by 7 February 2017. It is inconceivable that this letter could have been written if Richard had stated that the assets were in fact owned by Wanda. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Obviously, faced with this formidable catalogue, Wanda had to break her alliance with Richard. Therefore, as stated above, she asserted that he had &#8220;gone rogue&#8221;, and had been doing so for years. I am completely satisfied that this is a false case. Richard had not gone rogue; in asserting to the world, including to tax authorities, and moneylenders, that he was, with Charmaine, the real owner of the business, he was speaking the truth.  </p>

Her case as expressed in the preliminary letter of claim and in her formal pleadings and witness statements was that there had been an actual agreement between her, on the one hand, and Richard and Charmaine, on the other, that she (Wanda) was prepared to hand over full control of the running of the company to Richard and Charmaine and would allow them to pay themselves whatever income they liked out of it, provided that her capital asset remained intact. On her behalf it was said:  </p>

This change of tack does no more than to point up just how flimsy Wanda's case is. But having adopted the "Richard went rogue" line Mr Molyneux QC really had no sensible answer to my questions: why would Richard and Charmaine devote their working lives to, and do all the heavy lifting for, a business in which they had no interest?  What was in it for them? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">My very clear and strong finding on the evidence is that, at least from the time of the creation of the phoenix company Fast Fones Direct Ltd, it was the common intention of Richard and Charmaine that the business and the properties would be owned 50:50 by them. Wanda knew of this and went along with it. It is not necessary for me to decide what was their common intention for the predecessor business that was run into the ground by Orange, although the evidence is to similar effect. I do not conclude that the fact that Wanda agreed, as an act of maternal generosity, to allow 45 Addison Gardens to be used as security for the borrowing for the property purchase at Oliver Business Park transacted through Vantage Property Management Limited, or that in the early days she allowed the business to be run from there, signifies a common intention that she should be a quasi-partner in the business. Nor does it give rise to a presumption of resulting trust. </p>

As Mr Molyneux QC rightly said, nobody should have had to have read the last 20 pages of his witness statement, where he gratuitously and irrelevantly vents his spleen against Charmaine.  </p>
