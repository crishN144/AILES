She is a US citizen, habitually resident in the US State of Missouri. X was born in Missouri in September 2014, Y is the genetic father and a donor egg was used.

Although the parental order application was made jointly in February 2015, only Z actively pursues the application for a parental order. It is accepted that all but two of the relevant criteria for making a parental order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> are met. Those two are the requirement that at least one of the applicants is domiciled in the UK (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54(4)</ref>(b)) and X&#8217;s home must be with the applicants (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54(4)</ref>(a)). Both of these requirements need to be satisfied both when the application is made, and at the time when the court is considering making the parental order. Z asserts this jurisdiction is his domicile of choice and a purposive interpretation of &#8216;home&#8217; can include a situation where one of the applicants is not currently in the same jurisdiction as the child concerned and is not having contact. Y disputes these requirements are satisfied on the evidence in this case and, in addition, raises the issue as to whether the court can make a parental order against the express wishes of one of the applicants. </span></p>

In the adoption application concerning X made by Y&#8217;s partner, D, in New York, which Y was a party to, there was little or no reference to Z living with Y in their home in Miami with X until October 2015. Y unattractively sought to justify this omission in his oral evidence by relying on legal advice and sought to suggest the omission was justified by D visiting them regularly during this period. That suggestion is simply untenable on the information this court has seen. Whatever the difficulties in the relationship between Y and Z, they lived together with X as a family unit from her birth until at least October 2015. Whether D visited or not is irrelevant.  The consequences of this prevented Z being given notice of the adoption application, and by doing so failed to provide X with an accurate account of her background. For his part Z&#8217;s oral evidence to the Florida court in March 2017, when it was considering the question of jurisdiction, gave no caveat to his position that the parties&#8217; home was in Miami and emphasised the settled nature of the home and their integration in the community. Conversely his emphasis in this hearing has been his connections and long term intentions to live in the UK. Whilst Z has sought to rely on the difference between terms in the respective jurisdictions, it is an unattractive feature of both Y and Z&#8217;s position that their evidence has to a greater or lesser extent been tailored to which jurisdiction they are in.  </span></p>

A surrogacy agreement carries with it lifelong responsibilities for both Y and Z, irrespective of any orders, to ensure X&#8217;s welfare needs are met, which importantly includes an accurate account of her background. In my judgment, Y and Z have each abdicated their responsibilities to do this to the detriment of X&#8217;s lifelong welfare needs, particularly those relating to her identity. Her legal status is precious and important, not something that can or should be treated irresponsibly as part of the inevitable maelstrom following a relationship breakdown. The fact that Y supported X being adopted by someone else within weeks after Y and Z separated in October 2015, particularly in the covert way that he did, displays a reckless disregard to the realities of X&#8217;s identity.</span></p>

According to Z, despite Y knowing he had a return flight back to Miami on 23 December Y said he was going away with his parents at that time and in early December sent a text to Z in very unfortunate terms referring to him deserting Y and X and unilaterally stating he and X were going away over Christmas. It is now known that by that stage Y planned for D to adopt X. In his statement Y describes Z&#8217;s actions in October and thereafter as abandoning X as he did not request to see X after then until March 2016, he made no financial contribution to her care and the real reason behind his sudden departure was to repair relations with his father in Country B following the latter&#8217;s disapproval of Z&#8217;s lifestyle.</span></p>

Shortly before this hearing Y withdrew his motion that Florida did not have jurisdiction because of Z&#8217;s lack of standing, however Y maintained that the Florida Court should not accept jurisdiction because X was now resident in New York. Judge Young determined that the Florida court did have jurisdiction and declined to transfer the proceedings to be heard in New York. Z&#8217;s application for interim contact was listed to be heard on 31 May 2017. Y sought a stay from the trial judgment pending an appeal, which was refused. Y appealed against the refusal of the stay which was granted, the appeal was determined after this hearing was concluded but prior to judgment. The appeal was allowed, in effect determining that New York was the appropriate forum to determine matters relating to X, as that was where she was living with Y.</span></p>

After 2012 he said they did not have a plan to remain in London permanently and by 2013 they were both looking to live and settle elsewhere. Y agrees that in the various discussions to consider where they should live with X, options were discussed but London was never the agreed place.

The evidence regarding the agreement in Country B in January 2014 was expressly limited until X was of school age. It has to be looked at in the context of Z&#8217;s mother&#8217;s ill health. He relies on the emails in the middle of 2014 that support his position the parties were considering returning to live in London in November 2014. The change in that was sprung upon him by the granting of Y&#8217;s 5 year visa in August, which he only found out about when he went to the US in August 2014. Their email exchanges in early September 2014 make clear Z only agreed to stay in the US for a period of 2 years. He relies on the discussions there were about adoption in the US after X&#8217;s birth and the advice they received and followed was, Z submits, in the context of their joint position to establish their joint parentage in England. Z says this was further supported by the completed parental order application signed by both parties in February 2015, and the steps he took here, to secure the registering of the parental responsibility agreements with the court.</span></p>

This remained, they submit, a common theme prior to and after X&#8217;s birth. They submit it is revealing that Z asserts he has a domicile of choice in the UK in February 2015 yet has set out a counterfactual narrative in seeking to establish the Florida court has jurisdiction.

It could only be by way of establishing a domicile of choice which is simply not supported by the evidence. He has lived in the US since 2013, he intends to remain there and Wart from joint ownership of the property here does not assert any meaningful ties to the UK.</span></p>

I have reached that conclusion for the following reasons.</span></p>

Z&#8217;s emphasis of his long term intentions and ties to this country have really only come about in the context of these proceedings, to support his contention of establishing domicile and should, in my judgment, be treated with a considerable degree of caution. This is particularly when looked at in the light of what his position has been in the Florida proceedings, where he emphasised the settled nature of his residence in that jurisdiction and the integration in the community there.</span></p>

It is where his family remain. Whilst he seeks to assert it has been mainly driven by his mother&#8217;s ill health, it has clearly been significantly more than that. He returned back to assist with and work in the family business from at least April 2013, with frequent visits in the period before that, and the plan, as at January 2014, was they would live there with X until X was of school age. Even in the context of that fragile agreement, there was no certainty where they would live after that, London was an option but no more than that, it was never a solid agreed plan. In June 2013 Z was in Country B and stated he had no intention of returning to Europe as he had made the move to Country B. Z seeks to resile from that, but what it does show is the continuing magnetic pull of his domicile of origin was still operative then as it has, in my judgment, remained throughout. Whilst he has no property or assets in Country B he continues to receive ongoing financial support from his family there, either directly or through the family business, as he has done from the age of 10. His links with the family business remain strong and ongoing, he remains financially supported by the family business, pays taxes and retains bank and credit card accounts there.</span></p>

The somewhat vague email references to living in London in the middle of 2014 cannot be taken in isolation and are at best equivocal, they demonstrate continuing uncertainty rather than any solid plan and by August/September it was clear the plan was to make the family home in the US, even making due allowance for the fact that could only be under a time limited visa. In my judgment, the property being retained here was no more than convenience, enabling the option of living here to remain a possible option, rather than any intention to reside indefinitely or permanently here to the extent of supporting this jurisdiction being Z&#8217;s domicile of choice.</span></p>

At its highest Z asserts a domicile of choice relying on time spent here until 2013, qualifying as a lawyer here, acquiring citizenship and purchasing a property.

In my judgment the hard facts relied on by Z, such as period of time, qualification, working, citizenship, ownership of property and paying of taxes are not sufficient to establish that he intended to permanently and indefinitely reside here to support him establishing a domicile of choice. They have, in the circumstances of this case, been elevated by Z to seek to support his assertion of a domicile of choice in the context of seeking to establish this court&#8217;s jurisdiction to enable the parental order application to proceed. The acquisition of domicile of choice is a serious matter and not to be lightly inferred. As Baroness Hale stated in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Mark v Mark [2005] UKHL [42] &#8216;English law requires only that the intention [of the person claiming to be domiciled by reason of their intention to reside permanently in the UK] be bona fide, in the sense of being genuine and not pretended for some other purpose&#8230;&#8217;.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> A person&#8217;s domicile of origin is notoriously adhesive and is described as being more tenacious. In my judgment, it is more likely that Z retained his domicile of origin in Country B.  In the light of that conclusion, the parental order application cannot proceed. </span></p>
