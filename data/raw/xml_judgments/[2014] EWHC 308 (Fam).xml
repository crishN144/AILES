Subsequent investigations revealed the presence of chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) and retinal haemorrhages (RH). The court was asked to determine the causation and likely timing of the SDHs which became chronic and the RHs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the fifth day of this hearing the LA applied for permission to withdraw their application pursuant to rule 29.4 (4) Family Proceedings Rules 2010. This involves the determination of a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;question with respect to the upbringing of a child&#8217;,</span> and so the paramountcy principle in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1 (1)</ref> applies. The primary consideration for the court is whether the withdrawal of the proceedings would promote or conflict with the welfare of the child concerned. Such an evaluation is fact specific and the court must look to see if there is some <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;solid advantage to the child to be derived from continuing the proceedings&#8217;.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One of the matters that concerned me in this case was the delay of 12 weeks following the parents attending hospital with G and the LA issuing proceedings. The parents say, in reality, they had little choice but to sign a section 20 agreement for the LA to accommodate G on her discharge from hospital on 4 April 2013, whilst further medical opinion was sought. Without the LA issuing proceedings the parents did not have effective access to legal advice, and there is no framework for them to be involved in the further medical investigations being sought.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">According to Mr Richards (Consultant Paediatric Neurosurgeon), who gave evidence in this case, there are different practices around the country in this type of case. Some LA issue proceedings promptly, others await further investigation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst it is important in cases where alleged shaking of an infant is a differential diagnosis to await CT, MRI and eye examination before issuing care proceedings, if alleged shaking remains the position following those enquiries serious consideration should be given by the LA to issuing care proceedings promptly.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Court, together with the parties who will be legally represented, is then in a position to timetable and manage further medical investigation, analysis and disclosure. It is of note in this case that the LA first requested the medical records from Kings Hospital on 16 April, yet by the time they issued proceedings 6 weeks later only partial disclosure had been given. If they had issued proceedings promptly the parties could have sought further directions from the Court.  Due to the delay in issuing proceedings experts were not instructed until early July some 4 months after G was first taken to hospital.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There should, in my judgment, be great caution in using section 20 agreements in cases where complex medical evidence may become involved. Parents faced with that situation may consider they have little choice but to agree to section 20; they have no, or limited, access to legal advice and if they don&#8217;t agree they risk being regarded by the LA as being &#8216;uncooperative&#8217;.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">G has now been in the care of foster carers for about 9 months, she is only 12 months old. The parents have had contact 5 times per week. No one has suggested it is other than excellent contact and takes place in the family home. The Local Authority case at the start of this hearing was that the medical evidence supported a finding of a non accidental head injury whilst G was in her parents care. In their written opening Local Authority stated the following in relation to the parents <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;..it is readily apparent that the parents love G very much. They behave lovingly and affectionately towards her, despite the stresses and strains these proceedings have inevitably brought. There are no signs of bruising or extra cranial injury in this case; no features of repeated assault and, as Mr Richard opines, as far as non accidental head injury is concerned &#8220;the event may have occurred during a momentary loss of control or frustration on the part of the carer who had not planned to injure G&#8221;.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the oral evidence of the experts developed in this hearing it became less clear that the LA were going to be able to prove their case to the required standard. By the time the expert evidence had concluded the LA did not consider they could prove the case to the required standard. That position was supported by all the other parties, including the Guardian.</p>

Review of the head circumference suggests that a process capable of enlarging the head abnormally was established by three weeks of age. Whether that process was the development of a chronic subdural haemorrhage or enlarged subarachnoid spaces, cannot be determined as no imaging was performed.&#8217;</span> A little later he continues <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;..the head circumference measurements would suggest that a pathological process capable of enlarging the head was apparent by three weeks of life. Chronic subdural haematoma development could be that cause, but also when the chronic subdurals settled, enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces was identified and it is possible that this was the underlying pathology that lead to the enlargement of the head. I do not know which was the cause of the enlarged head. In the presence of enlarged subarachnoid spaces, it is clinically recognised that acute subdural bleeding may occur following an event at a level of force less than would normally be required to cause acute subdural bleeding if the intracranial contents were completely normal. Therefore, it may be speculated that if the cause of the subdural haemorrhage identified in G was a non-accidental shaking event, on the basis of the intracranial appearances it may have been at the lower end of the forces commonly encountered in these events.&#8221;</span></p>

He said whilst there was no doubt, as noted on the scans on 17 April, that as the subdurals reduced in size the subarachnoid space was enlarged; but what neither of them know is whether the initial enlargement of the subarachnoid space was there first, or was caused by the SDH. He observed <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Was enlargement of the head due to BESS or CSDH beginning to develop; I have no idea&#8221;</span> He said the SDH could compress the BESS and he did not know how the relationship between the two worked.

She also agreed there was little evidence base as to the impact of anaemia on the eyes as they were not routinely examined in this situation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Firstly, the existence, or not, of BESS prior to 23 January was critical. Whilst Dr Anslow was clear it was not detected on any of the scans, Mr Richards was equally clear that it could not have been detected, as its existence would have been masked by the CSDH. No CT/MRI scans were taken at the time of birth. The significance of not knowing this is that if it had been there a subdural bleed could have occurred spontaneously.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, whilst there is no evidence of birth related SDH turning into CSDH there is, according to Mr Richards and Dr Anslow, no biological reason why they can&#8217;t. Bearing in mind the increase in head circumference noted on 23 January both Dr Anslow and Mr Richards considered the ASDH was more likely to be birth related, although they recognised there were other experts who consider there is no evidence they can become CSDH.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, there were a number of features of the RH that were unusual. In particular, the disappearance of the RH in the right eye between 7 and 12 March which was simply inexplicable. In relation to timing whilst Mr Morrison increased the time frame from 4 weeks (as set out in his written to report) to up to eight weeks (in the experts meeting) he acknowledged there was little evidence to support the time frames given. Dr Robinson described the change in time frame from 4 to 8 weeks as extraordinary. Mr Morrison accepted that the significance of the RHs was entirely reliant on the neurological findings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, the role played by G&#8217;s anaemic condition both at birth and on admission to hospital on 5 March is far from clear. There was a lack of clarity as to how long G had been anaemic prior to 5 March and what impact that had on the overall pathology.</p>

All parties acknowledge that throughout the history of the case these parents have been consistent in their accounts, cooperative with all health and social care professionals and have responded in good time and appropriately to G&#8217;s health care needs. They consistently sought an explanation for the growth of their daughter&#8217;s head circumference and reassurance in relation to it. They also have the support of the wider family.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The consequence of the uncertainties in the medical evidence, in particular relating to the existence or not of BESS, means that the court is left in a position with a number of possibilities, but no consistent thread of evidence to underpin a finding that the CSDH and the RHs were more likely than not to have been caused by a shaking incident caused by one or other of the parents. In those circumstances the LA were correct in their analysis of the evidence and to seek permission to withdraw their application.</p>
