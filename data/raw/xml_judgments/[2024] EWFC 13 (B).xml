The children&#8217;s high level of fear is therefore linked to concerns about their father, and I find that the father has continued to exercise a regime of control over the mother and the children.  I therefore find that the father presents a high risk of controlling, intimidating and aggressive behaviour to the mother, including violence and a high risk of controlling and aggressive behaviour in respect of the children.  In light of my finding that the father assaulted X, I consider he presents a risk of physical risk of harm to the children&#8221;.</span></p>

The children&#8217;s reaction to the father&#8217;s application shows that it would be harmful to them to hear anything about or from the father now and in the foreseeable future.  There must be no chance of the father learning anything that might expose the children and their placement.  The father will need to change a lifetime&#8217;s behaviour when he is released from prison.  The chances of that happening are unknown; it will be extremely difficult.  I will not permit any exchange of any information which could put the children&#8217;s safety and security at risk.  Their needs must come before those of the parents&#8221;.</span></p>

They say that without the protection of a section&#160;91(14) order, the father could make applications to the Court, as a right, without first having to seek leave and showing evidence of change. The Local Authority say that all the children require the protection of such an order until they reach the age of 18, because of the trauma that they have suffered, which was significant and is enduring.  They say there is therefore a real and obvious need for the children to have the protective filter of a section 91(14) order until they reach the age of 18.</span></p>

During 2022, it was felt that Z&#8217;s safety was being compromised due to Y&#8217;s behaviour and the frustration and anger he was exhibiting.  Y has a lot of complex emotional issues due to the trauma he faced as a child, and this presents with him displaying physical and verbally aggressive behaviour.

It seems to me that the father has a huge amount of work to do before any application for contact could realistically be deemed to have merit.  In addition, even then, there would still be a significant question mark over whether the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings are likely to change.

In my judgment, the history of this case and the findings of this Court, the incredibly strong views of the children, the harm that the children have suffered previously, and the likely further emotional harm and trauma that they will suffer from any further applications made by their father, do necessitate an order that provides them with the protection required for the remainder of their minority.</span></p>

They are all of an age where they know and understand what these proceedings are about.  They have been clear in their wishes and feelings.  They all remain fearful of their father.</span></p>

The children cannot, and should not, be expected to go through this again without some level of protection being in place for them by way of a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 91(14)</ref> order.  It is my view that that order therefore needs to remain in place until the youngest child reaches 18.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.07in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I reiterate again that an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/91/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section&#160;91(14)</ref> does not prevent the father making an application to the Court.  However, it does provide the safeguard of requiring him to first obtain permission to do so, given the trauma suffered by the children, their additional needs, and the risks involved.  It is my view that it is therefore necessary and proportionate to make an order on those terms and that is what I shall do. The scope of the order will be in respect of any application for contact with the children and any application to discharge the care order, which is essentially the same terms that the order was made in previously.</span></p>
