	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These are care proceedings issued on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014. This case was transferred to the High Court from the Family Court at Watford by an order of His Honour Judge Wright on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2014 for the discrete purpose of deciding jurisdiction as the subject child L (born 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2006) is a Romanian national who had been habitually resident in Romania for all of her life until she came to live in the UK with RV and EV on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013. Although she had come here with the agreement of her father, her sole surviving parent, he later tried to remove L and subsequently withdrew his consent to her remaining in this jurisdiction with the Vs. The local authority, the children&#8217;s guardian and the Vs say that L is habitually resident in the UK and that any future decision should be made by the court here which has jurisdiction. The respondent/father disputes that L is habitually resident and, if the court finds that she is, seeks a transfer of proceedings under Art 15 of Brussels II R.</p>

The parties were all represented except Mr and Mrs V who were in person and unrepresented. The 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent had, after some difficulty, been served with documents related to the proceedings on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015. At the previous hearing before me on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2015 it appeared that he wanted to instruct solicitors in the UK and that he did not want L to remain living with Mr and Mrs V. It was ordered that the local authority serve a letter setting out his entitlement to public funding and describing the manner in which he could participate in proceedings. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent was represented by counsel today. Unfortunately his solicitors had failed to take full instructions from him and failed to arrange any means of him participating in the proceedings. They had not found out whether there was a video link available which he could use. The use of telephone was hampered by the need for everything to be translated to him by an interpreter in London. The solicitors had not taken his instructions on the means by which he wanted to participate in the hearing. Counsel was not fully instructed by her client. Time was allowed for him to give his instructions to counsel. I was informed that he was content for the proceeding to go ahead in his absence as he had given his instructions to counsel.</p>

It follows that this court has jurisdiction. I declined to order a transfer of proceedings under Art 15. The reasons for this decision are set out below.

Her father AC placed her in the care of RV and EV (who are themselves Romanian)and signed a declaration on the 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013 allowing the couple to bring L to the UK for at least 12 months. Quite properly they contacted Hertfordshire social services to tell the authorities that L was living with them because he mother had died and her father could not afford to care for her. The local authority carried out statutory assessments during which it came to light that L&#8217;s older sisters had made allegations in Romania of sexual abuse of L and her sisters by their father. The girls had told their pastor in Romania. The allegations were passed on to the Romanian police but there was no prosecution. The local authority contacted the pastor who confirmed the story. L made further complaints to Mrs V in which she disclosed more about the sexual abuse she had suffered.  </p>

In March 2014 after speaking to the pastor the local authority wrote (translated to Romanian) to the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent/father to up-date him. The local authority followed this up with a phone call through an interpreter in May 2014 to enquire about the consent form that he had signed. The 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent arrived in the UK in July 2014 when he tried to remove L by force, the police were called and a police protection order was made.</p>

Most of the facts concerning L&#8217;s integration in the UK are not a matter of dispute; As I have set them out here they are based on the investigation of her guardian and the assessments of the local authority which had been involved in her private fostering &#8220;placement&#8221; with the Vs shortly after her arrival in the UK at the instigation of Mr and Mrs V. The court has the advantage of a fairly fulsome and independent account of L&#8217;s circumstances. By the time the local authority issued their application L had been living with Mr and Mrs V for just over one year.</p>

During this assessment it had come to the local authority&#8217;s attention that L had told Mrs V that she had been sexually abused by her father when living with him in Romania. This disclosure was by the pastor at a church her late mother had attended. The disclosure of this information to the police (by the duty social worker) when her father tried to remove L from the Vs&#8217; care against her wishes led to the police making a PPO. The local authority became involved because no-one had parental responsibility and therefore no one could consent to medical or dental treatment or any other intervention, such as counselling, to support L with the loss of her mother, her home and her siblings or distress or trauma associated with the abuse she had said she had suffered.</p>

L is reported as enjoying school where she is given appropriate additional support. L has a number of friends from school and friends from the church she attends. She is often described as a happy child. She was observed as very comfortable around her foster-mother and was heard referring to her affectionately as &#8220;mum&#8221;.

Mr and Mrs V are themselves integrated into the social environment and community where they live in the UK and as her carers they share to a large extent that social and family environment with L.</p>

The 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent took no action through the Central Authorities or otherwise to commence proceedings in Romania. He contacted the General Directorate for Social Assistance and Child Protection but not until the 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> December 2014 for help in repatriating L despite his attempt to abstract her from the country in July. It was not until the end of January 2015 at the behest of this court that he engaged with the authorities in the UK. The lack of action on his part could be seen as abandonment and I keep it in mind when considering what weight to give the withdrawal of his consent for L to remain with the Vs which was only confirmed at the end of January 3015; by that time L had been here for 16 months.</p>

The Romanian authorities have not made any application for a transfer. The Romanian courts are not better placed to hear this case or any specific part of it. Although the alleged abuse which form part of the facts relied on by the local authority in relation to threshold took placed in Romania a number of the relevant witnesses are present in this country such as L herself, Mrs V and the social worker to whom L complained of the sexual abuse by her father. As the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent father is legally represented and is entitled to public funding he can participate fully in these proceedings either in person or by video link.

Turning to the second question I agree with the submissions of the local authority that the Romanian court would not be better placed to hear the case the subject of which is the child L. There are witnesses in both jurisdictions and there will be difficulties in holding a trial on the issue of abuse in either jurisdiction. L is at present in England as are the people to whom she has made her disclosure. The 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent is represented and can participate in the proceedings here. It is not possible to evaluate the position of other possible witnesses (such as L&#8217;s siblings) whose evidence, at this stage, has been neither sought or provided.

There would be delay as the Romanian authorities are not seised of the case and have not requested transfer. There are no proceedings nascent or otherwise in Romania. Delay is not the only issue. If the case is transferred where is L to go in the interim? She cannot be placed  with her father as he may have seriously sexually abused and assaulted her. L is frightened of him and does not want to go there. There has been nowhere identified that is safe haven to receive L and no-one with whom this court could safely leave her while the authorities pick up this case and commence proceedings.
