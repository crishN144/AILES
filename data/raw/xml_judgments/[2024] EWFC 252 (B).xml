This is all about B and C, D and E and I have to put them first.  Their welfare is my number one concern.  Their mother has come to court because she genuinely wants to have a relationship with them all.  She loves them and she has written a really thoughtful letter to them.  Their father will support them having a relationship with their mother if and when they want to.  </span></p>

They do not want to see their mother and they do not want to speak to any more adults about her.  The children, particularly the older two have had a difficult start in life and they suffered harm in their mother&#8217;s care.  Since they moved to their father in 2016, they have not seen or heard from their mother consistently.  She last saw B, C and D in 2016 and E briefly in 2018.  </span></p>

That is important because she needs to be well enough to build a predictable and consistent relationship with the children.  She has conducted herself in court with great dignity and is open to further therapeutic help.  That is greatly to her credit.  </span></p>

I think it would be harmful to force the children to see their mother face-to-face when they are hostile to it and we have yet to establish a good rapport by email.  I think it would backfire and undermine the chance of building a relationship in future.   I think it is best that the mother writes to the children once a month.  </span></p>

I do not think they would want to speak to a psychologist and I think it is unlikely it would change what they want and how they feel at this stage.  It would add delay and annoy the children.

One such change might be that the children ask to see her and I think if she comes back within the next three years, she would need my permission to start a new case.  </span></p>

	    <p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">Dear [names redacted],</span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">Thank you for writing to me. I heard loud and clear that you do not want to see your Mum and you want people to stop bothering you. I take what you say seriously. I respect your views. Your welfare is my number one concern. </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">Your Mum and Dad came to court. Your Dad told me that he would not force you to see your Mum and that your views should be respected. Your Mum told me how much she loves you and wants to be in your life. [redacted] suggested that each of you could have an e-mail address and your Mum could write to you once a month and then it is up to you whether you read it and when.  </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">I have finished the court case and I have decided that now is not the right time for you to see your Mum face to face. I do think that it is best for you if she sends you a message every month to your e-mail addresses and then it is up to you if you want to read it. Your Dad must make sure that you can read those e-mails whenever you want to.  I have made an order that places a hurdle in the way of your Mum coming to court again during the next 3 years. I would look at what she says if she comes back to court. If things have changed, I could give her permission to start a new court case.  One of the things that might change is if one of you tell her that you would like to see her. If things have not changed, I will not let her start a new court case. </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">I have listened to your voices and have put you first in making this decision. The e-mails that your Mum is allowed to send are like a bridge towards a relationship with her if you want it. It is up to you whether you cross that bridge and decide to see her in future. </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">You only ever get one Mum in your life. She loves you all so very much and misses a relationship with you greatly. She has had a difficult time and things have not been easy for her. &#8220;Well, things have not been easy for us&#8221;, you might say. You are right. Both of those things are true. But I want you to know that you are loved by your Mum. She is not perfect. None of us are. But you should know that she came to court not to upset you but because she genuinely does not want to lose the possibility of a relationship with you. I am clear that the choice of whether you want that relationship to develop, and when, is yours. </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:12pt">I wish you all the very best in the future. </span></p>

The father agrees with Cafcass and he says he will send updates every three months with photos of the children.  The mother wants more than anything to build a relationship with each of her children and see them face-to-face.  </span></p>

In 2015 there were care proceedings and the children were removed from their mother&#8217;s care.  These proceedings concluded in 2016 with a child arrangements order for the children to live with their father.  The final judgment in 2016 referred to allegations that the mother had made against the grandparents which the judge described as &#8220;completely unfounded&#8221;.  The mother wanted to adjourn the final hearing so she could do CBT and so the children could be returned to her.  The judge referred to the mother changing her position regularly &#8220;without reason or warning&#8221;.  Her Honour Judge Atkinson made a 12 month supervision order.  The order itself does not spell out the contact arrangements which were made for the mother but refers to a care plan of which I do not have a copy.  The order records the mother did not sign the working-together agreement at court as proposed by the Local Authority and the judgment of Her&#160;Honour&#160;Judge&#160;Atkinson refers to monthly contact which could increase or decrease according to how the mother deals with the issues identified in that judgment.  No mention is made of indirect contact in that judgment.</span></p>

It is not clear from the documents I have from of the Local Authority at this stage whether they supported phone calls or whether they were part of the care plan but the father&#8217;s evidence was that if he did not permit phone calls it was probably because direct contact was inconsistent. </span></p>

I do not have the full Local&#160;Authority records of this period and each parent relied on documents that they were able to find.  I do not have a complete set of Local Authority papers to assist me as to their contemporaneous position and analysis during this time. The mother was open in her evidence in saying, &#8220;I cannot really recall and my evidence is based on what the solicitors recorded on those contact dates that were missed.  I do not have a strong recollection&#8221;.  She recalls a meeting with a social worker in which she said the father was being difficult but that is not recorded in the social worker&#8217;s written evidence which has reached this hearing bundle.   The father gave evidence on occasion the children were unwell so he could not take them to contact.  He had no family support and was living in [redacted] at the time so if any of the children were poorly, all of them were unable to attend.  The mother thought the father was using this as an excuse but I accept the father&#8217;s evidence and think it likely with a group of four children that some of them may be unwell at times.  </span></p>

She reports that the contact was inconsistent and that the mother was unable to meet with the social worker due to her work commitments and did not want to travel in the evenings and for this reason contact stopped after having been supervised by the social worker.  The social worker writes in 2017 that contact did not move to unsupervised because the mother had not done the therapy ordered by the Court.  The schedule of the contact in the social work statement shows cancelled contacts and no steady pattern of a reliable contact taking place.  This is the best evidence I have because it is a near contemporary note of the number of contacts offered and which took place.  14 contacts were offered and three of those took place.  Some missed contacts are recorded as being due solely to the mother but other the reasons for other cancellations are more ambiguous and are not set out clearly in the social work records.  The overall pattern, however, is not one of consistency however that is caused.  </span></p>

It seems to me that contact did not become established regularly for a number of factors.  The mother did miss some and she did not want to travel in the evening and was trying to juggle work.  The father did have little support and children do get ill. It seems to me that the mother&#8217;s inconsistency was a key factor in why contact did not become more regular and established on the evidence before me.  </span></p>

The three older children refused to go when they were taken by their father to the contact centre but E went in and he was aged two I think at the time.  The father&#8217;s evidence was he tried to encourage all the children to go in and gave E a lollypop to encourage him to go.  The mother was critical of the father and thought he had not done enough but the records written at the time by an independent third party suggest the father did do his best to encourage the children to see their mother.  </span></p>

In November 2023 Cafcass wrote to the court to explain that they had not received the mother&#8217;s GP letter so were asking to stay the requirement for a section seven report.  In November 2023 I made an order that stayed that section seven report pending the provision of a GP letter.  I, in December 2023, gave the mother permission to attend the hearing remotely if she wished and I ordered her to provide a statement setting out her mental health diagnosis, the services she has been involved with, her medication, her compliance and any therapy that she has received.  She was also ordered to provide a letter from the crisis team locally about her engagement and support since February&#160;2022.  The father was ordered to provide redacted copies of the children&#8217;s education reviews and the time for the section seven report was extended.  </span></p>

Some of the questions she asked were not drafted in a particularly neutral way and I explained to her when questions were not relevant or needed to be rephrased.  Her questions about the grandparents which I did not think were relevant, were quite emotionally charged and critical and showed a high level of distrust of them.  Some of her questions could be interpreted as paranoid, such as her asking the father whether sending an email about her benefits or contacting the police for a welfare check was designed to trigger a mental health crisis.  However, other questions were entirely appropriate and I am satisfied that she has been able to put her case to the father and challenge his position fully.  </span></p>

The Cafcass officer was unwavering in their evidence that a key concern was the lack of consistency on the mother&#8217;s part in relation to contact and she took the view that because indirect contact had not been positive for the children, it would be very difficult to move to face-to-face based on their wishes and feelings.

The evidence is clear that the father left the room and it was the children who asked him to return when Cafcass was there.  Each of the children expressed themselves to Cafcass in quite a distinctive way.  For example, B&#8217;s favourite foods are fish fingers and takeaway every week.  He says he&#8217;s good at Brazilian jujitsu and wrestling.  He says that he likes his siblings, aunties, uncles and cousins who are important to him and living with dad and his siblings he says is where I call home.  He says he feels annoyed and angry that mum keeps disturbing my peace with my dad.  D spoke about being angry with my mum who keeps bothering me.

The father&#8217;s evidence was that he spoke to the school SENCo because the children were in school at this time and they said that the children were not showing signs of needing such support.

The judgment of Her Honour Judge Atkinson sets out the children&#8217;s early experiences living with their mother and there were, for example, a series of referrals made by neighbours by three different boroughs and from three different sources she says, who heard the mother shouting at the children between 2013 and 2014.  One neighbour reported hearing the mother says, &#8220;You fucking little bastards, I hate you&#8221;.  B was four, C three, and D just over a year.  Another neighbour reported the mother threatening violence and saying it was &#8220;horrible to hear&#8221;.  I do not read out those extracts from Her Honour&#8217;s judgment to distress the mother but to observe that obviously this would have been harmful to the children.  The mother&#8217;s evidence to Ms&#160;Norgate suggested she did not accept this finding of Her Honour Judge Atkinson.  The children are affected by shouting even when they are very young and the older two children in particular may have a memory of living with their mother which may be difficult for them.  Similarly Her Honour Judge Atkinson described an incident of violence outside a contact centre during care proceedings in full view of the children in which she recorded that the mother assaulted the father.  They have been exposed to harmful situations and that may well be part of the view that they formed of their mother now.  </span></p>

She showed them a picture of their mother.  They got confused and asked if it was the social worker&#8217;s mother.  B then became upset and asked if it was the social worker&#8217;s mother who stepped on his back.  B was scared when discussing his mother and C seemed unhappy with their mother although they were persuaded to see her.  The Guardian spoke to B in 2019 and he said he does not want to see mummy because of what she has done to us.  C told the Guardian that mummy &#8220;was not very nice the last time we saw her&#8221;.  The Guardian picks up a sense of anxiety and ambivalence about the children seeing their mother.  Her view is that the older two children do have clear recollections of the harm they experienced in her care.  The mother does have some acceptance and insight into the harm that they have suffered in her care.  When asked about the threshold in the care proceedings she said, &#8220;I accept my failures, I do acknowledge their experience, I don&#8217;t diminish their feelings, I think about it every day but I do not totally agree&#8221;.  So her understanding I think is partial and it is not clear to me that she really understood the entirety of the impact of the past experiences on the children.   I have already highlighted how she claimed it was false that she was shouting at the baby when Her Honour Judge Atkinson did find that it has happened.  Why is that relevant now?  Because it might be that the mother underestimates the impact that these early experiences have had on the children and have been formative in how they see her now.  The lack of consistency in contact has also been emotionally harmful for them, no matter how it arose and how contacts came to be missed.  </span></p>

Putting this in context, the mother was detained under the Mental Health Act from 11&#160;February&#160;2022 until March 2022.  The Cafcass letter sheds some more light on this.  They say in February 2022 the police had a referral which stated that the mother was detained at Manchester Airport under the Mental Health Act after contacting the police and reporting she had assaulted and killed one of the children.  The witness statement the mother provided explained that the police were trying to prevent her freedom of movement and so they detained her and falsely imprisoned her.  Then on 6 March 2022 shortly after being released from section, she attended Hospital with anxiety and insomnia and was given Lorazepam and Zopiclone.  She reported in her witness statement a mental health crisis in April 2023.  The letter from her community mental health teams sets out that during the time she was reported missing to the police and it seems that the community health team was under the impression that the police continued their search which included [redacted] and [redacted].

He has brought them to contact when asked to do so and he has in his formal position statement, and his actions, supported the children wanting to have a relationship with their mother but he says he will not force them.  </span></p>

She is clearly trying to focus on things that might interest them and develop a rapport with them using the information that father has provided to her.  It is a lovely letter in many ways and evidence of her ability to try and relate to the children and rebuild their relationship.  They need her to keep on sending letters like this, to keep on reaching out to them and trying to find something that engages them, if they are to rebuild their relationship with her in the future.</span></p>

That is why it is vital that their relationship with their mother is rebuilt at their own pace and evolves in a way that they can manage.  If I imposed direct contact on them, I think that this would be very destructive of their relationship both with their mother and their father and would be counter-productive. </span></p>

The younger two children, it seems to me, may well have taken the emotional temperature from their older brother and sister and their view of their mother may well have been influenced by this. However, to order contact for them when their older brother and sister are so opposed and in the face of their own clearly expressed wishes and feelings would not be in their best welfare interests. It is better than they are given a one to one opportunity to receive e-mails from their mother, to respond if they wish and to form their own view over time. </span></p>

The father&#8217;s evidence is that is their choice and the Local&#160;Authority give evidence that a suitable home education is being provided.  They record the Local Authority, that the children are keen to continue with their home education and the father gave evidence that E will be able to sit GCSEs and he will arrange and fund this.  I do understand the mother&#8217;s perspective that schools do provide access to specialist teachers, friends, structure and routine and I agree with her of course, that in order to do a work or an apprenticeship a basic number of GCSEs need to be obtained.  I do think the mother&#8217;s application is motivated by what she thinks is best for the children but it seems to me that the children are well settled in their home-school routine and that to force them into school would be something they would resent their mother for and so it is not in their best welfare interests but I do think the father should provided the mother with the Local Authority school reports as they come in with the name of the Local Authority and his address redacted. </span></p>

However, the father&#8217;s evidence was that the school did not think that this was necessary, save for B who was referred to CAMHS and diagnosed with ADHD.  I can understand why the mother would want them to have this therapeutic support in the hope that it might rebuild their relationship but the currently Cafcass view is that this was not necessary.  I do not have the power to order the children to do therapy so unless they want to go, it would be unhelpful and counter-productive.  The evidence suggests that this is not something they need at any event in the moment and I am satisfied that the father will be able to refer them if needs be.  </span></p>

Well, the impact it would have on the children&#8217;s welfare would, in my view, entrench the children further against their mother.  They are unlikely, given their view of professionals, to want to cooperate with such an assessment.  The issues to which the expert evidence would relate are their attachment with their mother and any psychological presentation but given that they have yet to rebuild that relationship with their mother, it seems to me that it is difficult to know what questions we would ask that psychologist.  We have help from Cafcass already and the previous judgments given by Her Honour Judge Atkinson.  If I granted permission for this expert, that would add great delay to these proceedings at a point where the children are very clear that they want them to come to an end.  It is not in my view necessary to have that report in order to resolve proceedings justly.  It runs a risk of further entrenching and alienating the children from their mother.</span></p>

The recommendation in the Cafcass report dated March 2024 is that the children need a break from litigation.  The father made his application on 30 July this year and puts the mother on notice at the pre-trial review that he would do so.  The mother has filed a formal statement in response to the Cafcass report and was legally represented at the time of its receipt and at subsequent hearings including the pre-trial review.  She became unrepresented on 6 August 2024.  The mother, therefore, has had legal representation during the time that this issue of the section 91(14) order was live.  Ms Norgate set out the law about section 91(14) in her position statement.  I have looked at the guidance in PD12Q of the Family Procedure Rules but the circumstances in which such an order may be made are many and varied.  The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration and there are some circumstances in paragraph 2.3 of PD12Q which are particularly relevant to this case.  It suggests that a period of respite may be needed following litigation where a period of time is needed for certain actions to be taken for the protection of the children or another person.  I have reminded myself of the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re P</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (Section 91(14)) [1999] 2FLR573.  That reminds me that an order can be indeterminate or last until a child is 16 but that should be an exceptional step, in effect it is saying that nothing more can be done and such an order must spell out what needs to be done and why.  The degree of restriction that case says, should be proportionate to the harm that it is intended to avoid and as ever section 91(14) should be read in conjunction with section 1(1) which makes the welfare of the child the paramount consideration.  The power of course to make a section 91(14) order is discretionary and I must weigh all the circumstances in doing so.  I have looked at the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re A [</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">supervised contact] (section 91(14) 2021 EWCA Civ 1749 case in which Lady Justice King pointed out that jurisdiction to make such an order is not limited to cases where parties have made excessive applications and that the landscape has changed since that case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Re P </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">and there is considerable scope for the greater use of this protective filter in the children&#8217;s best welfare interests.  </span></p>

Further applications and more professional involvement in the children&#8217;s lives, would I think, make them more hostile to their mother and maybe entrench their views.  It would be unsettling and harmful to their welfare to be exposed to future litigation unless there has been a change of circumstance.  The mother&#8217;s evidence is, &#8220;If parents are going to lose their kids they will pursue contact no matter what.  Maybe they don&#8217;t understand now the children but they might resent me if I didn&#8217;t apply and try and see them&#8221;.  Having listened to her I am not reassured that she could refrain from future litigation.  </span></p>

As D and E have not really had such a relationship with their mother as their older siblings have, and I have already looked at the possibility that they may have been influenced by their older brother and sister.  If, as Cafcass and the father ask, I make an order until E is 18, that is seven years.   I have looked at what is necessary and proportionate and I have looked at the children as individuals.  It seems to me that B and C need time to enjoy their childhood without interruption and without further applications.  They have made their views very clear and at the ages that they are, 14 and 13, they have a degree of maturity that maybe their younger siblings do not.  I think it is right to make a section 91(14) order until C turns 16.  By then D will be 14 and E will be 12.  If the mother has been consistent with her indirect contact they may have changed their minds or have a greater openness to see her.  That order in my view is necessary and proportionate to allow for the development of maturity on the behalf of the younger children and to establish indirect contact and it leaves open the possibility for the two younger children, when they have had three years of consistent communication with their mother, to at that stage, begin to rebuild their face-to-face contact and it means that the older two children have had a degree of respite until they are 16 years old.  I think continuing a section 91(14) order beyond three years would be disproportionate on the facts before me.</span></p>
