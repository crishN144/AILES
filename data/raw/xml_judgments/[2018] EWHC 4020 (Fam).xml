	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Over a period in excess of three weeks, I have conducted a fact-finding hearing in care proceedings relating to two young boys, X, born on 28 May 2013 and thus 4 years 7 months old, and Y, born on 12 January 2016 and thus almost 2 years old. The focus of that hearing has been to establish whether, on the balance of probabilities, Y suffered significant harm due to his mother&#8217;s interference with his medical treatment. In summary, the local authority alleged that the mother exaggerated and/or fabricated reports of Y suffering vomiting and pain; that she caused him physical pain whilst he was feeding; that she interfered with his feeding lines; and that she contaminated those lines so as to cause infections. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This case demonstrates all too clearly the difficult task faced by the court when it is asked to determine the cause of harm to a very young child in circumstances where (a) that child had pre-existing health problems; (b) much, though not all, of the alleged harmful behaviour took place at times when Y was a hospital in-patient on a busy children&#8217;s ward; and (c) much of the evidence relied on by the local authority was circumstantial in nature. Numerous nurses and doctors stated that they had no reason to be concerned about the mother&#8217;s behaviour and regarded her as a committed and caring parent. Throughout the mother vehemently denied harming Y in the manner alleged by the local authority.  </p>

Though this case was superficially distinct from those cases where children are harmed in the family home by their carers in that there was evidence from witnesses unconnected with the family, nevertheless the court remains heavily reliant on all the witnesses but especially on Y&#8217;s carers giving a truthful and frank account of what occurred.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I want to pay tribute to the advocates who appeared before me and who, I understand, were instructed in either late August or early September 2017. The circumstances in which they were instructed were not promising as, despite the very best endeavours of Her Honour Judge Lazarus, it was painfully apparent that the evidential issues in this case had not been appreciated or grappled with by those previously instructed. All of the advocates worked extremely hard to make sure this matter was capable of being heard at the end of November 2017 and in January 2018. That was no easy task for reasons which will become obvious from this judgment. Further, throughout the hearing, they have co-operated with each other and with the court in matters great and small to the ultimate benefit of the children with whom I am concerned. I am enormously grateful to them. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is apparent that those originally instructed failed at an early stage to grapple with what was evidentially necessary for the proper resolution of the issues in this case. Cases as complex as this one require careful analysis by all the advocates on issue of the proceedings and on an ongoing basis thereafter. That analysis should be driven by the local authority and focussed on what is required to prove the allegations it makes about a parent&#8217;s behaviour towards a child. The early collection of medical notes and reports is vital as is obtaining statements from relevant medical and health personnel. A significant proportion of this work was not done until about two months before the fact-finding hearing was due to commence.  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">
	  <num>13.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Early identification of what expert evidence might assist the court is also particularly important. In this case the parties were in early agreement that a report from a paediatrician was required but, despite it being evident that Y&#8217;s treatment focussed on his feeding and the gastroenterological response thereto, none of the advocates then instructed appeared to consider that an expert report from a paediatric gastroenterologist might assist the court. Though Part 25 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 requires the court to control the expert evidence it receives and to determine that only expert evidence necessary to assist the court in resolving the proceedings is adduced, cases of factitious or induced illness are ones in which the necessity for expert evidence is often self-evident. These cases axiomatically often involve children with significant medical histories and with a wide range of actual as well as alleged medical problems. Given that, the court is likely to be assisted by expert evidence - in many cases not limited to the instruction of a paediatrician - to illuminate and refine the forensic issues. </p>

	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I note that, at the very start of the proceedings, it was evident from the report of Dr H, consultant paediatric gastroenterologist, dated 29 March 2017 that the hospital had concerns that the mother may have been contaminating Y&#8217;s central venous catheter. No microbiology report which addressed this issue was filed until 19 September 2017 and, as will be apparent from this judgment, I found myself unable to rely on its conclusions. The absence of any medical report addressing this issue - on which the local authority sought findings - until September 2017 illustrates the lack of thought given to the evidential issues in this case at an early stage. The late arrival of the consultant microbiologist&#8217;s report in September 2017 also prejudiced any application - consistent with the fact-finding hearing starting in late November 2017 &#8211; of an expert paediatric microbiologist.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Finally, even if it might have been thought advisable to await the view of Dr Yadav, the paediatrician instructed as an expert in these proceedings, as to whether the instruction of another expert or experts would be of assistance, he was never asked to inform the parties at an early stage if this might be desirable. That omission from the letter of instruction was ill-advised. By the time Dr Yadav&#8217;s first report was available in late July 2017, time for the identification and instruction of a paediatric gastroenterologist and/or a paediatric microbiologist was extremely limited if not impossible.    </p>

They rented that property first before purchasing it in 2016.

On 14 February 2016 Y was diagnosed with gastro oesophageal reflux disease [&#8220;GORD&#8221;] and was admitted to H1 on 14 February 2016 for nasogastric [&#8220;NG&#8221;] feeding. On admission Y was described by his mother as vomiting and making high pitched crying noises. Y was discharged on 19 February 2016 when he weighed 3.18 kg. </p>

The mother reported that Y held his breath for over 20 seconds many times during the day and night and had not gained weight in over a week. The health visitor noted that Y was covered in many layers of blankets with a vest, babygro, cardigan, and outdoor suit. She advised the mother to remove the excess layers of clothing and, once this was done, Y was seen to be awake alert and active. During their discussions, the mother reported that she only gave Y lactulose (a medication to help with bowel movements) every five days even though this had been prescribed to be given twice a day. The health visitor advised the mother that she should give Y all medication as prescribed. </p>

The problems at that consultation included conjunctivitis, suspected bronchiolitis with breathing difficulty, breath holding spells, constipation and inconsolable spells of crying. Despite all this apparent sickness Y was still gaining weight and taking bottle feeds. He was prescribed anti reflux medication and further lactulose for suspected constipation. On 23 March 2016 a barium meal swallow test confirmed that Y had GORD though there was some confusion in the medical records about the degree of the reflux disorder noted at this test.  I note that on 20 April 2016 Y was seen by Mr D, consultant paediatric surgeon, who concluded that Y had significant GORD. Mr D felt it might be necessary to consider surgical intervention, for example, a fundoplication, if medical management of Y&#8217;s GORD failed. A fundoplication is a surgical procedure whereby the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower end of the oesophagus and stitched in place, thereby reinforcing the closing function of the lower oesophageal sphincter and preventing vomiting. </p>

On admission Y was started on NG feeds but he continued to vomit as reported by his mother who was resident with him in hospital. On 30 April 2016 Y&#8217;s weight was 6kg. On 2 May 2016 a naso-jejeunal [NJ] tube was inserted in order to help Y feed. A NG feeding tube is placed through the nose into the stomach and is used to convey food into the stomach. By contrast, NJ feeding is a method of feeding directly into the duodenum bypassing the stomach. A feeding tube is inserted via the nose through the oesophagus, the stomach and into the duodenum. An x-ray is required to confirm that the naso-jejeunal tube is correctly sited. </p>

Y was admitted to H2 on 5 November 2016 with vomiting and required repositioning of his NJ tube. He was discharged on 9 November 2016. That same day he saw Mr D in clinic who confirmed that, in the view of Y&#8217;s persistent problems, he would operate to do a fundoplication and PEG insertion. Y&#8217;s problems were noted to be (a) persistent gastro-oesophageal reflux, (b) the failure to medically manage this condition, and (c) Y&#8217;s failure to retain his NJ tube. </p>

A PEG is a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy where a tube is passed into a patient&#8217;s abdominal wall to provide a means of feeding where oral intake is inadequate. On 23 November Y was seen by the dietician and his weight was noted to be 5 kg. The dietetic plan was to start and progress with gastric feeds via the PEG to a more home friendly regime, the longterm aim being to improve Y&#8217;s growth and reduce his oral aversion to food. </p>

He was also said to have had a large vomit that evening. Following discussion, the medical team decided to give dioralyte and to slowly restart feeds. Y vomited several times on 27 November 2016. Unfortunately Y became mildly oedemic and his fluid intake was decreased to resolve this. By 28 November 2016 Dr G reported that Y was vomiting with Neocate feeds and was suspected of having gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying in which the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine is either slowed or stopped and which can sometimes occur after surgical intervention). Later that evening Y was reported to have pulled out his NJ tube. Discussion between the surgical team and the gastroenterological team about Y&#8217;s nutritional plan agreed that he should have a PICC line inserted together with a change from a gastrostomy tube to a gastro-jejeunostomy tube which would bypass the stomach. I note that a PICC line means a peripherally inserted central catheter to provide intravenous access that can be used for a long period of time to give either drugs or nutrition.  </p>

Following the operation Y was seen by the dietician on 30 November 2016 who noted that he had had very limited nutrition since surgery on 22 November 2016. Y was described as very poorly nourished with chronic poor weight gain since birth. The feeding plan was to start parenteral nutrition [PN] which is a method of feeding that bypasses the gastro-intestinal tract. Nutrition is given intravenously where a patient cannot receive food by mouth or into the stomach. PN began to be administered that same day but Y continued to receive no food or liquids orally [NBM]. </p>

He told the mother that he would discuss her request with the consultants and if they thought it was in order for her to leave, he would tell her. The mother did not wait to find out what the consultants thought and asked Nurse CAI if she could leave the ward. He considered that Y was well and so allowed the mother to leave. About 15 minutes after leaving the ward and whilst he was in Ronald McDonald House with this mother, Y became unresponsive and stopped breathing. With the help of another parent, Y was brought to Accident and Emergency where he was found to be unconscious on arrival. He responded to stimulation and oxygen via a facial mask.

Refeeding syndrome is a syndrome of metabolic disturbances which occur as a result of restarting nutrition to patients who are starved or severely malnourished or who are metabolically stressed due to severe illness.

The following day, 23 February 2017, Y&#8217;s screaming during a feed was witnessed by Nurse N, a student nurse and the mother&#8217;s friend, LW. Nurse N recorded that the mother had her hand under the blanket she was using to comfort Y each time the feed was given. At 21.35 Nurse G gave Y a feed in the presence of the mother, a student nurse and Ms LW. Nurse G recorded her suspicion about (a) the mother&#8217;s insistence that she had been told by the doctors to cuddle Y as he was being fed and (b) the mother&#8217;s hand being under the blanket which covered Y&#8217;s leg. As soon as Nurse G announced Y&#8217;s feed had finished she saw movement under the blanket and Y screamed. Nurse G believed Y was being hurt by his mother and told the nurse in charge who asked her to look at Y&#8217;s leg. Nurse G saw a pin prick mark on Y&#8217;s leg and told the mother she would get a doctor to come and see Y as he was so upset after his feed. </p>

Whilst she was examining Y, Dr D noticed that the mother had her hand under the blanket over his arm and when Dr D moved the blanket away she saw the mother tightly gripping/digging her nails into Y&#8217;s left wrist. As the blanket was removed, the mother started to stroke Y&#8217;s arm whereupon he immediately stopped crying and was relaxed and settled. Y was examined later that night by a surgical registrar who did not see any suspect red marks or scratches. </p>

Y spent lengthy periods in hospital as an inpatient and was presented to hospital whenever his mother (if not hospital staff) thought he was unwell. When the mother was unhappy about the care given by H1 and by H3, she made her discontent plain to staff. She did not attempt to conceal from H2 that Y had been receiving care from H1 when she took him there on 2 June 2016.   </p>

The parents complained about 13 aspects of Y&#8217;s care, only three of which were upheld by H3&#8217;s internal reviewers. The first matter upheld was when Y was fed 24 hours&#8217; worth of PN over a 3 hour period because of a nursing error.  H3 accepted the error and apologised unreservedly. It likewise offered a fulsome apology when the parents complained about a nurse falling asleep on 4 March 2017 when that nurse should have been supervising the mother&#8217;s care.

I note that Dr P questioned whether all Y&#8217;s reported symptoms were truly present. He confirmed that NG tubes can be easily dislodged and come out of place whereas NJ tubes &#8211; as their lower end is sited deep in the digestive system &#8211; are more difficult to dislodge. It would be unusual and difficult for a 3-4 month old child to dislodge a NJ tube. He had never been made aware that the mother had removed Y&#8217;s NJ tube when she had seen it dislodged. </p>

Dr D was worried by: (a) Y&#8217;s overall state of health and the medically inexplicable persistence of symptoms of vomiting and pain with miniscule amounts of enteral feed; (b) nurses stopping Y&#8217;s feed after an ultra-sound scan the previous Friday based on what mother had told them even though the clinical team had given clear instructions to stop feeds only after discussion with the doctors; (c) unusually the PN line had become disconnected the previous Sunday even though the nurse was happy with the connection; (d) the mother agreed with the feeding plans but then would hinder these being implemented; (e) Y had apparently vomited twice about 30 minutes after his feeds even though he was being fed about a drop of water into his bowel which was some distance from his stomach; and (f) the vomiting had not been seen by the nursing staff. </p>

A variety of other surgical procedures were carried out in response to Y&#8217;s continued vomiting and deteriorating presentation. These included the adaptation of the PEG tube into a PEG J tube to provide feed directly through the stomach into the jejeunum on 29 November 2016 and then a surgical jejeunostomy to bypass the stomach altogether. From a surgical perspective Mr D was unable to explain why Y continued to vomit. Additionally, central venous catheters were inserted to allow for PN as enteral feeding was so difficult to establish after the fundoplication. The Hickman line was inserted on 10 December 2016 because of continuing difficulties even after the PEG insertion. </p>

It was only when (a) her reporting of symptoms could not be clinically explained and (b) she appeared to be resistant without apparent good reason to Y&#8217;s enteral feeding that their suspicions were aroused.

They show a child who was literally wasting away before the eyes of the staff and of his parents. It was plain to me that Y&#8217;s presentation during this time was a source of enormous concern to the doctors treating him.

Having listened carefully to the evidence on this issue, I was struck by how quickly the team at H2 came to its view. Even allowing for the evidence of Dr U who had recognised the need to monitor the mother carefully, there was no evidence in the medical records from 2 June to 15 June 2016 detailing how this was to be done. The safeguarding concerns raised by H1 do not seem to have been fully appreciated and Dr B told me that he had been influenced by the mother&#8217;s distress so as to accept her version of events about what had happened at H1. To add to the difficulties, the notes of the safeguarding meeting on 15 June 2016 recorded that the mother had been told by H2 staff about H1&#8217;s concerns. This was apparently done in error. The medical records do not contain any detail of when or what she was told but it was recognised that this information may have altered her behaviour during this particular hospital admission.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Dr Yadav&#8217;s report and evidence were strongly criticised by Ms Delahunty QC. I summarise the main features of her submission as follows. She said that Dr Yadav failed to properly evaluate the mother&#8217;s written evidence, particularly her alternative explanations as to why Y got better after 24 February 2017, in his second report. He had simply failed to consider her case as he should have done. He had also formed a view that Y had been the victim of physical assault by his mother on 22/23 February 2017 and justified that view on the basis that medical staff (including nursing) should be believed above non-medical witnesses. He had failed to identify any contra indications to the allegations of abuse and had mis-stated the evidence against the mother by using absolutes such as &#8216;vomits had never been witnessed&#8217; and &#8216;pain on feeding had never been seen&#8217;. His approach to this case had not been that required of the independent expert. Ms Delahunty QC commented adversely on Dr Yadav&#8217;s experience of factitious illness disorder in that he had seen two such cases as a clinician and two as a court-appointed expert. In one of those cases he had been the subject of adverse criticism by Hayden J but had not been previously aware of the same [<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Westminster CC v M, F and H</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/518" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 518 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 518 (Fam)</ref>]. The criticisms made by Hayden J were put to Dr Yadav by Ms Delahunty QC.

Though he summarised this aspect of the mother&#8217;s case in his review of the new material provided to him, he did not comment on it at all within the body of his report. The first time the mother heard Dr Yadav&#8217;s view about this aspect of her case was when he was being asked questions by the local authority. That was profoundly unfair to the mother who was entitled to know what the expert made of this issue before he went into the witness box. Dr Yadav told me that he had complied with the instructions posed to him, namely to answer the questions posed by the parties in the second letter of instructions and do no more. He did not consider that more was required of him than this. That approach seems to me to ignore the expert&#8217;s duty to take account of all the material facts when coming to his opinion [see paragraphs 4.1(g) and 9.1(f)(i) of Practice Direction 25B of the Family Procedure Rules 2010]. It should have been obvious to Dr Yadav that this aspect of the mother&#8217;s case should have been addressed in his second report whether or not he was asked a question about it. Had he been unclear whether he should address this issue as he was not specifically asked about it in his second letter of instruction, it was open to Dr Yadav to clarify this with the lead solicitor. He did not do so. </p>

This was clearly inaccurate given the contents of the father&#8217;s statement and that of Nurse N. His report also stated categorically that Y had not been seen to have pain after feeding. This again was inaccurate and Dr Yadav admitted that he had overstated this feature of the medical records. Though these are but two examples, I formed the view that Dr Yadav had not been as careful in his analysis of the medical records as was consistent with the duties placed on a courtappointed expert.

Nurse T was not aware of this and said she would not have advised the mother to do this.

The mother refused to bring Y into the hospital after 4 July 2016 for ongoing daily observation of his feeding. At that time the plan was for Y to be weaned as Dr B explained to the mother on 4 July 2016 when she seemed happy for this to continue. The mother told Nurse T by text on 5 July 2016 that she would keep Y at home until he was due to see the consultant. When Y saw the consultant on 8 July 2016 he was fitted with a NG tube. Nurse T thus did not witness Y&#8217;s apparent problems as reported by the mother which led to the re-instatement of tube feeding. </p>

The mother and Y were resident for extended periods of time in hospital and Y was latterly placed in a cubicle right by the nurses&#8217; station. Whilst it might be thought surprising that no such behaviour was seen by hospital staff, common sense suggests that children&#8217;s wards are busy places where staff are simply unable to observe each patient and their carer at length and at all times. The mother herself told me that in H1 the nurses&#8217; desk was some distance away from Y&#8217;s cubicle and staff often did not put feed up on time because they could not hear the alarm going off which would have alerted them to the need to do so.  </p>

Apart from my concern that the mother had not mentioned removing feeding tubes of whatever description in her evidence before the hearing, I found it difficult to understand why the mother would modify her case that she had removed NJ feeding tubes when these had dislodged. I have come to the conclusion that the mother modified her stance because she realised that removing a NJ tube was far more serious for Y than removing a NG tube because it would require an X-ray to check it was in the right position when it was re-inserted.   </p>

The mother told professionals and the medical notes recorded that Y had been admitted to hospital whilst on Lanzarote and had received IV fluids and/or antibiotics. In cross-examination by Miss Gilliatt, she denied giving this account but could not explain why the notes said otherwise. At the time the notes recorded the mother saying that Y had worrying symptoms such as 15 loose stools a day and also blood in his stools. She denied to me that Y had experienced such symptoms on a daily basis. Even allowing for the passage of time, the discrepancy between what she was reported to have said and what she claimed in her oral evidence was happening to Y was stark and unaccounted for by her answers to me. I note that neither Dr G nor Nurse T was cross-examined about the discrepancy between their notes and the mother&#8217;s account in any detail though the mother sought advice from both whilst she was in Lanzarote.  </p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the accounts. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person hearing accounts given by others.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have concluded that none of these matters either individually or in combination explains what the mother herself described as &#8220;huge improvement&#8221; in Y&#8217;s health shortly after 24 February 2017. First, the clinical team&#8217;s evidence is important &#8211; Dr H told me that, on 28 February 2017 when he saw Y on his ward round, Y was doing very well. He looked well and had not been vomiting and the problems seen/reported earlier had stopped. He told me that &#8220;we never found a diagnosis to explain this&#8221;. The improvement in Y&#8217;s symptoms was thus relatively rapid and predated much of the later events on which the mother relies.  Dr H was equally clear that the change in the ward was not significant as both wards had a good standard of care. The evidence was that the feeding plan after 24 February 2017 was the same as had been attempted prior to that date but which had failed. </p>

Y&#8217;s chylous ascites was not associated with pain on feeding and he had begun to improve prior to his hernia operation on 7 March 2017. The adjustments in the type of feed, the amount of feed, mechanism for feed delivery and the medication used to support feeding (domperidone) I regard as ancillary to the one factor which I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities improved Y&#8217;s health so quickly, namely that he was actually and consistently being fed enterally. That had simply not happened for many weeks before 24 February 2017 because of the symptoms of vomiting and pain which Y was reported by his mother to have.  </p>

Y has been investigated for just about every type of organic condition known to the skilled doctors treating him at H3 which might have explained his response to treatment after the fundoplication. None has been established. I have considered very carefully the possibility that Y suffered from an unknown condition at the time he was an in-patient in H3 but, on the balance of probabilities, Y&#8217;s presentation at that time and the almost complete resolution of his feeding difficulties are explicable by other factors. </p>

The unchallenged evidence shows the clinical team to have been very concerned about the number of times Y was reported to vomit. Nursing staff had never seen Y vomit and he was witnessed vomiting only once by a doctor.  The mother accepted in her evidence that vomits were rarely seen by staff. When Y was nursed in the HDU between 29 May and 31 May 2016, he was seen to vomit once yet he was reported to have vomited within 20 minutes of the mother being alone with him. When fed by nursing staff, Y took his feed without apparent difficulty and generally did not vomit.  </p>

I note that Y had not been fed since 6.30 am that morning and so I infer that, in this context, the amount of vomit produced shortly after 1 pm was of concern. Second, some of what was said to be vomit smelled like formula milk or Neocate milk and not curdled milk which is what might have been expected. Third, on 11 May 2016 the temperature of the vomit reported by the mother was freezing cold rather than warm as might be expected. Fourth, the pH of a number of alleged vomits was tested and found to be the same as that of the formula milk Y had been given. That would not be the case if the alleged vomit had come from Y&#8217;s stomach. The mother accepted that the pH levels found were inconsistent with vomit. </p>

The barium meal on 5 December 2016 showed no reason why fluid placed in Y&#8217;s jejeunum entered his stomach which he then vomited. The pyloroplasty on 20 December 2016 made no apparent difference to Y&#8217;s vomiting and the contrast study on 19 January 2017 left Mr D wholly puzzled as to how feed was entering Y&#8217;s stomach to be vomited. Y was said to vomit even when he had received no nutritional intake either by way of enteral feeds or PN. Other causes of vomiting were investigated, none producing any explanation for why Y continued to vomit. The absence of any apparent medical reason for Y&#8217;s continued vomiting at the rate reported by the mother raised the real concern that this symptom was being exaggerated by her. That impression was reinforced by what happened after 24 February 2017 when Y simply stopped vomiting after his mother was no longer involved with his care. </p>

The mother was clearly unhappy about bottle feeding and wanted the reinstatement of tube feeding. She plainly refused re-admission on 1 June 2016 when this as recommended by Dr S and gave the excuse of X missing her when she removed Y from the hospital on 31 May 2016, contrary to what had been agreed with Dr P. When told on 2 June 2016 that Y should be readmitted because of his weight loss, she removed him from H1 saying that the medical staff were accusing her of starving Y.  </p>

This was an allegation never made beforehand and which did her little credit given her concession that she had been untruthful to the police in interview on 28 February 2017 by suggesting that she had removed Y from H1 because the staff were &#8220;pinning him down&#8221; to get him to feed. It was obvious to me from the sequence of events and her evidence that the mother had felt her own behaviour was coming under scrutiny at H1. She asked for a referral to another clinician in circumstances where Dr P&#8217;s sensible advice to her was that Y&#8217;s weight required daily checks and where Y had lost weight when he was at home.  Her angry and critical behaviour at the hospital on 2 June 2016 was not in response to any fault by the clinical staff but allowed her to walk out of H1 on the basis of a disagreement with the clinical team. Her behaviour prior to 2 June and her behaviour on the day itself spoke strongly of someone putting her own interests to the fore rather than those of her son. I agree with the local authority that she behaved in this way to avoid more intense scrutiny of her feeding of Y.     </p>

I find that she did so and reject the explanations she proffered for her behaviour.  When asked about this time in her oral evidence, the mother was unable to explain convincingly to me why she had failed to do what had been asked of her. First, she said that she failed to bring Y into the hospital for daily weighing as she had had a row with the father and his parents and thus had to take X to nursery herself instead of relying on them. This practical problem (if not the reason for it) would have been easy to explain to the hospital at the time but the mother did not do so. Then, she told me that Y had refused the baby rice but also screamed when she offered rusk and banana. If that was so, it is difficult to see why the mother would not have sought advice from CS or Nurse T about what else might be tried to get Y to bottle feed. She did not do so. Instead, Nurse T reported the mother asking on 4 July 2016 for a NG tube to be reinserted, a request which was refused. I am of the view that this refusal, coupled with the hospital&#8217;s advice to continue with weaning and bottle feeding, led to the mother&#8217;s decision to absent herself and Y from daily visits to the ward until the end of the week when Y was due to see the consultant. By then Y had lost weight and a NG tube was reinserted.  </p>

I do not regard that as credible evidence for the following reasons. By 1 February 2017 the photographs showed that Y had lost weight and he looked very unwell. He had been in hospital for a long time without apparent improvement in his feeding and had spent many days receiving no nutrition at all.

This cessation of feeding was in defiance of Dr H&#8217;s instruction that feeds should not be stopped for minor matters such as small vomits or loose stools. </p>

Even though the mother&#8217;s evidence that she had pulled out Y&#8217;s NG tube was something she had not said before, my assessment of the medical evidence was that the pulling out or dislodging of NG tubes was not an uncommon event for small children who would be irritated by the presence of a tube in their nose and throat. Given that, it would be unwise of me to make the findings sought by the local authority about the frequency with which the NG tube was dislodged whilst Y was an in-patient at H1 and the mother&#8217;s responsibility for this occurring.

I have already explained how the mother&#8217;s position in this regard altered from what was put to Dr U and Nurse T. I concluded that the mother modified her position during the course of the hearing because she realised that removing a NJ tube was far more serious for Y because it would require an x-ray to re-site that tube. These shifts in the mother&#8217;s position mean that I cannot rely on her denial that she removed Y&#8217;s NJ tube from time to time.

Thus, the summer fruits incident, if I found it had taken place as alleged, would stand alone as an example of the mother introducing a foreign substance into equipment which was part of Y&#8217;s treatment. This incident was however qualitatively different from those in which lines/equipment were allegedly contaminated simply because the substance introduced into the NG discharge could not have harmed Y directly in any way. Y would potentially be harmed by the mis-reporting of what was said to be in his NG drainage in the same way that mis-reporting of symptoms might lead, for example, to unnecessary medication or intervention.

Third, clinical urgency dictated that blood and other samples were taken and tested regardless of the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; which might be preferred in a forensic setting and which cannot now be made good given the samples taken at the time.

Second, there was no research data placed before the court so that the significance of foreign or unusual organisms could be evaluated by me. An expert instructed to report as an expert would have done so. For example, it would have been helpful for me to know the prevalence of enterococcus faecalis in a hospital environment. Third, there was no opportunity to instruct a paediatric microbiologist given the late hour counsel with a grip on the forensic issues were instructed. I accept Ms Delahunty QC&#8217;s submission that the mother should not be penalised by that gap in the evidence which could not be made good by any other evidence properly available to me. The finding sought was that of introducing bacteria into Y&#8217;s bloodstream &#8211; in effect poisoning. So serious an allegation required in my view a safe evidential foundation. That was simply not present here. Fourth, I do not know whether Dr F has been asked in the past to provide an opinion about paediatric microbiology findings with reference to alleged contamination as opposed to such findings having a benign cause.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The local authority alleged that on 22 February 2017 during a feed Nurse O observed the mother holding Y&#8217;s foot underneath a blanket causing him to scream as if in pain. Nurse O looked at Y&#8217;s foot and noted his foot looked sore with what looked like old fingernail marks. Later that same day Nurse O is said to have seen the mother dig her nails into Y&#8217;s back causing him to scream. On the following day, 23 February 2017, </p>

Although he had been smiling and playful during the feed, when Nurse G announced the feed was finished there was movement under the blanket and Y screamed. When Nurse G changed Y&#8217;s nappy she noticed a red mark on his leg. Finally, on 23 February 2017, Dr D went to examine Y. He was crying during the examination and Dr D observed the mother had her hand under a blanket over Y&#8217;s left arm. When Dr D removed the blanket, she saw the mother had a very tight grip on Y&#8217;s wrist but when the blanket was removed the mother began stroking Y&#8217;s wrist. Y stopped crying immediately and was relaxed and settled after this when the mother was no longer touching him and the blanket was no longer covering him. </p>

The only entry she made about the mother&#8217;s care on 22 February 2017 was positive and she failed to make any record until 23 February 2017 about what she said she had witnessed the mother do to Y. Nurse O, it was submitted, did not act consistently with her suspicions and Ms Delahunty QC invited me to conclude that poor and delayed record-keeping cast significant doubt on the reliability of what Nurse O told me. </p>

Her ward manager advised her to put her concerns in writing and to send them in an email. The email was dated 23 February 2017 and I have seen a copy of it. It is evident from the medical notes that the entry relating to Nurse O&#8217;s concerns postdated the events in question. Whilst the advice Nurse O was given seems to me to have been misconceived and, were the mother to have acted in the way Nurse O alleged, could have placed Y at risk of further physical harm, I consider it unfair to criticise Nurse O for following her manager&#8217;s instructions. In saying that I am of the opinion that good nursing practice, both for Nurse O and her manager, would have indicated the immediate reporting of and action on Nurse O&#8217;s observations. </p>

Her reaction was in keeping with what she believed that she had seen as she left Y&#8217;s cubicle and asked the doctors to review Y once more and she told her ward manager about what the mother had done. Her ward manager told her to continue with her observations of the mother. </p>

Ms Delahunty QC criticised the inconsistency in Nurse O&#8217;s accounts as to whether she could or could not see the mother&#8217;s hand in contact with Y&#8217;s foot under the blankets. On reviewing that evidence, I have concluded that Nurse O was doing her best to answer the questions put to her accurately but was clearly unable to say that she had seen the mother&#8217;s hand as this was under the blanket. Y&#8217;s reaction and the movement under the blanket had led her to conclude that the mother was responsible for Y&#8217;s screaming. Ms Delahunty QC also submitted that during the second feed members of the paediatric team were present but did not appear to have observed anything consistent with Nurse O&#8217;s observations. There is no entry in the medical records from any of the paediatric team about what they saw during that feed. </p>

This time Nurse O said she saw the mother digging her fingernails into Y&#8217;s back causing him to scream. Unlike the medical team who were standing at the foot of the bed, Nurse O who was standing on the left-hand side of the bed had a clear view of the mother&#8217;s hand. Nurse O was also clear that the amount of feed being given to Y was tiny and yet Y experienced pain immediately when she pushed the syringe to start the feed. Her email also indicated that each time Mr AA asked her to push more milk into Y&#8217;s feeding tube, the mother would dig her nails into Y&#8217;s back to make him scream.  </p>

When the mother left Y in her care to leave the ward, Nurse O noticed that Y&#8217;s foot was red and sore and that he had old nail marks on his right foot. Nurse O showed these to her ward manager and to another member of staff. Criticism was made of Nurse O for failing to have Y properly examined in the aftermath of what she said she had witnessed. I do not know why she did not report her suspicions to the medical staff though I suspect that her responses would have been guided by the advice of her ward manager. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Standing back and evaluating the evidence on this issue, I have concluded that on the balance of probabilities the mother did behave during the first two feeds in such a way as to cause Y to scream when he was being fed. I have also concluded that during the third feed the mother did take her nails into Y&#8217;s back causing him to scream. Though Ms Delahunty QC has made some telling criticisms of the poor record-keeping associated with what Nurse O saw, none of these explain why a nurse with whom the mother had an excellent relationship would accuse the mother of harming Y. </p>

I note that the mother had requested that Y&#8217;s feed was delayed until she returned to the ward after getting herself a Chinese meal. This was not in dispute. Nurse G was extremely clear about what she had observed and her account of a blanket covering most of Y was supported by the account of the student nurse who was also present during this incident. LW accepted in her evidence that there was a blanket covering Y lying across his legs and moving when he moved. That was not the account that she had given in her written statement. I note that the mother initially denied to the police that there was a blanket though later in her interview she accepted the presence of the blanket but said it did not cover Y&#8217;s foot.  </p>

She accepted that she could not see what was happening underneath the blanket though she was clear that the mother made great efforts to ensure that the blanket also covered her hand. Nurse G explained that she had positioned herself so that the mother was unable to see the syringe which administered the feed to Y. During the feed Nurse G observed that Y was smiling but when she announced that the feed had finished, she saw movement under the blanket and Y screamed out. This continued at intervals though Nurse G tried to move the blanket without success as the mother repositioned it to cover her hand. The student nurse who was present noted that Y started crying shortly after Nurse G said that the feed had started. Nurse G said that she saw a red pinprick mark on Y&#8217;s lower left leg following this incident. The presence of this mark was not confirmed on examination either by Dr D or the surgical registrar, both of whom examined Y later that night and saw marks on his leg consistent with injection sites. </p>

She complained that Nurse G was obstructive under cross examination and that, having discussed with Nurse O on the telephone what Nurse O had allegedly seen during her shift, Nurse G had come to the ward that evening with the intent to prove a point against the mother.  </p>

Discussion between Nurse O and Nurse G is not, without more, sufficient to found the submission that Nurse G&#8217;s account on the day itself was contaminated and motivated by dislike for the mother. As my analysis of all the findings sought has, I hope, made clear, it is not for the mother to prove her innocence but for the local authority to prove its case allegation by allegation. Having thought very carefully about this incident, I have concluded that there was no reason for Nurse G to invent or exaggerate what she saw and that I can rely on her account made in the immediate aftermath in preference to that of the student nurse made nearly 24 hours later.  </p>

Ms Delahunty QC submitted that Dr D had a genuine and honest belief in what she saw but was mistaken and had been influenced by what she had been told had happened by others. I do not accept that submission. Dr D&#8217;s evidence was fair and measured and she was clear in her recollection, having had direct sight of what she was seeing albeit for a very short time. She was adamant that she saw the mother gripping/digging her nails into Y&#8217;s arm and what she saw correlated with Y&#8217;s reaction. There was no reason for her to be untruthful about what she saw that evening even if there was no apparent injury visible to Y thereafter. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Having made the majority of the findings contended for by the local authority, I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s behaviour caused or was likely to cause Y to suffer significant physical and emotional harm. That harm was measured by the many unnecessary months in hospital during which Y was separated from X and, notwithstanding the visits made by the father and X to the hospitals where Y was an in-patient, Y was unable to enjoy family life with his father, X, and his wider family. Y also had numerous investigations and interventions - multiple x-rays, biopsies endoscopies, blood tests - in the vain pursuit of a medical explanation for his feeding problems and weight loss. As the events following 24 February 2017 demonstrated, Y&#8217;s recovery was entirely attributable to the removal of his mother from caring for him which allowed him to be fed enterally for a sustained period of time in contrast to what had gone before. Thus, on the balance of probabilities, I infer that it was his mother&#8217;s behaviour which accounted for his feeding difficulties and his weight loss. For the avoidance of doubt, I am also satisfied to the requisite standard that surgical interventions &#8211; namely, the insertion of the Hickman line on 16 December 2016 and the operation to insert a tube into his pylorus on 20 December 2016, and the pyloroplasty on 10 January 2017 - which took place after 22 November 2016 were medically unnecessary. These procedures were associated with Y&#8217;s continued inability to feed and his vomiting. </p>
