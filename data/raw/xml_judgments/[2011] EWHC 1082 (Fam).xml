She wanted to be at the hearing, but the local authority opposed her attendance on welfare grounds.  The issue was referred by the County Court to this court on the eve of the hearing.

Their views are gathered and their points of view argued by trained adults.  In proceedings brought by the state, the representation of children by a Children's Guardian and solicitor is an indispensable safeguard.  In acute disputes within the family, the need for children to be separately represented has been increasingly recognised in recent years: e.g. </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">Mabon v Mabon</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 1011" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 1011</ref>. </span></p>

In some courts, including the Principal Registry, children, some quite young, are brought to court to be seen by a welfare professional at the outset of proceedings between their parents.  This process leads to a high rate of settlement, perhaps because the views of the children shape the outcome, or perhaps because some parents feel anxious about putting their children in the spotlight.  </span></p>

These are not for the purpose of gathering evidence, but to enable children to feel more involved and connected with the court process.  Such meetings have surely become more common following the Guidelines approved by the President of the Family Division in April 2010.  The authors of the guidelines, experienced family law judges, argued that children who want to see judges should be supported in doing so, and not protected from participation.</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">The range of adult views on children's participation is reflected in the views of children themselves.  Most children hate being drawn into disputes between their parents and many find it difficult to be asked to make choices.  On the other hand, some children expect to be fully involved in decisions about their lives, and resent exclusion, particularly where proceedings are being brought by outside authority.  Research into children who had been subject to legal proceedings, carried out for the NSPCC and published in 2007, found that only 10 of the 134 children questioned had attended court.  Some had only gone to look around and two had not wanted to go at all.  The large number who had not gone to court divided 60/40, the greater number saying that they would not want to go.  However, a sizeable minority (50 children) would have liked to go to court, and half of these would have liked to have seen the judge.</span></p>

Giving the Hershman/Levy Memorial Lecture to The Association of Lawyers for Children in June 2007, Sir Nicholas Wilson has referred to the possible advantages of meetings between children and judges for all concerned: for the judge in understanding the child better, for the parents in gaining reassurance that the court does not entirely depend on professional accounts, and for the child: </span></p>

Hopefully the child will feel respected, valued and involved, as long as she is not coerced or obliged to make choices that she does not wish to make. Many children, especially the older ones who are loyal to both parents, simply do not want to be asked to choose. But it is just as important that they be enabled to say that, as it is that they be enabled to express a choice if they have one. It also presents an opportunity to help the child understand the rules. Just as the parents will have to obey the court order whether they agree with it or not, so will the child. Hopefully, a child who has been involved in the process may feel more inclined to comply with the decision than one who feels that she has been ignored.</span></p>

These include speaking directly to the judge in court, speaking to the judge outside court, writing a letter to the judge, appearing by video-link or telephone or Skype, or by their views being expressed through a trusted, neutral individual. </span></p>

I would have thought that to sit for hours, or it may be even days, listening to lawyers debating one&#8217;s future is not an experience that should in normal circumstances be wished upon any child as young as this.&#8217;&#160;</span></p>

Moreover, it is likely to increase their sense of responsibility for what is being decided, and to cause anxiety and distress. It is said that the court should be satisfied that the interests of the child indicate that the child should be in court if there is a suggestion that the child wishes to come.&#160;</span></p>

For my part I cannot see any analogy between orders made in this Division and orders made by the criminal court. The purpose of the criminal court is to deal with criminal offences committed by people or children, and one of the aims at any rate of the criminal court is to punish the perpetrators.&#160;</span></p>

It is, as the Official Solicitor said, a benign jurisdiction. It is to protect the child, sometimes from others and sometimes from itself, and in some cases it is necessary in order to protect the child and to act as a good parent would act to curtail the child&#8217;s liberty for a time. The statute which provides for this is limited in its scope; not only the court but also the Secretary of State in the case of young children has to be satisfied that secure accommodation is necessary. I am told that there are probably some thousand children a year put into secure accommodation, so that the numbers of orders made are quite substantial.&#160;</span></p>

It was his view on the evidence he heard or the reports he had read that the child would have to be physically &#8216;shackled&#8217;, as he put it, in court in order to control him. This in itself would be sufficient ground in the inherent jurisdiction of the court to refuse to allow the child to be in court. One can see that the prospect of disturbance or unruliness in court, or the possibility of the child being educationally subnormal, or the child being much younger than this child, would be examples of cases where the court would not allow the child to be in court for the hearing.&#160;</span></p>

In either case, in considering child welfare and children's rights we would, I think, give more weight to the potential benefits of greater involvement by children who want to be present when important decisions about their future are made.  It can no longer be presumed that attendance in court is likely to be harmful: if this is so, thought must surely first be given to adapting court procedures to meet children&#8217;s needs before deciding to exclude them.  Nor should children have to prove that their attendance at proceedings about them is in their interests.  The starting point should be an open evaluation of the consequences of attendance or non-attendance in terms of the welfare of the child and the court&#8217;s ability to manage its proceedings fairly.</span></p>

In secure accommodation cases, the risk of fight or flight may be so high as to make attendance unwise.  On the other hand, the fact that children in secure accommodation will inevitably have to be guarded cannot in itself be a reason for proceeding in their absence.  As to the chance of disruption in court, the safety of other court users must be considered.  Children who are in secure accommodation often find their way there after violence at home or at school, and in the secure unit itself.  The fact that trouble at court cannot be ruled out will be a factor, but may not be a conclusive reason for refusing attendance.  Criminal courts routinely accommodate people who pose a risk to the public, and family courts are used to dealing with situations of high emotion.  </span></p>

The length of the journey, the amount of time the child will be out of placement, and the cost of attendance where supervision is required may also inform the decision.  However, the court will be slow to refuse to allow a child to attend for such reasons alone, unless it has exhausted possible alternatives.  The availability of a video link in or near the placement should at least be considered, consistent with the Public Law Proceedings Guide to Case Management (paragraph 24) which encourages the court to make full use of technology.</span></p>

She has had no less than six placements in the course of the year.  She initially spent three months in a foster home, which ended because of her difficult behaviour.  She spent two months in another foster home, which ended when she threatened violence to younger children.  She lived for six weeks with a respite carer, but the placement ended when she trapped the foster carer&#8217;s arm in the door, pushed her to the floor and locked her out.  She was then placed in a residential assessment placement for two months.  She was verbally and physically abusive towards staff and peers, punching, kicking, head-butting and biting, and attempting to push staff members down the stairs.  She stabbed a staff member in the hand with a fork and regularly threatened people with knives and other objects.  Psychological assessment found that she was not mentally disordered but that her difficulties were behavioural.  A therapeutic placement was recommended, but not approved.  She went to another foster placement, which lasted a month, and ended with her pulling on the handbrake and attempting to jump out of a moving car.  On return home K threatened her carer with knives and a meat cleaver, resulting in an injury to the carer's hand.  She then went to a residential placement for a week, but they could not manage her.  Just before Christmas 2010 she was placed in a two-bed therapeutic placement with on-site educational provision.  She regularly assaulted staff members, causing black eyes, bruising and split lips.  In March 2011 she seriously assaulted a staff member, jumping on her and repeatedly punching her in the head.  A staff member lost consciousness and was taken to hospital.  At the time it was thought that her skull was fractured.</span></p>

I directed the local authority to make the necessary arrangements, in consultation with the court.  All arrangements for the conduct of the hearing itself and for K&#8217;s participation in it were matters to be decided by Judge Bellamy.  I gave the local authority permission to make a telephone application to him to vary or discharge the order if there was a change of circumstances overnight.  I directed the local authority to file a short report describing K&#8217;s behaviour in the week following the order.  </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.38in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">I respect and understand the apprehensions of the professionals looking after K.  I nevertheless made the order because there was no convincing evidence that attendance would be psychologically harmful to K, and because the practical difficulties were manageable.  It was foreseeable that the almost inevitable secure accommodation order would be upsetting for K, but the chances of her accepting it, and with it the help that the unit is trying to give her, might just be increased if she was part of the event at which the decision was taken.  A decision taken in her absence would have zero chance of acceptance.  Similarly, it was foreseeable that K might "kick off" at court, but her escort would almost certainly be able to prevent physical harm.  In fact, it would probably be harder for her to injure herself or others in the presence of such an escort than it would be in the unit.  Anyhow, there is no reason why the court should be privileged from having to witness and deal with situations that social workers have to handle day in, day out.</span></p>
