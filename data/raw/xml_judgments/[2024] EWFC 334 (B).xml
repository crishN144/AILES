	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This is the final financial remedies judgement in this case. The case has been ongoing since 2017 as will be apparent from the case number and the unwieldy size of the file. Both parties are litigants in person. Neither was able to agree the trial bundle and separate bundles have been filed.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There has been protracted and costly litigation both in this case and in at least two sets of child arrangement proceedings. The two children BD aged 17 and KD aged 16 live with the husband and sadly have not seen their mother, the wife since November 2020 apart for a brief time in 2021.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The wife accuses the husband of domestic abuse and of alienating the children against her. It appears the children live with the husband because of the wife&#8217;s relationship with another man who was convicted of child sex offences on in June 2023, and that these two children were exposed to the risk of, and possibly actual, sexual and other harm.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is a particularly sad and poignant feature of this case that the children do not wish to see their mother. This may change as they get older and become more curious and begin to heal emotionally. The wife messages BS on Instagram and usually gets a short reply typical of a teenager. KD does respond to the occasional text from her mother. This is a start to rebuilding the relationship. It may be helpful in terms of the healing process if the mother were to write a letter expressing remorse for the harm caused.</p>

She has a hairdressing and beauty business. She is also the director of a company. The wife has not had responsibility for the children for four years and it seems to me that she has not maximised her earning capacity during that time. This was partially caused by Covid and by studying for a degree in Psychology which she successfully completed In June of this year. She only has herself to support and should be able to at least double her declared income in the next few years.</p>

This is because the husband has since November 2020 been the sole carer for the children. He is and will continue to be responsible for meeting their day-to-day needs. The marriage is relatively short, and the husband has been the main contributor financially. I bear in mind however that the starting point is that the matrimonial home is an asset to be shared.</p>

She accepts she does not need to rent a three-bed property as she is currently doing. She says her landlord intends to sell in any event.</p>

The husband has reduced the outstanding balance on the mortgage slightly since then. The husband will have to remortgage to buy out the wife. On these figures he could raise an additional &#163;22,627. I expect the remortgage to be completed within three months and the wife to sign the TR1 transferring her interest to the husband at the same time the remortgage completes.</p>

This amounts to a total 22% asset share for the wife. I consider this to be fair.  I have factored in half the cost of the pension report the husband still owes the wife.
