He welcomed the opportunity to file evidence of alternative living locations in Ukraine. He carefully went about identifying three locations which he considered were distant from the current conflict and in respect of which there has been little or no hostilities in recent times. One of these, I shall refer to as T Town. T Town is in western Ukraine around 150 km from Kyiv. It is close enough to X Town that N will be able to visit and see friends and family somewhere safe. In respect of T Town the father exhibits a letter from the town&#8217;s  &#8216;Executive Committee&#8217; stating the town has not seen any combat action. It is noted there are no facilities or infrastructure that is likely to be the subject of Russian aggression. The father&#8217;s friend&#8217;s letter dated 23 April 2024, is exhibited to the statement. It notes the father and N are welcome to live there. She notes it is a two bedroom house with all amenities. The father exhibits letters from others friends in other towns which sets out the arrangements they are able to make for the father and N to reside with them. </span></p>

She also gave written evidence that he has integrated more in the north of England and would miss his English friends. She raised a concern about the quality of the education in these other parts of Ukraine. She stated the teachers at his English school told her at a recent parents&#8217; evening that N was doing well. She stated things had moved on since the Cafcass report.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As is apparent from the earlier judgment I had concerns about N&#8217;s safety in  X Town caused by the proximity of the C Facility. Since that judgment the Russian armed forces appear to have shelled and destroyed electricity infrastructure in or near X Town. I am however satisfied that the three alternative locations identified by the father do not carry the same low risks of grave harm to N&#8217;s physical safety. Of the three towns proposed by the father, the mother favoured T Town and the father readily agreed to locate there. T Town is in the West of Ukraine. There is no evidence that T Town has a facility similar to the C Facility that caused me concern for N&#8217;s safety in my earlier judgment. Unlike X Town, T Town has not been repeatedly attacked and there have been no civilian fatalities. The town&#8217;s Executive Committee states that it is not part of the ongoing combat. The mother&#8217;s evidence points to no open source information about the risks to civilians of the war in T Town or the other locations identified.  I am therefore satisfied that if N returns to Ukraine and resides in T Town (or such similar town) he is not at risk of grave harm or intolerability brought about by the physical risks to him of the on-going war. I am of course aware that the judge in the X Town area family court may take a different view as to the safety of X Town and the risks to N. I have little doubt a judge in X Town will have a greater appreciation of the risks in that town than a judge sitting in London. That judge will have the benefit of carrying out a full welfare analysis of N&#8217;s situation and the comparative risks to his physical safety and his emotional, psychological and educational welfare in the fullest sense, which a judge considering a return order does not have. It is after all the purpose of the 1980 Hague Convention that the courts of country where the child is habitually resident carry out the investigation and determination of a child&#8217;s welfare. It is proper for N that a Ukrainian judge in a Ukrainian court should determine his arrangements after hearing from his father and mother.     </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The mother&#8217;s case under Article 13 (b) is also based upon the psychological harm of a return to a part of Ukraine in respect of which N is not familiar, with the risks of separation from her. She is not currently prepared to return to Ukraine and a family friend will return N to Ukraine if the return order is made. I do not accept that this case reaches the Article 13 (b) threshold of grave harm or intolerability.  Whilst Cafcass reported on 8 March 2024 and it is now 20 May 2024, the evidence seen overall is still clear that N wishes to return to Ukraine. For the purposes of this hearing I have re-read the helpful report and I accept there are references by N to wishing to return to X Town specifically. However, there are also several references to wishing to return to Ukraine generally and wishing to leave England. I also note that N will be with his father, who he stated he wishes to be with and in respect of whom he says he is closer than his mother. He will be with his dog. I have little doubt that for the period of the long Ukrainian summer holiday, he will be able to see his friends from X Town. He may well play in a summer football camp. He may begin distance learning at the school he studied so hard to gain admission to last year. Overall, he will be back in his country, with his people, speaking his preferred language. I very much hope arrangements will be made for contact between N and his mother. Her presence in his life is essential.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">I have taken into account the pressures of the war and the worry that N may harbour of the Russian advance across Ukraine and the possibility of his father&#8217;s conscription. On the evidence before me, these issues are theoretical, possible, future risks. But they are also risks that N </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">feels</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> whether he is in Ukraine or England. I have little doubt his caring parents and his wider family would make appropriate arrangements to protect him. I consider there are greater dangers physically separating him from his Ukrainian identity, his father, his dog and his friends. That is entirely consistent with the detailed Cafcass report. The fact of a little more integration into England over the last six weeks does not fundamentally alter the balance and I note the mother has produced no evidence of N&#8217;s wishes and feelings which alter or change what he told the Cafcass officer. It would be more psychologically harmful to keep N from Ukraine.  I emphasise that I have re-considered the evidence and analysis which underpins paragraphs 51 to 57 of my earlier judgment and have considered all the strands of the mother&#8217;s case on psychological harm together but I have come to the clear conclusion that the least psychologically harmful course for N is his return to Ukraine. Therefore the mother&#8217;s Article 13 (b) defence is not made out on the evidence.</span></p>

Should there be any issue, for the avoidance of doubt, I prefer Ms Chokowry&#8217;s legal analysis at paragraphs 22 to 28 of her position statement, submitting that this court need not delay N&#8217;s return to Ukraine to ensure the undertakings are formally registered first. That is inconsistent with court&#8217;s obligation to forthwith make a return order and the recognition of such measures by operation of law. In any event should there be any doubt, those undertakings will be offered to the Ukrainian judge at the hearing on 24 May 2024. </span></p>
