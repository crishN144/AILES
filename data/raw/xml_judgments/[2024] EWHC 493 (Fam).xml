	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In practical terms SM cannot leave her bed of her own volition, and according to her Mother does not like sitting up.  Her only body control is to be able to push her hands away and to wriggle and roll from side to side. She is moved by her carers from the bed to the floor, which according to her Mother she enjoys.  She cannot communicate in any form and does not understand language. It is difficult to assess her cognitive functioning, but her Mother described her responding like a child of a few months. She does respond to stimuli, and for those who know her well it is possible to tell whether she is responding positively or negatively. All her care needs are met by carers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Quite apart from the overarching issue as to whether SM should be subject to a DoLs order at all, there are a number of aspects of the above restrictions which do not amount to a deprivation of liberty. In my view (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) are on any analysis part of her care provision, and not actions which deprive her of her liberty. This would be the case whether or not SM was severely disabled. It is important that the &#8220;mission creep&#8221; that seems to have set into the DoLs applications to the High Court. There are many aspects of care which may intrude on an individual&#8217;s privacy and autonomy, and which may interfere, albeit with justification, into the scope of Article 8. But they are not interferences with the right to liberty enshrined in Article 8. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DoLs orders have become a depressingly common matter in the Family Division of the Family Court. Over the period of 12 months something in the region of 1700 such orders have been made. The exponential growth in these orders has been referred to in numerous cases in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2021/2136" uk:canonical="[2021] UKSC 2136" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] UKSC 2136</ref>. The enormous expansion of this area of law can be traced to two factors. Firstly, the caselaw, in particular the judgment of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West v P</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] AC 896" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] AC 896</ref>; and secondly the severe shortage of places in secure accommodation units, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T</span>. The present case does not concern the problem of the shortage of places. It is a product of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span> and the approach that has been taken to potential prospective breaches of Article 5 European Convention on Human Rights (&#8220;ECHR&#8221;). </p>

Although this Court will have regard to the domestic courts' related findings of fact, it does not consider itself constrained by their legal conclusions as to whether the applicant was detained or not, not least because the House of Lords considered the question from the point of view of the tort of false imprisonment (see paragraph 39 above) rather than the Convention concept of &#8220;deprivation of liberty&#8221; in Article 5 &#167; 1, the criteria for assessing those domestic and Convention issues being different.</span></p>

The majority of the House of Lords specifically distinguished actual restraint of a person (which would amount to false imprisonment) and restraint which was conditional upon his seeking to leave (which would not constitute false imprisonment). The Court does not consider such a distinction to be of central importance under the Convention. Nor, for the same reason, can the Court accept as determinative the fact relied on by the Government that the regime applied to the applicant (as a compliant incapacitated patient) did not materially differ from that applied to a person who had the capacity to consent to hospital treatment, neither objecting to their admission to hospital. The Court recalls that the right to liberty is too important in a democratic society for a person to lose the benefit of Convention protection for the single reason that he may have given himself up to be taken into detention (De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium (judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, &#167;&#167; 64-65), especially when it is not disputed that that person is legally incapable of consenting to, or disagreeing with, the proposed action.</span></p>

It may be that those rights have sometimes to be limited or restricted because of their disabilities, but the starting point should be the same as that for everyone else. This flows inexorably from the universal character of human rights, founded on the inherent dignity of all human beings, and is confirmed in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities . Far from disability entitling the state to deny such people human rights: rather it places upon the state (and upon others) the duty to make reasonable accommodation to cater for the special needs of those with disabilities.</span></p>

If it would be a deprivation of my liberty to be obliged to live in a particular place, subject to constant monitoring and control, only allowed out with close supervision, and unable to move away without permission even if such an opportunity became available, then it must also be a deprivation of the liberty of a disabled person. The fact that my living arrangements are comfortable, and indeed make my life as enjoyable as it could possibly be, should make no difference. A gilded cage is still a cage.</span></p>

I would not go so far as Mr Gordon, who argues that the supervision and control is relevant only insofar as it demonstrates that the person is not free to leave. A person might be under constant supervision and control but still be free to leave should he express the desire so to do. Conversely, it is possible to imagine situations in which a person is not free to leave but is not under such continuous supervision and control as to lead to the conclusion that he was deprived of his liberty.

There is no paradigm 12 year old who can be assumed to have a particular level of maturity, and therefore subject to a particular level of restraint and control. Secondly, and more fundamentally, it is a wholly unreal exercise to compare SM with another 12 year old. To the degree that such comparisons are useful, she functions cognitively in a way comparable to a baby of a few months in age and therefore, on the facts, that would be a much more useful comparator. Lord Kerr was simply not addressing the type of facts, and thus the legal issue, that therefore arises in this case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Scarborough submits that SM is deprived of her liberty, and therefore a DoLs order is required. She points out that SM is not free to leave the property of her own will, and that an ordinary 12 year old might be expected to have some liberty to come and go. SM must stay where she is &#8220;whether she wants to or not&#8221;. Her movements are entirely controlled by third parties as she cannot move on her own. This is a substantial interference with individual liberty, albeit that intervention is both benevolent and highly beneficial to her. She relies on what was said by MacDonald J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Manchester City Council v CP</span> [2023] EWHC 133 at [26]. </p>

She asserts that the &#8220;level of disability&#8221; is not relevant to whether there is a deprivation of liberty. The fact that SM has no volition, or free will, is again irrelevant to the legal issue. Her foster carers are acting as agents of the state and are exercising complete control over her physical liberty. </p>

It is important to note that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span> was concerned with the three individuals&#8217; inability to consent to the deprivation of their liberty, and their apparent compliance with the restraints placed upon them.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The argument was that by reason of their compliance, and the benevolent nature of their care, they were not deprived of their liberty within the meaning of Article 5. The Supreme Court found that they had been deprived of their liberty.  Given the issue before the Supreme Court, the ratio was that a disabled person is deprived of their liberty even if they are wholly compliant with the regime imposed upon them. I note that Lord Carnwath was concerned that Lady Hale was seeking to lay down a universal test, rather than consider the facts of the specific case, see [94]. However, it is clear from the Strasbourg caselaw that the question of whether an individual is deprived of their liberty must always involve a fact specific consideration, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Engel</span> and all subsequent cases. The tests being applied are applied to everyone, but the answer may differ depending on the circumstances of the individual. </p>

It was axiomatic that they were not free to leave because of some action (or inaction) of the State.  <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span> does not deal with the situation of a child such as SM who is incapable of &#8220;leaving&#8221; because of a combination of her physical and mental disabilities, not by reason of any restraints placed upon her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are a number of different ways of explaining why SM is not deprived of her liberty in breach of Article 5, but they all come down to focusing on the reason why she cannot leave where she is living.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fundamental to a breach of Article 5 is a deprivation of liberty attributable to the State, whether by negative or positive action. Often this will involve putting in place restrictions, such as locked doors or windows; or physically restraining the individual. However, the action to prevent someone leaving could be purely verbal or indeed psychological, which often will involve &#8220;close supervision and control&#8221;.  In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span> the facts suggest that there was little physical restraint, but the nature of the supervision was such that the individuals knew they were not allowed to leave and would be prevented if they tried to do so. So simply telling someone that they are not allowed to leave, may be sufficient to amount to a deprivation of liberty. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Scarborough placed much focus on the test of &#8220;close supervision and control&#8221; and submitted that applied to SM and amounted to a deprivation of her liberty. She referred to the fact that SM was under constant supervision, and virtually all physical movements were controlled by her carers. In my view that is to confuse two things. SM is undoubtedly under close supervision and control, but that is not in order to prevent her leaving. The close supervision is to meet her care needs. It does not need to be, and is not, for the purpose of preventing her leaving, because she is wholly incapable of leaving, both because of physical inability but also because she is unable to form any desire or intent to leave. It is simply not a concept of which she has any consciousness. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On a conceptual level it is difficult to see how one can be deprived of something that one is incapable of doing.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span> the Supreme Court, particularly in the speeches of Lady Hale and Lord Kerr, were concerned to protect and facilitate the rights of disabled people. There will be many instances where a disabled person cannot do something through their own volition, by reason of their disability, but could do it with appropriate support. An obvious example is a disabled person who cannot move without a wheelchair, and therefore cannot leave the property without assistance. It is easy to see that that person may be deprived of their liberty because they are not free to leave, even though they need third party help in order to leave. In that situation the State may be under an obligation to assist the person in leaving, and failing to do so might amount to a breach of Article 5.  Equally, there will be people with mental disabilities, who may not assert their right to liberty, but are restrained by being told that they are not allowed to leave. Those are the type of situations which were in contemplation in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, that is a wholly different situation from that of SM. She is both physically incapable of exercising her right to liberty, and mentally incapable of asserting it. In <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span> at [76]-[77] Lord Kerr focused on the &#8220;objective element&#8221; and suggested a comparison with a child of the same age &#8220;and station&#8221;. It is not entirely clear quite what he meant by this.  I note, however, that neither Lady Hale nor Lord Neuberger adopted the argument that the comparison must simply be a child of the same age and station. Lady Hale at [46] rather relied on the key tests of close supervision and not being free to leave. Lord Neuberger at [63] adopted the same words as Lady Hale. Therefore the binding ratio of the case is the test of close supervision and not being free to leave, rather than necessarily comparing SM with a non-disabled 12 year old. In many, indeed most cases, such a comparison will be very useful, and the approach has been applied in many subsequent cases as an appropriate exercise, never so far I am aware on facts similar to SM&#8217;s. </p>

To some degree this was the concern of the majority in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span>. The Court emphasised the universal quality of the rights granted by the ECHR, see [36].
