Those proceedings concluded in 2017.  The undertaking was given in respect of a Legal Services Payment Order made by Cobb J on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2016, which was later extended by HHJ Troy, sitting as a Judge of the High Court, on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017.  The wife was released from the terms of that undertaking by order of Sir Mark Hedley, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017, save for &#8216;the sum paid in respect of Counsel&#8217;s refresher for 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2017&#8217; because the case settled on the first day.  The wife disputes any amount is due in respect of the refresher.  It was, she says, set off against an earlier liability in the same amount for which the husband was responsible under the order of 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2017, and in respect of which she points to correspondence dated 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2017 in the court bundle.  The husband made no application to enforce the undertaking in those proceedings or since to the level of judge to whom it was given.  He has made no formal application in these proceedings.  I have declined to deal with it in the absence of any such application despite the order of 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2020.</p>

At present, the choice as to where she will continue her education is between a specialist college close to home, or one some 200 miles away.  XFR has recently been accepted by both.  The one closer to home currently offer a day placement Monday to Friday, with XFR living at home; it is possible that she may be able to board during the week, but this is yet to be confirmed and will be subject to funding.  The one further away offers a residential placement during term time.</p>

However, I repeat a decision about these options is still to be made and the funding for either, yet to be confirmed.</p>

Different figures are given for domestic help.  Reply 28 in the schedule of deficiencies states &#163;150 pcm is spent on such help, but the schedule puts the figure at &#163;30 pcm with an additional &#163;40 pcm wages (unspecified).  The August 2021 payslip shows &#163;750 being deducted for savings, whereas &#163;350 appears in the schedule.  The husband also claims &#163;400 pcm for petrol, despite the proximity of his workplace to his home.  There are also restaurant costs of &#163;100 pcm.  He also seeks &#163;188.33 depreciation for his car, recently acquired albeit second hand.  Holidays are put at &#163;300 pcm, weekend breaks, &#163;50 pcm.</p>

It will still leave a shortfall.  However, on his own account, he is living in a property he struggles to afford, which comprises substantial grounds, including a tennis court and swimming pool.  There is, as Mr Taylor points out, no evidence of him seeking to persuade the trust to allow him to downsize to a smaller property.  The husband&#8217;s evidence to me was that if he were to leave his present home, he would have to meet rental costs in the region of &#163;2,500 pcm.  He still has access to what remains of the critical illness cover, at least for the present. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the hearing on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2021, it was agreed that I should bring forward a review of my order to a further case management hearing on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2022 and list a further two-day hearing before me on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022.  I made directions for the filing of further evidence and a further report, on joint instruction, from the Welfare Rights Unit of the local City Council.  Having brought forward the timetable from that which was originally suggested, I thought it fair to increase the global award in my draft judgment from &#163;1,050 pcm to &#163;1,150 on the same terms as before.  The order will continue until 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022.  The increase acknowledges Mr Taylor&#8217;s point of the husband&#8217;s ability in the meantime to amortise what remains of his critical illness policy; my finding that the wife&#8217;s needs are &#163;2,800 pcm; and that I am making the order, at least at this stage, over a shorter period than was originally my intention.  Hence, I approve the order prepared by Mr Taylor, subject to it continuing to 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2022, at least at this stage.  I can extend or vary it in July 2022. I have varied paragraph 8 (d) to remove the words &#8220;after XFR has settled in college&#8221;. That amendment does not shut out arguments on either side as to what work the wife may be able to take up, its timing and availability, and XFR&#8217;s circumstances at the time.</p>
