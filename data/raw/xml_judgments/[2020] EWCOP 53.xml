She is currently an in-patient at Hospital X, with advanced cancer of the larynx (specifically, a right supraglottic T3 tumour with partial obstruction of breathing and swallowing) which was diagnosed on 7 September 2020. The condition is becoming increasingly life-threatening.  Following discussions with her doctor about treatment options, she chose to undergo a course of chemoradiotherapy (&#8216;CRT&#8217;). She was admitted to X hospital on 6 October 2020 due to the general deterioration of her health and on the following day she was assessed to lack capacity to make decisions regarding treatment. </p>

She enjoyed shopping and until recently she had worked (for many years) at her local Co-op store. AC characterises her as the lady that ran the house and managed the family finances.   Her sons say that she has suffered from long-standing anxiety: &#8220;she worries about everything, and then she worries about worrying, that is who she is&#8221;.  It appears now, though this has only relatively recently been discovered, that TC had for many years taken anti-depressant medication, only ceasing to do so when her cancer diagnosis was first made. </p>

She was placed on the inpatient waiting list by the ENT Surgeon for an urgent panendoscopy and biopsy. A CT scan on 17 August 2020 revealed that she had a large right sided tumour. She first spoke to the Head and Neck cancer specialist nurse, Ms S, on 25 August 2020 as she was awaiting her test results for a potential cancer diagnosis. Ms S has said that TC appeared anxious on the telephone but no more so than any other patient in that situation. </p>

Although this was at an advanced stage (stage 3), TC was informed that it was curative with the appropriate treatment. She was offered two options &#8211; surgery or chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Significantly, and following discussions, TC made a perfectly capacitous decision to undergo a course of CRT. She was subsequently referred to the oncology team for review and assessment. </p>

A face to face appointment was arranged to discuss further support. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">At the clinical appointment on 11 September 2020, Ms S was concerned by TC&#8217;s increasingly erratic behaviour. TC did not want to engage with advice on her problems with swallowing and was anxious about issues at home, which included issues with heating and hot water, despite her husband explaining that these had been addressed. She was concerned about surgery even when advised that this was not the option she had chosen. She left the meeting abruptly and AC stated that her presentation was completely out of character. A referral was made to the psychology team for support. </p>

She was considered physically fit for treatment and signed the consent form for chemoradiotherapy after Dr B explained that the treatment was her best chance of a cure. TC became upset after the appointment and was taken to another room by Ms S. AC also reported difficulties with her eating at home. </p>

The treating Consultant ENT / Head and Neck Surgeon, Dr P, performed a nasal endoscopy to examine her throat; I was shown this video footage (and the CT scan sequence) this morning.  He identified (and indeed we could see) that the tumour was significantly obstructing her airway and there was a risk that the airway could become completely obstructed. Consequently, she was admitted onto the ward for ongoing support and monitoring. TC allowed Dr P to insert a nasogastric tube to help meet her nutrition and hydration needs. </p>

The tumour has grown materially.  It is now of such a size that if it grows any more, it poses a real and immediate risk to TC&#8217;s life.  The specific concern, as it has most helpfully been explained to me by Dr P, is that during CRT the tumour may in fact swell (as a result of the treatment), and this could prove fatal.

If this procedure (which I emphasise Dr P has described as &#8220;necessary&#8221;) is for any reason unsuccessful, the team have indicated that they would need to move to perform a tracheostomy, which may need to be in place for 3-4 months or more.

Furthermore, if treatment is delayed the cancer may spread to other parts of TC&#8217;s body which would increase the risk that any treatment might not be curative. </p>

As I indicated above, the plan is to attempt to debulk the tumour in one of three ways: a micro-debrider (which Dr P described as a type of lawnmower which will shave the tumour), laser treatment (which is less likely to be effective because this provides a more targeted or focused attack on the tumour), and/or thirdly a  treatment which vaporises the tumour.  If any of these procedures fail, then a tracheostomy would need to be put in place.  It is acknowledged by all the treating doctors and the family that this would not be what TC would want but the doctors are clear that &#8216;needs must&#8217;.   </p>

It is better, opined Dr B in his oral evidence, to ensure the integrity of the airway before the CRT begins, than to have to interrupt it.  If CRT is interrupted for any period of time, it loses its efficacy, and the treatment would have to revert to palliative care only. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">There is an understandable concern about whether TC will co-operate with all or any of these treatments.  There is a real risk that she will not.  She has indicated that she was opposed to surgery; she is terrified of losing the ability to speak; this is a temporary consequence of the tracheostomy should that be necessary, although after a period there is the possibility of introducing a fenestrated tube which may allow some vocal function.  There are also risks associated with leaving a tube in place which she may well want to try and remove, and the repeated submission to daily CRT is likely to be challenging to her.  On the other hand, (a) low level dosage of lorazepam on the ward this week has had a beneficial effect on her anxiety levels; a single larger daily dose prior to the treatment would be indicated, (b) she has forged a good and trusting relationship with Ms S, who appears to understand her well, and who has been able to contain TC&#8217;s anxiety levels for the procedures undertaken thus far, (c) it is Ms S&#8217;s view that while TC may vocalise her opposition to various interventions, she is unlikely to be aggressive or physically resistant, (d) she will have the benefit of psychological interventions, and last but by no means least, (e) she has the unconditional support of her husband and sons whose care for, and interest in her, is evident, and which as she begins her recovery, she will I am sure increasingly come to appreciate.   </p>

If all treatment were refused, the survival rate would be a matter of a few weeks only.  There are risks and complications (acute and long term) associated with the procedure, which he outlines in his report: he refers to acute mucositis (pain in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat) within the high-dose region.

The treatment plan is also supported by her husband and sons.  While there are risks to the CRT treatment, including sore skin, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, taste changes, voice changes and fatigue, skin discolouration and/or ulceration and mucositis, these side effects are generally usually temporary, and typically resolve in 6-8 weeks. </p>

Once safe to proceed, it is in TC&#8217;s best interests that she should undergo the course of CRT.  This course of treatment enjoys reasonable prospects of success, no worse than any other course of treatment proposed, and would stand the greatest chance of her retaining her ability to use her voice in the future, which is TC&#8217;s greatest concerns.

As Dr O&#8217;Donovan was able to point out, even if it were not for the cancer, TC&#8217;s mental health state would probably justify inpatient treatment just now.  I am pleased to note and approve the fact that the report of Dr O&#8217;Donovan has already been disclosed to the liaison psychiatric team, who will continue to provide psychiatric treatment and support to TC and consider the recommendations made by Dr O&#8217;Donovan.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in;margin-right:0.03in">I wish to conclude first by expressing my considerable gratitude to the lawyers for bringing this case to the court so efficiently.  For the treating clinicians and nurses, Dr P, Dr B, and Ms S in particular, for their obvious sensitive and attentive care of TC.  I wish to thank Professor Nutting and Dr O&#8217;Donovan for preparing their clear and thorough court reports so quickly within the very tight timeframe imposed by the court.  I wish to thank AC, BC and DC for their participation in this difficult legal process; I am conscious how painful all of this is for them, and how desperately worried they are for TC, their much loved wife and mother.   </p>
