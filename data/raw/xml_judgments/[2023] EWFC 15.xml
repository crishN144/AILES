	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am concerned with the question of whether this court has jurisdiction in respect of the subject children, each of whom all parties accept are habitually resident in this jurisdiction for the purposes of Art 5 of the Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (hereafter &#8216;the 1996 Hague Convention&#8217;).  If this court does have jurisdiction pursuant to the terms of that Convention, a further question arises as to whether this court should exercise that jurisdiction.  These twin questions arise in circumstances where a court in the jurisdiction of the Hellenic Republic is purporting to exercise jurisdiction in respect of the children, notwithstanding that neither child is habitually resident in the jurisdiction of Greece for the purposes of Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  Both the United Kingdom and the Hellenic Republic are Contracting States to the 1996 Hague Convention.</p>

As I have noted, at the present time there are also proceedings on foot in respect of the children in Greece.  On 14 September 2021, the maternal grandparents made an on notice application to the Greek court for interim relief, which application was heard on 15 November 2021 by a Judge sitting in the Hellenic Court of First Instance in Athens, with a subsequent decision granting interim contact being handed down on 23 May 2022.  Indirect contact commenced on 5 June 2022. Whilst it initially appeared that the Greek court had limited itself to exercising an interim jurisdiction and that proceedings had come to an end with the decision on 23 May 2022, this court has now been informed that there is a final hearing of the maternal grandparents&#8217; substantive application listed before the Greek court on 20 February 2023.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the outset of this hearing, counsel on behalf of the maternal grandparents indicated to the court that, in circumstances where they accept that each child is habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales, the maternal grandparents further accept that this court has substantive jurisdiction in respect of the children pursuant to the terms of Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention.   The corollary of this concession is that the maternal grandparents recognise that the Greek court is operating outside the scope of that Convention and, accordingly, does not have jurisdiction in respect of the children absent a transfer of jurisdiction by this court under the terms of Art 8 of the 1996 Hague Convention. In the circumstances, Ms Laurent&#8217;s submissions concentrated on the application by the maternal grandparents pursuant to Art 8 for an order transferring jurisdiction to the Greek court.  That application is resisted by the parents, who contend that this court should retain and exercise its established jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The translation of judgment of the Greek Judge sets out the basis on which the learned Judge concluded that the Greek court has jurisdiction over the children.  The learned Judge considered in the course of her judgment the impact on the Greek jurisdictional position of Council Regulation EC 2201/2003 (hereafter BIIa), which remains in force in Greece but not in the United Kingdom following the UK&#8217;s departure from the European Union.   It would not appear however, that the learned Judge was referred during the course of argument to the 1996 Hague Convention, which remains in force between the Hellenic Republic and the United Kingdom, and there is no reference to that international instrument in the Greek judgment.  Indeed, the learned Judge appears to have proceeded on the basis that there was no international convention regulating the question of jurisdiction in this case.  Within this context, the learned Judge identified a concurrent Greek domestic jurisdiction as follows:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;In this case, Greek citizenship functions as an independent jurisdictional basis in the sense that it establishes, though concurrently and not exclusively, the international jurisdiction of the Greek courts even when the parents or the child do not have, nor did they have residence or residency in Greece. However, especially in the case of interim measures, the place of execution of the interim measures - and as such is considered not only the place of forced execution, but also of voluntary compliance according to substantive law - establishes a special jurisdiction and at the same time constitutes a corresponding basis of international jurisdiction for the application of interim measures, since it is not specifically regulated by an international convention, it is in principle accepted for reasons of public order to prevent unavoidable damage to the applicant or for another urgent and special reason, taking into account the admissibility and the possibility of executing the interim measures abroad.&#8221;</p>

The Greek court further placed the parents under a liability to pay a &#8364;150 fine for each occasion contact was obstructed.  </p>

Those applications came initially before HHJ Purkiss sitting at the East London Family Court.  In light of the jurisdictional issues raised by the case, and following discussion, HHJ Purkiss re-allocated the matter to me and listed the case for a directions hearing before this court on 17 November 2022.  </p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">&#8220;The international jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Athens to order interim measures regulating visiting rights  was not based on the presence of the children in Greece. The Court ruled that Greek citizenship functions in this case as an independent jurisdictional basis in the sense that it establishes, however concurrent and not exclusive, international jurisdiction of the Greek courts even when the parents or the child do not have residence in Greece. It also mentions that an additional jurisdictional basis is the fact that Greece will be the place of (voluntary) execution of the injunctive measures. It is mentioned in the Judgement that regardless of the fact that the international jurisdiction of the Greek courts to take injunctive measures, since it is not specifically regulated by an international convention, is in principle accepted for reasons of public order to prevent unavoidable damage to the applicant or for another urgent and specialized reason, taking into account in particular the admissibility and the possibility of enforcement of injunctive measures abroad. As correctly noted in the &#927;rder both the United Kingdom and the Hellenic Republic are signatories to the Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in Relation to Parental Responsibility and measures to protect children. Nevertheless, it is still supported by part of the jurisprudence and literature that a concurrent basis of jurisdiction can be established due to the Greek citizenship and the place of execution of the interim measures&#8221;</p>

Proximity in this context means the practical connection between the child and the country concerned. The Practical Handbook on the Operation of the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention paragraph 4.5 makes clear that habitual residence is an autonomous concept and should be interpreted in light of the objectives of the 1996 Hague Convention rather than under domestic law constraints.

Art 8(2) provides an exhaustive list of the factors capable of demonstrating such a connection.  Second, the transfer must be in the child&#8217;s best interests.  Third, both Contracting States must agree to the transfer of jurisdiction.  With respect to the best interests criteria, the Practical Handbook further observes as follows:</p>

The exercise of the Greek court&#8217;s jurisdiction in May 2022 cannot fall within the terms of Art 11 of the 1996 Hague Convention as the children were not present in the jurisdiction of the Hellenic Republic.  The terms of Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention are clear with respect to the general rule of jurisdiction.  It is the judicial or administrative authorities of the Contracting State of the habitual residence of the children that have jurisdiction to take measures directed to the protection of the children&#8217;s person or property as further defined by Art 3, which includes rights of access including the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child's habitual residence.  In circumstances where the children are habitually resident in this jurisdiction, Art 5 is conclusive of the question of jurisdiction in this case and confers exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the children on this court.</p>

The aim is that the court of the Contracting State with which the children have the closest connection will be the one to determine their best interests.  The reason for this is self-evident.  The authorities in the country of the children&#8217;s habitual residence are closer to, and will ordinarily have a greater understanding of, the children and their social and family environment.  They are therefore, ordinarily, better able to assess fully the children&#8217;s situation and welfare needs when reaching decisions about the children&#8217;s best interests.  </p>

The children are British citizens, albeit they also hold Greek citizenship.  They are registered with doctors in this jurisdiction and attend nursery provision in this jurisdiction.  Each child&#8217;s day-to-day family and social life is centred in this jurisdiction. Within this context, as conceded by the maternal grandparents, both children are habitually resident in this jurisdiction.  The corollary of this is that the vast majority of the evidence relevant to an assessment by a court of each child&#8217;s best interests is located in this jurisdiction.  In this context, the court in this jurisdiction has far easier access to the evidence required to inform the assessment of the children&#8217;s best interests and is placed far more advantageously to consider, for example, the impact on children&#8217;s physical, emotional and educational needs of given contact regime in the context of their daily lives and routines.   Having regard to the rationale underpinning this primary basis for jurisdiction under Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention, namely that it is in a children&#8217;s best interests for questions concerning their welfare to be decided in the place where the children are integrated into a family and social environment, in these circumstances I am satisfied that there is a strong presumption in favour of this court maintaining the jurisdiction in respect of the children conferred on it by Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention.</p>

Having regard to the fact that it is habitual residence that is the connecting factor conferring jurisdiction, and to the rationale underpinning this primary basis for jurisdiction under Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention, nationality is not capable on its own of demonstrating that another Contracting State is better placed to assess a child&#8217;s best interests for the purpose of Art 8.</p>

The maternal grandparents did not seek to assert that the Greek court has commissioned welfare assessments or expert assessments in respect of the children.  The children have not been spoken to within the context of the proceedings by welfare professionals as part of the assessment of their best interests.

Whilst it may well be that the Greek court could make an order for disclosure of records concerning the children were it to become necessary to do so in the assessment of their best interests, that exercise would be complicated by disclosure of the children&#8217;s records having to be sought in a foreign jurisdiction by way of a foreign court order.

The fact that the court grants permission to make the application does not create a presumption in favour of the substantive order (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re A (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 8</ref> Order: Grandparent Application)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 FLR 153" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 FLR 153</ref>).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the reasons I have given in this judgment, by reference to the terms of the Convention to which both the Hellenic Republic and the United Kingdom are party, I am satisfied that it is this court that has jurisdiction in respect of the children.  Although the Greek court has purported to exercise what it considers to be a concurrent domestic jurisdiction in respect of the children, and whilst I am of course fully respectful of the Greek legal system and the Greek court, in circumstances where the children are habitually resident in England and Wales the continued exercise of that jurisdiction by the Greek court is outside the scope of the 1996 Hague Convention.  For the reasons I have given, it is not appropriate in this case to transfer the jurisdiction that this court has in respect of the children under the Convention to the court in Greece.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances, I find that this court has jurisdiction in respect of the children pursuant to Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  I dismiss the application of the maternal grandparents for transfer of that jurisdiction to the Greek court pursuant to Art 8 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  I grant the permission to the maternal grandparents to make an application in these proceedings for a child arrangements order in respect of the children.  I further direct that the parties notify the court of the outcome of the hearing listed on 20 February 2023.  This court will thereafter consider whether this case needs to remain before a judge of High Court level sitting in the Family Court or can be re-allocated to HHJ Purkiss for hearing of the applications before the court.</p>
