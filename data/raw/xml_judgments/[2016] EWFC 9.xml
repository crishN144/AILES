The younger children see their mother four times a week. The older children are at school and they come twice a week.  The meetings have gone well.

At times Mr B has been sent to prison for violence.  He has also used drugs but says that he has not done that since the last time he went to prison in 2013.

What I am clear about is that he is dangerous to the children and their mother because of the way he behaves and because the mother is not able to stop him.  There is a good side to Mr A &#8211; everyone has a good side &#8211; and this makes it hard for H and A and their mother to see what he is really like.    </span></p>

The mother is a quiet and peaceful person.  She would like a happy home and for the children to do well at school.  She wants to be loved.  She is not interested in politics or religion and does not know much about what goes on in the world.  She is not at all curious and often finds things hard to understand.  In a day-to-day way she is a good mother and she certainly loves her children very much.  </span></p>

So the children had to stay in foster care instead of being able to go home.  The mother now says she is embarrassed to have been so stupid.  Maybe she is.  Mr A says that they shouldn&#8217;t have had to keep apart and that they were only doing what was natural.  It shows that he doesn&#8217;t care how the children are feeling.</span></p>

He said that if the children were not returned home, he planned to smuggle them out of the country.  They would go via France so as not to be stopped.  If people asked where they were going, they would say they were going on holiday.  He had tried to get away from England twice and failed.  The third time, he would succeed.  He was asked in court if this meant that he would take them to Syria.  He replied: &#8220;That&#8217;s your opinion&#8221;.</span></p>

By protecting Mr A, she also put them at risk of being smuggled out of the country.  I hope that she now realizes how dangerous Mr A is to her and her children and how he has used her.

At 11:23 the lawyers sent an email telling the court that the family was in mid-air and were due to land at 13:30 UK time.  They asked to appear in front of a judge urgently.  At 11:35 they sent a detailed draft order.  At 1:00 they arrived at court to make the application.  When they got there they found to their surprise that the order had already been made by Mr Justice Newton, who was travelling at the time.

Having heard all the evidence, I have no doubt that an urgent order was justified.  But even though orders of this kind sometimes have to be made in a hurry, it is still important that the proper procedures are followed as closely as possible.  Here, there was no evidence at all before the court and no record in the papers of how the judge dealt with the application.  So far as I can tell, all he had was the email and the draft order.  The order that was approved was inaccurate in a number of ways.  It referred to the judge being at Manchester and to a telephone hearing having taken place with the judge hearing from a lawyer and from Mr C, and to the judge having given a short judgment.  That is not how it happened.</span></p>
