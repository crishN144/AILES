	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">    The default rule, and any practice direction that modifies it, represent a general conclusion on how best to administer justice.  In reaching that conclusion a balance will have been struck between the relevant competing Convention rights and the factors, propositions and public interests that underlie them.  But <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>makes it clear that this is not the end of the process and that as between Articles 8 and 10 (and so the factors, propositions and public interests that underlie and promote them) neither takes precedence as such and so, in my view, it would be wrong to approach a default rule as creating a presumption.  Rather, it is part of the structure for a reasoning process that applies the <span style="font-style:italic">Re S </span>approach to a given case. </p>

The interest protected by publishing names expressed by Lord Rodger in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Guardian News and Media Ltd </span>(the naming propositions) is rather different and on a staged approach will often fall to be weighed against the general conclusion as to anonymised reporting contained in the relevant Rule or Practice Direction.</p>

This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the public nature of the proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also maintains the public's confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially. It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties' or witnesses' identity concealed. It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely . . . Any interference with the public nature of court proceedings is therefore to be avoided unless justice requires it. However Parliament has recognised there are situations where interference is necessary." </span></p>

If prohibiting publication of the family name and photographs is needed, the court must consider how great an impact that will in fact have upon the freedom protected by Article 10. It is relevant here that restrictions on the identification of defendants before conviction are by no means unprecedented. The situation may well change if and when the mother is convicted. There is a much greater public interest in knowing the names of persons convicted of serious crime than of those who are merely suspected or charged.

The other grounds identified were (a) C&#8217;s medical confidentiality, which it was argued did not survive her death, and (b) the administration of justice.

The Court of Appeal held that OPO had no such cause of action and so upheld the refusal of the court below to grant an injunction on that basis.  However, the Court of Appeal did grant an interim injunction founded on the prospects of success of one of OPO&#8217;s other causes of action, namely the intentional infliction of emotional harm by MLA.

I am not clear whether there were any references in the book that referred to OPO or were directly linked to OPO (see paragraphs 14 and 17 of   the judgment of Arden LJ) and I confess that I am also unclear what the ratio for the conclusion that OPO had no cause of action for misuse of private information (MPI) is (see paragraphs 45 to 47).

Also, so far as I am aware, there is no research on the question of what harm is done by partial, incorrect or incomplete accounts being given of private proceedings in the local community, whether the giving of such accounts would be reduced if there was a public hearing and how any such harm would be alleviated by such accounts being corrected and an accurate account of both sides of a dispute being given.</p>

Naturally, the argument for a private hearing on that basis  (or the basis referred to in the last two paragraphs) is greatly weakened by effective reporting restrictions and a responsible approach being taken by the public generally (e.g. on social media and the internet) and the national and local media. </p>

This is because it recognises that the invasion into private and family life by the COP is regularly not limited to that of P as an individual and will have an impact for an undefinable time. </p>

On the other hand, as this case shows, significant financial and emotional burdens are likely to be placed on the individuals involved in a given case if they have to initiate a further application.  In my view, the balance of those burdens, coupled with the prospects of an agreed solution being reached, also favours the normal duration of a reporting restrictions order being until further order as in the Transparency Pilot.  If a member or representative of the media seek a change that permits wider or unlimited reporting they have a limited pool of people who they can seek consent from, whereas the parties cannot practically obtain consent to a continued or tighter order.</p>

An alternative would be to provide that it lasts until judgment on the substantive issues.  On both alternatives, and in any event, it seems to me that the terms, including the duration of the injunction, should be revisited at the substantive hearing or when judgment is given because it is only then that it will be known what (a) the nature and extent of the COP&#8217;s invasion into the private and family life of P, P&#8217;s family and others has been, (b) the relevant issues and decisions are and (c) the impact of any reporting restrictions on the competing Article 8 and Article 10 rights are likely to be in that case.</p>

In order to engage the interest of members of the public in the kinds of issues the court decides, it is however necessary to publish articles and reports that people actually want to read. That means telling our readers about the facts of the cases, including the real people and places involved, and sometimes publishing pictures that relate to these people and places.</span></p>

It is human nature to find it more difficult to take an interest in a story about problems arising from, say, dementia or the right to die if the story does not feature identifiable individuals. If we cannot publish stories about important issues that people are drawn to read, this will inevitably limit and reduce the quality of public debate around these issues. It is in my view important in a democratic society that we should encourage informed debate I believe that the media, including the popular press, fulfils a vital function in this regard. By reading about the experiences of others, readers are likely to be able to identify with those people and understand what they are going through. But they are much less engaged - and correspondingly less focused on the surrounding public debate - where they cannot identify with real people, places and events. Pictures are a hugely potent way of engaging readers and one of the problems with covering anonymised cases is that it is impossible to include pictures in our stories which identify those involved.</span></p>

However, in this case, the inquest to be held is into the killing of a child, L, in the situation where a High Court Judge has already found as a matter of fact that the mother was responsible for L's death and the application is made because harm is indirectly apprehended to a child who is a stranger to the investigative process. It is presently uncertain whether criminal proceedings will in fact be taken against the mother. If so, and the Coroner is so informed, then no doubt he will further adjourn the matter pursuant to s.16. of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/13" uk:canonical="1988 c. 13" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Coroners Act 1988</ref></span><span style="font-size:10pt">.

It is however clear from what I have been told that counsel for the Applicant had thought about the notice point and concluded that it was appropriate to make a without notice application. He tried to do so to the applications court; but was turned away and so had to pursue an out of hours application given the urgency and the nature and extent of the media interest.  So, although Theis J disagreed with him, I consider that counsel for the Applicant acted properly and I add that in my view some of his reasons for acting as he did and which he acknowledges he could have explained them better to Theis J were properly arguable.</p>

So, with the benefit of hindsight, the media Respondents should be relieved that they failed to persuade both Theis J and me to refuse the application with the result that they were free to publish and did publish articles in terms that they now accept would not have accorded with the correct balance between the competing Convention rights.</p>

My experience is that the media (apart from the Press Association) rarely attend such hearings and I am not aware of a case where the order has been objected to on such a hearing.  Indeed, although the existing precedent of a PD 13A Reporting Restrictions Order is not used rigidly its general overall effect is accepted as a standard or default position that is based on established and solid legal foundations (i.e. the COP Rules and the <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott </span>exceptions).</p>

Urgency, particularly if substantive relief is sought on the first or an early directions hearing may require notice of that hearing but equally may provide the &#8220;compelling reason&#8221; why notice was not given.  Different issues arise when, as in this case, an application is made after judgment and the expiry of the original reporting restrictions order.</p>
