Further, in the event that I did not detect him experiencing difficulty during the hearing, and he was also unable to communicate that difficulty to me, we agreed that he would alert me to the difficulty he was having by placing an object from his bag onto the table in front of him.</span></p>

I recognise that prohibiting him from cross-examining the mother impedes his ability to put his case.  During the hearing there have been many long and extended breaks whilst I have been required to deal with urgent matters that were put into my list. Those breaks have lasted, at times, for hours.  The father, helpfully, came with a bundle of the papers and, at the earliest opportunity when the case was called on, I set out to him what the format of the hearing would be and that it would assist the Court if he prepared a list of questions that he would want to ask of the witnesses during the hearing.  To his credit, he did that and, if I may say so, respectfully, he did that effectively. During the hearing he was not able to cross-examine the mother because of my direction, and therefore I asked questions of the mother that were prepared by the father.  It was apparent also that the father would be assisted by me asking questions of the social worker on his behalf given the difficulties I have identified and I did that.</span></p>

I have considered a letter prepared by him dated 22&#160;November&#160;2022 and an email of 25 January 2023.  CB has been involved in the father&#8217;s treatment since January 2009.  It is described that the father experienced a &#8220;very severe traumatic brain injury in an assault [in] 2008&#8221;.

These are particularly partially related to damage to the frontal lobes of his brain causing him some problems with executive function.  This means that he struggles to deal with unforeseen eventualities or to quickly and dynamically problem solve under such circumstances.  He can also be somewhat rigid in his thinking and behaviours.  He is prone to a considerable degree of fatigability if he does not plan and pace his activities carefully and, as he begins to fatigue, he can become somewhat inattentive.  He finds having to multi-task particularly challenging, not only because of his dysexecutive issues, but also because of how this quickly fatigues him.  Whilst he recognises the need for some assistance in his day-to-day management of his everyday affairs and is in receipt of funding for a personal assistant in this regard, he can somewhat overestimate his abilities at times.  However, in general, he is capable of supported independent living as detailed above and has long ago been found fit to drive by the DVLA.  Although his decision making is mostly sound under predictable circumstances, it can be less so in unpredictable ones, particularly if he is fatigued or emotionally upset in some way.  At such times he can act out impulsively in ways that are usually characteristically of him and he can loudly vent his anger with little recognition of the impact this could have on people around him.&#8221;.  </span></p>

However, I believe it would be in his and the children&#8217;s best interests for this to resume as soon as possible in a controlled environment where his ability to parent his children can be monitored by experienced childcare staff who can offer him direction or intervention if he begins to struggle in any way.  If he is to have any contact outside of such an environment, then I would recommend that this initially be only with him being in the company of another adult approved by the Court.  Whilst I hope in the long term he will prove himself capable of having his children under his sole care back in his own home or outside in the community, I feel this needs to be subject to assessment and support from statutory services to give the best chance of this happening safely for both him and his children.&#8221;.  </span></p>

First, the mother is concerned that the father drew a heart with an arrow through it in a previous letter. I have to say that was not something that I thought especially troubling.  Secondly, the mother is concerned that the father places an uneven emphasis between the two girls.  She considers that the children may well detect that the father has warmer words to express to one of them than the other; for example, the use of the words, &#8220;You are daddy&#8217;s world&#8221;, to one of the children and not the other.  </span></p>

I doubt these children, given their ages, fully appreciate the consequences to their long-term welfare of not having a direct or meaningful relationship with the father.  There is no doubt in my mind that the children lack the maturity to weigh in the balance the positive and negative features of having a meaningful direct relationship with the father.  Thus, whilst the children&#8217;s wishes are an important part of the evaluation of their welfare, they are very far from being determinative in this case.</span></p>

They are accessing counselling, which is likely to help them process the experiences they have had in their short lives.  They have a need for a relationship with each of their parents for a number of reasons, not least because that will help them understand their own identity but, where it can take place safely, it will help them have safe and meaningful relationships themselves once they are adults.  </span></p>

The mother is likely herself to feel safe and feel that the children are safe.  She will be relieved of the unacceptable emotional strain I find she would suffer at this time in facilitating the contact.  It is likely, in my judgment, at this time, the mother facilitating the contact would be so burdensome on her that she would seriously struggle to cope with meeting the children&#8217;s emotional needs that would follow from their experience of that contact.

It will severely limit their sense and understanding of their paternal identity.  There is no obvious or apparent other significant connection that they have to their father.  I accept that limiting direct contact makes the resumption of direct contact challenging because it builds up an unknown and potentially a fear about resuming what has not been tried.  Such an order would be very draconian.  It would be a serious severance, at least in the short to medium term, of the relationship between the children and their father.  It may cause the children to have challenges themselves in having meaningful relationships as adults and when they are parents themselves if they do not have meaningful relationships with their own parents.</span></p>

The children will be unlikely to feel safe physically and emotionally because the father cannot meet their needs.  The children are likely to regress in their progress emotionally and academically, and it may well make it harder for the children to have a relationship with the father in the long term if they are, as I find, not psychologically ready.  If commencing that contact now or in the near future is very negative for the children, that may have been the last best opportunity to resume the relationship, and if it is negative or fails, there may not be another good opportunity that can be tried again for the foreseeable future.</span></p>

For his part, I do not consider the father to have lied to me in the witness box.  I think he is probably an honest witness, but I judge he is not a reliable witness.  I consider his recollections are poor and he is an inadequate historian when it comes to past events.  It is likely that his recollection of the facts is heavily affected by his injury.  Thus, where there is a conflict in the evidence of the mother and the father, I prefer the evidence of the mother.  I accept her evidence and her version of events that there was a significantly traumatic episode that led to the end of the relationship that involved beating, hitting, grabbing of GK and pulling at the mother&#8217;s clothing.  It would have been extremely distressing for those who experienced that incident by witnessing it and being a part of it.  Not only will the impacts have been immediate in nature, but it is likely that the incident was so severe that it will have caused long-term harm to those involved.  For his part, the father concedes the incident will have been traumatic.</span></p>

I come to that conclusion with absolute confidence having listened to his video and heard how he spoke to his children.  He clearly does love them very much.  Despite all that however, I am driven to conclude that it is not in the children&#8217;s best interests at this time for direct contact to take place.  It would be traumatic and significantly harmful.  The children would regress.  To start direct contact now would do more long-term harm than it would do good.  </span></p>

It is not lost on me in the slightest bit that to prevent children having a direct relationship with either of their parents is a most severe remedy, arguably the most severe and draconian remedy a Court can order in private law proceedings of this kind.  I have regretfully however come to the conclusion that such an order is necessary and required in the overriding interests of the children.  Only indirect contact would be in their best interests at this time, but I hope in the fullness of time the children&#8217;s emotional and psychological health is such that they can process their experience and come to a place where they are more resilient and have the capacity to safely have a direct relationship with their father.</span></p>

It is one that is consistent with the arrangements for GK.</span></p>
