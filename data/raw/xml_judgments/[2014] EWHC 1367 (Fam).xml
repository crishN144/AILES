	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2012, an eleven-week-old baby girl died in hospital in Bristol. Post mortem investigation found that she was suffering from a number of injuries usually associated with non-accidental trauma. But in addition, the baby, hereafter referred to as S, suffered from a number of conditions, all linked to a unique combination of genetic abnormalities. The team of pathologists who performed that investigation were uncertain as to her cause of death. No criminal proceedings were instigated. </p>

The local authority started care proceedings, relying on the circumstances of S&#8217;s death. A was removed from the family and placed in foster care. The case was transferred to the High Court and listed before me for a fact-finding hearing into the circumstances of S&#8217;s injuries and death. This reserved judgment is delivered at the conclusion of that hearing. </p>

Ten years ago, he came to this country on a student visa, but lost his sponsorship and thereafter remained in this country unlawfully. In 2004, he started a relationship with another woman.

In fact, as he told me, he has worked steadily for several years, using an alias. He has applied for permanent leave to remain in this country. In his first statement in these proceedings, the father said that the application was originally based on his relationship with the mother and his having a child, S. He added that now the fact that he is the father of A will be a relevant factor. He hopes to be able to stay in this country and provide care for his son. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother and father met in 2009 in a night club. They started living together after about a year. The relationship seems to have been fairly volatile. The father says that the mother has a short fuse and has broken things in the property in temper. The mother says that the father was controlling and has become angry with her on occasions, and called her abusive names. On one occasion he raised his hand to her although he did not hit her. The father denies being controlling. He says that the mother was under the control of her own mother. The father accuses the mother of drinking excessively. He is a Muslim and claims that he does not drink, but the mother says he does and produced a photograph at the hearing which showed the father holding a champagne glass. He claimed that the liquid inside the glass was non-alcoholic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2011, the mother became pregnant. On 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2012, S was born by emergency caesarean section about 3 weeks premature. In the late stages of the pregnancy, there had been concerns about the baby&#8217;s low growth rate. At birth, she was very small, weighing only 1680 grams, well below the 0.4 centile, and had a very small head circumference. It was immediately noticed that she had a number of significant abnormalities, including dysmorphic features, a heart murmur and she had difficulty feeding. In her early days she suffered repeated episodes of respiratory distress and she was also found to have a congenital heart disease. Genetic studies revealed that she had a unique combination of genetic abnormalities. There is no known record of any previous patient born with this combination. I consider this important aspect of the case in greater detail below. The advice of geneticists and clinicians was that S would suffer a multitude of problems and that her life expectancy would be extremely limited. Sadly, that prediction proved all too accurate.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her first weeks, she stayed in hospital, moving between a normal ward, high dependency unit and a neonatal intensive care unit as her condition fluctuated. She had repeated episodes of oxygen de-saturations, respiratory distress, apnoea and seizures. One significant episode took place on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March. Curiously, there is no full contemporaneous medical record of what happened on this occasion, only a retrospective summarising note. It is clear that doctors were summoned urgently to attend to her in a state of collapse, but the details of the treatment given on this occasion are unknown. It is at least theoretically possible that she was given cardiac pulmonary resuscitation during this episode. That possibility cannot be ruled out, although routine practice would normally require that a note that CPR was administered should be kept on the medical records. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is the clear and unanimous view of medical staff that, throughout her stay in hospital, S received loving care and attention from her parents. There is not a hint of any criticism of either parent, despite the obvious strain and distress they experienced as it became clear that their beloved daughter had insurmountable problems and did not have long to live. They were trained in techniques needed to care for her. S was only able to take feed via a nasogastric tube which required two people to fit. This was difficult, but the mother said in evidence that she was able to feed her without difficulty and felt confident managing this. The parents were also trained in what to do if S collapsed and needed resuscitation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding the fact that, as one expert said in the course of the hearing, S was not really fit for discharge, the hospital staff agreed that her parents could take her home so that they could spend some time with her as a family. Thus, she was discharged home on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, aged 9 weeks. Thereafter, the community neonatal nursing team visited daily for the first week. Most of the care of S at home was provided by her mother, supported during the day by her own mother and, when he returned home in the evenings, by the father. The maternal grandmother visited nearly every day, and stayed all day until she went to work. The mother was responsible for measuring and making up the feeds and placing the feed in a syringe which was fitted to the nasogastric tube. She gave most of the feeds, and, although the father used to help with the feeds at night, the mother was always awake when this happened. The father recalled one occasion when S had appeared to stop breathing but had revived when the mother rubbed her stomach. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After S was discharged from hospital, her parents were advised not to take her out for the first week or so. On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April, however, she was taken to an appointment with the community paediatrician, Dr Bradley. This involved a bus journey for the mother and grandmother across Bristol. Later in the week, the mother and maternal grandmother took S for a hearing test. On two other occasions, the mother was taken out by a friend and S was left in the care of the grandmother.</p>

On her return, there was an argument because the father thought she had been drinking. The mother denied it and rang the grandmother who backed up her story. The father did not believe them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, S was looked after as usual by the mother with assistance from the grandmother. Their evidence is that the grandmother left at about 5.30 pm that afternoon, and thereafter the mother looked after S by herself until the father returned home some time after 10 pm, having gone from work to the gym and then to watch a football match in a pub. There is some dispute between the parents as to exactly what occurred after he returned, and I consider their respective accounts in more detail below. What is agreed is that, at some point after 10.30 pm, S collapsed . The father tried to revive her using techniques learnt at hospital but when this proved unsuccessful the mother telephoned for emergency services and an ambulance arrived at 10.48 pm. On arrival, the paramedics found S asystolic with her pupils fixed and unresponsive. She was taken to the Bristol Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital but all attempts to revive her were unsuccessful and she died at 11.30 pm that evening. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A routine sudden death report was prepared by Dr Gainsborough, a community paediatrician. During the preparation of the report, the parents were spoken to both at hospital and at home. A skeletal survey revealed no evidence of bony injuries. A post mortem examination was instigated by a paediatric pathologist, Dr Platt, who detected scalp bruising, bilateral subdural haemorrhages and rib abnormalities. As a result, he suspended his examination and contacted a forensic pathologist, Dr Amanda Jeffrey, and with the coroner&#8217;s authority a full forensic examination was undertaken. This involved not only a microscopic examination but also the taking of samples for expert analysis by a range of other experts. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The examination by Dr Platt and Dr Jeffrey confirmed the presence of a scalp swelling. The intracranial bleeding seen by Dr Platt was no longer present at the time of this further examination. Measurement of the major organs was undertaken and revealed that S&#8217;s brain was significantly below normal weight. Neuropathological examination confirmed the presence of intracranial haemorrhages, plus other signs supportive of trauma notably axonal disruption, but also the presence of significant brain malformations. Although radiology had not detected any bony injuries, histopathological examination of the ribcage revealed no fewer than forty fractures of the ribs, both anterior and posterior, of several different ages, some dating back to the time when S was in hospital. An ophthalmic pathological examination revealed the presence of bilateral retinal haemorrhages and fresh haemorrhage around both optic nerves. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Based on the information available to us, we are of the opinion that there are some very concerning features in this case which raise the suspicion of a mechanical head injury with evidence of a previous episode of hitherto unexplained rib fracturing, albeit the latter having occurred during hospitalisation. However, the background medical history of this child is extremely complex. S suffered a number of episodes of apnoea and desaturation during her time in hospital and, whilst these required less intervention as time progressed, it would appear that these continued in the days leading up to her discharge from hospital. It is therefore very difficult to determine the exact causation of the death with any degree of certainty. We therefore believe that the cause of death should be considered unascertained.&#8221;</p>

Mental handicap is universal and very severe. Feeding difficulties occur in 75% of cases and seizures occur in up to 90% by the third year of life. Brain imaging is abnormal in many patients.

Professor Patton advised that there is less medical literature as to partial trisomy 18 but identified features include low birth rate, dysmorphic facial features, congenital heart defects and brain malformation, all of which were present in S&#8217;s case. Professor Patton advised that it is difficult to obtain figures on life expectancy as partial trisomy 18 is relatively rare and each case will differ to some extent on the degree of chromosome imbalance. With full trisomy 18, most children will die within the first month of life and 98% will die by the age of one. The cause of death may be apnoeic episodes when breathing stops.</p>

He therefore concluded that S had sustained fractures which almost certainly occurred whilst she was in hospital. He noted that she required chest stimulation and that this may have involved CPR. He saw nothing in the evidence to suggest that either parent had inflicted injury while the child was out of hospital or that the fractures themselves contributed to the child&#8217;s death.

Some of the fractures were only visible microscopically, others visible to the naked eye. Dr James concludes that the overall picture of multiple rib fractures was complex.

Professor Freemont suggested that this might be explained by the fact that much of the repair of the fractures consisted of cartilage with only a small amount of bone, so that the amount of calcium would have been very small and therefore might have been missed radiologically. The contrast between the results of radiology and histopathology were stark. Dr James said that he had never come across a case in which there had been so great a disparity between the radiological and pathological findings.

He thought, intuitively, that a smaller fracture could be caused by a lesser degree of force. Again, the problem was the lack of comparative data. Examinations such as this were rare and it was impossible to build up evidence as to how many occult fractures exist generally.

In particular, the fact that one set of fractures occurred whilst she was in hospital required careful consideration. Either she suffered an unwitnessed squeezing episode whilst there, or she had an increased propensity to fractures which can not be explained medically. It was possible that her underlying diagnosis made her more susceptible to fractures although such an increased propensity has not been reported by other experts, or in the literature. In oral evidence, cross-examined by Mr Tolson QC for the father, Dr Robinson described that for a traumatic event to have occurred in hospital, in particular when she was on a high dependency unit or intensive care unit, would be possible but very unusual. On balance, he thought it unlikely that she could have been injured non-accidentally in hospital, given the level of observation. This led him to consider that S had a poorly understood condition that led to an increased propensity for rib fractures. In oral evidence, Dr Robinson reiterated the need to keep an open mind in respect of the rib fractures, because S&#8217;s condition is poorly understood. </p>

Dr Jacques observed that a number of natural disorders have been described that may mimic components of the triad although he had not identified in the literature any link between the type of genetic syndrome seen in S and subdural haemorrhage. He added, however, &#8220;despite these observations, the genetic abnormality in this child is complex and I would remain concerned that underlying disorder may have predisposed a haemorrhage&#8221;. As for the axonal injury, he describes this as sparse but in places in a distribution that would be in keeping with trauma.

He also observed that the appearances of the extradural haemorrhage in the spinal cord were consistent with both an old haemorrhage of a few to several days duration and more recent haemorrhage of less than 48 hours duration. He added, however, that the possibility of trauma had to be carefully correlated with the clinical history. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.49in">In this case, given S&#8217;s complex medical and genetic history, Mr Richards advised that the first and second possible explanations were worthy of some consideration. He noted that S had suffered a number of collapses whilst in hospital but added that these were of an order of magnitude significantly less than her final collapse so that it was therefore unlikely that the fatal event was the result of the same pathology. Given the fact that she had a number of microscopic structural abnormalities within the brain and her brain was not growing normally, the possibility of an unknown fragility as the cause of her neurological symptoms could not be excluded. Mr Richards raised the possibility that, in the panic following her collapse, S may have been shaken excessively as part of a resuscitation process, or that she had been put forcibly onto the floor without adequate support in a panic. He observed that the degree of force required to cause such injuries had not been scientifically measured, although clinical medicine indicated that it requires forces greater than those encountered in every day life or rough play. Cross-examined by Mr Ekaney QC on behalf of the mother, Mr Richards agreed that the subdural haemorrhages in this case were thin film and low volume. He accepted that a number of factors associated with a greater degree of force in non-accidental head injury were not present in this case &#8211; factors such as tears, intra ventricular haemorrhages, mid-line shifts, global hypoxic ischaemic damage or damage to the nerve and root ends of the spine. He agreed that, as S was an extremely small baby, below the 0.4 centile, common sense suggested that less force would be required to cause the  neurological injuries seen in this case. He agreed with Miss Wills-Goldingham QC on behalf of the grandmother that S was a very frail baby. He agreed with Mr Tolson that in this case a force not very much out of the ordinary could have caused these injuries. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All three of the experts who gave evidence about the neurological condition of this baby stressed the need for caution. Mr Richards, like all the experts, had never encountered this particular combination of genetic abnormalities. He observed that there were significant abnormalities in S&#8217;s brain, a number which predisposed her to seizures. In addition, her brain was not growing. He described it as a very small brain. According to the measurements taken at post-mortem by Dr Jeffrey, S&#8217;s brain was 50 grams less than the normal reference weight, some 10% lighter than the normal bracket. Something was wrong, said Mr Richards, with the way S&#8217;s brain was developing. It was not put together properly. A brain that was not growing was an indication of something that was seriously wrong. All this led Mr Richards in cross examination by Miss Wills-Goldingham to observe that &#8220;we can&#8217;t comment on the unknown. We have lots of children with brain abnormalities who don&#8217;t die of apparent head injuries, but I can&#8217;t exclude the possibility.&#8221;</p>

There were features of head injury but there were many things in S&#8217;s brain that led him to think that &#8220;we may have something not right.&#8221; This led him to be more cautious about concluding that trauma was the cause. </p>

S&#8217;s genetic diagnosis was not known to be associated with either subdural haemorrhage or retinal haemorrhage. Dr Robinson added, however, that it may have made her more susceptible to injury from a lesser force and as a result, &#8220;caution is required&#8221;.</p>

Dr McCarthy found no evidence of any older haemorrhage. The presence of haemorrhage in the optic nerves suggested a traumatic cause, either impact trauma or movement trauma. He noted the presence of a fresh scalp bruise as further evidence of impact trauma.

In answer to a question from Mr Ekaney about the degree of force required to cause these haemorrhages, Dr McCarthy said that he had been saying &#8220;for an awfully long time&#8221; that the degree of force required is less than previously thought, both for impact and movement trauma.</p>

Microscopic examination of the bruise showed some iron staining which raises the possibility that this occurred a few days prior to death. It is known that scalp electrodes were used in the process of cerebral function monitoring whilst in hospital but this was over a month prior to her death. We are not aware of any other medical explanation for the scalp bruise. Whilst the bruise appears relatively recent and more in keeping with having occurred after discharge from hospital, it is well recognised that the dating of bruises is not an exact science.&#8221;</p>

Dr Robinson, however, expressed a different opinion. In his report, he observed that most bruises disappear within 10-14 days. Superficial bruises resolve within 1- 3 days, and larger or deeper bruises may take 10-14 days to resolve fully. Fourteen days is the outside limit for resolution of a bruise and/or haematoma. He thought it unlikely that scalp electrodes used in hospital a month earlier would have caused the bruising and swelling seen on S&#8217;s scalp. In oral evidence, Dr Robinson said that it would be very unusual to see a scalp injury persisting for longer than 14 days, and certainly not for five weeks. For Dr Robinson, the scalp injury was of particular significance. He said in answer to Mr Ekaney: &#8220;You can&#8217;t back away from the lesion over the scalp.&#8221;</p>

However, there was equally a degree of consensus amongst the doctors that this case needed to be approached with caution because of S&#8217;s unique clinical picture. I have already cited a number of instances in which the experts made observations along these lines. In addition, Dr Robinson observed that the fact that extensive pathological investigations had shown no medical cause for S&#8217;s post mortem findings should be interpreted subject to the proviso that her underlying genetic diagnosis is poorly understood. Furthermore, Dr Jeffrey said that this was by far the most complex case that she had dealt with during her career to date. She described S&#8217;s genetic abnormalities as a &#8220;freak combination&#8221;. She agreed with Miss Wills-Goldingham that the case was &#8220;a conundrum&#8221;. </p>

On the other hand, one must always bear in mind the possibility of the unknown cause and in this case that possibility is greater because of S&#8217;s extraordinary and unique genetic abnormalities, her brain malformation and her very small size. For this court, accustomed as I am to hearing eminent doctors give expert opinion in cases of suspected non-accidental injury, the degree of caution expressed by the experts in this case is striking. Taken by itself, the medical evidence left me distinctly uneasy as to the local authority&#8217;s submission that this court should find that S had sustained her injuries non-accidentally. </p>

When he got back, the mother wanted to go out for a cigarette but before she did so the father said he wanted to have a shower and change his clothes. After he had done so, the mother had her cigarette. The flat is on the first floor and the mother therefore went downstairs and stood outside the front door to smoke. When she came back after about five minutes, she went to the bathroom, washed her hands, cleaned her teeth and went into the kitchen to prepare S&#8217;s 11pm feed. At that stage S was asleep but the father said he wanted to cuddle her. The mother protested but the father picked her up anyway to give her a cuddle. (In oral evidence, the mother said that she had got this wrong in her statement. This incident had occurred earlier when the father arrived home.) The mother had her back turned to the father and S but then heard him say that there was something wrong with her. She turned and noticed S&#8217;s head resting on the top of his arm. He had his hand on S&#8217;s belly rubbing it gently as they were advised. She did not respond, instead her skin colour turned grey and then she went floppy in his arms. The father placed her on the floor on her back and began to resuscitate her using the techniques they had been shown in hospital. S took one breath but did not repeat it. The father carried on trying to resuscitate her for about five minutes. Meanwhile, the mother phoned for an ambulance which arrived after about five or six minutes.  After the paramedics had tried unsuccessfully to revive her, S was taken to hospital in an ambulance. The father went in the ambulance with S while the mother collected things and then waited for her own mother on the street corner. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These inconsistencies were put to the parents in oral evidence. They were unable to account for them. Of course, I bear in mind that they were in a state of extreme distress and shock when they spoke to the doctors. I also take into account that the doctors&#8217; notes have been challenged, and that, in the case of the third conversation, there are some differences between Dr. Gainsborough&#8217;s note and that taken by DS Curnock. Furthermore, as DS Curnock acknowledged, this was a conversation, not an interview. Nonetheless, the inconsistencies are matters to be taken into account. Mr Fuller on behalf of the local authority invites the court to consider which is the true account and whether the discrepancies matter. </p>

She says that in about 2011 the father acquired a false marriage certificate from Gambia and pressurised the mother into signing it. The father says that a marriage ceremony took place in Gambia, but that, as is (according to the father) customary in that country, the mother was not required to be present. The mother says that, so far as she is aware, the father is still married to the woman he married some years earlier. </p>

It is the father&#8217;s evidence that he was working throughout S&#8217;s life, as he had done for some years previously, in a warehouse run by a windscreen company. As he does not have permission to stay in this country, he is not supposed to work, so he has assumed an alias. The mother&#8217;s evidence is that he lost his job after S was born because he was spending so much time away from work. She accepts that, after S came home, he spent most days out of the house, but she did not know that he was working. The father stuck to his account that he was working, that the mother knew that this was the case because he used to leave home wearing a uniform. </p>

It is the mother&#8217;s case, supported by the grandmother, that she did not go out of the home at all that day. The father asserts, however, that she told him that she had been to the shops, giving an account of how S had been unhappy in the pushchair, and that this account was supported in the father&#8217;s mind by the sight of shopping bags in the kitchen when he arrived home. The mother accepts that the bags were there but says that they had been brought in by the grandmother, who in turn corroborates her daughter&#8217;s account. </p>

The mother and grandmother say that it was their habit to make up a little bed on the changing mat and place S on it on the floor of the living room, sometimes in a position where she could see the light of the television. They say that this was more comfortable than her babychair which was too big for her. The father says that he had never seen her on the mat before he arrived home that evening.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">(6) What was the noise made by S on the evening of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April? The father says that, on arriving home that evening, he noticed S making an unusual noise which he had not heard before. When he mentioned it to the mother, she said that she had been making it all day. The mother denies this account. She says that S did not make any unusual noise that evening, The noise she did make was a grunting sound, which she had made previously and which the parents had been told related to her respiratory difficulties. As recorded above, during their conversations with Dr. Gainsborough in the day or so after her death, the parents are said to have given a different version about the noise made by S shortly before her collapse. Mr Fuller asks whether the father is lying about hearing a new noise that evening to cover up something he has done, or to protect himself from being wrongly accused. Alternatively, Mr Fuller suggests that, if the father is telling the truth, the mother may be lying to hide something that had happened earlier that day. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">(7) Finally, it is important to consider the gradual emergence of the father&#8217;s case in the period leading up to this hearing. Initially, he and the mother were united in their response to what had happened. In the police investigation, the father made no allegations or insinuations about the mother. Over time, however, and in particular in the Summer of 2013, the father has raised suspicions about the mother&#8217;s conduct. He has pointed to things which he says are untrue in her account of the events of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April &#8211; notably, what he says is her lie about not having gone out during the day &#8211; and which, he says, lead him to have suspicions. The case advanced by Mr Tolson on his behalf was not to accuse the mother of having killed S but rather to raise concerns and, in particular, to demonstrate that the injuries must have been sustained by S before the father arrived home that evening. A substantial proportion of the questions put by Mr. Tolson were directed to this latter issue. In the course of his cross-examination by Mr Ekaney, however, the father finally said that he thought it likely that the injuries were non-accidental and it was likely that the mother or grandmother was responsible. Later, he retreated from this position again, saying that he merely had suspicions. On the other hand, in the course of his cross-examination by Mr Ekaney, he accepted that the mother was nice, caring, hardworking, trustworthy, loving and kind, and that she was a good mother. I was left uncertain about exactly what the father was saying, and why he was saying it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Looking at the parents&#8217; evidence overall, I make the following observatrions and findings. First, I found the mother to be fundamentally truthful. Her evidence was sometimes vague and confusing. At times, I doubted whether what she was saying was entirely accurate. But that is, I find, because she is not of a reflective disposition. She is, as Mr Ekaney put it, a relatively simple and unsophisticated person. I believe and find that on the key issues in the case, including the important aspects of the events of 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, she was telling me the truth. Above all, I found her evidence about her feelings for her daughter to be compelling and moving.  She said: &#8220;I could never harm any child, let alone my own child. She meant the world to me.&#8221; Later she said: &#8220;when they told me that I was going to lose her, it didn&#8217;t make any difference. She was still my daughter. She still needed to be cuddled and loved.&#8221; She did not think that the father had harmed S, and wanted him to play &#8220;the best part he can in A&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

He is a much more sophisticated and, I suspect, intelligent person than the mother. He too spoke movingly of his feelings for his daughter. But his arrogant and condescending manner was concerning, and I find that he was, as the mother describes, very controlling of her. I find that he has acted deceitfully in the course of his employment, and I also find that he has lied about his marriage to the mother. I accept her evidence that he obtained a bogus marriage certificate and pressurised her into signing it. </p>

The father has acted deceitfully about those matters because he wants to stay in this country. I strongly suspect that this has influenced him in other ways in the course of these proceedings, although I make no findings on such speculations.   The question is whether the fact that he has lied about some matters mean that he has lied about the main issue, and of course <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas</span> teaches us that we must not make that leap.  His reason for lying about his immigration and his marriage is to achieve his aim of being allowed to stay in this country. To my mind, it carries little weight in my analysis of the circumstances of S&#8217;s death. </p>

Thus, I accept that she did not go out shopping that day. I find that she had put S down on the changing mat on other occasions. I also find that she did not say to the father that S had been making the noise all day. It follows that the father has not been truthful about those matters and has embellished his account of what happened that evening.  I have considered whether this is material evidence that he was responsible for S&#8217;s collapse. Again, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas </span> is relevant. It is equally possible that he is anxious to pin the blame on the mother to avoid a finding that he was the perpetrator or in the pool of perpetrators. The case advanced on his behalf was largely focussed in that direction. </p>

It is also accepted that (in spite of their differences with regard to other matters) neither the mother nor the maternal grandmother have expressed concerns about the father&#8217;s care of Sophie, nor he about theirs. On behalf of the guardian, Mr. Roberts submits that the evidence is of a family who were all grateful for the arrival of their child, and all of whom loved and cared for her in every way they could, and that the court is entitled to form a view, from the way in which each of the lay witnesses gave evidence and spoke of S and of A, of the love and devotion that they respectively felt towards the children.</p>

It <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">is</span> contended, however, that there is such a level of mistrust and suspicion that both parents must have been under a considerable degree of stress over and above that which must inevitably have been present because of their baby&#8217;s medical condition and extremely negative prognosis.  Mr Fuller submits that this may be a relevant factor when considering whether their evidence and their circumstances in April 2012 are such as to militate against the weight of the medical evidence and push the court towards &#8220;unknown cause.&#8221;</p>

I disagree. Certainly, it is possible that they were inflicted culpably. But the factor of magnetic importance in this case is that S was an extraordinarily vulnerable and fragile child with a combination of genetic disorders previously unknown to medical science, a tiny child with a malformed brain who could have died at any minute. All the doctors couched their opinions in varying degrees of caution. Dr. Jeffrey called the case a conundrum. This is a case in which the unknown cause looms large in the court&#8217;s assessment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">Plainly the injuries did not happen spontaneously. Something must have happened to cause them. But finding as I do that she sustained her first set of multiple rib fractures in hospital, when she was surrounded by medical and nursing staff, I conclude that it is wholly implausible that those fractures were inflicted culpably by one of her parents or for that matter by anyone else. And if that is so of the first set of fractures, there is no reason to think the subsequent fractures were sustained in a different way. Although there was no evidence of bone fragility detected either radiologically or histopathologically, the evidence overall leads me to conclude that she may well have been vulnerable to fracture in ordinary handling because of her insufficiently understood genetic condition. If that is true of the fractures, it may also be true of the intracranial bleeding. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.5in">Ultimately, my decision turns on probabilities and improbabilities. It would normally be thought extremely improbable that a child could sustain injuries of different ages of a type commonly associated with trauma in circumstances that were anything other than non-accidental. In this case, however, that calculation is rendered much more uncertain by her pre-existing medical conditions &#8211; very small size, brain malformation, and unique genetic abnormalities. Furthermore, having seen and heard these parents, I consider it inherently improbable that either of them could inflict injuries on this little baby that each of them adored, let alone systematically on at least four occasions. Although it is not impossible that such a parent could have inflicted injuries in a momentary loss of control, it would in my view be surprising if that is what happened here.  There were stresses within this family, and such stresses may lead to a momentary loss of control. In this case, however, I think it unlikely that this happened on at least four occasions, or at all.  In any event, as I have already indicated, I find the mother and grandmother to be truthful and honest witnesses and I accept their evidence. As for the father, although I do find that he has lied about some matters, I do not consider that those lies lead to any conclusion that he has lied about the circumstances in which S died.</p>
