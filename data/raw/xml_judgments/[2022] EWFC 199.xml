At this hearing, I again heard Mr Marks QC for PrivatBank, who opened the case. Leading counsel for W, Mr Turner QC, and then Charles Howard QC, leading counsel for H, responded. Although PrivatBank had not been joined to the proceedings, nobody took exception to me hearing from Mr Marks QC. There was a hint of a suggestion from Mr Howard QC, that as the bank is not a party, they should have no right to make submissions on the application for the consent order to be made. But having received written and oral submissions from all leading counsel, I propose to have regard to all the matters in the round. </p>

I was also provided with a Form D81 which suggests that the parties&#8217; assets (including assets in respect of which they are discretionary beneficiaries), very substantially in H&#8217;s name, are about &#163;3.8bn, a very significant increase on the figure in the separation agreement. There has been no (or no recent) financial disclosure that I am aware of, and I am in no position to judge the accuracy of the figures as broken down in the D81. In the notes to H&#8217;s assets, it is acknowledged that a large proportion of the assets is held in Ukraine, and it is not possible realistically to value them with any degree of accuracy. </p>

They say that (i) there is no good reason not to make an order reflecting an agreement freely and at arm&#8217;s length agreed between H and W, and (ii) thereafter all matters of enforcement and implementation should be dealt with in the Chancery Division in conjunction with the commercial litigation. The draft consent order is, they say, expressly subject to the WFO, and therefore cannot be implemented unless and until the freezing order is discharged or varied. In other words, they seek a conditional order although it seems to me that to say this is a &#8220;condition&#8221; of the consent order is something of a misnomer as implementation of the proposed consent order, if made by me, would in any event be subject to the WFO by operation of law. It is clear that their intention, if the order is made, would be to apply to Trower J for variation of the WFO so as to permit implementation of the consent order. They submit that it is for Trower J to determine whether or not to vary the WFO, and thereby permit or prevent implementation, and not for me to refuse to make the consent order and thereby prevent implementation. So, they submit, as a matter of principle the application by PrivatBank to stay the making of the consent order must fail.</p>

This is because of the fundamental distinction that an agreement for the compromise of an ancillary relief application does not give rise to a contract enforceable in law. The parties seeking to uphold a concluded agreement for the compromise of such an application cannot sue for specific performance. The only way of rendering the bargain enforceable, whether to ensure that the applicant obtains the agreed transfers and payments or whether to protect the respondent from future claims, is to convert the concluded agreement into an order of the court.

An even more singular feature of the transition from compromise to order in ancillary relief proceedings is that the court does not either automatically or invariably grant the application to give the bargain in the force of an order.

The court then has a duty, in the context of the statute, to consider whether there are other circumstances into which it ought to enquire.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fundamental question in this. Should I, in the exercise of my independent duty, approve the proposed consent order? The answer, I am satisfied, is no. If the bank succeeds against H, he will have a liability in damages of up to $4.2bn which, on the basis of the evidence before me, could wipe out the entirety of his assets. I appreciate that the Form D81 suggests there might be a surplus but in the absence of corroborative documentation, I do not consider I can so find, especially as H himself acknowledges the limitations of valuations in the current economic, political, and military climate in Ukraine. That would, or could, place H in a position of inability to meet his obligations to W, both in terms of quantum and structure. It might, however theoretically, extinguish all but the &#163;100m due to be paid to W leaving him with nil assets. It would be illogical and, in my judgment, wrong to approve an order which might subsequently be shown to be incapable of compliance, and potentially unfair to either or both parties. It would be illogical and, in my judgment, wrong to approve the consent order until the extent of H&#8217;s potentially massive liability is established. </p>

I accept that in many, perhaps most cases, the risk of a liability or debt flowing from third party litigation does not lead to a stay of the proceedings, particularly when a proposed order is made by consent. That is because the sums are generally of not such significance as to justify delay and can be dealt with by contingent sums, or reverse contingent sums. Parties sometimes take a view; one might be willing to shoulder a greater risk of responsibility for uncertain and uncrystallised liabilities, but will usually seek something in return from the party which is freed from any such responsibility. The difference in this case is the sheer scale of the potential liability which, in my view, renders uncertain and unsafe any assessment of the parties&#8217; net assets and any evaluation of whether the outcome in the proposed consent order is fair.</p>

To do so, they would need to persuade Trower J that it is right and proper to do so. That, it seems to me, would throw on to Trower J a need to consider the financial remedy proceedings, the nature of the order, the available resources, and the circumstances in which the order was made. Inevitably, H and W would rely upon the fact of the consent order (if approved) to seek to persuade Trower J that the WFO should be varied, particularly as it is opposed at this hearing by PrivatBank. At the very least, it would be submitted to Trower J that (i) approval of the consent order (despite PrivatBank&#8217;s opposition) indicates that the financial remedies judge considers it fair and (ii) it is an enforceable order. I do not consider this to be by itself a proper reason for making the consent order. In any event, H and W can apply for variation of the WFO even without a consent order, so as to give effect to the settlement agreement; I make no comment on the likelihood of that succeeding before Trower J.  It seems to me, as PrivatBank submits, that H and W are seeking to put the cart before the horse, deploying a consent order to assist in any WFO litigation, whereas my task is to decide whether it is right to make the consent order in the first place. Nor do I accept that refusing to make a consent order would in some way prioritise the claims of PrivatBank. If PrivatBank is ultimately successful, the courts in Chancery and Family will no doubt need to consider the interrelationship between enforcement of a financial remedies order and a damages award. That is a familiar exercise, but it is unhelpful to speculate now as to how that process would play out. </p>

This case, as between H and W, is proceeding consensually. It is open to H to execute a will so as to make provision for W. That may require expertise in both Ukraine and this jurisdiction to assist H, but I have seen nothing to suggest it cannot be done. The separation agreement itself at clause 10.1 records a covenant by H to make provision for W and the children by will within 6 weeks of the date of the agreement in terms no less generous than those set out in the agreement; it is not even clear (and certainly not expressly stated on behalf of H) that there is no such will in existence, nor, if it has not been done, is there any explanation why not. I am not satisfied that (if it be the case that there is no appropriate testamentary provision in place) H&#8217;s failure to comply with a term of the separation agreement should in itself be a reason for the making of the consent order which in turn reflects the separation agreement. It may also be that, as W and the children are within the class of beneficiaries of various discretionary trusts, the absence of testamentary provision may not be fatal. In any event, I do not consider that this argument outweighs factors pointing against making the order.</p>

Ordinarily the court will compute the assets and then move on to distribution. To undertake that exercise here and now is all but impossible. In my judgment, it would not be fair or appropriate to accede to the application for a consent order to be made. I will not, however, stay the financial remedy proceedings as there may be matters which need to be progressed from time to time pending the outcome of the PrivatBank litigation. Nor will I make an order that no consent order can be made until the conclusion of the PrivatBank proceedings; I will simply refuse the application to make the consent order. It may be that some justification emerges in due course for a consent order to be made, although I cannot immediately anticipate what that might be.

		      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, and for reasons already given, there is clearly an issue between PrivatBank which, because of the scale of the claim, is connected to the matters in dispute in the financial remedy proceedings. However, on the basis of my refusal to approve the consent order, PrivatBank would be content not to remain joined to the proceedings. I propose therefore to join them for the purposes of this order, but henceforth they shall be discharged from the proceedings.</p>
