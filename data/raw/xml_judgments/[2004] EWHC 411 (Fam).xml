That debate is no longer confined to the possibility of further miscarriages of justice in the criminal justice system but extends also to the possibility of similar miscarriages of justice in the family justice system. The debate relates in particular to what is commonly called Munchausen&#8217;s Syndrome by Proxy, a condition first identified and so described by Sir Roy Meadow. Much of the public&#8217;s concern, whether justified or not, has focussed on Sir Roy&#8217;s research work and the expert evidence he has given down the years in many criminal and care cases.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;We have read bundles of reports from numerous experts of great distinction in this field, together with transcripts of their evidence. If we have derived an overwhelming and abiding impression from studying this material, it is that a great deal about death in infancy, and its causes, remains as yet unknown and undiscovered. That impression is confirmed by counsel on both sides. Much work by dedicated men and women is devoted to this problem. No doubt one urgent objective is to reduce to an irreducible minimum the tragic waste of life and consequent life-scarring grief suffered by parents. In the process however much will also be learned about those deaths which are not natural, and are indeed the consequence of harmful parental activity. We cannot avoid the thought that some of the honest views expressed with reasonable confidence in the present case (on both sides of the argument) will have to be revised in years to come, when the fruits of continuing medical research, both here and internationally, become available. What may be unexplained today may be perfectly well understood tomorrow. Until then, any tendency to dogmatise should be met with an answering challenge.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;With unexplained infant deaths, however, as this judgment has demonstrated, in many important respects we are still at the frontiers of knowledge. Necessarily, further research is needed, and fortunately, thanks to the dedication of the medical profession, it is continuing. All this suggests that, for the time being, where a full investigation into two or more sudden unexplained infant deaths in the same family is followed by a serious disagreement between reputable experts about the cause of death, and a body of such expert opinion concludes that natural causes, whether explained or unexplained, cannot be excluded as a reasonable (and not a fanciful) possibility, the prosecution of a parent or parents for murder should not be started, or continued, unless there is additional cogent evidence, extraneous to the expert evidence, &#8230; which tends to support the conclusion that the infant, or where there is more than one death, one of the infants, was deliberately harmed. In cases like the present, if the outcome of the trial depends exclusively or almost exclusively on a serious disagreement between distinguished and reputable experts, it will often be unwise, and therefore unsafe, to proceed.&#8221;</p>

The directions provide that in London all applications will in the first instance be seen by the Senior District Judge, who will then refer all applications as soon as possible to me for directions; that applications on the South East Circuit should be referred to Hogg J; and that in all care centres other than London or the South East, the Family Division judge to whom applications should be referred shall be the Family Division Liaison Judge with responsibility for that Circuit. Those judges are Coleridge J (Western Circuit), Hedley J (Wales and Chester Circuit), Kirkwood J (Midland Circuit), Black J (Northern Circuit) and Bodey J (North Eastern Circuit).

I will therefore write shortly to councils with social services responsibilities to ask them to take the following action. First, I will ask them to consider those cases affected by the Attorney-General&#8217;s review. In these cases, councils should stand ready to act in the light of the outcome of that review.</p>

In those cases councils should consider with their lawyers the implications for those proceedings of the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment in the Cannings case.</p>

In such cases councils should again consider, with their lawyers, whether there are now doubts about the reliability of the expert medical evidence. If that is so, they should &#8211; bearing in mind the child&#8217;s current circumstances and current best interests &#8211; consider whether to apply to the court for the care order to be discharged, or whether to support any application that made be made by the parents or the child. When reviewing cases, councils will also need to take into account any fresh case law judgments from the Appeal Court that may be relevant. </p>

Our best estimate is that it may number no more than the low hundreds, rather than thousands. I am not suggesting that it will be appropriate in every case, following a review, to apply for the discharge of the original care order. The decision must depend entirely on the circumstances of each case. Councils already have a duty to review the cases of children who are the subjects of care orders at least every six months. Given the range of public concerns that have been raised, it would not be right to impose an arbitrary limit on the types of cases that should be reviewed. The key determining factor is that the making of the care order depended exclusively, or almost exclusively, on a dispute between medical experts.</p>

Although that heresy was exploded by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">In re F</span> &#8230; , the belief seems to have lingered on well into the 1980s &#8230; Let it be said clearly, once and for all: the publication of information about a ward, even if the child is known to be a ward, is not, of itself and without more ado, a contempt of court &#8230; At one time, and even after the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">In re F</span>, there was widespread misunderstanding as to the ambit of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> and, in particular, as to the meaning of the critical words &#8220;information relating to proceedings before [the] court sitting in private&#8221;.

Mr Everall counters with <span style="font-style:italic">Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt</span>, 2nd ed (1999), para 8&#8211;79. The authors there submit that the statutory language should be given the wide interpretation of the law of defamation: it should not be confined to information communicated through the media but should extend to private communications to individuals. I do not read a narrower sense in the dictionary definition and would accept that a conversation between the CFR and another individual might amount to publication, but I cannot accept that a CFR publishes, and thereby exposes himself to a risk of contempt, when he reports concerns to the relevant statutory authority charged with the collection and investigation of material suggestive of child abuse. Such a communication between two professionals exchanging information in the course of their respective functions, each acting in furtherance of the protection of children, does not constitute a publication breaching the privacy of contemporaneous Children Act proceedings.&#8221;</p>

It is, of course, no answer that the information provided by the parent is not related to the proceedings, and Mr Everall did not attempt so to argue. The only logical answer to this question, therefore, in my judgment, is that neither is &#8220;publishing&#8221; the information. Each is communicating information to a statutory body charged with responsibility for child protection. That is neither a criminal offence nor a contempt of court.  </p>

Children need to be protected from publicity in the usually understood meaning of that term, where public knowledge of their plight or the activities of their parents in relation to them would be harmful. In my judgment, therefore, giving the word &#8220;publication&#8221; its ordinary meaning is consistent with the framework of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> and does nothing to obstruct the court&#8217;s ability to protect children from harm.&#8221;</p>

Mr Everall&#8217;s argument is historically well rooted and honourably designed to afford the maximum protection for children against unwarranted or unauthorised disclosure of information. The only question is whether the prohibitions which he submits are universal do in fact apply to inter-disciplinary communication between CFRs and child protection social workers. In my judgment, for that to be the case, the statutory language would have to be clear and unambiguous, and the court would need to be driven to the conclusion that no alternative construction of it was permissible.&#8221;</p>

When one asserts that a witness is giving evidence for one party against the other, one is moving from the formal shape of the proceedings towards what, in &#8230; <span style="font-style:italic">Pickering</span> &#8230; , Lord Bridge called &#8216;the substance of the matters which the court has closed its doors to consider&#8217;. The assertion does not reveal the substance of those matters but it cannot be made other than by reference to the stance taken by the witness in relation to them. Put another way, it is the content of his affidavit or statement which determines the assertion.

Professor Alan Craft is the President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. On 2 February 2004 <span style="font-style:italic">The Times </span>published a letter from Professor Craft in which he drew attention to the fact that &#8220;Many medical posts in the field of child protection remain unfilled and paediatricians are, not surprisingly, increasingly reluctant to act as expert witnesses in these complex cases.&#8221; He continued: &#8220;Unless confidence is restored, the present crisis in child-protection work will worsen.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The last few months have seen an unprecedented number of media attacks on paediatricians. Although this has largely been around high-profile court cases, the impact on the whole of child protection has been enormous. The public, and indeed many professionals, are confused. Paediatricians are deeply concerned, both for themselves and for their families. The purpose of this letter is to let you know that we do recognise this as a major issue, and to let you know what we are doing about it.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">That this is causing a major problem is evident from the fact that paediatricians are becoming reluctant to become involved in child protection unless they absolutely have to. A substantial number of designated and named doctor posts are unfilled. Our recent survey of all paediatricians, for which we thank you for the 75+% response rate, has shown us that in the last five years one in ten have had a complaint against them relating to child protection work. Increasing numbers are reported to the GMC by aggrieved parents. Many of our trainees say they don&#8217;t want to do child protection work. In the midst of this the College continues to receive a large number of requests from solicitors to suggest the names of paediatricians who will give second and expert opinions &#8211; something it is becoming increasingly difficult to do as people become more unwilling to undertake this kind of work.&#8221;</p>

As President of the Royal Collage of Paediatrics and Child Health, you are doubtless concerned that such campaigning poses a great risk to maltreated children, has a chilling effect upon paediatricians&#8217; willingness to involve themselves in these cases, and sets back the gains that have been made on behalf of abused and neglected children during the past 40 years.</p>

There are many, but one issue that increasingly inhibits high quality child protection work is the fear of complaints and litigation. No one condones poor clinical practice, but some complaints are malicious and are intended to obstruct social work and police investigations, and some arise from orchestrated campaigns.&#8221;</p>

I am certainly not to be taken as suggesting, or even hinting, that the views espoused by Sir Roy Meadow, or by Dr Y in the present case, could ever properly be described as junk science, or anything remotely approaching it.

He says that there is a significant current public interest in the developing debate in the media particularly about (a) the workings of the family court system, carried on behind closed doors, (b) the reliability of expert witnesses in family cases, in particular the opinions of Sir Roy Meadow and his colleagues, (c) Munchausen&#8217;s Syndrome by Proxy, and (d) false findings of &#8216;guilt&#8217; in child abuse cases. This debate, he says, has been generated recently, and pointedly, by the flawed convictions of women alleged to have killed their children. The mother, he says, wants to enter that debate in the media. She has relevant information to impart. She wishes to disclose at least part of the letter written to her by the social worker, as I understand it, to show the way &#8211; as she would have it the inappropriate, unfair and heavy-handed way &#8211; in which she has been treated by the local authority.  </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority and the guardian assert that any such disclosure will prejudice B. Referring in this context to the letter from the mother&#8217;s Member of Parliament, Mr Howard submits that the mother&#8217;s wish to impart information into the public domain is only to assist in some way in her appeal and possibly to put pressure on the Court of Appeal and/or the lower courts. He says that the mother&#8217;s approach in this way is entirely self-interested and that she is not considering the paramount interests of her child B. Mr Baldock makes a similar point on behalf of B&#8217;s guardian, submitting that the mother&#8217;s openly stated position that she wishes to deal with what she sees as a profound injustice suffered by her and other parents, raises the question as to whether the mother is capable of balancing her desire for publicity against the risks to B. The guardian&#8217;s view, shared by the local authority, is that there should be no relaxation of the restraints which the general law, and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> in particular, impose on the mother. The guardian fears that any relaxation of the usual safeguards would only increase the dangers to B. The guardian, of course, as she says, puts B&#8217;s interests at the forefront of her concerns and submits that they weigh very heavily in this case. Mr Howard puts forward a further reason why, as he would have it, I should refuse the mother permission to disclose any part of the letter into the public domain. Its publication, he says, particularly if accompanied by critical comment from the mother or the media, is likely to imperil any future working relationship between the mother and the author of the letter.</p>

And the balancing exercise is made none the easier because there are also in play, and requiring to be brought into the balance, not merely the interests &#8211; themselves starkly conflicting &#8211; of Dr Y and the media, as represented before me by the BBC, but also the various wider and public interests &#8211; themselves pulling in different directions &#8211; which I referred to in paragraph [93] above.</p>

Mr Cobb, on the other hand, insists that the mother should be able &#8211; if need be, be permitted by the court &#8211; to participate in the public debate now, to participate in the debate, that is, before, during and after the hearing of her appeal by the Court of Appeal and without having to hold back pending delivery of judgment by the Court of Appeal.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not agree with Mr Howard, however, that the identity of the local authority needs to be protected. He says that there is no public interest in naming the local authority. That may or may not be so, but it is, I think, largely beside the point. It is for the local authority to establish a convincing case for an injunction to restrain the media publishing something which is prohibited neither by the general law nor by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref>. It cannot establish such a case merely by demonstrating &#8211; even assuming it can &#8211; that there is no public interest in the identity of the local authority, for that is to put the boot on the wrong foot. His real case is that the local authority&#8217;s identity needs to be protected in order to ensure that B&#8217;s identity is protected. That argument, if it could be justified on the facts, might well weigh heavily in the balance. But in my judgment Mr Howard fails to make good the factual premise. I do not accept his argument that identification of the local authority is likely to lead to the identification of either B or her carers. I do not accept his argument that a combination of the disclosure sought and &#8220;tittle-tattle&#8221; will serve to identify B, certainly not to the world at large or even to her local community. </p>

But that is not of itself, nor is it in the particular circumstances of this case, a sufficient reason to keep the identity of the local authority a secret.

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The position of Dr Y (and indeed of Dr X) is very different. I have referred already to the worrying background material that Mr Moon has produced. He submits that if the court were to agree that doctors in the position in which Dr Y currently finds himself should be named, this would be likely to lead to a further drain on the pool of doctors willing to do child protection work. As he correctly points out, that work, though very important, is voluntary. He voices the fear that doctors may be yet further disinclined to do such work if they see that the evidence they give to the court on the understanding that it is confidential can be the subject of public examination in the kind of circumstances which the mother now asks me to permit. </p>

He also reminds me that Dr Y has available to him legal remedies in respect of defamatory and false publications and points out that reports of proceedings which, like the proceedings before Bracewell J, are not held in public do not attract qualified privilege. There is also the important point that the expectation of confidentiality cannot be absolute. As I said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X </span>at para [24], and I repeat the key passage:</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is here, I think, an especially acute and difficult dilemma. On the one hand there is a powerful public interest, particularly at a time when public concerns are as great as they are at present, in knowing who the experts are whose theories and evidence underpin judicial decisions which are increasingly coming under critical and sceptical scrutiny. On the other hand, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that Sir Roy Meadow has been pilloried and almost demonised in the media. And even whilst I have been preparing this judgment the media have been full of stories about how another expert who has given evidence in Munchausen&#8217;s Syndrome by Proxy cases, Professor David Southall, has been under investigation by the General Medical Council. </p>

My concern is that if Dr Y is to be named in this case, then why not every medical expert in every Munchausen&#8217;s Syndrome by Proxy case where a mother, whether with justification or not, turns to the media with the story that she has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice at the hands of Professor F or Dr G or whoever. Were that to happen then the concerns articulated by Mr Moon would, I very much fear, all too soon become the reality: the already inadequate number of experts willing to assist the courts in vitally important child protection cases might well be even further reduced. In other words, what tips the balance is not so much Dr Y&#8217;s personal interests, real and important as they undoubtedly are, as the important public interest to which Mr Moon has very properly and so compellingly drawn attention.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The balance at this stage comes down, in my judgment, in favour of permitting the mother to make her allegations in public whilst at the same time protecting the identities of Dr X and Dr Y. I emphasise that this is how the balance requires to be struck at this stage. There may come a time when the balance requires to be struck differently. That time may come once the Court of Appeal has given judgment. The judgment of the Court of Appeal may, for all I know, turn out to be inconclusive: it is at least theoretically possible that the Court of Appeal will order a re-trial. But the Court of Appeal might dismiss the mother&#8217;s appeal altogether, or it might allow her appeal and set aside the care order. There is a very wide range of possible outcomes. I am not going to go through them all one by one, for the point I am here considering may well arise for decision on some future occasion. All I would observe here is that, were the mother to be wholly vindicated, and Dr Y&#8217;s evidence totally discredited, the balance might &#8211; I emphasise the word might &#8211; swing in favour of Dr Y being identified; so too the balance might swing in favour of him being identified if the mother was wholly discredited and he was wholly vindicated. In the first case, there might be a powerful public interest in a discredited expert being identified; in the other case, there might be a powerful public interest in the public vindication of an expert who had been unjustifiably and unjustly attacked. I put these as purely hypothetical examples to show that the balance may shift and to show that how it shifts may depend upon the outcome in the Court of Appeal. For the moment, at least, the balancing exercise requires that Dr Y&#8217;s identity (like that of Dr X) is not to be disclosed.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before I leave this part of the case there is one final thing I ought to add. I have not the slightest idea whether the mother&#8217;s complaints have any foundation. Apart from Bracewell J&#8217;s judgment I have seen very little of the material from the care proceedings. I have not, for example, seen any of Dr X&#8217;s or Dr Y&#8217;s reports. It may be that the mother is indeed the victim of a miscarriage of justice. If she is, then she has a powerful argument for saying that she should not be gagged. Indeed, even if she turns out not to be, in the meantime she can still pray in aid Lord Steyn&#8217;s powerful dictum. But it may be, for all I know, that mother is not the victim of any miscarriage of justice and that she is indeed everything that Bracewell J found her to be. In that event there may be a powerful public interest in exposing her for what she is found to be: a woman who falsely cast herself in the role of victim and sought, by use of the media, to persuade the public that she was something which in truth she turns out not to have been. </p>

Those who without justification attack the family justice system can all too easily do so by feeding the media tendentious accounts of proceedings whilst hypocritically sheltering behind the very privacy of the proceedings which, although they affect to condemn, they in fact turn to their own advantage. It is all too easy to attack the system when the system itself prevents anyone correcting the misrepresentations being fed to the media: see <span style="font-style:italic">Harris </span>at para [386]. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I make the point for two reasons. In the first place it suggests that too relentless an enforcement of the privacy of family court proceedings may be counter-productive and that the courts should perhaps in future be more willing than they have been in the past to exercise the disclosure jurisdiction so as to permit matters such as these to be put into the public domain. Secondly, if disclosure is to be permitted, the person seeking disclosure &#8211; here the mother &#8211; may have to be prepared to take the rough with the smooth. The mother is not necessarily entitled to set the media agenda. If she wants to put some parts of the case into the public domain, then she may have to accept that other less appealing parts of the case are also put into the public domain. Hence, in the present case, my reference to Bracewell J&#8217;s unchallenged finding that the mother is a liar and my reference to the intriguing differences between the allegations the mother makes against Dr X and Dr Y in her grounds of appeal to the Court of Appeal and those she makes in her complaint to the General Medical Council. And hence, likewise, my permission to the others involved in these proceedings to put those matters more generally into the public domain if the mother chooses not to.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, the application in the present case for leave to disclose papers to the Minister of State and the Solicitor-General was made at a time when Ministers were still apparently debating whether or not there should be any, and if so what kind, of review. There had been no request for such disclosure, so far as I am aware, from either the Minister of State or the Solicitor-General. In these circumstances the application, insofar as it was put on this basis, was in my judgment inappropriate and premature. If Ministers felt that it was appropriate to see individual case papers before deciding what if any kind of review to set up, then it was, as it seems to me, for Ministers so to indicate and for a Minister, not some individual parent, to make an application to the court. And in this context I should add that I agree with Sumner J&#8217;s comment on 5 February 2004 that it is not for the courts to start inviting people to write to government departments. Matters might, of course, have been quite different if a Ministerial review had been set up of a type which made it appropriate for individual case papers to be submitted. In such circumstances it might have been appropriate for a parent to make the application for permission to disclose. But that was not the position when this application was first mounted on 29 January 2004 nor, in the light of the statement made by the Minister of State on 23 February 2004, is it likely to the position in future, at least not within the near future. </p>

On the contrary, the BBC had made it clear in correspondence, as it was put in a letter dated 11 February 2004, that &#8220;the BBC has no intention of committing breaches of the Children Act or of behaving in a manner likely to constitute a contempt of court&#8221;. It added, in a letter dated 13 February 2004, that &#8220;it is fully intended that the welfare of any children involved in such disputes will be protected by the BBC and its staff.&#8221; Insofar as the BBC had refused to give the local authority the assurances that were being sought, it was perfectly entitled to adopt that stance, and its decision to do so could not, in my judgment, found any complaint or give rise to any justified concern on the part of the local authority. The assurances sought went far beyond anything that the local authority could reasonably have demanded, and in those circumstances the BBC&#8217;s refusal to comply was not something to be held against it. The BBC, in my judgment, could and should have been given notice of the hearing. Moreover, and in the light of that same correspondence, there seemed to me to be no very apparent need for any injunctive relief against the BBC at all.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, the first part of the order sought seemed to me to be fundamentally objectionable. It is wrong in principle to require the media to give prior notice of some proposed publication or broadcast. That is, on the face of it, a wholly unacceptable form of prior restraint. Worse than that, it is, on the face of it, a wholly unacceptable attempt at censorship. That may seem a strong word, but that is in reality what was being attempted here. When I questioned what would happen if I made the order and the BBC then called the local authority&#8217;s bluff by immediately giving notice, the answer was that the local authority would hope to &#8220;negotiate&#8221; with the BBC, it would hope to arrange to view the tape and to obtain a transcript of the interview. Ms Sarah O&#8217;Connor, appearing on that occasion for the local authority, was disarmingly frank, saying words to the effect that the local authority was asking for 14 days&#8217; notice &#8220;in order to give us an opportunity to negotiate&#8221;. The truth is that what the local authority was seeking was the opportunity to approve in advance what the BBC broadcast or, failing agreement, the opportunity to apply to the court for an injunction. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment Mr Howard&#8217;s criticisms of the mother and Ms Sarah Harman as I have recorded them above were entirely justified. The fact is that both of them have disseminated documents containing information within the ambit of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1960 Act</ref> and in circumstances amounting, prima facie, to a whole series of contempts of court. Both the mother and Ms Sarah Harman have displayed a remarkable and disquieting lack of candour with the court. Ms Sarah Harman&#8217;s witness statement of 29 January 2004 was disingenuous to say the least. They misled Sumner J on 5 February 2004 by a mixture of suppressio veri and suggestio falsi. They both filed witness statements (the mother on 16 February 2004 and Ms Sarah Harman on 20 February 2004) asserting, explicitly in the case of the mother and implicitly in the case of Ms Sarah Harman, that they were giving full and candid accounts of what had happened when in fact their accounts were neither full nor candid. Indeed, neither of them made full and frank disclosure of what had been going on until after the hearing before me on 25 February 2004 had concluded. It is neither a pretty nor an edifying picture. </p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is made all the worse in the case of Ms Sarah Harman by the fact that, at a time when it subsequently transpired that she had not in fact made full disclosure, she permitted Leading Counsel on her behalf to file a skeleton argument containing not merely an apology but also an assurance &#8220;that she will disclose without the Court&#8217;s leave no other material for the disclosure of which leave is required&#8221; and then permitted Leading Counsel to offer the court, in her presence, an &#8220;unreserved apology&#8221; for what had happened. Again, the clear impression was being given that full disclosure had taken place when in fact it had not.</p>

	    <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Amongst the relief being sought by the local authority at the ex parte hearing on 17 February 2004 were orders against both the mother and Ms Sarah Harman (a) restraining them, in effect, from doing those things which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> would in any event have prohibited, (b) restraining them from publishing &#8220;any information of whatever nature relating to the legal proceedings herein&#8221; and (c) requiring them to make certain disclosures in relation to what they had been doing. I made an order against the mother in the terms of (a) and a limited order against her in relation to (c), but otherwise adjourned the local authority&#8217;s applications for hearing on 25 February 2004. I refused to make an order in the terms of (b), because that would have gone far beyond the effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> and made it a contempt of court for the mother and Ms Sarah Harman to say anything at all to anybody about the proceedings. Furthermore, I was not persuaded that there was generally any need for urgent ex parte relief in the terms of (c). I made an order in the terms of (a) against the mother, but not Ms Harman, largely because the mother had already indicated in correspondence that she would not object to such an order being made.</p>
