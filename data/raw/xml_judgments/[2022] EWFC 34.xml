In the papers there is a signed form A101A dated 24 June 2020, more than six weeks after Z&#8217;s birth. The signed document is in English and is witnessed by a notary public.

We also appreciate the reasons for this because, under British law, the surrogate is always seen as the legal mother at birth. However, the local position in Uganda, and specifically at our clinic differs from the above. When the surrogate mother consents to providing this service, she is assured of anonymity at all times, including after the birth of the child(ren) she has borne&#8230;I hope you understand the position and appreciate the difficulty if this conflicts with the legal position in the UK.&#8217;</span></p>

All those documents indicate her consent to this court making a parental order. It is not suggested that any further adjournment would facilitate other steps to be taken to contact her. There is nothing to suggest the documents signed by her cannot be relied upon. Therefore having considered all the material that is available to the court, including the background to this particular surrogacy arrangement, the involvement and co-operation by the clinic and the documents the court has I can be satisfied that W does consent to this court making a parental order. </p>

The paper was not published but was quoted by the Hague Conference on Private International Law Preliminary Report of March 2012 on issues arising from international surrogacy arrangements. She sets out that surrogacy is well established in Uganda, there are no laws or guidance regulating surrogacy arrangements in Uganda and that it is usual for surrogates to receive between 6 &#8211; 10 million Ugandan Shillings. Birth certificates are registered in the name of male and female commissioning parents without a judicial/court process. In her updating statement X has provided some additional information about what the payments made in this case equate to, providing information of the minimum wage salary in Uganda as being 663,000 Ugandan shillings (about &#163;140 per month) and the average monthly wage as being 2.6 million Ugandan Shillings (about &#163;550 per month).</p>

In circumstances where the Applicants did not meet W reliance is placed on the information provided by the clinic, supported by the information from Ms Isoto. The clinic have co-operated with the requests and enquiries for extra information and the surrogacy arrangement in this case falls within the financial and other parameters outlined by Ms Isoto. There is no suggestion the Applicants have acted other than in good faith and have not sought to get round the authorities. In the circumstances of this case the court should, in my judgment, authorise any element of the payments that are other than for expenses reasonably incurred.</p>
