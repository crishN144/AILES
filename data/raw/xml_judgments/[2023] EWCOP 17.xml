Beyond the gaunt appearance of the men, there were significant decreases in their strength and stamina, body temperature, heart rate and sex drive. The psychological effects were significant as well. Hunger made the men obsessed with food. They would dream and fantasize about food, read and talk about food and savour the two meals a day they were given. They reported fatigue, irritability, depression and apathy. Interestingly, the men also reported decreases in mental ability, although mental testing of the men did not support this belief.</span>&#8221;</p>

Indeed, the matter will be restored on Thursday 18 May 2023. Ms Sutton KC, representing Beatrice, did not demur on this basis.</span></p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Anorexia nervosa is a mental illness characterised, along with a significantly low body weight due to restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, by a disturbance in the way in which one&#8217;s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation and an intense fear of gaining weight (see DSM 5 diagnostic criteria). As a result, in patients with anorexia nervosa both the prospect of increasing their nutritional intake and the goal of restoring weight, even from a life threateningly low starting point, can cause intense distress. The powerful anorexic cognitions that patients experience, as well as the distress entailed in challenging them, unduly influence decision making in relation to nutritional intake by impairing the ability to use and weigh up information relevant to such decisions. The severe and enduring nature of Beatrice&#8217;s anorexia nervosa, her prolonged history of treatment sabotaging behaviours, her ongoing inability to comply with advice to make even minimal changes to her current nutritional intake and her compulsion to continue self-induced vomiting, despite her distress at this behaviour, provide ample evidence of the strength of the anorexic cognitions that Beatrice experiences and of their effect on her decision making and behaviour. Her description of all possible futures were she to decide not to cease food and fluid intake in the near future as entailing unendurable suffering for her is also firmly tied to the distress which her anorexic cognitions produce when contemplating the prospect of maintaining some nutritional intake and/or receiving treatment for her anorexia nervosa, further underlining the influence of her illness on her ability to use and weigh information relevant to her decision.&#8221;</p>

		  </authorialNote> does not have a description on its face either way. In my opinion, if the order is to bear a description then, given that it is a <span style="font-style:italic">contra mundum </span> injunction with potentially penal consequence, it should describe itself accurately and not misleadingly. It is debatable whether an order which with one hand directs that the hearing and all later hearings shall be in public but then with the other hand imposes strict anonymity, is correctly to be described as an order which gives full transparency. At its highest it gives only partial transparency. It is correctly described as a Reporting Restriction Order and anyone served with it bearing that description will know immediately what the order does.</p>

Given that this case was returning before me in 16 days it was not necessary for there to be lengthy paragraphs spelling out what reporters were allowed to report. A reporting restriction order should be very specific about what cannot be reported, and that should be the end of it, leaving reporters free to report everything and anything that is not specifically prohibited.</span></p>
