On 17 February 2023, Recorder Vickers sitting in the East London Family Court, with the permission of Peel J, allocated the financial remedy proceedings and the Wife&#8217;s annulment application to be heard by a High Court judge sitting in the Family Court. Peel J subsequently heard three case management hearing, on 5 April 2023 (when the annulment application was remitted back to the county court), 18 March 2024 and 9 April 2024. This case was then allocated to me, sitting as a Judge of the High Court pursuant to s.9(1) of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Senior Courts Act 1981</span>, for a pre-trial review on 4 September 2024 and to hear this four-day final hearing. </p>

The mortgage balances as at February 2024 were &#163;98,561 and &#163;23,658, a total of &#163;122,219. Deducting costs of sale at 2% (&#163;8,800) produces net equity of &#163;308,980.

Roughly one-third represents the creditors&#8217; debts (&#163;78,487 as at 9 July 2019); the balancing two-thirds arises because of statutory interest at 8% and the professional costs and legal costs of the trustee in bankruptcy. Since then, I estimate that interest of roughly &#163;2,600 will have accrued and the trustee in bankruptcy will have incurred further costs including the attendance of a noting brief at this hearing. Doing the best I can on limited information, I propose to adopt a figure of <span style="font-weight:bold">&#163;235,000</span> for the current total, against which I will offset the Wife&#8217;s liability to pay the annulment costs order of &#163;14,055 in order to avoid double counting that liability.

Both parties in this case have raised numerous allegations of conduct against the other in one or another of their witness statements. At no stage in any of the previous nine hearings have directions been made in relation to conduct. I gave the parties the opportunity to request permission to rely on conduct further to Peel J&#8217;s guidance in <span style="font-style:italic">Tsvetkov v Khayrova</span>&#160;[2023] EWFC 1300. Both parties confirmed that they were not relying on conduct. To my mind, that was the right approach to take in such a modest asset case. For what it&#8217;s worth, my preliminary view is that none of the allegations overcame the &#8216;high hurdle&#8217; set in law, as recently upheld in <span style="font-style:italic">N v J</span> [2024] EWFC 184). I therefore excluded any allegation of conduct from the issues in this case.

I accept that the Husband frequently referred to the family home as &#8220;our home&#8221;.

Obviously, the primary carer needs whatever is available to make the main home for the children, but it is of importance, albeit it is of lesser importance, that the other parent should have a home of his own where the children can enjoy their contact time with him. Of course, there are cases where there is not enough to provide a home for either. Of course, there are cases where there is only enough to provide one. But in any case, where there is, by stretch and a degree of risk-taking, the possibility of a division to enable both to rehouse themselves, that is an exceptionally important consideration and one which will almost invariably have a decisive impact on outcome&#8221;</p>

She has produced property particulars, to which I have not been referred during the hearing, from [597]. I accept that it is reasonable for the Wife to look for 3 bedroom property in Essex, and that the cheapest three bedroom properties she has evidenced have asking prices of &#163;260,000. I take judicial notice of the possibility that properties are often bought at less than the asking price but bear in mind that some purchase costs will have to be paid by way of conveyancing etc. </p>

While I understand the Wife&#8217;s reluctance to take out a large mortgage, in my judgment she will need to do so in order to purchase a property. There is simply not enough capital in this case otherwise. The higher quote for &#163;125,250 relates to an illustration from the Skipton Building Society [578]. It involves a 25 year term, initially costing &#163;769 pm. That compares to the current mortgage on the family home of circa &#163;793 pm [94].
