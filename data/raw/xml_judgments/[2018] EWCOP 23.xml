The substantive application was founded on alleged misuse of benefits but the prolonged and wholly disproportionate nature of the litigation increasingly turned not on this issue but on costs. The son had no savings and so the usual rule regarding costs &#9472; that the costs be paid from his estate &#9472; was not an option unless his solicitor and counsel were willing to waive their by then substantial costs. Despite the father&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;s attempt to persuade me otherwise, costs was the stumbling block and became the reason why the case did not settle. The correspondence recently copied to me makes that crystal clear. On 10 August 2017, Scott-Moncrieff &amp; Associates Ltd wrote to the local authority stating, &#8216;We will seek payment of our costs by Hounslow <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">as a condition of</span> the application being withdrawn&#8217;.  On 22 September 2017, the local authority stated that, &#8216;The LA has indicated that it may be willing to withdraw the application, on the basis the respondents are in agreement to another [sic, presumed to be &#8216;a number&#8217;] of conditions&#8217;. The first condition was financial monitoring. &#8216;The second <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">condition</span> is that the application [sic] will not agree to pay the first respondents costs&#8217;.

In my view, the respondents did not have a fair opportunity to deal with that allegation at the time, within the safeguarding investigation. The local authority was so concerned to protect the identity of its anonymous informant that it decided not to share the minutes and &#8216;aspects&#8217; of the safeguarding investigation with the respondents (Local Authority Position Statement, 7 July 2017, para 5). This made it difficult for them to provide a satisfactory response or explanation. The local authority then sought to rely on Public Interest Immunity in the proceedings, which was incorrect. When the bank statements were made available, the local authority was bound to conclude that it could not prove the alleged dishonesty and withdrew its application. </p>

In my view, the litigation was conducted disproportionately by both sides and there was a failure to focus on the simple central issue of whether the bank statements into which the DLA was paid evidenced any misuse of funds. The amount of claimed costs incurred of approximately &#163;50,000 + VAT is, to my mind, a staggering sum given the relative simplicity of the central issue and the son&#8217;s lack of means.  Counsel&#8217;s position statement dated 27 September 2017 on behalf of the First Respondent is in general terms, in particular the financial tables at (internal) pp.10-12, and involved giving evidence rather than merely setting out a position based on evidence. The correspondence is full of generalised assertions, of applications being misconceived, requests for summary judgment, etc, and both legally-represented parties made basic procedural errors (filing lengthy documents electronically despite what the rules say and including references to discussions at a DRH). </p>

That allows for an item-by-item detailed assessment of which items were reasonably required by SJ Hilder&#8217;s directions, the nature of the allegations and the complexity of the case and which were not.

In many cases, such as statutory Will, LPA and disputed deputyship applications, several family members may wish to participate and join the proceedings as parties without being represented. The record I have seen, in a statutory Will case, is nineteen.
