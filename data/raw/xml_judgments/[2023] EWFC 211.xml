	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Applicant Local Authority issued these public law proceedings in March 2022 soon after the eldest of the three children with whom I am concerned, A,  tested positive for gonorrhoea. The children&#8217;s mother, M, was at that time in a relationship with Y who is the father of M&#8217;s youngest child, C. The second respondent, X, is the father of M&#8217;s elder children, A and B. He is now married to Z. The children, A, B, and C, are now aged 8, 6, and 2 respectively. Medical opinion is that when a young child contracts gonorrhoea, it is strongly suggestive of sexual abuse. A was in the care of M and Y, or of M alone, at the time when she probably contracted gonorrhoea. There is no suggestion that any other adult could have infected A. M and Y have suggested that A may have been infected accidentally by transmission of infective bacteria via an inanimate object such as a shared towel or during bathing. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case has been listed before me as a final hearing. The reason why it has taken so long for the proceedings to reach a final hearing is that the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of M and Y against findings made against them by HHJ Mitchell sitting in the Family Court at York in December 2022 and remitted the case for a rehearing - <span style="font-style:italic">A, B and C (Fact-Finding: Gonorrhoea)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2023/437" uk:canonical="[2023] EWCA Civ 437" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWCA Civ 437</ref>.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of the first hearing and the appeal, A had denied that anyone had touched her inappropriately. She had no physical signs of sexual abuse on examination. M and Y had not previously come to the notice of children&#8217;s services and there was no evidence that M or Y had any sexual interest in children. There has, however, been a significant development since the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in April 2023. When sitting in a hot tub in the garden of the home of X and Z, A made a serious allegation that Y had put something in her &#8220;front bum&#8221; by which she meant her genital area. Very unusually, part of the discussion was secretly recorded by a neighbour without the knowledge of X and Z. A then made further statements in an Achieving Best Evidence (ABE) interview with the police in which she described the &#8220;thing&#8221; that Y had used on her. The Local Authority maintain that the object she described was a white, plug-in vibrator belonging to M.</p>

I have heard oral evidence from M, X, Y and Z, from the ABE interviewing officer, two other investigating officers, the current allocated social worker, the Children&#8217;s Guardian, and from two medical professionals giving opinion evidence: Dr Ghaly, Consultant Physician in Genito-Urinary Medicine, and Dr Teare, Consultant Microbiologist.

The Local Authority&#8217;s plans for the children are supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian. The plan for A and B is that, whether or not findings of fact are made, it is in their best interests to remain living with X and Z. If no findings are made, that arrangement can be made under a Child Arrangements Order. If findings are made a Supervision Order would be appropriate. In either case defined contact at least once a month with M would be appropriate, and regular sibling contact would also be planned. If findings are made against M and Y then the Local Authority plans that C will continue to live with Mr and Mrs D but under a Special Guardianship Order. If findings are made against Y but not M, or against neither, I have to consider whether C should return to M&#8217;s care, or their joint care. </p>

M performed oral sex on Y, then they had intercourse and Y ejaculated inside M. They told me that they did not use any sex toys. M says that she then went to the toilet, urinated, and wiped herself. M&#8217;s evidence to me was that between 2pm and 3pm she had a shower. She usually has a shower after the children have gone to bed, but she decided to have a shower early that day. M says that A and B were in their bedroom, upstairs near the bathroom. Typically they would come in and out of the bathroom. They follow her everywhere. Y was minding C downstairs. She used a gathered plastic netting shower scrub, which she calls a loofah, to wash herself with body wash, over her body and then between her legs. She dried herself on a white towel belonging to Y which she then draped over a banister. Her usual towel, and the children&#8217;s usual towels, were in the wash having been used to dry the dog after the wet walk in the forest the day before.</p>

However, she then said that she had visited the GP and picked up a vaginal swab for A on 11 February when in fact the first attendance was on 21 February when a cream was prescribed. Antibiotics were later prescribed on 25 February when vaginal swabs were taken. When M spoke to police in March 2022, and on filing a further statement dated September 2022, M stated that in fact the first sign of A having symptoms was on return from school on 14 February. M had told Dr Young, the Sexual Offence Examiner on 4 March that A&#8217;s symptoms began on 14 February and included a genital rash associated with soreness and itching and three days later, a green-coloured discharge.</p>

On the same day A was subject to a medical examination. This revealed no physical signs of sexual abuse. The testing, including examination of her vulva was distressing and painful for her. Tests on B and C were negative for any sexually transmitted infection. It was noted during a case discussion involving social workers and the Deputy Sergeant  that M was seen to be on the phone a lot to Y whilst in the hospital and that she presented as low in mood and at times upset. She believed that Children&#8217;s Services were trying to break up her family and was suggesting that A had &#8220;contracted gonorrhoea harmlessly through of material contact. She trusts Y completely that he would not harm any of the children.&#8221; Y was arrested and bailed with a condition not to have any contact with the children unless agreed by the police or social care. </p>

He could not explain how gonorrhoea could have entered the family home, saying that he wanted to know how just as much as the police did. He did not reveal that he had had unprotected intercourse with P  on 2 February, that he had feared he might have a sexually transmitted infection as a consequence, or that he had obtained medication which he had taken before he was tested for gonorrhoea. Instead he used the negative test result as grounds for objecting to the police actions.</p>

That evening she only said that the thing was white. The following morning, again according to Z, A said that Y had put string in her &#8220;front bum&#8221;. X had informed the police and social services by telephone on the evening of 29 May 2023. A was spoken to by officers on 1 June and interviewed on 24 June. A neighbour of X and Z, who has long thought X and Z&#8217;s family was too noisy, overheard discussion in the hot tub which she thought was inappropriate and she made a video recording which she provided to the police. Y was later interviewed about the allegations made by A.</p>

However, during the hearing Ms Venters KC informed the court that Y no longer maintained that position, but that his case was that A had been influenced by various factors to make the allegation, which was false. M&#8217;s position regarding A&#8217;s allegation is that &#8220;she worried that it is either true or that she has been influenced to make the allegations.&#8221; However, in her evidence she pointed to arguments involving her and X speaking over the telephone, in one of which she maintains that X told her that she would not see her children again and to &#8220;see what happens&#8221;. She considered it highly significant that this threat, as she saw it, happened only a month before A reportedly made her allegation in the hot tub. In  her final statement M said that it seemed to her that X and Z were telling A what to say. In closing submissions on her behalf Ms Worsley KC took a position similar to Y &#8211; not alleging deliberate coaching but rather influence as a result of circumstances and negative attitudes to M and Y to which A had been exposed.</p>

X told me that B had been behaving badly and that he had taken her to one side and told her that if she behaved like that nobody would like her. M recorded the telephone conversation on 5 April, in which Z also participated. I do not have the full recording, only the transcript that M has chosen to rely upon. In my judgment it is a mature conversation in which all three adults seem to take reasonable positions. The later telephone conversation between M and X, on 29 April 2023, was not recorded. X says that the context was that he had asked M to come over to his house to tuck A and B into bed because they had asked for her. M had complained to social workers that she was being called over by X. X had thought he was helping her maintain her relationship with the girls. X denies that he made any threat to stop contact but did say he would stop additional contact beyond that already laid down by the Local Authority. Indeed, contact did continue, under supervision, in accordance with the Local Authority&#8217;s plan which was adjusted from three times a week to two times a week at M&#8217;s request. It is also the case that additional indirect contact also continued, facilitated by X and Z. Notwithstanding closing submissions of her Counsel, it did strike me that during her oral evidence M continued to imply that A had been coached by X and Z to make the allegations that emerged on 29 May 2023.</p>

At this point I shouted to X and A repeated this to X. X then phoned the police as this is what he had been informed to do. B also said she had seen this happen but we didn&#8217;t know if this was B&#8217;s way of joining in the conversation. We did not ask further questions. This was around 7.30 pm. The next morning 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May, A was asking if she was still seeing her mam today as she was excited to go to the beach &#8230; A spoke about what had happened again as I said some people might want to talk to her about what happened to which A said she thinks it was string Y had put in her front bum. I just said okay and it was left at that. This was around 9 am.&#8221;</p>

On arrival they initially spoke to A alone but she did not repeat any of the allegations she is said to have made in the hot tub or on the morning of 30 May. The officers then took a statement from Z based on the handwritten note she provided to them (above). A was in the kitchen with her sister and step-sister at that time. The officers gave evidence to me that she would not have heard what Z was saying. Then Z went to bring A back into the room with the officers. According to IO Bussey, an Investigating Officer experienced in first contacts in child sexual abuse investigations, Z was only gone for a moment. On return A was asked if there was anything she wanted to tell the police &#8220;now that Mam&#8217;s in the room&#8221;. She replied, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221; She was then asked, &#8220;Anything that you told Mammy?&#8221; And A replied, &#8220;Yes, daddy put something right up my bum.&#8221; On further questioning she said it was something white, that it was her &#8220;front bum&#8221;, that it happened downstairs at the &#8220;old house&#8221;, it happened once, it did not hurt, she had not said anything to Daddy Y, and that mummy was there and &#8220;B was there, she can remember.&#8221; IO Bussey took a handwritten note of this exchange on 1 June 2023.</p>

When asked what the object was that she had drawn she said it was a bottle. On further questioning she said that the string was wrapped around the bottle and the bottle was smooth and &#8220;probably plastic&#8221;.

The police noted that there were no means of checking his story. Y denied having any sexual contact with A and suggested that she might have contracted gonorrhoea accidentally through &#8220;shared shower stuff.&#8221; He denied using a vibrator on A and when asked for an explanation for why A might have made the allegation against him that she had, he said &#8220;she has been coerced by her step-mum and her dad.&#8221;</p>

The labia minora surround the vestibule and lie inside the labia majora. The labia majora form the outer boundaries of the external genital area. The vestibule, labia minora and labia majora are part of the vulva, not the vagina which is the passage connecting the cervix to the external genitals, the vulva. Commonly in non-medical parlance, the term vagina is used to refer to the vulva and vagina. When A refers to her &#8220;front bum&#8221; I take her to refer to the whole genital area, but adults will sometimes use the term vagina similarly to refer to the whole female genital area. </p>

Transmission is normally directly from one mucosal site to another, for example from urethra to vagina, by &#8220;direct inoculation of infected secretions from one mucous membrane to another.&#8221; [Ghaly, first report para 2.3]. Dr Ghaly told the court that the ejaculate of an infected male will be likely to harbour infected secretions. Whilst the vaginal mucosa are a welcoming environment for the infected bacteria, there are also mucosa in the vestibule, such that infected secretions transferred to the mucous membrane of the vestibule may adhere there, colonise, and infect the female.</p>

In her oral evidence, consistent with Dr Ghaly&#8217;s evidence, Dr Teare did not put an absolute time limit on the period over which the bacteria could survive and remain infectious outside the body, and she did accept that it was not impossible for it to survive for a short period of time.

The incubation period is generally thought to be between 3 and 14 days. For children, the incubation period is less clearly defined but is assumed to be similar. The period of time between the introduction of the bacteria to a person and that person becoming infectious, so that they could infect another person is the same. If a person has symptoms then they will be infectious. I was told that the average incubation period is thought to be 2 to 5 days but that is not consistent with the overall period of 3 to 14 days, because 2 days is outside that period. I understand however that for most individuals the incubation period is between 2 and 5 days but for some they may not have symptoms for up to two weeks, possibly longer and some develop symptoms within a day or so.  </p>

STIs or sexually transmitted infections have also been detected on clinic surfaces and hands of national health service staff using the NAAT test but attempts to culture Neisseria Gonorrhoea or Chlamydia Trachomatis from these specimens have failed, suggesting that this material is nonviable and the transmission via this route is extremely unlikely.&#8221;</p>

Even assuming that semen carrying infected bacteria had found its way on the towel, loofah, or sponge, on the given timing, Dr Teare said that the bacteria would have &#8220;perished&#8221; before the girls&#8217; bath and so transmission could not have occurred through that mechanism.</p>

He thought that this would not happen when, for example, dabbing herself dry with a towel, or passing a loofah or sponge over herself when washing.

Notwithstanding the shower water passing over her and probably the loofah, and shower gel being applied to the loofah and M&#8217;s body, some of the infected ejaculate comes out of M and sticks to the loofah; (iv) the bacteria remains capable of infecting another even though it stays in room temperature and in a drying environment (in the loofah on a shelf) for a further two hours or so; (v) any remaining bacteria on the loofah then survive the application of more shower gel and possibly bath water; (vi) the loofah containing infective bacteria then makes contact with A&#8217;s vestibule which has become exposed even though it is protected by the labia majora. Dr Ghaly considered that it was highly unlikely that A became infected through that process. Similarly, it was highly unlikely that A became infected by Y&#8217;s residual ejaculate being emitted by M onto his white towel, surviving in room air and room temperature for two hours or so, and then transferring to A&#8217;s vaginal mucosa. In any event, the way M described A being dried by being dabbed with the towel over her genitals makes it very unlikely that infected ejaculate could have come into contact with the mucosa in her vestibule.</p>

It is a short letter which says that a small laboratory experiment had demonstrated that gonorrhoea bacteria had been found to be present on a piece of towel in one case 3 hours, in another 6 hours, and in a third, 24 hours after the towel had been contaminated with the bacteria. This letter is listed in the reference section of the RCPCH&#8217;s guidance. Dr Ghaly noted that this was not a controlled trial. It was not peer reviewed. There had been nothing similar reported in the 51 years since the letter was written. He and Dr Teare were also asked about an article in the Pan African Medical Journal in 2021 by Bambang and others, <span style="font-style:italic">Gonorrhoea Vaginitis in a Paediatric Patient</span>. This was a single case study. Dr Ghaly accepted a proposition within the report that a prepubertal vagina was more susceptible to the bacterial infection because it was more alkaline and contains no oestrogen. However, he was very unimpressed with the suggestion that the case report supported the thesis of non-sexual transmission of gonorrhoea since the child&#8217;s father had had a penile discharge and sexual abuse had not been excluded.</p>

Hence, there must be a theoretical possibility of fomite transmission because controlled studies could not be performed to exclude the possibility. However, gonorrhoea is very rare in children. If transmission via shared towels, the use of shared bath products, or shared bathing were possible, it might be expected that there would be many more cases of childhood gonorrhoea.</p>

The allegation was made to her when she shared the hot tub with A and B. The first mention by A of &#8220;string&#8221; was also to her. Z told police officers that she had not asked any further questions of A after she had made her initial allegation, but the neighbour&#8217;s recording proves that she did. The recorded conversation also reveals that Z gave A false reassurance, for example that she would not get Y into trouble. Z was with A when the officers arrived to speak to them on 1 June, and she was present when the ABE interview took place. She was not in the interview with A but she did spend  time with A during a break in the interview. Hence, Z did have an opportunity to exercise influence over A in relation to the allegations that she made. I have to weigh this in my consideration of the evidence as a whole.</p>

M is vulnerable and the court took breaks every hour to accommodate her need to take time out. She was emotional at times when giving evidence but she persisted and presented to the court as articulate and was able to put her case. She did not simply accept propositions put to her, indeed she was robust in the defence of her position. However, it was very striking how M raised criticisms of X and Z over matters such as X shouting at A and B, or Z possibly having consumed alcohol on the evening of 29 May, whilst being entirely forgiving of Y. She memorably said that Y may have cheated on her but that did not make him a &#8220;beast&#8221;, meaning a paedophile. The extent of Y&#8217;s deception appeared to be lost on her:</p>

Most importantly, after Y revealed his sexual encounter and that, as he has accepted, he probably brought gonorrhoea into the household, M, for the first time, set out in detail how she had showered on 6 February 2022 two hours or so before the children had a bath. This is the account which she and Y say allows for a mechanism of fomite transmission via the towel or the loofah to be put forward and which Dr Teare had previously rejected because of the timings.  Previously, M had told social workers that the routine is for her to shower at 7.30 to 8.00 pm [social worker report at page C70 of the bundle]. In Dr Teare&#8217;s first report dated 12 July 2022 at paragraph 4.16 she set out the evidence she had been provided with, namely that the mother bathed at 7.30 to 8.00 pm and the girls bathed the following day at 5.30 to 5.45 pm. No corrections or questions were put to her to change that information. In her July 2022 statement, M had said that the children shared a cream sponge when bathing (which was not for her use), but in her September 2022 statement she changed that to saying that A, but not B, had used the same loofah that she had used two hours earlier. </p>

However, crucially, it was only after Y revealed that he had had gonorrhoea that M gave the detailed account of the showering and bathing over the weekend that she continues to give, and which she and Y use as the basis for contending that A may have been infected by fomite transmission. This account also came after the written medical opinion evidence and the oral evidence of Dr Ghaly at the first hearing. </p>

That concern ought to be regarded as far more important that the concerns with which he was being challenged. Even so, he was frank about having lost his temper with M after she had complained to social workers about his having asked her to come to his house to tuck the girls in because they were asking for her. He had viewed this as a gesture by him to keep M very involved in the girls&#8217; lives, in their best interests, and not as a justifiable ground for complaint to social workers. He denied saying that he would stop contact, explaining that it was not in his power to do so in any event. He accepted that he had said that he would stop additional contact of the kind that had led to M&#8217;s complaint. He denied threatening &#8220;watch what happens&#8221;.

He appeared pained when giving his evidence. During his oral evidence he had to make a large number of concessions about his past dishonesty and his treatment of M. He admitted that he had lied to her, the police, social services, and the court when he had not revealed that he had had intercourse with another woman shortly before M and A had contracted gonorrhoea, and having treated himself for a suspected STI with tablets purchased from an online pharmacy before he tested negative for gonorrhoea. He admitted that some of his messaging to M during February 2022 looked, on paper, like &#8220;gaslighting&#8221; and controlling behaviour. When making these admissions he dropped his head and spoke very softly giving an appearance of contrition. The children meant the world to him, he said, and he would never hurt them. He just wanted to prove himself to M. As to their recent separation, such as it is, he hoped that they could repair their differences.</p>

It is difficult to trust any of his evidence. As Mr Tyler KC for the Local Authority rightly submitted, Y even lies about his lies. I do not accept his account of why he suddenly decided to &#8220;come clean&#8221; about his sexual encounter with P  and about having had gonorrhoea which he had treated with medication purchased online. He told the court that he had been affected by seeing the poverty and day to day existence of people in an African country where he had been working. This gave him a perspective on life and caused him to reassess his deceitfulness to that time. However, as it happens, and as agreed by all Counsel, on 27 September 2022, only two days before Y &#8220;came clean&#8221;, the parties were informed that Ms Phillips, Junior Counsel for M, had discovered that the telephone number which Y had called on the morning of 7 February 2022, which number had been extracted from his mobile phone, was that of an on-line pharmacy. Y had been found out &#8211; he had treated himself with medication for a suspected STI before testing negative for gonorrhoea. I am sure that that is the true reason he decided to admit that he had had gonorrhoea. I am far from convinced that his evidence about an encounter with P  is true, but what matters is that he did have gonorrhoea and he brought it into the household over the weekend of 4 to 6 February 2022. That is not disputed.</p>

Counsel have helpfully prepared an agreed note of the law which I have taken fully into account.  I remind myself that the burden of proof is on the Local Authority and that neither M nor Y have to prove anything. They do not have to prove that A contracted gonorrhoea by fomite transmission. Even if I reject their own allegations, for example in relation to the way in which A came to speak about Y having put something in her &#8220;front bum&#8221;, it does not follow that the Local Authority&#8217;s case that A&#8217;s allegations are true, is proved.

He later had a symptom of gonorrhoea with a stinging sensation on micturition but, according to him, that subsided. Nevertheless, on 7 February he sought out medication for an STI and treated himself.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical opinion evidence is that once a person has symptoms of gonorrhoea, and possibly before then, they are able to infect another person. Y had stinging on micturition on 4 February 2022. Although he says that that subsided it was likely to be the first symptoms of his gonorrhoea. Y  was therefore able to transfer infective gonorrhoea to another person on the weekend of 4 to 6 February 2022. The timing of the onset of M&#8217;s symptoms &#8211; most likely on 7 February, given her messages to Y, and her abstinence from sex with others during the few months prior to the onset of her symptoms and her positive test for gonorrhoea, all point strongly to the conclusion that M did not have gonorrhoea before Y infected M with gonorrhoea on 6 February 2022. The incubation period would be short, but it is not inconsistent with Y having given M gonorrhoea the morning before. Y has in fact admitted that he had gonorrhoea and infected M with it on that day. His admission that he had gonorrhoea is perhaps surprising since on his own evidence he only had a fleeting and mild symptom and it cannot be confirmed by testing that he had gonorrhoea, but he has admitted it and the evidence overall firmly establishes that he probably infected M with gonorrhoea and it was he who introduced it into the household on the weekend of 4 to 6 February.</p>

M confirmed in oral evidence that the redness in question had been over A&#8217;s vaginal area and that A had complained of being sore in her &#8220;front bottom&#8221;. M had applied some cream to relieve the soreness. Since, on the medical opinion evidence, the average time from infection to symptoms &#8211; the incubation period &#8211; is two to five days, the onset of A&#8217;s symptoms fits with her having been infected on 6 to 9 February 2022. However, as Dr Ghaly advised during his oral evidence, since the two to five day period is an average, then it is not inconsistent with earlier infection. Likewise, if the onset of symptoms were not until 14 February, as M has said in the past, that would not be inconsistent with infection as early as 6 February 2022.</p>

In the absence of evidence of an almost immediate transfer of infected ejaculate via an inanimate object, and the absence of any suggestion of non-sexual mucosa to mucosa contact at a time when an adult with A was harbouring bacteria capable of infecting another person, then fomite transmission is even less likely. It is &#8220;theoretically possible&#8221; for fomite transmission to occur via a towel or loofah, but for that to have happened on 6 February 2022, the infective bacteria in Y&#8217;s ejaculate would have had to have survived a series of transmissions, in environments hostile to the survival of the bacteria. Mr Tyler KC for the Local Authority submitted that the chances of fomite transmission to A on 6 February 2022 via the loofah or the towel were &#8220;vanishingly small&#8221;. Even if M&#8217;s current evidence as to the showering and bathing arrangements on 6 February 2022 is accepted, the chances of A being infected with gonorrhoea by fomite transmission via the loofah or towel are extremely low.</p>

On the account she gave in her statement of July 2022, an important statement on which the medical witnesses relied when making their initial reports, there was no shared use of the loofah, and so no means of fomite transmission via that object. The detailed account she now gives of the sequence of showering and bathing came late in the day and after the written medical opinion evidence, as already discussed. Therefore, aside from the lack of medical opinion support, it is difficult to rely on the alleged factual basis for the suggested mechanism of fomite transmission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The medical opinion evidence strongly supports the conclusion that A contracted gonorrhoea through sexual contact (and therefore sexual abuse). However, until May 2023 A had made no allegations of sexual abuse and had not given any information implicating any adult in any sexual contact with her. I note that on physical examination in early March 2022, A was found to have genital erythema but that is a non-specific sign and could be consistent with trauma or infection. Since it is known that she had gonorrhoea it cannot be safely assumed that the erythema was due to trauma. Dr Ghaly has advised that the absence of anogenital injuries does not negate sexual abuse but there were no such injuries present to help to prove sexual abuse. A has had counselling at her school and has shown some signs of being withdrawn and troubled &#8211; the school reports her as having the weight of the world on her shoulders &#8211; but that may be related to the general family situation rather than the consequences of an event of the kind she described in her ABE interview or any other sexual abuse.</p>

Might A have become infected after 6 February 2022 by accidental fomite transmission? The onset of A&#8217;s symptoms on 11 February is consistent with infection after 6 February. Y could not have infected her after 6 February because he was not present in the home. There is no chance of his infected ejaculate coming into contact with A&#8217;s mucosa and causing her to be infected after 6 February 2022 &#8211; any very small prospect of his ejaculate being transmitted to A and causing her infection that may have existed on 6 February would certainly have disappeared by 7 February 2022 because any infective bacteria would have perished by then (see Dr Teare&#8217;s evidence (above)). In any event, M does not describe any bathing, showering or other incident after 6 February when Y&#8217;s infected ejaculate could have been inadvertently transferred to A&#8217;s mucosa. However, M was probably harbouring bacteria capable of infecting A by 7 February 2022. Hence, it is possible that M infected A on or after 7 February 2022 not through transferring Y&#8217;s ejaculate to A&#8217;s mucosa but by transferring her own infectious bacteria.</p>

She told the court that showering and bath time routines were as normal, that is, that she would shower in the evenings after the children had bathed (on the days when they did bathe, which was about two to three times a week on weekdays). She does not say that they all shared a towel.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Gonorrhoea is known to be a sexually transmitted infection. Upon sexual intercourse infected ejaculate is implanted deep into the vaginal mucosa. That is an ideal environment for it to survive and multiply. Penile transmission to vaginal mucosa would not necessarily require deep penetration &#8211; mucosa to mucosa contact may transfer the infection.. Vaginal to vaginal mucosa transmission or oral to vagina transmission is also possible, although the mechanics of transmission are less advantageous for the bacteria. Digital to vaginal transmission is possible if the digit carried infectious bacteria but the transmission would probably need to be almost immediate. Fomite transmission via an object, including a sex toy, put into the vagina, or put into contact with mucosa at the vestibule, is possible but the medical opinion evidence was that transmission by that mechanism would probably require almost simultaneous transmission otherwise the bacteria would be prone to perish at room temperature and away from mucosa before it was brought into contact with the mucosa of the previously uninfected person.</p>

I regard the evidence that Y never spent time with A and/or B without M being present in the room as not credible. It may be true, as M has said, that A and B have a tendency to follow M around, but it is clear that they did not do so all the time. For example, they did not interrupt M and Y having sex on the morning of 6 February 2022. It must not be forgotten that Y and M had a baby to care for as well as A and B. It would be very natural in a busy household for adults and children to spend some time in different rooms from each other and very unnatural for Y, who was close to A and B, never to be alone with either or both of them. It is very likely that Y did spend some time with A and/or B without M being present over the weekend of 4 to 6 February 2022. On 6 February A and B spent the day in their nightwear. M took a shower in the mid afternoon and her evidence did not establish that A and B were with her in the bathroom throughout the period she was showering. She would on her own admission go to the toilet alone. I am sure that there will have been other periods during the weekend when she would be in another room, or outside the house, leaving Y with A and/or B. </p>

One of the most striking elements of the oral evidence of Y was his absolute confidence that he has not spent time with A and B without M being present. He maintained that that was true not just for the weekend of 4 to 6 February 2022, but also for the paternity leave he took and spent mostly at home with M and the girls, from the end of May to the beginning of September 2021, and the Christmas period he took as leave at the end of that year. For part of the period of his paternity leave, M was considerably restricted in her mobility as she recovered from complications of surgery at the time of C&#8217;s birth. For example, she slept downstairs to avoid having to use the stairs. There was then a baby to feed, change and look after, as well as A and B. There was later a dog to walk, feed and put out of the house. Both M and Y smoke and they would smoke outside the house. Y says that he never dressed or bathed A and B, that they would follow M around all the time, and that he was never alone with them, either individually or together. In that he was largely supported by the evidence of M, who, so far as the weekend of 4 to 6 February 2022 was concerned, admitted to me only that she might have had a minute or two on her own when using the toilet. I did not find the evidence about Y not being left alone with the A and B to be credible because it defied common sense.</p>

A highly unusual feature of this case is that the court has a recording of conversations involving the child very shortly after her first allegation was made. Had a trained police officer or social worker carried on the conversation as Z did on the recording, then they would be open to criticism for breaching guidelines. However, I am struck by the unguarded way in which Z repeatedly impressed on A the importance of telling the truth. Z and X were placed in a very difficult situation and I am satisfied that they did their best to deal with it. Z should not have told officers that she had not asked follow up questions. She clearly did so, but I accept that she did not continually press A for more details of what had happened. X and Z acted properly by notifying the police and social services immediately. The recording in itself does not cause me to question the authenticity of A&#8217;s allegations at that time.</p>

That of course is not quite the same as asking her to tell them what had actually happened to her. There were also parts of the ABE interview where, in my judgment, A was being led to certain answers. A is also inconsistent at times for example the &#8220;white thing&#8221; was later said by her to be yellow, green and pink. I acknowledge that the white vibrator pictured in M&#8217;s bedroom drawer is not yellow or green and that it does not have stripes down its length as she had drawn during her interview. When asked to point to an object that the string was like, she pointed to a piece of string rather than a piece of plastic coated wire of the kind that was attached to M&#8217;s vibrator. However, the vibrator is white, as originally described. To a young child, the plastic coated wire might be remembered as &#8220;string&#8221;, and the pink rings she refers to could well be the purple ridges that form part of the vibrator between the upper and lower white sections. The drawing she made showing the object put into her vagina shows an upper and lower section. The vibrator is not unlike a &#8220;bottle&#8221;. The way A describes the &#8220;bottle&#8221; object being put into her vagina is how a vibrator might be used. The way in which A gradually gave more information about the object clearly showed that her account was not rehearsed. The additional information she gave added detail, such as that the object was like a bottle, which better described M&#8217;s vibrator. There was no sense of exaggeration by A. She did not portray Y as a villain in any way. She has seemingly maintained a good relationship with Y and has not shown any animosity to him, nor any (other) reason to be hostile to him. A was consistent throughout in saying that it was Y who had put the white thing in her vagina. I have no evidence of an incident which A could have mistakenly interpreted and it is difficult to think of what such an incident might have been.</p>

I take heed of MacDonald J&#8217;s summary of sexual abuse allegations by children in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P</span> (above). I take into account the manner in which the allegation was made and developed, A&#8217;s inconsistencies, and the lack of coherence about some of her evidence to the police. I note that she did not recall any pain on the object being put in her (in contrast to her reaction to the physical examination by Dr Young) and that she did not show any emotional response when making the allegations in the ABE interview. However, those matters are consistent with her bond with Y, her trust in him, and that he may well not have pressed the vibrator very far into her may well not have exposed her genital mucosa. I take into account that A did not make these allegations sooner, and had previously denied that anyone had interfered with her, but I am satisfied that she made the initial allegation spontaneously when she felt sufficiently confident with Z to do so. The breaches of ABE guidance go to the weight to be given to A&#8217;s evidence in this case but, having regard to all the circumstances, they are not separately or cumulatively so significant as to extinguish the reliability of her evidence. Indeed, having assessed all the circumstances, including the breaches of ABE guidance, I am satisfied that I can rely on A&#8217;s evidence to the extent of making a finding that A did experience Y putting M&#8217;s white vibrator against and possibly into her vulva.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">I have to consider the possibility that M caused A to contract gonorrhoea by sexually abusing A, without Y&#8217;s involvement, after 6 February 2022 (she was not infectious before 7 February). The timing of the onset of A&#8217;s symptoms of gonorrhoea is consistent with that possibility. However, it is very clear that M and A have a loving relationship and that M feels protective of A. A has not made any statements that would implicate M other than one comment to the officers who spoke to her 1 June 2023 when A did say that &#8220;Mummy&#8221; had been present when Y put something in her &#8220;front bum&#8221;. She had not said that in the hot tub and she did not say it in the ABE interview. She may have been telling the officers only that M was in the house at the time. If, as I find to be the case, Y has sexually abused A with a vibrator, it seems to me unlikely that, quite independently, M would also have sexually abused A. Female to female transmission of gonorrhoea is possible but much less common and less easy to achieve than male to female transmission. A had lived with M all her life and has not revealed any information or shown any behaviour that would suggest that she has become sexualised or has been the victim of repeated or indeed any sexual abuse by her mother. It is unlikely that, against a background of no previous abuse by her, M would have chosen a time when she had a sore vagina (from 7 February) to bring her infected vagina into contact with the genital or anal mucosa of her daughter. Applying the standard of proof I do not find that M sexually abused A so as to give her gonorrhoea or at all.</p>

I do have to take into account that M&#8217;s evidence about some of the events of that weekend has been unreliable. However, had she known that Y had sexually abused A and then that A had developed gonorrhoea, she would surely have known that Y had given A gonorrhoea. In contrast, all the evidence points to M being misled by Y about his having had gonorrhoea, and M being genuinely confused as to how A may have become infected. She was put under the spotlight of suspicion because of his dishonesty. Her text messages speak to her suspicions about Y but also her ultimate acceptance that he had not been the cause of any infection. Those unguarded messages from her convince me that she did not know that he had sexually abused A or that she became convinced that he had not infected her or A with gonorrhoea. The evidence is inconsistent with her being a participant or facilitator of his sexual abuse.</p>

I am sure that he did have some symptoms and I am prepared to accept that they were minor on 4 February when he took informal advice from a medic.

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">It is theoretically possible that A could have contracted gonorrhoea by fomite transmission via the vibrator over the weekend of 4 to 6 February 2022. However, A has not fixed that event in time, and she does not describe the object Y used on her as being sticky or moist. She does not recall pain on the use of the object and that suggests that it was placed over her vulva without penetrating even to the mucosal membrane in the vestibule. Hence it is unlikely to have deposited infectious bacteria in the mucosa. Unless the vibrator carried infected ejaculate which was then put into contact with A&#8217;s mucosa in her vulval vestibule before the bacteria perished, fomite transmission via the vibrator is very unlikely. I do not have sufficient evidence to find that Y used the vibrator on A in that manner over that weekend. Hence, I cannot find on the balance of probabilities that A contracted gonorrhoea by fomite transmission via a vibrator. However, my finding is that Y probably did use the vibrator at some time on A. That finding that Y sexually abused A with a vibrator is consistent with and supports the finding that A was infected with gonorrhoea through some other episode of sexually abusive contact with him over the weekend in February 2022. </p>

The Local Authority did not ask me to make a finding that Y&#8217;s undoubted dishonesty was due to his guilt in sexually abusing A. I note Macur LJ&#8217;s formulation of the third question to be asked in such a case, &#8220;on what basis it can be determined that the <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> explanation for the lie(s) is guilt.&#8221; [emphasis added]. She earlier quoted from the Crown Court Compendium which put the third element of the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> as being that the lie &#8220;was not told for a reason advanced by or on behalf of D, or for some other reason arising from the evidence, which does not point to D's guilt.&#8221; Hence, I am not sure that  Macur LJ meant that inferences of guilt can be drawn only if the sole explanation of the lies is guilt. Rather, the court has to be able to discount that the lie was told for a reason that does not point to guilt. Here, I accept that one motivation for Y lying about his sexual encounter with P  and his gonorrhoea, was to protect his relationship with M, but another might well have been that he wanted to hide his guilt in relation to sexually abusing A and giving her gonorrhoea. Given that the Local Authority do not rely on a &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> finding&#8221;, I have reached conclusions as to the findings of fact made above without relying on any finding that Y&#8217;s lies were told because of his guilt in sexually abusing A.

She does so to set out grounds on which she alleges that A may have been coached by X and Z to make her allegation against Y. This is a clear example of her thought processes: she suspects Y of sexually abusing A but the prospect to her is so disturbing that she prefers to latch on to much more unlikely explanations: the possibility of accidental transmission by a loofah or towel, or the coaching of A to make the allegations in May and June 2023. M&#8217;s mental health has been difficult for her for some time but these proceedings have exacerbated her problems, and she hit a very low point a few weeks ago. I find that due to her vulnerability and Y&#8217;s deceit and manipulation of her, she has buried her suspicions about Y and chosen to stick by him whatever the evidence reveals. Her assertion that during the weekend in question Y was never with the children when she was not present, and her changes of evidence about the timing of the onset of symptoms, and the timing of her shower, persuade me that, if she is honest with herself, she knows more about the events of that weekend that she has told the court.

In fact, as I have found, M knew that A had soreness and redness on 11 February 2022. As Dr Ward advised, M would typically seek medical attention for her children more swiftly than most parents, but on this occasion she did not do so, even when she herself had remarkably similar symptoms. M said that with over the counter treatments A&#8217;s symptoms were soothed, but they must have returned by 14 February, if her report to the GP can be relied upon, which I am sure it can. So by Tuesday 15 February she should have sought medical attention. A went on to become feverish before M sought medical attention. This failure by M to seek medical attention is, in my judgment, another feature of her unwillingness to confront reality in relation to the events of the weekend of 4 to 6 February and subsequent developments. It must have struck her that A&#8217;s symptoms were similar to hers. She suspected that Y had given her something &#8211; she said as much by text. She also implied that what he had given her was related to him having sex with someone else. Yet, she was willing to accept his assurances. By burying her suspicions she prioritised her relationship with him, but in doing so she neglected to give A the medical attention she ought to have had. </p>

The alternative for C, if she cannot go home, is adoption which, as the Guardian has observed, would be catastrophic for her, and in my view could not be contemplated given the possibility of her being cared for by Mr and Mrs D under an SGO. Given my findings, including post-threshold findings, I do not see that it can be in C&#8217;s best interests to return to her mother&#8217;s care or to await further assessments of M before a permanency order is made. Accordingly it is in C&#8217;s best interests for a SGO in favour of Mr and Mrs D to be made now.</p>
