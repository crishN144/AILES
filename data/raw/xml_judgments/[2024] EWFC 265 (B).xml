The parents invite the court to adjourn these proceedings for an unspecified period to enable them to obtain accommodation and to make any other changes the court considers it is necessary for them to make.

The local authority has explored potential alternative kinship carers but no other persons who were put forward were positively assessed. As no other suitable carers have been identified, the local authority considers the only realistic and safe care plan it can devise is one of adoption outside of C&#8217;s birth family and it is for this reason it seeks care and placement orders.</p>

The guardian recommends that C&#8217;s welfare will be best promoted and protected by a care order, and considers that C&#8217;s welfare requires a placement order to be granted and that her parents&#8217; consent should be dispensed with. Mrs Jordan considers the parents place great reliance and dependency upon each other and have no support from anyone else. This makes it unlikely they will end their relationship. Mrs Jordan&#8217;s opinion is that the risks the parents present to a child are systemic and cyclical and they haven&#8217;t changed a great deal over the course of the past 8 years. Mrs Jordan could not identify any package of support which could be put in place to ameliorate or reduce the risks, not least because of the likelihood of the parents not working honesty and openly with professionals who would have the responsibility of making sure C is safe.</p>

In my judgment it is now too late to separate because such separation would have to take place and endure for a lengthy period before this court could be confident the parents would not resume their dysfunctional relationship yet again.

I am persuaded this is a na&#239;ve conclusion for the mother to reach. In his oral evidence, Y did not identify any reason at all for why he should stop using cannabis, he stated it improved his appetite and he struggles to eat without using cannabis, he said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I don&#8217;t have an issue with it&#8230;I like the taste of cannabis, why should I stop, I&#8217;m struggling to eat. If I waste away I will die, it gives me an appetite&#8221;.</span></p>

In light of the parents joint monthly household income of &#163;578.30 this is a significant portion being spent on the purchase of illicit drugs and it diverts essential funds away from their household finances and contributes to their inability to obtain any accommodation of their own or to discharge their rent arrears. There have been no changes in this regard over the past 8 months, if anything the situation has become worse with the mother stating in August that Y was smoking cannabis twice a week when contrasted with his admission in evidence he is smoking it 4-5 times every day.</p>

She stated she has access to the account via a banking app on her phone but then went on to state Y was in possession of her phone.  The social worker encouraged the mother to obtain her own photo identification via the Citizen Card with the aim of obtaining her own, separate bank account. This highlights the co-dependency the parents have with each other and their shared financial arrangements.</p>

The father has not shown any commitment to access such courses over the past 8 months or since the previous proceedings concluded. He failed to attend the Caring Dad&#8217;s course and was not proactive about pursuing this. The mother on the other hand did engage with the Freedom Programme but I am persuaded by the evidence of the children&#8217;s guardian that the mother <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;can talk about domestic abuse in an informed way but putting it into practice with Y is the difficulty</span>&#8221; because this is consistent with the mother maintaining her relationship with the father despite being able to identify the risks he presents as long ago as November 2023.</p>

The parents have a longstanding history of oppositional and dishonest engagement with professionals. In August 2024, this court refused the mother&#8217;s application for further assessment by an independent social worker because it was not necessary but directed the allocated social worker to update his initial assessment which is dated 26 April 2024.  The mother, to her credit, engaged with that updated assessment, the father did not. Despite attempts to rearrange his appointment on more than one occasion the father did not engage with it and put forward excuses for not doing so. During the initial parenting assessment Y presented at times as &#8216;frustrated and surly&#8217; towards the social worker. I am persuaded he resents the  involvement of safeguarding professionals in his life and does not see why it is necessary.</p>

Whilst it is acceptable to be assertive and to disagree, it is never acceptable to intimidate, to threaten or to be aggressive towards professionals doing their job. There has been no engagement by the father in any interventions which would cause this court to believe he would behave any differently in the future if placed in a similar situation.</p>

The mother found it difficult to make her own views known when the father was present with Mrs Jordan, he would often talk over her, interrupting her when she was talking. When the mother became upset when talking about her older children Y made jokes, completely dismissing the mother&#8217;s feelings. After Y had been escorted out of the meeting, the mother became much more engaged and regretted not being honest with the local authority about her relationship with Y but she &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">was scared about what might happen</span>&#8217;. The mother admitted she did not feel it would be safe for C to live with her if she remains at the home of Z due to all of the arguments between the adults in the house, and the arguments were likely to increase if a baby was in the house.</p>

The mother is influenced by, and enmeshed with, the father and his position is one which lacks any level of genuine acceptance or accountability for the situation the parents find themselves in. The mother was able to conceal C&#8217;s paternity when asked about it during home visits, Core Group meetings, the ICPCC, the PLO meetings and with the midwife. The parents only admitted the truth after the allocated social worker already knew it from Z after he visited his home on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January. A consistent theme in all sets of proceedings has been a lack of openness and honesty with professionals and there is no reason to expect this to change in the near future given the father&#8217;s lack of insight and understanding into why professionals would need to be involved, and the mother&#8217;s inability to separate from him or not to be influenced by him and her mistrust of professionals. </p>

Fortunately, C is sufficiently young to make this outcome unlikely and the positive attachments she has formed to her foster carers are likely to be transferable to adoptive carers to make it a successful adoption. Any adoptive placement which is found for her will only be progressed after a robust and comprehensive assessment of the prospective adopter/s ability to meet her needs and this minimises the likelihood of any adoptive family placement breaking down. An adoptive placement will keep C safe, it will meet her needs and be free of the risks C is likely to face in the care of her parents.</p>

Accordingly, I make a final care order and approve her care plan of adoption. I would like to say to the parents who have attended court throughout, that these reasons are not intended to add to their distress. Simply, I have to set out my reasons because this is an important decision for C and those reasons have to be recorded. </p>

Accordingly, I dispense with the parents&#8217; consent to placing C for adoption and I make a placement order which authorises the local authority to place her for adoption with prospective adopters of its choice.</p>
