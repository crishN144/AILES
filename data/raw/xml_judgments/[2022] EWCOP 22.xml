	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The sole question which this judgment addresses is whether the donor under a Lasting Power of Attorney for Property and Financial Affairs (LPA) executed in 2009 had capacity to execute it. I understand that although it is not uncommon for the courts to determine past capacity to execute an LPA, there is a dearth of published authority on the issue. I have been greatly assisted by an extract of a judgment of Senior Judge Lush in <span style="font-style:italic">In the matter of Collis</span>, unreported, 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2010, available at <a class="Hyperlink" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128112038/http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/guidance/protecting-the-vulnerable/mca/re-collis.pdf">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128112038/http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/guidance/protecting-the-vulnerable/mca/re-collis.pdf</a>, but no subsequent judicial authority has been brought to my attention. Although the issues are not complex, the lack of judicial authority has prompted me to publish this, suitably anonymised, judgment.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The LPA was purportedly executed on 17 December 2009, RD appointing his brothers, RI and RO, and his mother, V, to be his attorneys. The certificate provider was a legal executive, JH. There was compliance with all the requisite formalities. D is married to RI. She has taken a role in assisting the attorneys. J, who is not a party to the proceedings but who has provided helpful evidence to the court, is married to RO.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">RD was born in 1961 and is now aged 60. He has a learning disability and a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia for which he continues to receive treatment. At the time of the execution of the LPA he lived with his mother, V, but she died in 2015. In or around 2014, when V became unwell, RD moved to a care home where he continues to live. Members of his family have told the court of his love of the arts, his enjoyment of books, including at one point, a series of books about Queen Victoria, and his enjoyment of playing the banjo. When he lived with his mother he would go to the shops by himself, sometimes to buy ingredients with which he would cook them both a meal. He used local buses to travel around. He was and remains independent in many activities of daily living such as dressing, preparing and eating food, and personal hygiene. Sadly, since having to leave his home and following the death of his mother, he has more recently developed some behavioural problems, including disinhibited behaviour in public which has, on at least one occasion, come to the attention of the police. Currently he is subject to deprivation of liberty restrictions under which he cannot leave the care home without supervision.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2019, the manager of the care home contacted the Office of the Public Guardian with concerns about the management of RD&#8217;s financial affairs. This appears to have been triggered by a refusal to pay for RD to have a holiday in Blackpool but the concerns expressed extended to the delegation by the surviving attorneys of their duties to RI&#8217;s wife, D, and to the question of whether RD had received one-third of his mother&#8217;s estate in accordance with her will. As it happens, those matters are not now of substantial concern to the Public Guardian or the court. I should emphasise that there is no suggestion that there has been any fraud or misconduct by the attorneys, or that RD was unduly influenced to make the LPA. I am satisfied that all concerned in this case have sought to act in RD&#8217;s best interests at all times. However, when the care home manager raised the concerns, they prompted an investigation by the Office of the Public Guardian.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 11 April 2019 a Court General Visitor, Mr Pratt, visited RD at his care home and produced a report in which he stated that RD had had a lifelong learning disability and did not have capacity to manage his finances or to revoke the LPA. He expressed concern that RD may not have had capacity when he executed the LPA. Accordingly, arrangements were made for RD to be medically assessed. On 9 July 2019 Dr Ntanda, Consultant in Old Age Psychiatry, visited and assessed RD and wrote a Medical Visit Report. He concluded that RD did not have capacity to manage his finances or to revoke the LPA and that it was &#8220;most likely&#8221; that RD had not had capacity to execute the LPA in 2009. Correspondence sent to the surviving attorneys &#8211; RI and RO &#8211; remained unanswered and so, on 24 April 2020, the Public Guardian applied to the Court of Protection for the court to consider that RD had not had capacity to create the LPA in 2009 as is required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/9/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.9(2)</ref>(c) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>) and that, as such, a requirement for the creation of the LPA was not met &#8211; applying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/22/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.22(2)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>. If the Court so found, the Public Guardian sought a direction that it must cancel the registration of the LPA - Schedule 1, paragraph 18 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> - and an order appointing a deputy for RD to manage his property and affairs.</p>

RI, RO and D contend that RD did have capacity at that time, that the Legal Executive, JH, clearly assessed RD&#8217;s capacity at the relevant time, and that RD has deteriorated significantly since 2009 due to the dual impact of having to move out of the family home and the death of his mother.

Following an initial decision by DJ Beckley on 10 June 2020 to suspend the LPA and appoint an interim Deputy, the Respondent RS, and to give directions, the case next came a Deputy District Judge on 19 October 2020. Without a hearing, the DDJ made an interim declaration under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.48</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> that RD lacked capacity to manage his property and financial affairs and/or to revoke the LPA, made a full deputyship order, and directed the Public Guardian to cancel the registration of the LPA. No determination was made as to RD&#8217;s capacity to have executed the LPA in 2009. Further, the DDJ appears to have proceeded on the basis that there was no opposition from the donees. The family later became aware of the proceedings and made an application for reconsideration of the orders of 19 October 2020. That application was transferred to the North East hub and was heard by DJ Temple. On 2 March 2022 DJ Temple set aside the order of 19 October 2020 as having been erroneous in law and fact. In particular, there had been no declaration as to RD&#8217;s capacity to execute the LPA and only an interim declaration about RD&#8217;s capacity to manage his property and financial affairs. Directions were given, including that the hearing of the determination of past capacity should be on submissions only, without evidence. Due to the illness of the District Judge due to hear the case, the final hearing was re-listed before me on 25 May 2022.</span></p>

The Office of the Public Guardian&#8217;s booklet &#8216;Guidance for people who want to make a Lasting Power of Attorney&#8217; confirms that P (RD in this case) should be able to understand at the very least: what an LPA is; why they want to make it; who they are appointing as attorney; why they have chosen that person or those people to be appointed; and what powers are being given to the attorney. The degree of understanding required to create an enduring power of attorney was considered by Mr. Justice Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Re K, Re F</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] 1 All ER 358" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] 1 All ER 358</ref>.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Finally, I should say something about what is meant by understanding the nature and effect of the power. What degree of understanding is involved? Plainly one cannot expect that the donor should have been able to pass an examination on the provisions of the 1985 Act. At the other extreme I do not think it would be sufficient if he realised only that it gave cousin William power to look after his property. Counsel as amicus curiae helpfully summarised the matters which the donor should have understood in order that he can be said to have understood the nature and effect of the power: first, if such be the terms of the power, that the attorney will be able to assume complete authority over the donor&#8217;s affairs; second, if such be the terms of the power, that the attorney will in general be able to do anything with the donor&#8217;s property which the donor could have done; third, that the authority will continue if the donor should become mentally incapable; fourth, that if he should be or become mentally incapable, the power will be irrevocable without confirmation by the court. I do not wish to prescribe another form of words in competition with the explanatory notes prescribed by the Lord Chancellor, but I accept the summary of counsel as amicus curiae as a statement of the matters which should ordinarily be explained to the donor whatever the precise language which may be used and which the evidence should show he has understood. </p>

In practice it is likely that many enduring powers of attorney will be executed when symptoms of mental incapacity have begun to manifest themselves. These symptoms may result in the donor being mentally incapable in the statutory sense that she is unable on a regular basis to manage her property and affairs. But, as in the case of Mrs F, she may execute the power with full understanding and with the intention of taking advantage of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> to have her affairs managed by an attorney of her choice rather than having them put in the hands of the Court of Protection.

Perhaps further enquiries could have been made to track down JH who has not been traced.

I made an appointment to see JH a solicitor at S&amp; J, I believe he was chosen at random on the proximity of their premises. We both attended the initial meeting with JH without RD, where her concerns were addressed, her will was fairly straightforward with a Trust created for RD to be included in the distribution of her assets and an LPA was suggested.  We were asked  to return the following week with RD in order for the Lasting Powers of Attorney to be created. The following week I picked V up at her home and met RD near the solicitor&#8217;s office {an indication of his capabilities at that time} I believe he was fully aware of why he was at the solicitors and later that day would announce he had been out to sign a very important paper.  </p>

She said that in 2009 RD travelled independently on local buses, went shopping on his own, and was independent within the home he shared with his mother.

In marked contrast to his Mental State now, where he is not allowed out without a carer hence the DOLS due to his behavioural problems in the community, a comparison of RD from then with a 10-year gap does not stand up to scrutiny.

The court should not set the bar too high. Furthermore, RD, like many people, relied on a lawyer and his family for explanation and advice. The fact that he may not have understood every provision in the LPA or every possible consequence of making it or not making it, does not necessitate a finding that he could not have understood explanations given to him in a way that was appropriate to him, for example by the use of simple language. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no dispute that RD has a learning disability which has been lifelong. He also has a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia. Dr Ntanda is a specialist in Old Age Psychiatry and I have had some hesitation in accepting that he was an appropriate expert to advise in this case. However, his cv satisfies me that he has a sufficient level of qualifications and experience to assist the court in this case, his report is cogent, and he has had proper regard to the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref>.  All agree that RD could not live independently. In 2009 he lived with his mother but, when she was unable to look after him, he moved to his present care home. I accept the evidence of Dr Ntanda that RD has an impairment in the functioning of his brain which affected him in 2009. However, every person with a learning disability (and every person with schizophrenia) is an individual with their own characteristics. The evidence in this case is that RD is independent in many activities of daily living, he enjoys reading, arts, crafts, and playing the banjo. However, when interviewed by Dr Ntanda, and even though Dr Ntanda attempted to explain matters to him, RD could not understand what an LPA was, he had not recalled who his attorneys were, and he could not understand what authority they had. Dr Ntanda&#8217;s assessment of RD and his evidence as a whole provide compelling evidence that at the time of his assessment RD lacked capacity to execute an LPA. </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Ntanda&#8217;s opinion was the RD&#8217;s learning disability will have been static and that it is likely that RD would have also lacked capacity to execute an LPA in December 2009. The family&#8217;s evidence is not persuasive that RD&#8217;s ability to understand, retain, weigh and use the relevant information would have been materially different in December 2009 than at the time of Dr Ntanda&#8217;s assessment. They speak to a deterioration over time in RD&#8217;s behaviour, and perhaps also in his mental state, but not to any change in his level of understanding or capacity to make decisions. The evidence provided as to the events surrounding the making of the LPA does not weigh heavily against Dr Ntanda&#8217;s professional opinion that RD would not have had capacity at that time. RD may have understood that he was signing something important, that it was to do with money, and that RI and RO were to look after his money for him, but the evidence tends to show that he had no understanding of the scope of their powers, when they could be used, or what would be the foreseeable consequences of his not signing the important document. There is no suggestion of undue influence being brought to bear on him, but the evidence does show that his mother, V, decided that she wanted to make financial arrangements to protect RD in the event of her death, and that she was advised that an LPA should be made. RD was then asked to come to the solicitor&#8217;s office to sign the documentation. He did not instigate the process but was compliant with a process instigated by his mother.</p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence shows that RD&#8217;s learning disability is severe and that he has chronic schizophrenia. It is his learning disability which is, and has been, the predominant cause of his difficulties with decision-making. It renders him incapable now of managing his property and financial affairs. He would not have capacity now to revoke the LPA or to execute an LPA. In 2009, JH, the certificate provider, did not mention on the form that RD had a learning disability. JH did write that he had experience of assessing capacity, but there is no evidence about his experience of dealing with donors with a learning disability. There is no evidence as to what advice or explanation JH gave to RD in the 30 minutes they spent together in private at the solicitor&#8217;s office. I could infer that during that time JH explained the LPA to RD rather than engaging in small talk but, given the other evidence in this case, I cannot infer that, if the relevant information was explained to RD at that meeting, he was able to understand it, retain it, or weigh and use it. The evidence from the family, from Mr Pratt, and from Dr Ntanda, persuades me that at that time RD did not have that ability due to an impairment in the function of his brain. The evidence displaces the presumption of capacity and I conclude that on the balance of probabilities RD lacked capacity to execute the LPA in 2009.</p>
