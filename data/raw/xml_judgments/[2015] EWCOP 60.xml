Without the operation, the inevitable outcome is that he will shortly die, quite possibly within a few days.  If he has the operation, he may live for a few years.  Mr B also has a long-standing mental illness that deprives him of the capacity to make the decision for himself.  The operation can therefore only be lawfully performed if it is in his best interests.</span></p>

Given his views on life and death, it is very unlikely that he will change his mind.  But if he does, there is nothing to prevent the operation taking place, unless it is by then too late.</span></p>

On behalf of the Trust in this case, Mr Sachdeva QC submitted that the views expressed by a person lacking capacity were in principle entitled to less weight than those of a person with capacity.  This is in my view true only to the limited extent that the views of a capacitous person are by definition decisive in relation to any treatment that is being offered to him so that the question of best interests does not arise.  However, once incapacity is established so that a best interests decision must be made, there is no theoretical limit to the weight or lack of weight that should be given to the person&#8217;s wishes and feelings, beliefs and values.  In some cases, the conclusion will be that little weight or no weight can be given; in others, very significant weight will be due.</span></p>

As <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and the European Convention make clear, a conclusion that a person lacks decision-making capacity is not an </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">"off-switch" </span><span style="font-size:12pt">for his rights and freedoms.  To state the obvious, the wishes and feelings, beliefs and values of people with a mental disability are as important to them as they are to anyone else, and may even be more important.

However, the effect of their submissions is that because Mr B himself cannot balance up these matters in a rational way, his wishes and feelings are outweighed by the presumption in favour of life.  It is, I think, important to ensure that people with a disability are not &#8211; by the very fact of their disability &#8211; deprived of the range of reasonable outcomes that are available to others.  For people with disabilities, the removal of such freedom of action as they have to control their own lives may be experienced as an even greater affront that it would be to others who are more fortunate. </span></p>

In this situation, I do not find it helpful to see the person as if he were a person in good health who has been afflicted by illness.  It is more real and more respectful to recognise him for who he is: a person with his own intrinsic beliefs and values.  It is no more meaningful to think of Mr B without his illnesses and idiosyncratic beliefs than it is to speak of an unmusical Mozart. </span></p>

As appears below, he describes hearing angelic voices that tell him whether or not to take his medication.  Delusions arising from mental illness may rightly lead to a person&#8217;s wishes and feelings being given less weight where that is appropriate.  However, this cannot be the automatic consequence of the wishes and feelings having a religious component.  Mr B's religious sentiments are extremely important to him, even though he does not follow an established religion.  Although the point does not arise for determination in this case, I approach matters on the basis that his Article 9 right to freedom of thought and religion is no less engaged than it would be for any other devout person.  </span></p>

Religious belief has been described as a belief that there is more to be understood about mankind&#8217;s nature and relationship to the universe than can be gained from the senses or from science: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">R (Hodkin and another) v Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages </span><span style="font-size:12pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] AC 610" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] AC 610</ref> at [57].  Religious beliefs are based on faith, not reason, and some can strongly influence the believer&#8217;s attitude to health and medical treatment without in any way suggesting a lack of mental capacity.  Examples include belief in miraculous healing or objections to blood transfusions.  There may be a clear conceptual difference between a capable 20-year-old who refuses a blood transfusion and an incapable elderly man with schizophrenia who opposes an amputation, but while the religiously-based wishes and feelings of the former must always prevail, it cannot be right that the religiously-based wishes and feelings of the latter must always be overruled.  That would not be a proper application of the best interests principle.</span></p>

In this case, given the momentous consequences of the decision either way, I did not feel able to reach a conclusion without meeting Mr B myself.  There were two excellent recent reports of discussions with him, but there is no substitute for a face-to-face meeting where the patient would like it to happen.  The advantages can be considerable, and proved so in this case.  In the first place, I obtained a deeper understanding of Mr B's personality and view of the world, supplementing and illuminating the earlier reports.  Secondly, Mr B seemed glad to have the opportunity to get his point of view across.  To whatever small degree, the meeting may have helped him to understand something of the process and to make sense of whatever decision was then made.  Thirdly, the nurses were pleased that Mr B was going to have the fullest opportunity to get his point across.  A case like this is difficult for the nursing staff in particular and I hope that the fact that Mr B has been as fully involved as possible will make it easier for them to care for him at what will undoubtedly be a difficult time.</span></p>

This can lead to the patient being unaware that they have damaged their foot, leading to ulceration and subsequent infection.  With normal sensation, the injuries would be extremely painful, but because of the neuropathy, Mr B has been able to tolerate marked deterioration beyond that which a normal patient could endure.  In such circumstances, the first approach is to clean the wound, debride it surgically and administer antibiotics.  However, treating such infections with antibiotics has a very low success rate, and once the bone is infected, surgery is inevitable.  High doses of antibiotics may hold the infection but are unlikely to cure it.  In a non-compliant patient there is a serious risk of infection spreading up the leg and the presence of diabetes facilitates ongoing infection.  Similarly, infection makes it more difficult to control diabetes.  Once putrefaction has occurred, healing will never take place.  </span></p>
