	      <p style="margin-left:0.4in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This case concerns proceedings in Italy and England, to which the Brussels regime applies.  The parties are married, Italian, but have lived all their married life in London.  The whole family is undoubtedly habitually resident here, whether an English or autonomous European Union test is applied.  The husband is a hedge fund manager.  His fund is of high worth, perhaps &#163;30&#160;million.  The parties have valuable London properties.  Their income is high.  The wife says that she can establish that the parties&#8217; expenditure on themselves and their children was well in excess of &#163;300,000 per annum.  The husband applies to stay the wife&#8217;s application for Schedule 1 provision for their two children, aged 9 and 4.  He contends that the only jurisdiction in respect of provision for the children is in Italy where his matrimonial proceedings first in time were issued.  The wife concedes that were the Italian court seised of child maintenance then there would be no jurisdiction here, but she says that it is not seised.  As with most if not all such jurisdictional contests, there is considerable jockeying for position.  Each perceives that the jurisdiction of his or her choice gives advantage.</span></p>

The wife says that the judgment and the order must be read as a whole and it is quite clear that the judge was ruling on jurisdiction.  The husband has other points: he says that there was no jurisdiction in a single judge to make a ruling in respect of jurisdiction and that the matter could only be dealt with by a three-judge court.

He did not appeal the order.  He, and his Italian lawyer, who has produced an opinion for these proceedings, says that this is because there is no appeal against an opinion, as opposed to a ruling.  The mother&#8217;s Italian lawyer strongly disagrees.  This obviously would be a matter of some dispute before the Italian courts.  However, on 27</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt">&#160;December 2012, the husband petitioned the Supreme Court of Cassation, the Supreme Court, for a declaration that the Italian courts have jurisdiction in relation to child maintenance.  The mother&#8217;s Italian lawyer has submitted a response to the husband&#8217;s petition.  From this, it appears that the wife advanced the case as to jurisdiction which the judge adopted in November 2012 and supports it before the Court of Cassation. In the response her lawyer refers to other cases heard in Italy and it appears elsewhere, which it is said justify the judge&#8217;s conclusion that the courts of the child&#8217;s habitual residence are the courts which have sole jurisdiction in respect of child maintenance.</span></p>

It is specifically provided that a choice of court may be agreed between the parties.  He particularly draws attention to Article 7, headed &#8220;Forum necessitatis&#8221;, which provides that, where no court of a member state has jurisdiction under Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6, the courts of a member state may, on an exceptional basis, hear the case if proceedings cannot be reasonably brought or conducted or would be impossible in a third state with which the dispute is closely connected.  But I agree with Mr.&#160;Scott that this is not directly relevant in this case because either there is jurisdiction in Italy or in England or perhaps both, in which case the only question is which court is first seised.</span></p>

He submits that the </span><span style="font-size:14pt">Lis Pendens rule is not to be applied mechanically.  It must always be applied so as to give effect to the goal of avoiding irreconcilable decisions.  Mr.&#160;Scott points out that the effect of the Italian court&#8217;s ruling in the husband&#8217;s appeal to the Court of Cassation is that the wife has no access to the Italian court until the Court of Cassation rules and, unlike the case in this jurisdiction, the court in Italy cannot make an interim determination of maintenance until the jurisdictional issues are resolved.</span></p>

That case concerned the interplay between the Spanish and the English court regimes and the Brussels II regime in a different context.  The question was, had there been, or could there be, a maintenance determination at all.  That decision was under appeal.  Lord Justice Thorpe said at para.103:</span></p>

		      <p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;The effect of an appeal from a decision by the court first seised that it has no jurisdiction does not appear to be settled by authority: c.f. Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins, Conflict of Laws, 14th ed. 2006, paras. 12-047, 12-062; Briggs and Rees, Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments, 4th ed. 2005, para 2.205.  It is true that a judgment for the purposes of Brussels I is final even if an appeal is pending: e.g. Articles 37 and 46.  But the object of Article 27 is to prevent irreconcilable judgments, and as a matter of policy it would be very odd if proceedings in the court second seised could continue even if on appeal the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.  Consequently, we consider (contrary to the view of the judge) that Article 27 applies until the proceedings in the court first seised are finally determined in relation to its jurisdiction.  That would mean that the expression in Article 27.1 &#8216;until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established&#8217; should be interpreted to include the case where the court first seised has declared that it has no jurisdiction, but an appeal is pending against that decision, and that it would be unsatisfactory for the matter to be dealt with through a discretionary stay in the court seised second.&#8221;</span></p>

Proceedings for recognition of an order made in a non-protocol state must be stayed if an appeal has been lodged in that state, and if the order has been made in a protocol state no proceedings are required to obtain recognition.  Recognition cannot be stayed and the question of a stay does not even arise.  He submits that the streamlined procedure for recognition and enforcement is a matter of policy which reflects the overall goal of the Maintenance Regulation to favour the maintenance creditor.  The only member states that have not signed the Hague Protocol are the UK and Denmark.  He says that the great majority of cases will therefore fall under the streamlined procedure and this marks a significant development from Brussels II.  He says that the fact that the UK is itself a non-protocol state is irrelevant.  The distinction between the two recognition codes is predicated entirely upon whether the judgment has been given in a protocol state or a non-protocol state, not on whether the recognition state has subscribed to the protocol.  The position in the present case is therefore clear.  A judgment has been given in a protocol state declining jurisdiction.  That must be recognised.  There is no possibility of opposing its recognition and the fact that a collateral procedure has been started with a view to impugning it is irrelevant.  He stresses that there has been no appeal.  He says, therefore, that I am bound to recognise the Italian court&#8217;s decision, which he says must be regarded as a decision rather than simply the expression of an opinion that the Italian court has no jurisdiction.  In this respect also, the court must pay attention to the fact that the policy of the Regulation is to favour the maintenance creditor.</span></p>

This, of course, could relate only to the question of interim maintenance, bearing in mind that a significant aspect of the wife&#8217;s Schedule 1 application is capital provision, albeit provision for the children, which would of necessity need to be in trust.  He says that in that event there would be no subsisting order in Italy with which it would conflict.  Meanwhile, the wife will not be deprived of a forum.  He submits that this is analogous with a maintenance creditor who moves jurisdictions, who may invoke the child maintenance laws of each successive country.</span></p>
