(Three minor subsidiary issues were resolved by the parties by agreement during the course of the hearing.  One involved some relatively small joint assets; one involved a fund for child school fees; one involved a dispute over how much the Husband should pay to the Wife in respect of an agreement to meet expenses in relation to the children.  When an order is drawn in this matter it will reflect those agreements.  I am grateful to the parties for sorting those points out.)</p>

The Husband proposes the Wife should have 37.5% of that 50% interest in X Ltd and he should have the balance, i.e., 62.5%.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.75in">I shall record my findings below, but I make these general observations about the oral presentation of the witnesses.  Fred Brown was entirely professional in his evidence.  He was clear and helpful in answering questions.  The Wife was nervous but straightforward.  It is clear that she felt wronged by the Husband arguing against an equal division.  The Husband, who had to experience a long cross examination, appeared, on a number of issues, a calculating witness.  Instead of merely answering questions I formed the view he was considering how his answer might impact on his case.  Nonetheless, save on one emotional point set out below, I consider his evidence to be reliable.</p>

It is the Wife&#8217;s case (not completely accepted by the Husband) that until summer 2023 they spent 2/3 of their time with her, and only 1/3 with the Husband.  The Husband does accept that the children did spend more time with the Wife.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.75in">The Wife is aged 50. She does not work other than some charity work.  She had worked full time until 2012 as an administrator but reduced her hours to part time in 2012 when F started at primary school.  In November 2021 she had a brief 3-month job which was full time, but she has not worked since January 2022, when she gave up that job. She gave up the job because she felt it was incompatible with looking after the children.  She lives in the former family home.  This, on the scale of wealth of this case, is a modest property worth some &#163;733,000.  It is mortgage free.</p>

This business, through software which the Husband developed, enables companies who use call systems to analyse time spent on the phone and how well their call and contact systems work.  The Husband and Mr B initially held an equal number of shares.  In 2018 there was some corporate restructuring. A holding company was put in place. The Husband&#8217;s shareholding in the trading company were translated into shares in the holding company and then passed to another company Y Ltd.  The Husband and the Wife held the shares in Y Ltd.  70% were owned by the Husband and 30% by the Wife.  At the same time Mr B&#8217;s shares were similarly rearranged, effectively passing to Z Ltd.  The shares in Z Ltd were then owned by Mr B and his wife.  Their shareholding is more equal than the distribution between the Husband and the Wife.</p>

In July 2021 a presentation was sent out to market the company prepared by ABC Advisory, who acted for the company on the sale. Bids were made by interested parties in September to October 2021.  There was on an uncertain date a second round of bidding for the preferred bidders.  In about November 2021 an exclusivity agreement was entered into with A Ltd, and they proceeded to conduct due diligence enquiries.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.75in">The sale is described to be of 57% of X Ltd.  The consideration was divided equally between Y Ltd and Z Ltd.  Y Ltd was then dissolved.  The assets of Y Ltd are divided between the parties in accordance with their shareholding.  As a consequence of that sale and dissolution the Husband received cash of some &#163;17.42m pre-tax (&#163;14.2m net) and the Wife received cash of some &#163;7.46m pre-tax (&#163;6m net).  Further the Husband received loan notes worth approximately &#163;7m gross and the Wife received loan notes worth approximately &#163;3m gross.  These loan notes carry interest.  That is rolled up.  The loan notes are payable in either 2032, or if there is an onward sale of X Ltd.  Tax will be payable on what is received from them at that time.  The loan notes are only payable if there are funds in a newly created company, referred to as Midco which sits between the trading company and Topco.  I am told that is likely.  Further the parties received preference shares and ordinary shares in Topco.  The preference shares are for &#163;3.5m gross for the Husband and &#163;1.5m gross for the Wife.  They are payable on a resale of the business, but only if X Ltd sells for 2 &#189; x what A Ltd paid for it.  The amount is then payable on a sliding scale down to nothing if the sale is only at twice the purchase price.  This is what the parties describe as a claw back.  The ordinary shares are a mixture of B and C shares in Topco.  The C shares are also subject to the same clawback. I was told, after the hearing, that the B and C shares have equal voting rights.  The B and C shares passed to the parties on a 70/30 split. These, as I understand matters, will have value if X Ltd does very well.  Neither party has attributed a value to them as matters stand.</p>

It is drawn to my attention by Mr Southgate.  It is a case in which the husband had set up a separate account into which he paid performance related remuneration which he claimed, and was accepted by the court, to be non-matrimonial property.  Mr Southgate wants me to take note that Roberts J recognised the wife&#8217;s ongoing (i.e., post separation) contribution to the welfare of the family but did not consider that such contribution matched the husband&#8217;s post separation earnings or gave the wife an entitlement to an equal share in them.  I do so note, but I also note that the Judge does say that those contributions are relevant to the overarching circumstances of the case including fairness of outcome.</p>

I note in that regard that they did not prevent Moylan J and Roberts J from assessing assets deriving from post separation labour as non-matrimonial assets.  I agree with Moylan J and Roberts J that these words do not bar the existence at trial of post-separation non-matrimonial assets.  It is of course right that assets must be assessed as at the date of the trial, but that does not exclude a consideration as to whether the assets are matrimonial or not.  That is a task that the courts now often need to perform.  It is a matter for the particular facts of the case whether what the husband (to use the genders of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Times-Roman">Cowan</span><span style="font-family:Times-Roman">) is in fact doing when he pleads post marital contributions is investing the wife&#8217;s unascertained share or creating fresh wealth through labour.</span></p>

Where I must depart from those words is that there may be cases in which fairness does require a consideration of assets accrued by post-separation labour. A rule of thumb, even one promulgated by as experienced and influential a judge as Mostyn J, cannot act as a bar to a fair assessment.</span></p>

What he says is that &#8216;It will depend on the circumstances, although the assets used may be a relevant consideration as to whether the circumstances justifies departure from equality.&#8217;  In that case Moor J concluded the post separation argument failed in part because the Husband&#8217;s hand was &#8216;no longer on the tiller&#8217; of the business (he had reduced his hours of work to 3 days a week and then 1 day) but mainly that the parties&#8217; matrimonial home was charged to fund the MBO of the business in which he alleged post separation accrual, so the &#8216;trading with an undivided share&#8217; had a particular resonance.</span></p>

The judge did allow 50% of the profit allocation for the following years profit share to be considered as money that should be excluded from the sharing principle on the basis that the business activities become more distanced over time.

Mr Brown relates to me that those figures do not substantially differ from the assumptions he had made in his second scenario.  Where there is a significant difference however is in relation to the projected growth for 2024.  In the report the projected growth was 10% for 2024 under scenario 2.  In the marketing material it was 23%.  That changed the multiple that he applied from 3 to 4.5, which in turn led to the significant increase in estimated value.</p>

They are referencing here that whereas there were projections for 2020 and 2021 in the valuation in the report there are now actual accounts.  Mr Southgate says that hindsight valuation unfairly factors in the work that the Husband has done between November 2019 and July 2021 in that the Husband&#8217;s hard work after November 2019 was part of what produced the figures in the 2020 and 2021 accounts, and that is his post-separation labour.</p>

Indeed, he agreed when I put it to him that the contingent nature of some of the remuneration offered in relation to the 2022 deal may reflect caution at that time by the purchasers as to the estimates of future growth.  I do note that what he did not have when writing the report was an assessment of the growth of the business provided by the business, as was available on sale, which might have been supported by argument and information and might have altered his assessment as to growth.</p>

I do however need to remind myself that it is a reasonable rather than a reliable figure and is subject to a significant limitation.  Given the company did in fact sell for significantly more, albeit after it had grown, and given the higher valuation which Mr Brown came to on the basis of the marketing presentation I must bear in mind that any error in the &#163;28.1m figure is likely to be that it is too low.  I propose then for the purposes of any rough and ready calculations to round the valuation at the time of separation up to &#163;30m.</p>

The principal point he makes is that revenue grew after separation and before sale.  That is unquestionably true however one measures it.  Turnover in 2019 was some &#163;3.7m and in 2022 was &#163;7.6m.  Mr Molyneux was able to easily demonstrate that Mr Southgate exaggerated this growth significantly when he said in his note that the business grew exponentially  (albeit to be fair to Mr Southgate he used the phrase colloquially).  In fact, the rate of growth slowed.  Nonetheless the growth is, as the Husband said in evidence, enviable.  This was of course a factor referred to by Mr Brown.</p>

Nonetheless I have already recorded that Mr Brown considered his valuation reasonable but not reliable because of the lack of estimates provided to him of future growth.  All accountancy evidence is fragile &#8211; a point which is often made in financial remedy cases involving companies - but in the light of what I am told is a significant limitation, I must be careful in attaching too much weight to this value above and beyond the point that there has been significant increase in the value of the company.

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.75in">The second is the passive growth in the business.  At its core this point is that the driving force for the growth of the business is the software that the Husband wrote sometime before separation and continues to be used by the business.  Mr Molyneux was able to demonstrate that the rate of growth of the business had slightly fallen during the separation period, so in his phrase the company was just going forward on a &#8216;steady as she goes basis&#8217;.  The Husband conceded that there is some force in this argument.  And he does refer to it in his statement as a reason why his proposal is more than a sharing of the 2019 value of the business.  He does however make the point, as fleshed out above, that growing a business requires a lot of work.  I agree with that.  I conclude that there is a significant element of passive growth but there is also active growth.  This is a further reason why I must deal with the issue in the case by making a proportionate division.</p>

Multiples went from 9 in October 2019 to 16.4 in September 2021 before falling to 8.9 in April 2022.  Mr Brown said private companies were likely to have moved in the same direction as the graph, but not as sharply. The bid in this case was made in about September 2021.  The deal was not completed until February 2022.  Mr Southgate cross examined Mr Brown as to whether the market on completion was more significant than the market when the bid was made.  Mr Brown did accept that deals may fall apart if conditions change, and that he would expect purchasers to be under a duty to reconsider the deal under prevailing market circumstances.  He did however make the point that bids become &#8216;sticky&#8217; and that an indicative offer made when the market was high may not fall apart if the figures still work for the purchaser.   The evidence is that the claw back was introduced after the original bid.  There was speculation that was a response to the changing market.  I cannot determine that, but I do find that the spike in prices is likely to have increased the value of X Ltd.</p>

Mr Molyneux in this case drew my attention to passages in the Husband&#8217;s first voluntary Form E dating from May 2020 when the Husband highlighted the risk to the business that Covid presented. His argument was then developed along the lines that it was possible that the business might have failed, and in that situation the Wife would have had to share the loss, so why should she not share the uplift.</p>

The Husband has not taken matrimonial assets and placed them on the stock exchange.  Here there was an existing company which he worked very hard on to increase its value post separation.  Yes, if the company had failed that would have changed this case completely. The court <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> in those circumstances be asked to consider recklessness on his part.  It might not if the failure was beyond his control.  That is a matter for another theoretical case.  Here the business had grown significantly, and the court therefore has to consider what element of the growth derives from post separation endeavour on his part and is therefore not matrimonial.</p>

I do not agree with that as a matter of principle.  It may be appropriate in many cases to treat bonuses relating to the year post separation as still marital because they derive from the position which the employee has achieved during the marriage.  It is just a particular way of reflecting what I will in this case be taking into account as passive growth.  It is to reflect the extent to which money that is being made after separation derives from work done during the marital relationship.  I shall be taking the same factor into account here when I consider passive growth, and in particular the extent to which the growth in the value of the business derives from the software that the Husband wrote during the marriage.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.75in">If I cross-check this figure with the straight-line apportionment, I see that I am increasing by 3.5% the Wife&#8217;s share over what that approach would yield. I am comfortable with that given the findings that I have made.  (On reviewing the draft of this judgment Mr Molyneux and Mr Coates suggested that I correct the arithmetic of the straight line division from the figures advanced by Mr Southgate to 11.8/14 which is 84%, yielding a half share of 42% and thereby giving only a 0.5% increase in my assessment over the straight-line apportionment. I record that, as anticipated by Mr Molyneux and Mr Coates, I remain comfortable with my assessment and feel no need to investigate the precise dates further.) Reflecting on the overall fairness bearing in mind all the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18 s. 25" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> factors, I consider this an appropriate outcome.  The Husband receives 15% more than the Wife from the business to reflect his post separation endeavour.</p>

I will leave counsel to calculate the figures with more precision and, I hope, sort out the timing.</p>

Of course, if agreement cannot be reached then the matter will be referred to me together with any other consequential orders.</p>
