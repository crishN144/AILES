F is reported to have diagnoses of ADHD and of ASD. At a CMH early in these proceedings the local authority reported its awareness of these issues. Both parents were directed to file and serve letters from their GPs setting out details of their respective medical histories. In keeping with the often non-cooperative stance the parents have adopted in these proceedings, neither complied. They have both been legally represented throughout and neither parent&#8217;s legal representatives have raised issues with respect to their client&#8217;s cognition or ability to provide instructions. I have heard evidence from each of them. They each had a good understanding of the questions they were being asked and a clear ability to express their answers. Insofar as M often resorted to saying that she could not remember particular incidents I am entirely satisfied that this related to her not wanting to answer questions about potentially difficult topics; she was able to remember with clarity non-controversial details from the same parts of the family history and could recall with equal clarity a number of matters which she says other witness have got wrong.</span></p>

The police exercised their protective powers and the following day I made interim care orders. Threshold is not conceded by either parent and the circumstances in which the family came to be at Wharram Percy are disputed. </span></p>

I found her evidence with respect to the extent to which she would ever challenge F&#8217;s behaviour particularly troubling. I do not doubt her love for her children or her desire to say the right thing. Unfortunately, I found her an unimpressive witness who would readily lie, in particular to exculpate F.</span></p>

He was a palpably honest and fair witness with a good recollection of key details of the morning in question. In particular he was able to give me compelling evidence about just how bad the car and the family smelt, telling me that they had had to have areas of the police station in Malton professionally cleaned, after the family&#8217;s attendance, so strong was the smell. He was also clear in his recollection that not only was there dog excrement in the car when he arrived, but the parents were clearly aware of this given that he witnessed F attempting to clear it up, whilst still on the scene. I have found no reason why he would lie about these parents and his memory of what he saw and smelt was vivid and compelling. Where there is disagreement between his evidence and that of the parents, I prefer his account. The smell of the car and, more tellingly in my view, its occupants is entirely consistent with the family having lived in deeply unhygienic conditions for more than a single night. I reject the mother&#8217;s evidence that during the preceding days the children were always showered and clean. That is also inconsistent with the photographs of K &#8211; in particular the photograph of ingrained dirt on his feet, taken at the police station on the 21.3.24.</span></p>

M was heavily pregnant. The living conditions were entirely unsuitable and unhealthy. The interior of the car was dirty, smelt and contained dog excrement. The children were unclean and the family had a foul odour, to the extent that Malton police station had to be professionally cleaned after their attendance. The children did not have adequate food.  The children experienced significant harm by way of neglect of their physical and emotional needs and were at risk of further significant harm.</span></p>

She used this to buy a house in Wakefield. There was a large amount left over but, according to the parenting assessment, this was spent within around a year, being used for general living expenses.  She met F in 2019, becoming pregnant with J in early 2020. In 2021 she sold her house at a considerable financial loss and lived off the money for a while until it was gone. The family moved to East Yorkshire eventually settling in Driffield where K was born in 2022. It is accepted evidence that between around March 2022 and December 2023 &#8211; 21 months &#8211; the family had settled, rented accommodation in Driffield. They were then evicted from that property. The reasons for that are disputed. The parents say, and again this does not appear contentious, that they stayed in a holiday let in Bridlington for around 2 weeks over Christmas 2023; they then moved to live with the maternal grandmother in January 2024; she reported F to the police, alleging that she had been assaulted in early February 2024. Between that point and the 21.3.24, the situation is unclear: the parents have variously claimed that they lived for 6 weeks with the paternal great grandparents; that they spent time in other, vaguely identified, holiday lets; that they lived with a friend of the mother&#8217;s at Driffield; and/or that they were camping at unspecified and unremembered locations in Scotland.</span></p>

On leaving the Glencoe guest house the owner contacted the local authority to complain about the condition in which it had been left. Apprentice social worker, Clare Woolgar attended the property on 9.5.2024 and recorded, &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">as soon as I walked into the room the smell of urine and dog was overpowering (the windows had been open for 24hours and the smell was still very strong). The double bed had all its bedding missing including the mattress protector, sheet, pillows and quilt and the mattress has marks on it. The bottom bunk mattress was full of urine stains and dog hair, the bed sheet and mattress protector for this bed was also missing. The two single quilts were also covered with urine stains. There was also a hole in the wall that looks like it has been punched and the television remote is missing. There is also a large dark stain on the carpet&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (G124; 465). The parents deny that they were responsible for the poor condition of that property, stating that it was always like that. However, that is undermined by the local authority parenting assessment which sets out that there had been previous, planned visits to the couple at the accommodation where the conditions were seen to be good (G178). That acknowledgment is made by the local authority as a concession to the fact that the parents are capable, when they put their mind to it, of keeping their living quarters in an acceptable state. However, what it means is that the conditions described by Clare Woolgar on the 9.5.24, in particular the overpowering smell, the visible dog hair and urine stains are due to the parents&#8217; failure to maintain the accommodation. Whilst this incident post-dates threshold, I am entitled to take it into account when considering the overall picture as to the parents&#8217; ability to maintain good-enough living conditions. </span></p>

This is a family who have repeatedly moved from one form of accommodation to another and repeatedly after a period of time &#8211; days or weeks on some occasions, months on others &#8211; allowed it to deteriorate to the point that it is unhygienic and, for young children, unsafe.</span></p>

That aside, it was very clear from the unchallenged evidence of the community midwife, that midwifery services were extremely worried for the unborn baby&#8217;s wellbeing; M was told as much at the appointment. Her current case is that her failure to attend multiple appointments in December and January is because she did not know about them. However, whether she was staying with a friend or with the paternal great grandfather, or somewhere else, she could have provided a contact address through which she could be notified of future appointments.

M&#8217;s response to this is that it doesn&#8217;t matter because L was in fact born healthy. The factual premise is correct: he was born well.

It is also part of the local authority&#8217;s case that the parents are in an abusive relationship with the father exerting unhealthy control over the mother. That forms part of the parenting assessments before the court, although Kirsty Sample fairly conceded that during her assessment sessions with F &#8211; for which M was present &#8211; she did not directly observe anything that gave her cause for concern. The parents&#8217; case is that they have a mutually supportive and equal relationship which does not feature control or abuse. Given the relevance of this to the welfare determinations I have to make, it is necessary for me to set out the evidence, my analysis of it and my conclusions with respect to their relationship as well as addressing the local authority&#8217;s threshold finding with respect to F&#8217;s aggression.

In her oral evidence, M gave an utterly unconvincing answer to explain these text messages away, saying that they were a hoax by her, in an attempt to get F out of her property so that she could cheat on him with the ex-partner to whom she was sending them. There is no suggestion in the text messages that M wants to have sex with her ex-partner; she does not directly invite him to call the police on her behalf; nor does she invite him to come round or suggest she might visit him; she does not say &#8211; as would have been much more obvious &#8216;why don&#8217;t you call the police so that F gets arrested and we can spend time together&#8217;. What comes through from those messages is M&#8217;s fear of F. Not only was M&#8217;s attempted explanation of the text messages implausible, it was entirely inconsistent with her actions when the police duly attended which was to be obstructive and uncooperative. She did not act in a way that suggested she in fact wanted F removed from the property so that she could cheat on him; she acted in a way that was consistent with her being the frightened victim of abuse. A neighbour reported having heard a loud scream from the property. F shouted and swore at officers. Both parents told me that there had been no domestic incident on this occasion and that M&#8217;s text messages were a hoax. I don&#8217;t accept that account. All the evidence points to there having been a domestic incident which frightened M to the extent of reporting it to a friend; the parent&#8217;s behaviour when the police attended is entirely consistent with them trying to prevent the police from finding out about it.</span></p>

F can be threatening to adults</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8217; (G236). I agree with that analysis.</span></p>

Against that proposition, when F was arrested in June 2023 one of the attending officers reported that the home smelt of cannabis, that F&#8217;s eyes were glazed and he appeared to be under the influence of cannabis, and also that he told police he had taken 3 grams of the drug 24 hours previously (J101; 680). Accordingly, and on the basis of what he himself told police officers in June of last year, I do not accept his evidence that he last used cannabis prior to J&#8217;s birth. I also note, in this regard, that in her parenting assessment the mother told Molly Nixon that F was using cannabis at the time of the police incident in June 2023. She then changed this in her oral evidence to be in line with the father&#8217;s evidence about ceasing use prior to J&#8217;s birth. That is a further example, in my judgment, of the mother&#8217;s passive and unchallenging nature causing her to fall in line with the father.</span></p>

He then refused to comply with the court direction for such testing and indeed cut his hair. His given reason was that the local authority had not managed, he said, to arrange contact to his convenience. For that reason, he told social workers, he was not going to comply with hair strand testing. I accept that it is entirely consistent with everything else I have learnt about F that he would act in such a petty way and for such a reason; it is consistent with his pervasive need to be in control and his anti-authoritarianism. However, that doesn&#8217;t preclude me also drawing the inference, which I do, that this was a convenient excuse for F to avoid hair strand testing which he knew would give the lie to his claim to be abstinent from drugs. I draw the inference that F&#8217;s refusal to comply with a court order, to which he had previously agreed, was in part because he was in fact using cannabis at the relevant time and knew that the testing would reveal this. I also note that in March of this year, F&#8217;s grandfather told police that on 6.3.24 &#8211; just before the family left his home &#8211; he and F had an argument about the latter&#8217;s &#8216;cannabis use&#8217; (J43; 622).</span></p>

As young children, they need safe, secure care in a stable setting. The parents have not provided that. These children have suffered significant harm in the care of their parents who have neglected them through their desire to avoid professional scrutiny and pursue their own agendas. The parents deny threshold is crossed and, to that extent, it is their case that the care these children were receiving up to the 21.3.2024 was good enough. In my judgment if these children were returned to their parents they would inevitably, and quite quickly, experience sub-standard care again from parents who don&#8217;t recognise that they have done anything to harm their children previously. I have seen photographs of the parent&#8217;s current accommodation. The local authority accepts, as do I, that it is a suitable home in which children could be raised. However, these children have had that previously, in particular for a period of time when the family lived in Driffield. The issue is the parents&#8217; ability to keep it that way rather than becoming, what M herself described as, a &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">shit tip&#8217;</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">. Further, in my judgment, if these children were returned to the care of their parents, it is highly likely that at the first realistic opportunity the parents would seek once again to remove them from the scrutiny of professionals whether by moving geographically or simply refusing to co-operate with any level of oversight. These parents have a long history of failing to work co-operatively &#8211; and in F&#8217;s case civilly &#8211; with professionals trying to ensure the safety of their children. Furthermore, as evidenced by the early part of this year and the statement of B, they have a history of falling out with family members and then isolating themselves from sources of support and oversight. I am not satisfied that any level of support could address that at this time. Nor do the parents accept that they need any support. In particular, they do not acknowledge that there is any imbalance in their relationship that needs addressing or that their peripatetic lifestyle caused any harm to the children or placed L, whilst still in utero, at risk of any harm.</span></p>

The parents, on other hand, are wholly lacking in insight into the harm that the children have suffered previously. Until they acknowledge that, they are unlikely, in my view, to be capable of meeting the children&#8217;s holistic welfare needs. I fully accept that M has been attentive and emotionally attuned to the children in contact, noting that for the vast majority F has not been there. I fully accept that both parents love the children and have a genuine aspiration to resume care of them. I acknowledge that F is a hard-working young man who has demonstrated a good ability to sustain employment and, currently, a home. I have no doubt that when he does not consider himself to be challenged or under threat, he is capable of being respectful and interesting. However, in my judgment his inherent mistrust of authority and his unusually thin skin with respect to perceived challenge, are a volatile combination that have led to frequent outbursts of abusive and aggressive behaviour and, at other times, simply &#8216;running away&#8217;. He is likely to continue to act in that manner until he acknowledges that he has a problem and, thereafter, seeks and benefits from proper help. In the meantime, if the children were in his care, they will be exposed to emotional harm by way of seeing and hearing his aggressive behaviour, and instability and neglect on each future occasion that he falls out with someone and/or pre-emptively decides to move the family. For reasons I have set out, M has not been in a position to shield the children from that and, in my judgment, remains incapable of doing so. Indeed, she too has demonstrated avoidance and at other times confrontation and obstruction, not least in her dealings with antenatal services for L. </span></p>

Within the proceedings neither parent has shown a proper ability to focus consistently on the welfare needs of the children. F has barely attended any contact. I accept that his employment has been a significant contributory factor. However, I also note that he refused to attend contact in Wakefield on the basis that he feared retribution from drug dealers who he previously robbed (which, on his evidence, would have to be 4 years ago or more), notwithstanding the fact that he </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">lived</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> in Wakefield, with the maternal grandmother, in January of this year, when it suited him. I am entirely satisfied that if F was not so set on proving a point and creating problems, he could have attended much more contact with his children than he has achieved. For her part, M has refused to consent to J being enrolled in a nursery close to his original foster carers and has deprived him of shoes that he was bought by his foster carers because she found them to be &#8216;ugly&#8217;.

In closing submissions, Mr Worrall said that once a week would not be unreasonable. I have already noted that contact is generally of a good quality. However, the court is now in a position to approve plans of permanence for these children and it is important that they are given an opportunity to invest fully in their placement and come to realise that it is their &#8216;forever&#8217; home. The current level of contact, which is 3 times weekly for the mother, is unsustainable and incompatible with family life with their carers. In my view the local authority&#8217;s plan of monthly contact strikes the right balance between B and C&#8217;s family life as primary carers for the children, and the need for the children to maintain positive relationships with their parents. However, I note the local authority&#8217;s commitment to holding a formal review once contact has reduced down to fortnightly to reconsider which level of contact best meets the children&#8217;s welfare needs.

I therefore urge him to seek help &#8211; from his GP, through the social worker or from trusted family members &#8211; if he is struggling in the aftermath of this Judgment. I urge him to do that both because of his individual worth and importance as a human being and because of his worth and importance to M and to his children.</span></p>

That means it is incumbent on the local authority to satisfy itself that contact arrangements, including the supervision of contact, remain safe for these children and that they are not exposed to any unmanaged risk from the parents. In particular, it is the local authority&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that these children are not removed from contact by the parents in a rash attempt to run away with them. In the event that the local authority becomes concerned about the risk of this, there are further orders the court could be invited to make and I reserve any future applications with respect to these children to myself in the first instance. </span></p>
