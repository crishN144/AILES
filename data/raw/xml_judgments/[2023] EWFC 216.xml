		    <p class="ind" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">There is a risk in needs-based awards, such as the one I have made, of requiring the payer to act as the ultimate insurer of the payee&#8217;s costs with little or no incentive on the payee to negotiate reasonably. An applicant for a financial remedies award can, and frequently does, seek a sum which, inter alia, clears all indebtedness including costs. Thus, however high the level of costs incurred by the payee, he/she will frequently seek what amounts to an indemnity for any costs outstanding so as to be able to exit the marriage debt free. Similarly, if and insofar as the payee has already spent large sums on legal fees which have been provided by the payer (either voluntarily or by way of a court imposed legal services funding order), he/she will argue that to be required to reimburse the payer will lead him/her into debt. It is, in my view, important for parties to be aware that even in needs-based claims no litigant is automatically insulated from costs penalties, notwithstanding the possible impact on the intended needs award.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">First, I found H to be &#8220;somewhat evasive and legalistic about his trust interests&#8221;, a central issue in the case. I do not think that he truly accepted the accessibility of trust assets, nor the extent of his notional allocation, nor the impact of his mother&#8217;s death on his interests. A significant amount of time and expense was spent on this important issue, although I have not been given any figures relating solely to this aspect. Ordinarily, this would justify an order for costs against him.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, W did not formally pursue conduct, but included in her documents personal criticisms of H. This practice of making pejorative comments about the other party which have absolutely no relevance to the outcome of the financial remedy proceedings and are probably hurtful, must cease. Apart from anything else, it is unfair to the party who has refrained from making personal criticism to be met with a litany of complaints about their own personal behaviour. The court&#8217;s function is not to pick over the bones of the marriage and attribute moral blame.  I doubt this in fact added significantly to the costs, but it is not appropriate to make unnecessary allegations, and ordinarily this too might justify a costs order. </p>

She was sufficiently well informed about the resources in the case, including the business (which by then had been valued) and trust interests, to know that such a figure was unsustainable. It was not until September 2023 that she reduced her offer to &#163;12.3m, and then to &#163;10.9m in October 2023. H&#8217;s first offer of &#163;6.5m in December 2022 was closer to the mark although the time for payment, over 6 years, was ambitious.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, certainly until September 2023, W maintained an unrealistic and speculative approach. She did not modify her position for months. This was not &#8220;reasonable open negotiation&#8221;. It was unreasonable.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Perhaps more importantly, lawyers must advise their clients accordingly. Of course, they act on instructions, but it is, in my view, incumbent on the legal team to explain clearly that a failure to negotiate reasonably <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">on an open basis</span> carries costs risks. If the party persists in in an unreasonable stance, they can have no complaints if they are on the receiving end of a costs order. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Litigation is expensive and personally demanding for lay clients. I see no reason why the court should not visit a costs order if one party makes unreasonable open offers. The authorities make plain that a costs order may be made even if it reduces the needs as found by the court. These comments apply particularly to big money cases, although I take the view that in smaller value cases the court should also be willing, in the right case, to make an award for costs, even if only in a modest amount, to register condemnation of the party whose open proposals are far removed from the eventual outcome. The message must get across that although the starting point is no order as to costs, the courts are increasingly willing to depart from that so as to do justice to the party who has been put to unnecessary costs by the other party&#8217;s overstated proposals.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Weighing all the matters in the round, I determine that W should pay &#163;100,000 towards H&#8217;s costs, such sum to be deducted from her award. The second lump sum payable by H will be reduced accordingly.</p>
