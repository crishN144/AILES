The husband argues that there should be a departure from equality for two reasons. First, he says that in 1986 he brought great value into his newly formed relationship with the wife. Second, he says that since 1986 he has made contributions of such a special nature that they outweigh those made by the wife. </p>

The primary function of a first instance judge is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way. He should give his reasons in sufficient detail to show the parties and, if need be, the Court of Appeal the principles on which he has acted and the reasons that have led him to his decision. They need not be elaborate. There is no duty on a judge, in giving his reasons, to deal with every argument presented by counsel in support of his case. His function is to reach conclusions and give reasons to support his view, not to spell out every matter as if summing up to a jury. Nor need he deal at any length with matters that are not disputed. It is sufficient if what he says shows the basis on which he has acted.&#8221; </p>

At that time the wife was a worker on the shop floor of the husband&#8217;s factory. The husband had been married twice before; the wife once. On 30 April 1986, they commenced cohabitation. They have two children: a son born in 1987 who is now aged 30; and a daughter who was born in 1989 and who is now aged 27. They married on 23 September 1989 shortly after the birth of their daughter. They separated in May 2015 and divorce proceedings then ensued. So, this was a 29-year partnership.  </p>

At first, the business was an equal partnership between the husband and a friend; that friend was bought out in April 1989. No science was brought to bear in the buy-out negotiations. The business manufactures and supplies materials, predominantly, but not exclusively, for installation in ceilings. In 1978 the husband and his friend found a factory in a town in the South of England from where they manufactured the fittings. The business has gone from strength to strength and is now a vitally important source of local employment &#8211; there are over 500 employees who depend on the continuance of the business. It is the biggest employer in the town. The shares in XG are held 99% to the husband and 1% to the wife. </p>

Mr Simpson&#8217;s methodology was not controversial. Unsurprisingly, Mr Pointer QC argues that the top figure should be taken while Mr Marks QC argues for the bottom figure. Mr Pointer QC made some good points in cross-examination, and in argument, as to why a figure, if not at the very top of the bracket, then certainly in its upper reaches, should be taken. Mr Simpson accepted that the price that would be paid by the notional or hypothetical purchaser would be in the &#8220;middle to upper end&#8221; of the bracket. Having considered the matter carefully, bearing in mind that a lot of value hangs on my decision, I have concluded that the price that would now be paid by the notional or hypothetical purchaser would be at the 85<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile of the bracket. I therefore conclude that the round figure to be taken for the present value of the company is &#163;221 million (&#163;221,125,000 to be numerically exact). </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.33in">I am firmly of the view that the correct approach to give effect to the sharing principle is to try to calculate the scale of the matrimonial property and then normally to share that equally leaving the non-matrimonial property untouched. This is logically pure, morally sound, easy to understand, and limits individual judicial caprice. I recognise that not everyone agrees with this approach. For example, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">AVT v VNT</span> (CACV 234/2014) at para 69 described it as &#8220;not helpful at all&#8221; apparently because it encroaches on the exercise of a wide discretion. Even so, I continue to oppose the school of thought that plucks a random percentage out of the air where the pool of assets is a mixture of matrimonial and nonmatrimonial property.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.33in">The (equal) sharing (of matrimonial property) principle is not a Procrustean bed. Cases have shown how it has been modified (some might say manipulated) to achieve an overall intuitively fair result. Thus it has been described as a tool and not a rule. So, by way of example, Mrs Miller did not receive half of the value of Mr Miller&#8217;s New Star shares, as the House of Lords felt that he had brought into the marriage some intangible unquantifiable knowhow which contributed to the later establishment of the business during the marriage. Similarly, Mrs Robertson did not receive half of the increase in value of Mr Robertson&#8217;s ASOS shares, Mr Justice Holman considering that the numerically quantified figure for the value of those shares at the start just did not fairly reflect what Mr Robertson really brought into the marriage. Equivalently, Mr Jones succeeded in persuading Lord Justice Wilson to adopt a very creative, arguably artificial, inflation of the actual starting figure for the value of his business in order to shrink the amount of the matrimonial property. But in all of these cases there was fidelity to the basic principle, more or less.&#8221; </p>

In my judgment that is too much, but to allow only the bare numeric figures of the accountants would in my opinion not remotely do justice to the true latency of this business in 2003. In my judgment one quarter of the present value of this business is the fair quantum to attribute to the husband&#8217;s premarital contribution. It is rather less than the proportionate amount which the House of Lords attributed to Mr Miller, which I calculate to be a third.&#8221; </p>

Rather, he argues the exercise is an evaluation. It involves weighing the evidence and then forming a value judgment. It is to be distinguished from picking a result from a range of choices none of which can be said to be right or wrong. Plainly, to decide whether periodical payments should be &#163;15,000, or &#163;20,000 or &#163;25,000 annually will be a pure exercise of discretion. When the court determines future facts, i.e. makes predictions about the future, the exercise is evaluative, even if it is based on findings about past facts.

Equivalently, to determine whether a party has a future earning capacity is an evaluative exercise. Determination of past facts may also have a significant evaluative component. For example, what a husband actually did by way of contribution is a simple matter of fact; whether it amounted to something special justifying a departure from equality is a value judgment: see <span style="font-style:italic">Work v Gray</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2017/270" uk:canonical="[2017] EWCA Civ 270" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWCA Civ 270</ref> at [105].

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.33in">The formation of a value judgment about the past value of something is essentially subjective but it must have some evidential basis. But the evidence is certainly not confined to a strict black-letter accountancy exercise. It involves a holistic, necessarily retrospective, appraisal of all the facts and then the application of a subjective conception of fairness, overlaid by a legal analysis. This is not arbitrary in the sense that it is unreasoned or capricious. Thus, in <span style="font-style:italic">Jones</span>, Mr Justice Charles held that 60% of the value of that business, founded ten years before that marriage, which itself lasted ten years, was to be treated as non-matrimonial. Lord Justice Wilson found that this was wrong and that 36% of the value was non-matrimonial. He achieved this by taking the agreed initial valuation of &#163;2m, by doubling that to reflect the fact that the company was (to mix metaphors) pregnant with a springboard, and then by uprating the doubled figure by 116% to reflect the movement in the FTSE All Share Oil and Gas Producers Index, thus reaching &#163;9m, which was 36% of the sale price of &#163;25m. In paras 32 and 35 Lord Justice Wilson acknowledged that his approach was &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; even if it did have the merit of being based on financial evidence. I am not sure that I agree with his self-criticism. Lady Justice Arden did not agree with Lord Justice Wilson, holding at para 60 that all the value of the company should be treated as non-matrimonial, even if it was worked on during the marriage, for otherwise &#8220;the law rewards the spouse who buries her non-matrimonial assets in the ground rather than the spouse who actively manages them.&#8221; She added: &#8220;the correct analysis in my judgment, in circumstances such as the present, is that, where a spouse has a non-matrimonial asset of the present kind, he is entitled to that element of the company at the end of the day which can fairly be taken to represent the fruits of the non-matrimonial assets that accrue during the marriage, even if the fruits are the product of activity by him or on his behalf.&#8221;  Sir Nicholas Wall P agreed with </p>

A linear time apportionment would suggest that just over 20% (20.12% to be exact) of the present value had been accumulated at the time of the marriage. In numeric terms this is &#163;44.5m. The straight-line method is not the only way of looking at the matter. An alternative is to take a discount rate of say 5% and work backwards from the current value. 5% has long been thought to be the &#8220;natural value of money&#8221;. Locke thought so in 1722 when writing about interest on an unsecured debt. Using this technique, &#163;221m in year 39 shrinks to &#163;49m in year 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">1</span>.

The objection of the wife&#8217;s legal team is to echo Lady Justice Arden. It does not reflect reality, they say. They have produced a graph which plots in separate lines the increase in turnover and post-tax profit. For each line the business had barely got off the ground in 1985. It made a loss in that year on a turnover of &#163;2m. Compare that, they say, to turnover of &#163;63m and profit of &#163;13.4m in 2015. Their lines have an exponential shape. If one were to start with say &#163;46,000 of value and to increase that every year by 25% you would end up with &#163;221m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>. The graph would look the same as Mr Pointer&#8217;s. I do not agree that it is reasonable to look at this company as having started with a tiny figure which has grown by 25% in each and every year. Even though it does not match the turnover/profits graph I consider that the linear or discount method much more fairly and realistically reflects the true potential of this company at the start of the marriage. </p>

That fact does not alter, in the slightest, my evaluative assessment of what element of the present value of the business should be treated as existing at the time the relationship started and which is therefore certainly to be characterised as nonmatrimonial. The wife&#8217;s arguments have made me ponder whether a further element, to reflect the co-ownership between April 1986 and April 1989, should also be designated as non-matrimonial property. The linear approach would suggest that the business was worth &#163;61.5m in April 1989. So, it may be argued that &#163;8.5m, being half of the difference between that figure and &#163;44.5m, should also be treated as nonmatrimonial.

He told me &#8220;this is my life, my passion, and when I walk around the factory with the staff and things, it is the ultimate zing. It is as good as driving a racing car. That is what drives me. So I know loads of people that do not retire until into their 80s. I am not saying I am going to try and leave it that long&#8221;.

He told me that he started talking about 75 &#8220;probably two years ago. At 65 he said he will do at least 10&#8221;. It is true that in the context of the breakdown of the marriage the husband had some desultory conversations with two possible purchasers, but I do not believe that at that time he was sincerely exploring a disposal of the business. I think he was probably acting emotionally in the context of the failure of the marriage. It is inconsistent with my view of him which is that he is devoted to his business and wishes to continue taking it forward, as well as providing work for so many local employees.  </p>

The husband confirmed to me that this would in fact be his intention on his 75<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday. Therefore, but for this divorce I proceed on the footing that it was the husband&#8217;s intention to cash out at that time &#8211; seven years from now. Of course, the divorce alters everything. However, it is my judgment that it is reasonable for the husband to be able to continue with his life&#8217;s work if most of the wife&#8217;s award can be provided now either by transfers of real property or in cash. Generally speaking, a <span style="font-style:italic">Wells</span> sharing arrangement should be a matter of last resort, as it is antithetical to the clean break. It is strongly counterintuitive, in circumstances where one is dissolving the marital bond and severing as many financial ties as possible, that one should be thinking about inserting the wife as a shareholder into the husband&#8217;s company. Its inaptness was well illustrated when Mr Marks QC put it to the wife that a form of <span style="font-style:italic">Wells</span> sharing would have happened had the marriage continued, to which her pithy response was &#8220;but it hasn&#8217;t continued&#8221;.

This finding has two consequences so far as the wife&#8217;s award is concerned. First, and obviously, and as I have already mentioned, it means that a minority part of the wife&#8217;s award will be expressed as an enlarged shareholding in XG. For reasons I will explain the wife&#8217;s shareholding will be enlarged from 1% to 17.5%. This is about 26% of her overall award, which is a not unreasonable proportion. </p>

I then expressed the provisional view that I would regard that purchase as not having happened and would treat the husband as if he still had the relevant funds in his bank accounts. I maintain and confirm that view. The husband did not need to purchase this property at that time &#8211; it is not his primary home &#8211;  and it would not be fair and reasonable to deduct from the pool of marital assets the costs and taxes of purchase let alone the notional costs of sale. </p>

There is a dispute as to how much of this should be made available to the wife as a lump sum &#8211; the husband claiming that he has liquid needs comparable to hers, and I will deal with this below. However, my calculation of the net marital assets proceeds on the basis that a dividend of &#163;80 million will be declared and the dividend tax of 38.1% will be paid on it. In calculating the capital gains tax the amount of the dividend is of course deducted from the starting point value. </p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Miller</span> the House of Lords said that the question of special contribution should be judged by reference to the same standards that an allegation of misconduct is judged. Although conduct has its place in the statute (in section 25(2)(g) of the 1973 Act) it is undeniable that marital (as opposed to litigation) misconduct virtually never plays a part. So, the same standard of rarity should be applied to a claim of special contribution. I can see why in the extraordinary case of <span style="font-style:italic">Cooper-Hohn v Hohn</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2014/4122" uk:canonical="[2014] EWHC 4122 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWHC 4122 (Fam)</ref> that standard was met, but </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.33in">while making &#163;145 million over the course of a long marriage is a highly creditable achievement it simply does not meet the standard of rarity needed to justify what is, after all, a highly discriminatory unequal division of the product of the matrimonial partnership. The problem with the whole concept of special contribution is that it gives rise to the Orwellian oxymoron that &#8220;all contributions are equal but some are more equal than others&#8221;. Therefore, (like the idea of sharing non-matrimonial property) it should be confined to cases which are as rare as a white leopard.  And this is not one of them.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Gray v Work</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/834" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 834 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 834 (Fam)</ref> Holman J determined that for the husband to have made $225m (&#163;175m at current exchange rates) over 18 years was not a special contribution, and his determination was upheld by the Court of Appeal. At para 103 it was said that the task of the judge is simply to evaluate whether the claimed contribution is &#8220;wholly exceptional&#8221;, no more, no less. At para 108 it was said that comparisons between cases are unhelpful. Even so, I am reassured that in this case the husband has made rather less money than Mr Work did, over rather a longer period. I am also reassured that in <span style="font-style:italic">Chai v Peng &amp; Ors </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/792" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 792 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 792 (Fam)</ref> Bodey J did not regard the accumulation of &#163;161m over 46 years as a special contribution justifying a departure from equality &#8211; see para 72. I make these observations in passing. The results in those cases have not influenced my core determination that the scale and quality of the husband&#8217;s contributions here do not justify discrimination in his favour.   </p>

I do not adopt that approach. A valuation of an asset is the estimate of what it will sell for now. If it is perceived as being hard to realise then its value will be discounted to reflect that difficulty. It does seem to me to use discounted figures and then to move away from equality is to take into account realisation difficulties twice. Whatever the asset the only difference between it and its cash proceeds is, as Thorpe LJ once memorably said, the sound of the auctioneer&#8217;s hammer. </p>

The balance, of just under &#163;10 million, is reasonably needed to give the husband some cash, which he will use principally to pay off the borrowing which he has raised to purchase the shooting estate. The evidence was that of this dividend of &#163;80 million, the sum of &#163;50 million could be raised immediately, and the balance would have to be deferred. Of the &#163;50 million, the sum of just over &#163;30 million would have to be paid in tax. Thus, the wife can be paid &#163;20 million more or less immediately and &#163;20 million would have to be paid over a period of time. Mr Marks suggested &#163;5 million a year over four years, but in my judgment, that is too long. In my judgment, the husband should have two years from the date of my order to pay the deferred sum of &#163;20 million. In her oral evidence the wife accepted that it would be reasonable for her to have to wait for a large chunk of her award. There will be a charge over the husband&#8217;s shares to secure this deferred payment. </p>

In my judgment that is a perfectly fair proportion for the wife to receive on the facts of this case. As it happens, it would be a fair percentage if I were doubly wrong -  about <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">both</span> of special contribution and pre-marital property, but that is not a consideration which bolsters my conclusion.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.33in">Finally, I would observe that the demands by Mrs Carew Pole for correction and amplification of the draft judgment went far beyond what is permissible, and amounted to blatant attempts to reargue points which I had already rejected. This practice is becoming commonplace and should be stopped in its tracks in the interests of efficiency and the conservation of the resources of the court. Suggested corrections should be confined to typographical or plain numerical errors, or to obvious mistakes of fact. Requests for amplification should be strictly confined to claimed &#8220;material omissions&#8221; within the terms of FPR PD 30A para 4.6.       </p>
