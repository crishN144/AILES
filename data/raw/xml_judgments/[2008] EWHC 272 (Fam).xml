It concerns his two sons M born on 28 December 1994 who is now 13 years old and K born on 23 March 1996 who is now almost 12 years old (&#8220;the children&#8221;). The Defendant is the mother of the children who arrived with them in England in December 2006. She married the father in Poland in 1994, the marriage being dissolved in Poland on 26 April 2002. Post-separation the mother lived and worked in Gdansk as a dental surgeon. The father has since remarried and lives in Gdansk with his second wife and their young child. There have been previous proceedings in Poland relating to the children in which Court orders were made on 26 April 2002, (by the Regional Court in Gdansk), 1 February 2005, 15 December 2006 and 24 October 2007 (all by the District Court in Gdynia, Family Department). Copies of those orders are before me in translation. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 6 December 2006 the mother brought the children to England without first informing the father. This is not in dispute. In her affidavit sworn by way of defence to these proceedings, the mother briefly sets out her position in Poland before she left which was one of dispute with the husband over finances and the amount and timings of contact visits which she wished to reduce and which the children were reluctant to fulfil. She recognises that the Court Family Curator (referred to in the second and third court orders) was then active in trying to ensure that contact took place, but states the last time contact had actually taken place was about July 2006. The mother makes clear that she was in financial difficulties because, although a qualified dentist, she was unable to get a contract with the government health service and the father was in substantial arrears of maintenance. (The father asserts that he was paying maintenance, but it is clear from court documents that there were substantial arrears). The mother was bearing the burden of supporting the family. She had visited England in September 2006 to explore the possibilities of coming and practising as a dentist over here, discussed the plans with her children and brought them to England with their agreement. She does not suggest that she discussed her plans with the husband. She visited England in November 2006 to arrange places at schools in England for the boys and makes clear that:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She states however (as her solicitor confirms) that she informed her Polish solicitor that she was planning to move to England and was advised that she could do so lawfully because she had the care of the children under the court order and could decide where they lived. Indeed, as her solicitor has acknowledged in a letter before me, she personally encouraged the mother to take a job abroad. The mother instructed her solicitor to write to the court and explain that she was living in England and to give her address in Lancashire. The solicitor wrote to the Court in the form of an application to the court dated 20 December 2006 headed &#8220;Motion for Contacts to be Suspended&#8221;, applying &#8220;for suspension of contacts of [the children] with their father &#8230;&#8221; Under the heading &#8220;Justification&#8221; the application states that on 6 December 2005 [it is not in dispute between the parties that this must be a misprint for 2006] the mother went to work in Great Britain and that she went there with her children &#8220;due to economic reasons&#8221;. Having set out the mother&#8217;s economic difficulties and the outstanding maintenance, the application stated:</p>

She did not herself notify her new address in England to the father. Nonetheless, she relies upon statements of the children that they had informed the father of their intended move to England and that he appeared to accept it. The father does not state when he first knew of the move to England. He simply states that he first made telephone contact in September 2007. Nor does he say when he first knew the mother&#8217;s address. The mother asserts (and I accept) that the father could readily have found her address on the internet and/or by consulting the General Dentist Council website which contained her name and home address as recorded in its register and has been the same throughout her time in England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At some date prior to 24 October 2007 the Gdynia Court inquired of the mother&#8217;s solicitor when the mother and children&#8217;s return to Poland could be expected. The solicitor informed the Court that she was unable to say. Thus, on 24 October 2007 the Gdynia court made the last of the orders to which I have earlier referred, namely a decision to &#8220;suspend executory proceedings&#8221; in respect of item II of the original court order of 26 April 2002. It records that the mother&#8217;s attorney by a procedural writ of 23 October 2007:</p>

Under such circumstances, as [the mother] is absent from this country, execution of the probation officer&#8217;s supervision is hindered.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father by his affidavit, disputes the mother&#8217;s assertion that the difficulties over contact in Poland arose from his default or unreasonable attitude. He blames her for those difficulties, and asserts that in truth they arose because of the mother&#8217;s obstructive attitude and deliberate creation of prejudice in the minds of the children against him. In this respect he is supported by an opinion of two psychologists in Poland reporting under an order of the court of Gdynia on 31 May 2006 (which order is not before me) in relation to the difficulties over contact which had developed when the boys were 11 and 10 respectively. The conclusions, which were supportive of further contact with the father as ordered,  included the following passage:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The analysis of the materials gathered show that the present negative attitude of [the children] towards the father is not their independent decision, but results from the long-term conflict between their parents and instilling certain attitudes by their mother, as well as from long-term lack of contact between the father and his sons.</p>

In directions ordered by Ryder J on 10 December 2007, as well as providing for the service of evidence and a CAFCASS officer&#8217;s report in respect of the child&#8217;s also advanced (see below), it was ordered that there be joint instruction of a Polish expert regarding the question of whether the father had rights of custody on which to base the proceedings, such report to be filed and served by 21 January 2008. That report has not in fact been obtained, owing apparently to difficulties in obtaining the services of a Polish lawyer. However, the parties are anxious that the matter should be disposed of promptly, as indeed is the duty of the court, and they proposed that I proceed with the hearing.</p>

I am mindful of the observations of the editors of the Family Court Practice 2007 at page 509 that where there is an issue whether the foreign law gives the applicant custody rights or not, the Court should resist the temptation to make its own findings as to the foreign laws applicable and should be reluctant to allow rights of access to a child to metamorphose into rights of custody. In my view, evidence is particularly desirable, in a situation where, without it, the Court is obliged to form its own conclusion upon the basis of a series of orders translated into English without the assistance of expert evidence as to the nuances of the wording, or guidance as to the nature or extent of the rights of the parties under the relevant law. That said, however, in the light of the parties&#8217; readiness to proceed and in particular the willingness of the father, as the party upon whom the burden of the issue lies, I propose to accept the parties&#8217; invitation because, in the event, the position seems to me to be susceptible of decision with reasonable confidence.</p>

This is by no means an unusual way of looking at the matter. Alternatively, the state may regard the whole bundle of parental rights and responsibilities as inhering and continuing to inhere, in both parents save to the extent that they are removed or qualified by the necessary effect of a court order or an enforceable agreement between them.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Re D</span> there was expert evidence upon those questions. I have none. However, it seems clear to me in this case that the parental authority (custody rights) over the children were not exclusively awarded to the wife, but were subject to (i.e. obliged to be exercised in accordance with), a right of co-decision in the father in relation to what were called &#8220;vital problems&#8221; in connection with upbringing, education and medical treatment. To that extent, parental authority was to be shared. In that respect, the precise ambit of the expression &#8220;vital problems&#8221; may well be open to argument in Polish law. However, as it seems to me, a long term change in the childrens&#8217; place of residence from Poland to England (as opposed to a holiday or short term visit) with its obvious serious implications for their upbringing and education, as well as for the father&#8217;s rights of access plainly constitutes a &#8220;vital problem&#8221; in connection with both the upbringing and education of the children which required co-decision, and thus created a right of veto in the father in the absence of agreement. No doubt, if agreement could not be reached, a court decision would be necessary. However, the father&#8217;s (restricted) custody right is to be found in his right of veto and not in a mere right to apply to the court and ask for an order relating to the child&#8217;s upbringing (including the question of relocation abroad). </p>

The letter further notes that, on the lawyer&#8217;s notifying the Polish Court that the children had left for abroad on 27 January 2007, the Court did not itself institute any proceedings. Nor did it do other than suspend the requirement of supervision by the Court Family Curator. I do not find that letter helpful for two reasons. First, because it comes from a lawyer who had personally encouraged the mother to take the job abroad and advised her that she did not require the Court&#8217;s permission for that purpose; to that extent the lawyer may be regarded as an interested party in the outcome of the proceedings. Second, it seems to me no more than a general statement insufficiently addressed to the terms of the order of 26 April 2002 and in particular to the effect of the limitation placed upon the mother&#8217;s exercise of parental authority by the father&#8217;s right of co-decision in respect of &#8220;vital matters&#8221; (c.f. the terms of the parties&#8217; joint instructions to the proposed expert dated 18 January 2008). Nor does the solicitor&#8217;s letter advert to any distinction, as encountered in most jurisdictions, between taking a child on holiday or other temporary trip abroad, which does not affect the child&#8217;s place of residence, and a move abroad with the intention of setting up home there on an indefinite basis. That being so, I turn to consider the defences advanced by the mother on the basis that the father has discharged the burden of proof that the children were removed in breach of his custody rights.</p>

That decision makes clear that the burden of proving that the plaintiff in Convention proceedings has acquiesced in the wrongful removal of his or her child lies upon the abducting parent. Further, for the purposes of the Convention, acquiescence is a subjective state of mind, which is a pure question of fact. In the instant case, where there is no evidence of any statement by the father indicating his acquiescence in the wrongful removal between the time when it occurred and the time when he issued proceedings, nor any clear and unequivocal action on his part by way of acquiescence, the mother is in effect inviting the court to infer a subjective intention to acquiesce based simply on the delay in issue of proceedings under the Convention until just over a week before the expiry of 12 months from the removal of the children to England. It is of the course the position that, after that period, a defence of &#8220;settlement&#8221; would potentially become available to the mother under Article 12.</p>

In this case, the evidence does not establish when or how the father became aware of wrongful removal of the children. Although the children have stated to the CAFCASS officer (see further below) that the father was aware of the intention of the family to depart for England well before such departure occurred, I lack evidence as to when the father learned such removal had occurred. Despite the issue of acquiescence and or/ delay by the father having been clearly raised by the mother in her defence, the father has not seen fit to make clear in his evidence (a) when he first realised removal had occurred or (b) why his application was so long delayed after such removal. In the light of (i) his refusal to engage on this question, (ii) the fact that prior to departure the mother lived and worked in the same town, (iii) the fact that court involvement over contact was current, (iv) that he would soon have been aware that the contact earlier ordered was not taking place, and (v) that he was in possession of the mobile telephone numbers of the mother and children, I infer that the father would have been aware of their departure to England within a few weeks at most of the removal.</p>

Despite that, the burden of establishing acquiescence as a subjective state of mind on the part of the father rests upon the mother, who is herself vague on the question of dates. It may well be that despite the removal of the children, the husband was not anxious to stir up matters for his own reasons, not least because he was in arrears of maintenance, which the mother was unlikely to pursue while she remained in England. Nonetheless, despite his delay in commencing proceedings under the Convention, I am not prepared to infer from the evidence before me that the father ever acquiesced in the removal of the children. It is not enough simply to show that he issued his proceedings late. Mere inaction, does not itself amount to acquiescence and, the quality of the evidence before me is such that I am unable to infer it. I am unhappy about the delay and the absence of explanation for it, however, to infer acquiescence on the basis of an absence of chapter and verse from the father seems to me in effect to reverse the burden of proof in relation to acquiessence, in a situation where the mother herself does not assert that any action or inaction by the father has influenced the course of her conduct either in coming to, or remaining in England. In my view there is insufficient evidence to establish acquiescence in this case.</p>

She said that, when describing the father&#8217;s uncertain temper and violence towards them, she was quite satisfied that the symptoms of distress which they showed were not made up. She was also quite clear that the boys were genuinely bewildered and agitated at the attitude of the father because he had been told by them of the move to England and appeared to greet it with equanimity. She was also satisfied of the genuineness of the assertions on the part of M that he would run away if ordered to return and in the case of K that he would hide where no one could find him.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (A Child) </span>[2007] EWHC Civ. 260, the Court recently reviewed the questions which need to be explored by a judge when considering a defence of Child&#8217;s Objections. They may be summarised in this way. (1) Are the objections to return made out? In this connection is the child objecting to being returned to the country of habitual residence, as opposed simply to expressing a preference for staying with the abducting parent? (2) Has the child reached an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views? (3) In this connection have those views been shaped or coloured by undue influence or pressure directly or indirectly exerted by the abducting parent to an extent which requires such views to be disregarded or discounted? (4) If, and to the extent that, it is appropriate to take account of the child&#8217;s objections, in exercising the Court&#8217;s discretion whether or not to order return, what weight should be placed on those objections in the light of any countervailing factors, and in particular the philosophy of the Convention or what have been called the &#8220;Convention considerations&#8221;. These are that both the deterrence of abductors and the welfare interests of children are generally best served by the making of an order for prompt return to the requesting state for consideration of the position by the appropriate home court; they also include comity and respect for the judicial processes of the requesting state, as well as welfare considerations directed to the position of the child in question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to question (1) I am satisfied that each of the children&#8217;s objections have been made out in the sense that they are sincere and largely based upon an objection to return, as opposed to a simple preference for staying in the care of the mother. If a child&#8217;s objections to return result solely from a desire to remain with the abducting parent, who in turn does not wish to return, then little or no weight should be attached to the child&#8217;s objection: see <span style="font-style:italic">S v S (Child abduction) (Child&#8217;s views)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 2 FLR 492" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 2 FLR 492</ref>. However I do not think that is the case here. The objections very considerably rest upon the happiness and feeling of security of the children in their new school where they are doing so well and their general environment and feelings of security in England. Both children state that, even if their mother went back, they would themselves find it very difficult to return. It is also plain that such reluctance stems from the prospects of a renewed regime of visits to the father in the face of what they state to be his unpredictability and occasional violence, and in that sense their expressed desire to return depends in part upon their preferred choice of carer. However, the wording of article 13 does not inhibit the court from considering the objections of a child to returning to a particular carer (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (A Minor) (Child Abduction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 FLR 390" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 FLR 390</ref>. Similarly, as it seems to me, the Court may consider objections to returning to a particular regime of contact with a feared parent, albeit that consideration is of little influence where (as here) day to day care would remain with the abducting parent on her return who would have the opportunity to apply to her home court for a welfare-based review of that regime and/or for consent to reside with the children in England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to question (2), I am satisfied on the basis of the CAFCASS report and the clear and persuasive evidence of Miss Weydert that, at age 13 and almost 12 respectively, and as possessors of reasoned and clearly stated objections, the children are both of an age and degree of maturity in which it is appropriate to take account of their views. Indeed Mr Rosenblatt has not sought to argue to the contrary. Nor has he sought to dispute the evident strength of their objections. What he has done, is to challenge the validity of those views, or at any rate the weight which should be given to them on the basis of that the mother has &#8220;coached&#8221; the children, or at any rate so poisoned their minds against the father in the past that what they say cannot be treated as a true reflection of the position. In this respect he relies on the examination made and conclusions formed as to the infection of the boys&#8217; minds by the mother against the father, as set out in the joint psychologists&#8217; opinion of 31 May 2006 to which I have already referred.</p>

Nor did Mr Rosenblatt, (who made clear that his cross-examination of Miss Weydert was conducted on the basis or instructions received from his client in full knowledge of the content of the CAFCASS report) explore those matters with Miss Weydert, despite her evidence that the children had been both specific and, apparently credible in what they said.

It is of course the position that the report is over 18 months old and relates to the period up to May 2006. We are now over 18 months on and the boys are of an age where they are certainly able to form and express views of their own and are not necessarily simply reflecting the views of the mother when they express them. Nonetheless, the following aspects of the report impact upon the assertions of the children to Miss Weydert.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Weydert makes clear in the conclusion to her report, that the boys attitude is in considerable measure based upon the view that the father showed little interest in them when they were still living in Poland and upon their allegation of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of their father, coupled with the fear that such alleged abuse may continue if they were to return. As to the former, it is plain from the psychologists&#8217; report that, contrary to the assertions of the mother, the father showed repeated interest in contact, which appears to have been frustrated by the mother&#8217;s intransigence and her arrangement of the children&#8217;s affairs in a way which made it difficult for such contact to take place. As to the latter, a passage in the report also casts doubt upon M&#8217;s expression of fears of violence from the father, in that it states in respect of M:</p>

The minor is well-oriented in the parental conflict and clearly sides with the mother. Living with the [mother], he observes her behaviour and is aware of her negative attitude towards the father, his wife and contacts with the minors. The boy is clearly imbued with the mother&#8217;s negative feelings and opinions concerning the participant. Together with his brother, [K] witnesses the conversations of his mother (often with their grandmother) concerning the father or the ongoing legal proceedings. Thus, the mother (and, indirectly, also the grandmother) influences in a negative way (maybe even self consciously) her son&#8217;s attitude towards his father and his visitations.&#8221;</p>

That said, however, in the light of Miss Weydert&#8217;s evidence, I do not doubt the correctness of her assessment that the boys are expressing their own now firmly held and genuine objections, based in large measure on their own perceptions. In particular, there is no reason to question their fervent wish to stay in England as the place where they are now happily and successfully settled at school with a milieu of friends and interests which they lacked in Poland. I do not consider that the objections of the children or Miss Weydert&#8217;s views as to the force and genuineness with which they are held are so undermined by the psychologists&#8217; report that I ought not to entertain them or enter upon the exercise of weighing them in the balance against the Convention considerations.

The underlying purpose is to protect the interest of the children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary.

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: First that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has obtained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the rights of the child, Courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child&#8217;s views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play, the Court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child&#8217;s objections, the extent to which they are &#8220;authentically her own&#8221; or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which the coincide or at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the great the weight that her objections are likely to carry.

I do not so intend, since I accept the submission of the respondents that Brussels 2 Revised is not to be taken to have achieved implicitly more than it has expressed. However, there can be little doubt as to the intention of the member states that opted for Brussels 2 Revised. The provisions relating to the return of abducted children were the most contentious and therefore the most difficult of resolution during the negotiation of Brussels 2 Revised. The resolution of the resulting impasse was the retention of the operation of The Hague Convention throughout the European region but with the fortification of what were seen, in the light of nearly 20 years of operation, as weaknesses or loopholes through which abductors were escaping. The fortifications were threefold: The emphasis on protective measures to nullify an Art 13(b) of The Hague Convention defence; The return of the case to the requesting state in the event of a refusal by the requested state; and automatic enforcement of return ordered throughout the region. The policy that underlies these provisions is clear and it is important that states bound by Brussels 2 Revised do not undermine its intended effect either in its interpretation or in its application in accordance with the stringent time limits stipulated.&#8221; (emphasis added).</p>

It is of course true &#8230; that for present purposes, while Art. 60 of Brussels 2 Revised gives it precedence over the Hague Convention, the only specific provision of Art. 11 which affects the implementation of Art. 13 of The Hague Convention (apart from the need, identified in Art. 11(3) for the proceedings to be concluded within 6 weeks) is Art. 11(4) which relates specifically only to a defence under Art. 13(b), which this is not. Mr Scott-Manderson was thus unable to derive direct support from Brussels 2 Revised in his efforts to rely on the protective measures available to PM in France.</p>

That this is manifestly not the case is clear from the terms of Art. 11(8) itself, which plainly envisages non-return orders being made. Nonetheless, in my judgment, when one is considering the policy of The Hague Convention in a case where there are active proceeding pending in the court of the child&#8217;s habitual residence, and where that court is plainly seized of all determinative welfare considerations, Art. 11(8) seems to me, at its lowest, a reinforcement of the policy of The Hague Convention, and thus falls to be considered in the exercise of discretion.&#8221;</p>

As identified by Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Vigreux v Michel</span>, there are three provisions in Brussels II Revised whereby the effect of the position under the Hague Convention has been fortified. By Article 11(4) of Brussels 2 Revised, an Article 13(b) Convention defence is precluded if it can be established that adequate arrangements have been made to protect the child after its return. By Article 11(6) and (7), provision is made for return of the case to the requesting state in the event of refusal by the requested state; and by Article 11(8) an order for return subsequently made by the requesting state is automatically enforceable throughout the Union. None of those provisions acts to reduce or qualify the &#8220;at large&#8221; discretion in respect of child&#8217;s objections under Article 13.</p>

However, as it seems to me, the overall nature of the Court&#8217;s task in performing its balancing exercise as between welfare and other Convention considerations remains the same whether or not the Convention case is governed by Brussels 2 Revised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To the extent that the defence of child&#8217;s objections raises welfare issues in this case, the background against which they fall to be considered is this. Before moving to England, the mother was living with the children in a private 3-room flat in Gdynia which had been the matrimonial home; she was paying all the bills and in arrears with the mortgage/rent. In September 2006 she had cashed in a life policy in order to ensure that she kept up her payments. She has kept them up and thus the flat is available to her and the children if an order is made for their return. If that order were made, the mother would return with the children, but at the price of losing the dental practice she has established here which enables her to live well (with the grandmother) and maintain payments on the flat in Gdynia despite the failure of the father to keep up his maintenance payments, and to provide a more affluent lifestyle for the children, including holidays abroad. The father is also living in a 3-roomed flat with his wife and child and is not in regular work. He does not seek the day to day care of the children, but simply to enforce his access rights. Thus, the practical effect of making an order for return will be generally disruptive and damaging to the finances of the family and their standard of living will be much reduced, but the welfare of the children so far as their day to day care and immediate <span style="font-style:italic">physical</span> needs are concerned will not be adversely affected.</p>

As to the first of these, I do not attach substantial weight to their asserted fears of violence on the part of the father. There is a real question mark as to the substance of the allegations and, upon their return to Poland, further contact could be supervised by the Family Court Curator if it appeared necessary. As to the children&#8217;s belief in their father&#8217;s indifference to their departure, while it seems to me that the father&#8217;s delay of 11 months in issuing proceedings and seeking to re-establish contact may well have afforded them some basis for that view, it is not a matter which represents any threat to the children&#8217;s welfare. </p>

Since June 2005 he had been under the supervision of a psychologist from the mental health centre for children and youth at Gdynia, with a preliminary diagnosis of emotional distortion. The view was expressed that his mother had a wrong understanding of his cognitive needs, distorting his social functioning, which led to non-adaptation at school and lack of proper interpersonal skills. She was also said to be unable to co-operate with teachers properly, being a very conflicting person.</p>

So far as K is concerned, under a heading &#8220;Personal, Social and Emotional Development&#8221; he is described as deserving great praise for his hard work at the school, as being a very likeable pupil who has taken part enthusiastically in all that he has done and as having made friends quickly and become a popular member of his class. The view is expressed that he will continue to shine in the future. The mother is described as being supportive of the school, maintaining contact and ensuring that the boys work hard at their lessons. Finally, in the report of the deputy head master it is stated in respect of both children that there have been no reported instances of any problems with their peers nor any issues with either of them in school. Both are said to be happy and thriving at school, joining with other pupils playing football during the lunch break and taking part in extra-curricular activities.</p>

Whilst this cannot be advanced as a &#8220;settlement&#8221; case under article 12, it is clear that, in a case of child&#8217;s objections, unexplained and unexcused delay on the part of an applicant may be treated as a substantial factor in the exercise of the discretion whether or not to make an order for return: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Child Abduction: Delay)</span> [1998] 1 FLR 659H. It is also to be noted that, so far as the children&#8217;s school is concerned, the mother has earned recognition for her helpful attitude as opposed to the condemnation of her interference and regular complaints when the children were being educated at school in Poland. On that basis, in so far as the Polish court had concerns over the children&#8217;s educational progress and relationships with their peers, the grounds for such concern appear to have been resolved by the move to England, albeit the Polish court&#8217;s concerns for the father&#8217;s contact rights and the perceived need of the children for a relationship with their father have been frustrated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Taylor, for the mother, has urged upon me four reasons why, having taken the decision that a potential child&#8217;s objections defence has been established, I should exercise my discretion to decline an order for return. The first is that, although an Article 12 &#8220;settlement&#8221; defence is not available, because of the unexplained delay in the father&#8217;s application the children have effectively settled with success into their English school and new circle of friends. They are happy and doing well in England, whereas they were unhappy and a source of psychological concern in Poland. It would be damaging to disturb that position, particularly in relation to their education, for the reasons outlined by me above. Second, Miss Taylor urges me to accept that the father knew that a move abroad was contemplated and did nothing to prevent it. Third, there were economic factors governing the mother&#8217;s move which were in substantial part due to the father&#8217;s failure to fulfil his maintenance obligations; the move of the mother was designed to ameliorate the position. Fourth, there is a risk of the children running away if an order for their return is made. I shall deal with the first reason last. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to Miss Taylor&#8217;s second reason, while I am suspicious of the father&#8217;s failure to address the assertion of the children to Miss Weydert that he knew a move to England was contemplated, I am not confident that he was in fact so aware. The mother certainly did not to tell him, but only instructed her solicitor to inform the Court of her address after her departure As to the third reason, it does indeed appear that the father was in breach of his obligations of maintenance. That does not of course justify the change of residence by the mother without consulting the father or making an application to the Polish court in the absence of agreement, but it contributed to the strong economic reasons for her move to England where she has the opportunity to earn far more as a dentist in order to support the family. However, while she was apparently having some difficulty financially in Poland, there is no sufficient evidence that she could not manage and, again, she could and should have had resort to the Polish court. So far as the fourth reason is concerned, I do not doubt the sincerity of the children&#8217;s assertion that they would contemplate running away if an order for return is made. Nor do I doubt that such assertion emphasises their preference for life in England. However, while I consider that they would be deeply distressed to be ordered back to Poland I do not think that they would in fact run away as they have threatened. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I return to the first, and by far the weightiest, welfare consideration. It is plain that the period since the children&#8217;s removal has been a critical 14 months in their lives and their development for the reasons summarised by me at paragraph 73 above. They are now old enough to have formed their own firm views and have valid reasons for their objections to return to Poland quite independently of their mother&#8217;s views. It appears that their very considerable psychological and educational difficulties in Poland have been happily resolved by their move to England, and the period over which their objections to return have developed and hardened are in large measure the product of the father&#8217;s unexplained delay in pursuing his Convention remedy. In those circumstances, in the exercise of the discretion afforded to me under Article 13, I decline to make an order for the return of the children to Poland.</p>

The order I propose to make, is in no way a reflection upon the careful attention given to this case by the Polish Court. However, as I have made clear, my decision is based upon my conclusion that for these intelligent children, whose views must carry increasing weight with their increasing age, matters have significantly changed for the better since the matter was last before the Polish court and there are strong welfare grounds not to order their return. To make such an order would be to uproot, contrary to their wishes and objections, from a situation of happiness, security and educational progress over the last 14 months and to return them to a place and general situation where it is clear that they felt unhappy, emotionally disturbed and unable properly to relate to their peers. That being so, I propose to order  dismissal of the father&#8217;s originating summons.</p>
