It sought to prevent the girls and the baby from leaving Ukraine. It referred to my order of 27 April 2018 and said that I had dismissed the mother's relocation application for "unclear reasons". It asserted that were the children to leave the Ukraine it would make "my communication with grandchildren and their upbringing impossible" without mentioning that his own son is at boarding school here and that he has a visa allowing him to visit this country. <span style="font-weight:bold">On any view it was a thoroughly misleading application. </span>It was returned to him on the 16 August 2018 and no injunction was ever granted on the application while it existed.  </p>

It is true that he made similar allegations in the relocation proceedings which I dismissed in my judgment of 27 April 2018. The situation now is very different. The mother has shown herself to have no respect whatever for the rule of law and MGF has been shown to have easily made untrue and misleading applications to the Ukrainian court.

It has been suggested that MGF might be charged with an offence under section 2 in that he has taken or detained the children in Ukraine without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. It has also been suggested that the mother might be charged with the offence of conspiracy to commit an offence under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/37/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref>.

If a positive decision is made, then an application to Ukraine to extradite the mother and MGF would have to be made as it seems vanishingly unlikely that they will present themselves here voluntarily. Lord Macdonald QC explained that in his experience extradition proceedings in Ukraine would take years, particularly having regard to the prominence of MGF. Therefore, he described the spectre of future criminal proceedings against the mother and MGF as being both extremely distant and, as he put it, &#8220;utterly contingent&#8221;. His simple submission was that something that is so far distant and utterly contingent cannot ever be described as &#8220;pending or imminent&#8221;. </p>
