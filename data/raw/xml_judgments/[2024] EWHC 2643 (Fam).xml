It was at the first meeting he said that he would be really upset if the judge said he had to return to Singapore.  However, even at the first meeting he spoke positively about Singapore.  At the second meeting, after his operation, he was keen to not be responsible for any decision about where he was going to live.  In the words of her report he said, &#8216;that after all that he has been through, it is too hard a decision for him&#8217;.  What he wanted was for his parents still to be together.</span></p>

It is not properly an objection to going back to Singapore but a fear, given what he has been told by his father, that his father will be sent to prison if he were to return to Singapore.  </span></p>

He does say that the flats would be slow to liquidate, but I am given no idea in the statement as to the rental return on them, or any facility that he might have to borrow using them as security.  I have since heard from Mr Hames in his submissions, to much the same effect.  Save I am told that the father has encashed an ISA and borrowed from his father to fund his substantial legal fees, and that the properties are mortgage free.  As to the German property the managing agent has disappeared, and no rent is being paid.  The father believes squatters are in the property.  As to the London property he has given notice to the tenant with a view to sell the property.  It is not known how long it will take to raise borrowing against the property and the father had not yet made any enquires in relation to such borrowing.</span></p>
