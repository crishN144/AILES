	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is my judgment in respect of the discrete point on costs which arose at the end of the formal handing down of my judgment on the leave application made by the Applicant to bring proceedings in this court following earlier proceeding in Malaysia. It is concerned, inter alia, with the interplay between Family Procedure Rule (FPR) 2.3 and FPR 28.3 (4) (b) (ii) and which should take precedence. I should make it clear that this judgment does not go beyond that preliminary issue and should not be taken as indicative or binding in any way as to my eventual decision as to where the costs should lie or if an order is to made at all (as to which I am satisfied I retain an unfettered discretion see paragraphs 13 and 29 below).</p>

Unhelpfully, I had not seen Mr Bickerdike&#8217;s skeleton until this was drawn to my attention during the hearing. This does not reflect on him at all - it had clearly been provided in time but it meant that I was presented with what both counsel agreed was a novel point of law at short notice. I needed further time to reflect hence this written judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">When preparing the case before the hearing and without the benefit of Mr Bickerdike&#8217;s skeleton this seemed uncontentious. However, Mr Bickerdike has properly drawn my attention to the provisions of FPR rule 28.3 (4) (b) (ii). He prays this in aid to resist the clean sheet approach and the admission of without prejudice or open correspondence. There is, of course the more fundamental issue which he then identifies at paragraphs 6 (iii) of the submissions as to the application of the 28.3 regime such that my starting point should be covered by the &#8220;general rule in financial remedy proceedings&#8221; that the court will not make an order requiring one party to pay the costs of another.</p>

Instead, Miss Barrons, in particular, has referred to various academic texts which, she says, support her position. Otherwise, it appears, I am in uncharted territory. My own research has not thrown up a case on the point.</p>

I referred Counsel to what may be regarded as a contrary position in Financial Remedies Practice. I also referred to the commentary in Jackson&#8217;s Matrimonial Finance (such as it is) and subsequently I have also reviewed the commentary in the Dictionary of Financial Remedies and Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory Interpretation . If Counsel feel the need to address me on any authority, not mentioned during the hearing, then they may do so at the handing down of this judgment and I will be open to the reconsideration of the same.</p>

The courts are ever mindful that their constitutional role in this field is interpretative. They must abstain from any course which might have the appearance of judicial legislation. A statute is expressed in language approved and enacted by the legislature. So the courts exercise considerable caution before adding or omitting or substituting words. Before interpreting a statute in this way the court must be abundantly sure of three matters: (1) the intended purpose of the statute or provision in question; (2) that by inadvertence the draftsman and Parliament failed to give effect to that purpose in the provision in question; and (3) the substance of the provision Parliament would have made, although not necessarily the precise words Parliament would have used, had the error in the Bill been noticed. The third of these conditions is of crucial importance. Otherwise any attempt to determine the meaning of the enactment would cross the boundary between construction and legislation&#8230;</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">It may be thought that the competing &#8220;pros and cons&#8221; are balanced. However, it remains that there has been a mistake in the rules as they in conflict with each other, and this uncertainty could never have been intended. I therefore turn to the analysis in Bennion. The starting point is a presumption that the legislature intends the court to apply a construction which rectifies any error in the drafting of the enactment, where required in order to give effect to the legislative intention. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in">Taking as my starting point the definition of &#8220;financial remedy&#8221; under FPR 2.3 the drafter considered the orders which were available under Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> and went on to specifically exclude leave applications under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref>.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.3in">Turning then to FPR28.3 (4) (ii): this appears to have been drafted with less thought simply encompassing, as it does, the whole of Part III of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>. I am satisfied that the intended purpose of the legislation is that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 13</ref> was to be excluded because this required a conscious decision to draft the exception in that way. Clearly this was not considered when drafting FPR28.3 (4) (ii) as otherwise the exception would have been repeated. In my judgment it could not have been the intention of the rules committee having created a specific exception that this could then be thrown into doubt by another and incompatible &#8220;all-encompassing&#8221; definition. In my judgement FPR28.3 (4) (ii) is the provision in error and, applying the threefold test in <span style="font-style:italic">Inco Europe Ltd v First Choice Distribution:</span></p>
