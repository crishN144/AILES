The application was made six months ago, by notice dated 23 January 2023. As F is not Michael&#8217;s father, he needs permission to apply for an order in respect of Michael.

I vacated the hearing on 21 June administratively; on 3 July 2023 I held a short hearing to deal with participation directions for this hearing, and to find out from the prison when the matter could be listed. To reduce delay, I accommodated a hearing in this matter the day after. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The children have lived with M for their whole lives. For the past five years, they have had no direct or indirect contact with F. In 2018, F was convicted of a murder, and sentenced by a senior judge to life imprisonment, with a minimum tariff of over 20 years. Since then, F has been at a maximum-security prison, a Category A prison, and a Category B prison in England. Save for one visit with Michael at a Category A prison, whilst on remand, the children have had nothing to do with F for this whole period. Indeed, Lawrence was a matter of weeks old when F was sentenced to life imprisonment. </p>

She tells me that F has had several threats on his life whilst in prison for this reason. I do not have the evidence to determine this, however, such was the extent of concern about M and the children, the police issued an &#8216;Osman Warning&#8217; in respect of the family. This is also known as a &#8216;Threat to Life Notice&#8217; and is reserved for cases where there is some basis of a threat being made to the subject&#8217;s life, in this case M and her children. She told me at this hearing that, although her safety is no longer an acute worry, she continues to live in fear of reprisal. </p>

The fact that a parent is in prison is not in any way a bar to contact taking place, as long as it accords with the children&#8217;s best interests, and is safe for the children concerned. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Cafcass has provided a very detailed safeguarding letter in this case, dated 2 May 2023. The letter runs to five pages, including two pages of analysis and recommendations. The key points of analysis are as follows:</p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;Michael, Lawrence and David have not seen [F] for a significant length of time. David and Lawrence would have been very young and are unlikely to have any memories of their father. Michael has a biological father who he has a relationship with and [M] reports that he has never seen [F] in a parent role. [M] also reports that her and [F] never lived together, and [F] involvement in the children&#8217;s lives was only very limited.</span></p>

[M] also talks about [F] links to gangs which would increase the potential risk of retaliation or revenge attacks and could put the children and [M] at risk of harm if [F] is still affiliated with gangs or is still at risk of retaliation from his victim&#8217;s associates.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic">[M] has raised domestic abuse as an issue which will need consideration. She alleges that [F] was very controlling towards her throughout their relationship, and he made serious threats to harm her and her family. Given [F] conviction it is important to take [M] allegations seriously and to consider how any communication between the children and [F] could potentially increase the risk of further domestic abuse. Practice direction 12J is relevant as a result of these allegations. Given that [F] already has a conviction for murder and is currently in prison, a fact-finding hearing is not necessary.&#8221;</span></p>

I am told by M in the safeguarding letter that Michael has a relationship with his own father and a clear idea of his identity. It cannot be said that F has assumed the role of parent or had any responsibility for J since he has been in prison. Although this is to be expected on a practical level, F has made little to no effort (save for an initial letter) to maintain a relationship with J.

M has purposely not shared the reason why with Michael, and does not consider that Michael is resilient or mature enough to understand this yet. M described in submissions how settled J was in his new life. This is in stark contrast to the trauma J suffered aged 7: he was acutely aware of the loss of F from the family set-up, he saw his primary care giver experience distress as a result of the circumstances around F&#8217;s arrest and imprisonment, and he experienced upheaval as the family effectively started again with every aspect of their lives. I consider there to be a risk of jeopardising the precious but fragile safety and security which Michael has found over the past few years, and that such a risk arises through both giving permission to apply and appointing a reporting officer to discuss F with Michael, or indeed the risk of any eventual order for contact. Either seems to be disruptive for Michael. </p>

I must consider the checklist factors, but in particular the effect of a change of circumstances, and any harm Michael might suffer. In considering this, I weigh both the risk to Michael&#8217;s emotional safety which I have outlined, but also to M&#8217;s emotional safety as a process of assessment etc is ongoing. I cannot separate M and Michael artificially, and I must consider the effect of disruption on M as Michael&#8217;s primary caregiver.

Everything that conduces to a child's welfare and happiness or relates to the child's development and present and future life as a human being, including the child's familial, educational and social environment, and the child's social, cultural, ethnic and religious community, is potentially relevant and has, where appropriate, to be taken into account.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is incumbent on me to adopt a relational approach. This means looking not only at the children in a vacuum, but in their home environment and therefore their primary carer. Aged 7 and 5, those things are inseparable. The effect of proceedings alone is having a negative effect on M. M was in significant danger in 2017 as a direct result of F&#8217;s criminality, and was subjected to the ordeal of moving her life away from her home. I am entirely satisfied that the continuation of proceedings, and the inevitable assessments and further hearings that will follow, would be destructive to M and her own wellbeing. Although F suggests that M can be insulated from this by involving the paternal family in journeys, contact in effect would be significantly more involved than just a journey. David and Lawrence at present do not know who their father is; they do not know that he is in prison, nor why he is in prison. David and Lawrence will require a sensitive explanation of their life story and surroundings, and emotional support in preparing for and meeting F for the first time in their living memory. This is a high level of emotional support that I consider would be destructive to M, and therefore to the children. In addition, I place some weight on the fact that M has made allegations of serious domestic abuse against F, and such an arrangement opens the possibility of contact being used in an abusive way. Whilst I make no findings on M&#8217;s serious allegations, and in light of the risks in this case I do not consider it proportionate to embark on this road, I simply note that this is a potential risk that I cannot and should not ignore. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What of the children? In my view, confronting the children with their own life story, and introducing to them to F, will, at this stage, cause them distress. The likelihood is that, even with modest levels of contact as requested by F, F will have little to do with the children in any meaningful sense. F will be in prison for the entirety of the children&#8217;s minority. He will be unable to play a full part in their lives until they are well over 18 years of age. At present, in my view, I am therefore being asked to risk the children&#8217;s own emotional safety for the sake of a low level of intermittent involvement with F. I do not think it is appropriate at David&#8217;s and Lawrence&#8217;s tender age to explain to them the reasons why M took the decisions she has responsibly done. At the very least, it will scare them. At worst, learning about their history will be traumatic. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I must also have regard to the conflict between M and F. Quite obviously both M and F have differing views about the extent to which the children should be involved with F, and in particular the parents disagree on the extent of the risk to M&#8217;s and the children&#8217;s safety. F wanted to use some of the court hearing to speak directly to M and discuss this approach. Although I did not allow it, it was clear that there was a level of conflict, and F&#8217;s perspective is radically different to M&#8217;s perspective. Exposure to this conflict would in my view be harmful to the children&#8217;s welfare, particularly as some discussion between F and the children about him missing from their lives seems to be inevitable. </p>

Even if what F told me about there being no gang element is true, and that he hoped to both appeal his conviction and sentence to recognise that the incident was &#8220;self-defence&#8221;, I cannot ignore the fact that both the police and children's services assisted M in moving her life away from F following the Threat to Life Notice.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In addition, both children have suffered harm. The father&#8217;s offending has caused the children emotional harm. By reason of his criminality, he has disappeared from living memory for both children, who are missing an important figure from their childhoods. They have had to move and lost important relationships in the process. M described living a private life away from F; I am entirely satisfied that as a result of F&#8217;s criminality, M and the children will live a lower key childhood than they otherwise would have done. I do not consider at present, without a significant amount of intervention and age appropriate work, that direct contact would begin to address this harm. </p>

I highly doubt that a &#8216;contact day&#8217; is an appropriate forum for any contact between F and the children. I imagine that any contact would need to be on a one-to-one basis. This would require the children being brought to prison and, like other visitors, having to go through searches and subject to delay. This would be an unpleasant experience for the children, and may be a source of harm. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Drawing the threads of my analysis together, I am of the firm view that direct contact between F and the children is contrary to their best interests. There are few advantages, and many significant, serious disadvantages to contemplate. When I weigh those factors, I am led to the conclusion that direct contact is not appropriate in this case now or in the short to medium term. I cannot see any form of safeguard in direct or indirect contact that would guard against risks of such magnitude. Even in respect of indirect contact, the risks associated with creating such contact remain identical: the children must know who they are writing to, and why they are having to engage in this way. Likewise, indirect contact sent from F to the children would require a level of vetting and support that is simply unavailable to M at this time. </p>

He would like this to be accompanied by photographs. M did not oppose this in principle, but raised concerns in submissions that F had access to social media in prison (although this is not allowed) and therefore might share images of the children on Facebook or another platform. Ms Burke from PACT kindly offered to act as an intermediary to ensure that photographs were well looked after, and were used only for the father to see his children grow and develop alongside the updates. This has the advantage of respecting F&#8217;s role as the children&#8217;s biological father but insulating the children entirely from F and the risks that I have identified. M considered that she would be able to do this on a very occasional basis, and it would not undermine her own emotional wellbeing that is so important to the children. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">There is no evidence that the risks that I have identified would soften or change in the short to medium term. Any assessment of the true risk of reprisals from associates of F depends on a level of honesty that I simply cannot rely upon from F, particularly in circumstances where F plainly still does not accept his conviction. This itself presents an issue: F effectively protested his innocence at this hearing. Five years on, however, he remains convicted. He has not been given permission to appeal either his sentence or his conviction. </p>

In circumstances where F does not accept his conviction, I do not see how any remedial or therapeutic work about his offending could have been effective. I must therefore be cautious about F&#8217;s ability to interact with the children in a way that safeguards against any risk he may be assessed as posing. </p>

There are two things to say about this. First that this is subject to there being some solid advantage to continuing; this is a case where I have examined the benefits and risks to the children of setting off down the proverbial road at a preliminary stage, and have found that those risks fundamentally outweigh the benefits. Second, for the reasons I have explained, I am able at this early stage to form a holistic welfare analysis and I do not consider there to be any benefit to additional evidence when it simply cannot overcome the hurdles I have identified in terms of harm to the children that may come from any other form of order. </p>

Prison governors have their own responsibilities under Children Act 2004 and other statutory schemes. As noted by Macdonald J, National Offender Management Service Public Protection Manual 2016 stipulates at paragraph 3.2 of Chapter 5c, entitled Child Contact Procedures, that: <span style="font-style:italic">"The Governor (or senior manager with suitable delegated authority) is ultimately responsible for making an assessment of what, if any, level of contact should be permitted.&#8221;</span> Although I have the power to make an Order, ultimately the implementation of that Order &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">is subject to, and cannot displace, the statutory powers of the Secretary of State for Justice to operate the prison system, including communications between serving prisoners and outside persons and, in this case, the management and assessment of the risk posed by serious offenders.</span><span style="color:#000000">&#8221; There is therefore significant doubt about the utility of this process in any event. </span></p>
