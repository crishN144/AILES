A&#8217;s capacity to make relevant decisions on conducting the proceedings in respect of residence, care, and contact are disputed, as is the validity of the Lasting Power of Attorney for health and welfare matters, executed in January 2018, which as I have indicated was revoked until the final hearing by interim order dated 18 October 2019. The first attended hearing was on 18 April 2018 when the official solicitor was appointed to act as litigation friend for A. Interim declarations were made and the NHS trust was joined as a party to the proceedings. Dr Ince was directed to provide an independent psychiatric assessment in respect of A. On 13 August, the court gave permission to Dr Ince to report on A&#8217;s capacity to execute the Last Power of Attorney dated 4 January 2018 and purportedly executed by A at a time when she had capacity. </span></p>

Further the court revoked the LPA pursuant to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/22/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.22(4)</ref>(b) and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/48" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.48</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> until the determination of the issues at the hearing fixed to commence on 5 March 2019. I am told that the proceedings were issued by reason of the Local Authority&#8217;s concerns that A was failing to engage with healthcare and other professionals possibly due to B&#8217;s undue influence in consequence of which A was not receiving the appropriate or any treatment for her physical health conditions. The consensus opinion of the professionals involved was and remains that without appropriate treatment, A was at serious risk of health complications, including increased seizures, osteoporosis, fracture risk, and cardiovascular disease. </span></p>

A has significant health needs associated with epilepsy and primary-ovarian failure. She has been resistant to treatment plans, particularly in relation to the latter diagnosis.

He sets out that on 13 September 2017, A was admitted to the Hospital assessment suite following reportedly experiencing more than ten generalized clonic seizures at home over the last 24 hours. This had been reported to the GP. B previously routinely reported seizure activity experience to the GP as a matter of course. On this occasion, the doctor insisted on seeing A despite B saying A did not want to see a doctor. The GP had not seen A since 2011. The doctor visited A and advised that an ambulance be called. B was very reluctant to let the crew take A to hospital. The GP had also written a letter for the crew to take to the hospital outlining her concerns. This letter included details of A&#8217;s apparent decision not to transfer to adult neurology for follow up reviews of epilepsy and medication and that she had not been seen since discharge to adult services in 2016. B is reported to have advised that A made the decision, though whether A had capacity to make the decision is unclear.</span></p>

She said she had two friends, one called Hannah. I asked how she knew her. She said her mum had gone to school with her mum. She said they sometimes go to the shopping centre together. The other friend was one she had previously discussed with the psychologist. She told me that she had been to a party at her house once. I explained that at 18, a lot of young adults were moving on, some went to university and got a flat.

It was notable that she repeatedly referred to her pink folder of handwritten notes and her responses were concrete in nature with a lack of cognitive plasticity or an inability to extrapolate from one situation to another. It is my opinion that A displays an ability to understand the basic aspects of the current Court of Protection proceedings and that, with the aid of written notes, is similarly able to retain certain information. I believe there are significant deficits within her underpinning knowledge and understanding of terminology such that the responses she gives are, to a degree, rote learned. I do not believe that she is able to independently appreciate the gravity of the current situation or form a view such that this can be communicated to her legal representative in a manner that demonstrates she is able to appropriately weigh the information with which she has been provided. It is clear that she places universally exclusive weight to the views and opinions of her mother and grandparents and cannot appraise whether these are correct or further accept that there may be an alternative view. It was notable that at points where questions were raised that she did not have a pre-prepared answer for, she appeared particularly stuck and perplexed. Based upon the responses that she has given, the absence of true understanding</span><span class="legds" style="text-decoration-line:line-through">,</span><span class="legds"> and retention of said information, and an inability to independently weigh the information, it is my view that A lacks capacity to litigate within the current Court of Protection proceedings. I would furthermore add that A&#8217;s lack of capacity to litigate is directly associated with her underlying mental disorders and that these compound her ability to appropriately appraise information given to her such that there is clear evidence that she is subject to undue influence of B. This view is based upon the responses of A at interview and the provided collateral information and general practice records, with the latter documenting the minimal contact between A and her general practitioners, arguably to her broader detriment.&#8221;</span></p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="legclearfix" style="margin-left:1.5in">&#8220;A is somewhat quiet and reticent in her general demeanour. However, in terms of core intellectual functioning, she has the ability at a verbal and non-verbal level to engage with the conceptual content of a variety of environmental experiences and stimuli to learn new ways and develop her adaptive skills in a variety of learning, recreational, and social environments. In the context of the need for clarification as to her intellectual capacity to understand the rationale and implications of giving Lasting Power of Attorney to a significant adult, in this current context her mother, B, I am of the opinion, therefore, that A does have sufficient core cognitive capacity to make a well enough informed decision in this regard. Notwithstanding this, however, she does have significant and specific weaknesses in working memory and processing speed and there is evidence that her competencies in reading accuracy, spelling, speed, and accuracy of her written expression are not as functional as they might be and certainly well below the level that would be predicted on the basis of her core intellectual abilities. The above evidence suggests a combination of elements consistent with a dyslexic profile, the main implications being that she is likely to benefit from help to achieve a higher level of efficiency and confidence when processing information, and when expressing her ideas in written form.&#8221;</p>

I further note the longstanding barriers that have been put in place between A and any health professionals by B. Overall, the evidence clearly shows that A does not truly understand the information relating to her health conditions or the longer-term implications of non-compliance. I do not believe that she understands the risk of SUDEP. I would also note that the one view that she has articulated, although I do not believe that it is her own, as to wanting to change her antiepileptic medication, was contradicted by B at a point wherein A was presumed to lack capacity and  thus was either not in her best interests or did not take her views into account.&#8221;</span></p>

He accepted it was unusual for a 19-year-old to want to appoint an attorney. He saw A and B together and said it was quite usual to see the donor and donee together. The focus was on medical issues.

The oral evidence of Mr Miller does raise concern as to just how vigorously, if at all, he investigated the position. He saw B and A together. He did not enquire into A&#8217;s medical history although aware of her hospital admission and diagnosis of epilepsy, and bearing in mind the appointment was only of 30 minutes&#8217; duration and he says within it he discussed it being unwise to have only one attorney and also discussed revoking it, it is questionable whether Mr Miller was able to consider the necessary salient factors in respect of capacity. It is, of course, easy to be critical with hindsight and with the information now available to the court. However, I find Mr Miller did not sufficiently question whether or not A had capacity or attempt to avail himself of the necessary information to conduct an adequate assessment of A&#8217;s capacity to understand, retain, and weigh the information relevant to the decision to execute the LPA. There is cogent evidence to suggest A did not have capacity to execute the LPA at the relevant time and thus, the LPA is not valid and I make a declaration under s.15 to that effect.</span></p>

A scan was reported showing that neither the uterus or ovaries could be delineated within the pelvic cavity. Dr X said that this finding was not unexpected as the ovaries and gonadal dysgenesis are often invisible on a standard scan and the prepubertal uterus can be so small as to be invisible on a standard transabdominal scan. Unfortunately, B and thus A perceive that they have been lied to by the medical personnel and have been reluctant to accept Dr X&#8217;s expertise in regard to these matters and thus have continued to express the view that they must seek further opinion. </span></p>

There are fortunately just too few individuals with congenital hypogonadism coming to expert medical attention late in life who have never gone through puberty for there to be any kind of systemic study. However, experts across the world do talk to each other and discuss their more difficult cases and there is universal expert consensus that these individuals are deeply unhappy, have not led fulfilling lives, are socially isolated, have major issues of body image and self-esteem, and have a marked degree of alienation from the rest of society. They have great difficulty in forming physical relationships and, indeed, penetrative sexual intercourse, is extremely uncomfortable for any untreated hypogonadal woman. In my own clinical experience, I have taken a male or female patient aged over 40 through puberty around once every one or  two years. None of them have expressed any regrets about going through this process. All were extremely pleased to have undergone puberty and all had significant regret at not having done so earlier. Neither I nor any colleagues has hitherto encountered an individual who truly, of their own free will, did not wish to go through puberty or whose parents did not wish them to go through puberty.&#8221;</span></p>

These types of fracture rarely occur in normal women under the age of 60 and their peak instance is in old age, 80-plus. Whereas wrist and hip fractures only occur with trauma, e.g. falls, osteoporotic vertebral stress fractures typically occur spontaneously, leading to chronic backpain and progressive spinal deformity, potentially even with impairment of lung volumes should a pronounced kyphosis develop. Hence, vertebral fractures are associated with increased mortality from respiratory disease, among other things. Statistics show that a third of men and women who undergo fracture neck or femur, which is one of the more severe osteoporotic fractures, are dead within a year and one third never return to their pre-fracture physical and social function. Spine crush fractures are around 10 percent more common than fractured neck or femur in patients with osteoporosis. A is therefore at a significant risk of sustaining at least one spinal crush fracture before aged 50 - 60. These are not only painful in themselves, they lead to secondary arthritis, with further increasing pain and the resulting spinal deformity results in loss of lung volume. The nearly 50 percent increased relative risk of death associated with vertebral fractures largely seems to arise from an excess of respiratory diseases which may arise from impaired lung function to thoracic deformity. </span></p>

In a study of some 2,500 older women, 28 percent reported early menopause before the age of 46 years, either one that occurred naturally or as a result of surgical removal of their ovaries. These women had significantly worse coronary heart disease and stroke free survival. This effect was independent of additional cardiovascular risk factors. So it is clear that having premature loss of sex hormones predisposed to increased rate of death through stroke and cardiovascular disease. What cannot be known for sure because the studies are simply impossible is whether lack of exposure to oestrogen whatsoever during one&#8217;s lifespan will make this situation even worse. However, in my view, and that of other international experts in the field, that is a pretty safe assumption.&#8221;</span></p>

A is more than a year on since Dr X explained the necessity for treatment and no treatment has commenced.

Thus, the prospect that B will in the future support her daughter and positively encourage her to engage with the treatment must be extremely limited. Sadly, it is difficult to reach any conclusion other than B would prefer A not to &#8220;grow up&#8221; for want of a better description, that she would prefer A to remain the same, dependent upon her mother, and isolated within her mother's sphere without any outside influence or interference.</span></p>

Dr Y also stated that A&#8217;s current epilepsy medication can lead to lifelong issues. In his oral evidence, Dr Y confirmed that the proposed alternative medication is very stable and in terms of side effects, there was a very small chance of irritability. Undertaking a balance sheet approach as prayed in aid by Mr Karim within his final submissions, the advantages included reduced risk of osteoarthritis, and effectiveness and increased monitoring of seizures.

I anticipate that B would have difficulty and thus A would have difficulty working with any social worker who challenged B&#8217;s attitude, views, or behaviour. B does not trust Dr X. The evidence of the meetings between the social worker and A before she went into Placement A demonstrated a lack of willingness to engage and B's continuing influence over  B. The evidence before me, although disputed by B, is that A has coped remarkably well in her new living situation and has been engaging well with staff and has developed good relationships with them, particularly a staff member called Kelly. A has been sleeping and eating well. In his attendance note of 2 May, A&#8217;s solicitor Mr B confirmed that while A still expressed a wish to go home, she had no complaints about Care Home One and found the staff helpful. Kelly, with whom A, it seems, has developed a good relationship, informed Mr B that A had begun to become quite chatty with her. Overall, the evidence from the local authority, albeit disputed by B, is that A is benefitting from the care and support at Placement A and is doing well. </span></p>

Her enmeshed relationship with her mother is longstanding and established behaviours will take time to alter and B&#8217;s influence diminish. A deserves and requires the opportunity to experience life as an independent adult with proper support. Sadly, I find it will not occur if she remains living with her mother at the present time.
