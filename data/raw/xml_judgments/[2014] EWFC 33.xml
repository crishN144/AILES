Mr and Mrs C are dead. X died in 2011. X&#8217;s daughter, Y, the applicant before me, seeks access to the original court file, which has been located, and which I have read. Her purpose is to discover more about X&#8217;s birth mother. Who was she? What part of the country did X come from?</p>

Judge Wildblood directed that, subject to my agreement, the application should be listed before me during the week commencing 30 June 2014.

Second, it provided that notice of the application was to be given to the Registrar General in accordance with rule 19.2 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010. Third, it invited the Official Solicitor to identify an <span style="font-style:italic">amicus curiae</span> (advocate to the court).</p>

Z is now dead. Y says that she has always believed that X was in some way related to Z and speculates that perhaps another of Mrs C&#8217;s siblings was X&#8217;s mother. Her statement suggests that, if given the information she seeks, Y would try to make contact with X&#8217;s birth relatives, for she says &#8220;If I were to be successful I would be happy to have an intermediary to make contact with birth relatives.&#8221;</p>

He said, &#8220;The Registrar General submits that, from a public policy perspective, it is vital that the statutory code governing access to information is not undermined or circumvented by reliance on secondary legislation. If the Rules provide a free-standing or alternative means to access information outside the statutory machinery, it would be wrong in principle to apply a different and lower threshold than &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221;.&#8221;   </p>

That was an application by an adopted child for judicial review of the decision of an adoption agency refusing her access to some of her adoption records. The claimant had been adopted in 1948. She discovered the identity of her birth parents in the 1970s, met her birth mother and remained in regular contact until the mother&#8217;s death. Her birth father had died before she located him. Both her adoptive parents had died. The adoption agency, which had already given her some of the material in the adoption file, was not prepared to give her that part of the file relating to the adopters or the birth parents. </p>

It is now recognised that many adopted people wish to have information about their history and background including the reasons for their adoption.

A very important, perhaps crucial, consideration in this case is the long passage of time since the adoption order was made. This, plus the fact that none of the relevant people other than the claimant is still alive, suggests that there is little if any purpose in maintaining confidentiality from the viewpoint of those who imparted the information. Balanced against this is the genuine interest to the claimant in receiving the information. Viewed on this basis it seems to me that the scales would be likely to come down firmly in favour of disclosure.</p>

Clearly it would be unsatisfactory were public confidence in the integrity of confidential information supplied during the adoption process to be undermined. Obviously great care is needed before confidential records are disclosed. The problem is not a new one. It is not uncommon for a balance to have to be struck between disclosure and maintaining a confidence &#8230; </p>
