	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">In early 2018, there was a hearing which lasted some eleven days, and which took place before Baker J, as he then was, to determine financial remedy applications, following the breakdown of a long marriage between the husband and the wife.  In the course of a very long judgment, dated 4 September 2018, the judge was very critical of the husband's disclosure, and he found part of the husband's case to be a fiction, and that he had concealed from the court the extent of his business activities and resources. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">That said, the judge accepted that the husband's development projects in London and the French Riviera had run into difficulties, which affected their profitability.  He also found that the husband had spent money on himself in a cavalier fashion, and was well able to afford the orders for maintenance pending suit and legal services, which had been made at an earlier stage of the proceedings, in a total sum of &#163;40,000 a month, and which had been largely ignored by the husband. </p>

First, procedurally:  The parties have adopted before me the same stance as they adopted at the abortive hearing before Holman J in July 2019, when he found halfway through the case that he had to recuse himself because of a previous involvement.  I made it clear to the husband at the outset of the case that he need not answer any questions that might incriminate him, or indeed that he could choose not to give evidence at all on the judgment summons.  He has chosen to give evidence on all matters, and to answer without any reservation all questions put to him. </p>

She must prove to the criminal standard of proof that (1) the husband had the means to pay the sums due under the order, and (2) that he has refused or neglected to pay them. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.92in;margin-right:0.07in;text-indent:0in">4 September 2018, the date from which he was due to make the monthly payments of &#163;10,000 per month in advance, he paid nothing until June 2019, after the summons was issued.  It is common ground, as it has to be, that he should have paid thirteen payments of &#163;10,000, that is &#163;130,000, and in fact has paid a total of &#163;12,500.  That is &#163;2,500 in June, &#163;5,000 in August, and &#163;5,000 in September.  And therefore, he is &#163;117,500 in arrears. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">The issue is whether I am satisfied so that I am sure that he has had the means to pay the sum due.  Although, as I will set out, there are other money payment orders which he is in breach of, the statement that the wife provided pursuant to the order of Williams J specifies only the arrears in respect of maintenance.  I say "only"; that is putting to one side a complaint about a very small costs order, which it is unnecessary for me to go into.  And she says correctly in that statement that the husband at that time was in arrears to the tune of &#163;107,500, and he is now in arrears to the tune of a further &#163;10,000. </p>

And says Ms Hay, on behalf of the husband, if the court confines itself to that issue, the husband takes no procedural points (if there are any to be taken) in respect of the judgment summons proceedings. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">I have not been asked to adjourn the judgment summons until after the hearing of the application to vary, but even if that course had been pressed on me, I would not have acceded to it.  The husband's application to vary is unsupported by any evidence.  It was issued just four months after the order of Baker J was approved, in circumstances when, on his own case, he had income which he did not have before (albeit not very much more), and with no argument put to me that there has been any change in his circumstances for the worse.  It would in the circumstances of this case be a serious injustice to the wife if I was to adjourn or stay her application for a judgment summons. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">The husband has sought to defend the judgment summons on two grounds.  The first is that he says he should be given credit for &#163;81,000 from what he says is his share of the proceeds of sale of a painting that was sold in November 2017.  In my judgment that is a hopeless argument.  Baker J was fully aware of the issues surrounding the sale of the painting and its proceeds, which of course arose before he even commenced the financial remedy trial.  He declined to adjust his award to reflect that.  I cannot see how the application of the monies which the parties received following the sale of a painting in November 2017 can possibly affect the husband's liability to make payments under an order of September 2018.  He says he was advised by lawyers that he could claim credit for that.  I simply say that no properly informed lawyer could have given that advice. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">His second argument is that he could not afford to pay.  I am satisfied so that I am sure that is not the case.  True as always, his income has been limited.  He is at the stage of development of two properties with completion variously in 2020 and 2021, and with a third now on the market for sale.  A property developer's income is never constant, and indeed sometimes not actually received at all.  Baker J found, on a civil standard, that the husband had the ability to pay &#163;10,000 per month, and of course since then his income has improved.  But that does not absolve me from examining the issue to a criminal standard. </p>

First, I look at what he has actually and obviously had available in the time in issue, that is since September 2018.  He says he received something in the region of &#163;100,000 from the sale of watches.  He says that he has received rather over &#163;40,000 from his share of the development of a property in Holland Park, and about the same sum again by way of consultancy income.  He has also received financial assistance from a gentleman referred to in the judgment as "Mr X" to meet obligations in respect of the French properties, but in my judgment that particular source of income takes matters no further, because of the particular circumstances relating to it.  But there are resources that he had which would have permitted him to pay in full, albeit leaving relatively little for himself <span style="font-style:italic">if</span>, and I stress the word "if", those were his only resources. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.9in;margin-right:0.07in">But perhaps a better guide is to be gained from looking at his expenditure over the period.  He has expended &#163;8,100 a month on the rental of a flat in prime central London.  That flat was one that he chose to rent, and unnecessarily retained, even though he has now given notice, when he already owned a flat, albeit a small one, nearby, which was available to him through the period, albeit it is now in receivership.  Secondly, he has chosen to provide for his children at a level significantly in excess of what was ordered.  He was ordered to pay &#163;3,000 per month for the youngest child of the family, the son to whom I have already referred, but in addition to whatever he has been paying him, he has been paying without any order requiring payment a very substantial sum to the daughter of the parties.  He paid &#163;30,000 to his solicitors in the period.  He paid &#8364;46,000 towards the expenses of the French properties, albeit with borrowed money.  He goes away for the Easter weekend, at a cost of &#163;3,000, and buys his girlfriend a &#163;700 jacket.  And there are many other indications of significant expenditure. </p>

In my judgment, it is not material whether he would have done so from capital or income, and I reject Ms Hay's submission that it is only the income that I should be looking at.  What I must look at is wider than that, and is all his available resources. </p>

He is under a liability to pay the mortgage on the matrimonial home.  The equity in the home is being eroded at the rate of &#163;47,000 a quarter because the husband has paid nothing towards the mortgage.  The result is that since March 2018, when the hearing took place, the equity has been reduced by reason of the non-payment of the mortgage by something in the region of &#163;300,000.  At trial, the husband put the equity in the matrimonial home at &#163;487,000.  The result of his non-payment and an unhelpful property market is that after sale there will be no equity in the matrimonial home, and the loser of course is the wife. </p>

He has two other costs orders against him in very much smaller sums which are outstanding.
