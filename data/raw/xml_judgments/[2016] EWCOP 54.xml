	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This application for costs itself is highly distressing and has generated a good deal of paperwork and no doubt a great deal of time and expense.  Fortunately the parties agreed that the application could be resolved as a paper exercise.  When I agreed to that course I had not anticipated such extensive written argument.  Much time has been spent analysing the factual history of the litigation and I have been provided with a great deal of case law.  </p>

However, the &#8216;general rule&#8217; prescribed by <span style="font-weight:bold">rule 157, Court of Protection rules 2007</span> provides that where the proceedings concern P&#8217;s welfare the general rule is that there should be no order as to the costs of the proceedings.  It is unnecessary further to burden this short judgment with the detail of those particular provisions.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the non exhaustive factors included within Rule 159 (1) and (2) as can be seen above, are such matters as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;conduct&#8217;</span> of the parties, <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;manner of response&#8217;</span> to application, whether a party has <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;succeeded&#8217;</span> in whole or in part.  Given the extraordinary sensitivity of the issues in this case these criteria are difficult to apply and do not seem to be wholly apposite in a case which <span style="font-weight:bold">ultimately</span> had an investigative, non adversarial complexion to it.  For reasons which I gave in my judgment which I do not propose to repeat here and from which I do not for one second depart, I required the experts to give evidence even after they had reached a professional consensus. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Culverhouse points to the delays in the investigation and harnesses the criticisms of the Official Solicitor, for example in relation to the significant delays by the CCG in providing disclosure of the medical records.  The Official Solicitor expressed himself in unambiguous terms, again which I need not repeat.  Further criticisms also assert failure to comply with the Royal College of Physicians National Clinical Guidelines; failure to respond promptly to emails; the particular costs of the 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> July hearing etc.  Perhaps the central complaint is that the family should never have been put in a position where they were forced to make the application in the first place and in consequence of the CCG&#8217;s failure to follow the guidance.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The CCG says that the request that they pay two thirds of the Applicant&#8217;s costs of the proceedings is &#8216;manifestly excessive&#8217;: applications for Court declarations were &#8216;inevitable&#8217; given the unique state of the facts in the context of the existing case law.  This is reinforced by the Official Solicitor&#8217;s initial stance that presumption in favour of life had not been displaced.  The essence of the response is that the applicant would, apart from issue costs etc, have incurred roughly the same expenses had she been a Respondent rather than an Applicant.  This analysis leads to a submission that I should only award costs against the CCG where identified instances of &#8216;unreasonable conduct&#8217; are established.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Determination of costs is not a precise science in any case, it is an intuitive art reflecting the Judge&#8217;s feel for the litigation as a whole.  In a case such as this it is almost invidious to dissect the party&#8217;s individual reactions at each stage of, and indeed prior to, this highly charged application.  I am not prepared to deconstruct the particular instances of the CCG&#8217;s un-reasonability, I am however satisfied that their responses entailed avoidable delay and, particularly at the procedural stages, a disturbing disregard for National Guidelines.  I consider that the failure to follow guidance and Ms Rosenbaum&#8217;s ultimate decision to bring the application herself are inextricably linked.  I do not see how it could be sensibly argued to the contrary.  Having taken the initiative I am also satisfied that she encountered delays in response and consequential costs.  I do not however consider it to be appropriate to burden the CCG with her full costs at a hearing which was protracted because the Judge alone considered it necessary to do so.  As I have said above, in so many respects, this case was unique.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Rosenbaum brought a very brave application.  It was her efforts that finally brought a proper medical evaluation of her mother&#8217;s circumstances.  Her instincts from the start were proved to be correct.  In the litigation she achieved what I consider to be the right outcome for her now late mother.  In that process she will have incurred considerable costs which she should not have had to do.  Had the Trust brought the application itself she could have reasonably decided, as many families do, to be an unrepresented party, effectively sheltering under the wing of the Official Solicitor or indeed the Trust itself.  As an applicant she had no real choice other than to be represented.</p>
