F seeks an order pursuant to the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> and the thereby incorporated provisions of the Hague Child Abduction Convention 1980 as supplemented by article 11 of the Council Regulation (EC) [2201/2003: [BIIR]].</p>

A wished to meet the judge charged with making decisions so clearly affecting him, and on 23 February I met him for about 25 minutes in the presence of Ms Res Pritchard and of Ms Jacqueline Roddy of the CAFCASS High Court team who had at the court's direction interviewed A on 22 January 2016.</p>

It was conceded by each of them that A's failure to return to Ireland at the conclusion of the agreed contact period was a wrongful retention in terms of article 3 of the Convention, M though emphasising that A's refusal to return was his and not at all inspired by her.</p>

The outcome so far as A is concerned was that he remained in Dublin subject to residence orders in favour both of F and of his parents, PGF and PGM.</p>

He himself told the guardian that he liked Ireland and wanted to stay. His only recorded complaint was that it rained too much. He was, in the view of the guardian, clearly settled and progressing in that placement.</p>

He currently lives in her household and is undoubtedly an influence within it and strongly supportive of his mother. It was (and I have no reason to suspect that this has changed) a feature of his presentation in 2012 that it was wrong for A to have been removed to Dublin and wrong of the court not to have returned him to his mother's care.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The outcome in 2012 for M thus was that both her sons were removed from her care. The facts established in the course of the proceedings demonstrated a number of serious deficits in her ability safely and appropriately to manage her sons' upbringing. There was a series of well-documented incidents over some years when she became completely unable to cope and where the histrionics, the hysteria and the emotional firestorms set raging by her inappropriate tendency to turn to alcohol for support at times of stress directly threatened the children's emotional and indeed their physical well-being.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">M was in the course of the proceedings diagnosed by a psychiatrist as subject to a borderline personality disorder featuring emotional instability. This was a root cause of her impulsive and damaging behaviours. She was at that stage considered to be at best an uncertain candidate for long-term cure or sustained improvement which, if achievable, would require substantial periods of intensive psychiatric/psychotherapeutic involvement and support. A negative factor was that she lacked, or denied herself, insight into the nature of her problems and consistently blamed her and the children's misfortunes (including their own maladaptive behaviour) on the local authority's and on the court's wrong-minded and unnecessary intervention into their family life.</p>

A, as well as B, has retained that view in the years which have since passed. A remains adamantly supportive of M as well as of her perspective of past events. He is, for instance, recorded as being of the belief that he was to blame for his removal and the upset it brought to M through his own disruptive behaviours, at home as well as at school. HHJ Brasse, on the other hand, expressed himself (at [62] of his judgment) as 'fully satisfied that the evidence overwhelmingly proves that M's parenting style led to the behavioural and emotional difficulties that these children have shown. Further, I find as a fact that there is no evidence that their problems were innate.'</p>

I very much hope that is the case but the fact is that there is at present no independent validation or evaluation of these claims, of which she gave details in a statement filed but days before this hearing. It would be necessary to undertake a thorough investigation of her current situation and state of mind and understanding before A could safely be committed to her care on a long term basis, an investigation which might well be measured in months rather than days or weeks. And if, contrary to what I am sure would be M's best endeavours, past patterns of behaviour reasserted themselves not only would A be at what was assessed 3 1/2 years ago as unacceptable risk of harm, but circumstances might dictate his removal from her home with all the disruption that would cause. This is a factor of which I must not lose sight when considering what effect I should give to what are accepted on all sides to be A's objections to a return to Ireland.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.25in">The orders made by HHJ Brasse in relation to A laid out a programme of contact with his mother which recognised and was intended to guard against the fact that seeing his mother would arouse both memories and aspirations for him which could well prove unsettling and potentially damaging to his Dublin placement with F. The local authority was to be involved, and an ongoing role was assigned to A's guardian. The reasons why nothing happened remain unexplained, but might have to do with the fact that A at some stage became habitually resident in Ireland, and that after the completion of the care proceedings and the confirmation of his residence in Ireland the continuing validity and involvement of the English court and the other agencies might have been regarded as spent, given his lawful removal there pursuant to permission granted by the English court, and having regard not least to the provisions of article 8 of BIIR which puts the country of the child's habitual residence firmly in the driving seat so far as continuing arrangements for that child are concerned.</p>

There were two such occasions (the first, 14 days or so at Christmas 2014, and then in the summer of 2015 for 3 weeks) before this most recent visit which was intended to cover both Christmas and the New Year. It was timed to end in time for A's return to his highly-regarded (including by him!) Dublin school on 6 January 2016 where he was to have had the opportunity of sitting a number of significant in-school examinations which his absence in London had prevented him from taking.</p>

His resentment simmered and there undoubtedly towards the end of November 2015 there was some sort of disagreeable if not (on A's not always entirely consistent account) positively abusive behaviour by F towards him.

And so I leave open the questions whether F has minimised the gravity of that and other occasions; or A to an extent is exaggerating what transpired (which was certainly a feature of his presentation when he was only 9); or whether the truth lies somewhere in between. </p>

In the case of a 13-year-old it would not be surprising if his recollection of incidents differed from one narration to another, indeed it might give rise to well-founded suspicions if his descriptions were accurate in every detail on each occasion. The fact is indeed that his accounts (for instance as recounted by M, and as described by him to Ms Roddy) have at times been inconsistent in the detail with which he fleshed them out. Even so, given this 13-year-old's past history it is not reassuring to find that the only occasion within the available documentation on which he has spoken of a punch which punctured his lip came during his interview with Ms Roddy, and is not replicated in his solicitor guardian's account of the complaints he made to her.</p>

They transferred A's case to their welfare team a week before A came to London, with a view to conducting a longer term intervention in the form of family support planning. It was initially agreed that meanwhile A should live in his grandparents' home to secure, if it needed securing, his safety while the initial assessment was carried out. I am not sure what if anything to make of the fact that the welfare team were apparently unaware that A returned after about five days to the immediate care of his father and there spent the last fortnight or so prior to his departure to England, without so far as I am aware any further complaint by A. </p>

Meanwhile he will have no unsupervised contact with A and will cooperate with the proposed programme of work recommended by Irish social services. They envisage their role as being to carry through their plan that the family engage with support services, specifically to support and hopefully to restore the relationship between A and his father, and also to support A individually with his emotional needs. </p>

When M heard of it (which would unsurprisingly seem to have been more or less immediately on his arrival in London) there seems to be little doubt but that she embarked upon a campaign to involve any number of potentially interested agencies. She relates that it was over the course of the Christmas period that A told her that he did not want to go home, and that if he were to return he feared that he would be so angry that he would be at risk of doing injury to his father and his grandparents. But M's reaction was swift and she seems to have mobilised within days of A's arrival. Thus by 19 December the local authority within whose area she lives had despatched a social worker to see the child. On her own account she also contacted 'several agencies like' Family Action Group, Barnardos, the NSPCC, ChildLine and (when told, she says, that Irish social services did not propose to take further action) she contacted the police who came to see A 'in the New Year.' She sought advice from two firms of solicitors as she wished to make an emergency application for a child arrangements order, but was then served with F's Hague application. There now seems little doubt that it was at the instigation of the local authority that she took prompt steps to secure a school place for A although she well knew that this was a matter upon which the court said it would rule at a hearing which took place on 8 February. </p>

She assessed him in the course of their 75 minute interview on 22 January as a bright and engaging young man whose maturity is consistent with his chronological age. That said, when considering his predicament and giving due weight to his stated objections she reminded herself and me a number of times that his views were 'entirely aligned with those of his mother', and that he was still only a 13-year-old child. He found himself in an invidious situation and had been, in her view, clearly exposed to the adult (and, I would add, partisan) views of both his mother and B.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:Arial">In child's objections cases, the range of considerations may be even wider than those in the other exceptions. The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to be returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity and which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. Once the discretion comes into play the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child&#8217;s objections, the extent to which they are 'authentically her own' or the product of influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide with or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry. But that is far from saying that the child&#8217;s objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.</span></p>

I owe them a particular debt of gratitude, and indeed an apology, because in the event I have decided that it is clear, whatever and irrespective of the merits of the rival claims, that I should order A's return to Ireland despite his objections. Anything I said in relation to these powers would therefore be irrelevant to my conclusion, and thus obiter. That relieves me of the invidious risk of potentially differing from the views and the course expressed and adopted in</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial"> Re S (Care; Jurisdiction) </span><span style="font-family:Arial">[2008] EWHC 3013 Fam, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 FLR 550" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 FLR 550</ref> by Charles J at [49] and [89], and in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Re H (Abduction)</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> [2009] EWHC 1735 Fam, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 FLR 1513" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 FLR 1513</ref> by Roderic Wood J. </span></p>

Once this current Hague application is determined, then the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60/section/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5</ref> power to make interim orders 'for the purpose of securing the welfare of the child concerned or of preventing changes in the circumstances relevant to the determination of the application' is spent. It is at least questionable to what extent if at all this court could properly exercise the power, for instance, to direct a section 37 Children Act report, or to prolong the involvement of either A's solicitor guardian to act on his behalf, or indeed of Ms Roddy.</span></p>
