At the conclusion of the hearing, I adjourned giving judgment in order to give further time for the Lithuanian authorities to communicate any additional matters they wished to make in respect of Article 15.  They had in fact already sent a letter to the English&#160;Central&#160;Authority, in response to questions posed by this court, but this was not available to me until after the hearing.  </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The Lithuanian Central Authority has made it clear that they seek a transfer of jurisdiction under Article 15.  It is their view that the Lithuanian authorities are better placed, and that it would be in the children&#8217;s best interests for them, to hear this case.  In summary, they point to the children&#8217;s connections with Lithuania, to the connections which these proceedings have with Lithuania including in terms of potential placements and evidence and to the provisions of international instruments including Article 8 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 which requires State Parties to respect the right of a child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality.</p>

They also submit that it would not be appropriate to transfer jurisdiction under Article 15.  Despite the father&#8217;s limited and only recent involvement in these proceedings, Mr Spain has made clear that he does not seek an adjournment of the hearing or of the determination of the above issues.  Mr Spain does not actively oppose the cases advanced on behalf of the other parties in respect of those issues, saying that the father is keen for an early decision to be made for the benefit of the children. </p>

In addition, it pointed to the father&#8217;s right to file an application under the 1980 Convention.  The State Service is also the relevant Central Authority for Lithuania.  Further details were given to enable the father to make such an application.  This information was provided to the father on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014.  It is clear that he has not made any application under the 1980 Hague Convention or indeed otherwise.  He appears not to have contacted the State Service again until some time in 2015.  </p>

I have not seen the June 2014 assessment, and this issue was not investigated during the course of the hearing, but I cannot but express surprise at this decision given the background circumstances.

The draft pro forma order includes a paragraph stipulating that there is an issue as to jurisdiction, but this had been deleted.  </p>

They had spent all their lives in Lithuania until January 2014.  Their father lives in Lithuania, as do all their extended family members.  The Lithuanian authorities are better placed to obtain evidence relating to the children&#8217;s past circumstances and to investigate, through interviews and assessments, what orders should be made.  They are also said to be better placed to understand and evaluate this evidence &#8220;taking into account the cultural context of this family and the country that they are from.&#8221;  Reference is made to Article 8 of the 1989 Convention, as referred to above.  The request is also put in the context of the Lithuanian authorities considering that placement in Lithuania is very likely to be in the children&#8217;s best interests. </p>

They had been living in England for approximately 14&#160;months and had become integrated through attending school and nursery and living in settled circumstances, at least since early December 2014.  He also relies on the fact that the three elder children say that they want to remain living in England.  </p>

This applies, he submits, powerfully in respect of the eldest child who will be 17 on 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th&#160;</span>October 2015.  The court&#8217;s power (in England) to make any care order in respect of him expires on that date.

They had become settled and integrated due to the length of time they had lived in England and, significantly, as a result of the effect of their having been accommodated under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.20</ref> of the Children Act.

Without further inquiry and investigation, Mr Gray submits that it would not be in the children&#8217;s best interests for jurisdiction to be transferred because, until further investigations have been undertaken, it would not be in their best interests for them to be returned to Lithuania.</p>

I must, of course, have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the children&#8217;s nationality, their family and other connections with Lithuania and, certainly, in respect of the oldest child but also, I consider, the twins, their expressed views.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The test for determining habitual residence is summarised as depending on whether there is some degree of integration by a child in a social and family environment.  That this is an overarching summary is clear because the court needs to conduct a broad assessment (&#8220;numerous factors&#8221; are engaged, as referred to by Lady Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">A v A</span> para. 54).  I considered this issue, in the context of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>, in <span style="font-style:italic">An English Local Authority v SW and Others</span> [2015] COPLR 29, <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2014/43" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCOP 43" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCOP 43</ref>, (at paragraph 72) when I referred to the broad assessment as being that:</p>

This means a sufficient, or some, degree of integration, not, I suggest, as a limited factual assessment, but as a question to be answered by reference to the factors, suitably applied, referred to by the Court of Justice and the Supreme Court.&#8221;</span></p>

Their lives were so unsettled and, it must be said, they were being provided with what appears to have been very inappropriate care.  However, by April 2015 there had been dramatic changes in their circumstances.  I do not see that the fact that these changes were significantly due to State intervention alters their effect on the issue of whether the children, as a result, became habitually resident in England.  This was the reality of their environment.</p>

As referred to in the correspondence from the Lithuanian Central Authority, the Lithuanian courts would clearly be well placed to address the family&#8217;s circumstances before January 2014 and to investigate potential carers of the children in Lithuania, including, importantly, the father.  They would also, as they assert, be well placed to obtain information about the &#8220;available social services and support&#8221; in Lithuania.  They would also have the advantage that this is a Lithuanian family, which continues to have extensive links with Lithuania.  </p>

A significant part of the necessary evidence will be obtained from witnesses in England.  Further, assessment of the father and other family members can be obtained from Lithuania.  In addition, and of significant importance in my view in this exercise, the three elder children appear to be stating strongly that they want to stay in England, preferably with their mother but, in any event, that they do not want to return to Lithuania because they are afraid of their father.  </p>

When this factor is weighed with the other factors in this case, it reinforces my conclusion that the Lithuanian courts are not better placed but, indeed, that the English court is better placed to hear this case.</p>

In contrast to other cases, the options for their future care are not focused in the other Member State, namely, Lithuania.  They include substantive options in England.

If a child who is habitually resident in England is to remain living in England, at least during the course of proceedings, it would in my view require some powerful countervailing factor or factors to justify transferring jurisdiction to a Member State in which the child would not be living.  It would, of course, be jurisdictionally possible to leave any decision as to where the child should live, pending the substantive determination of proceedings, to the courts of the other Member State.  However, I can foresee considerable potential problems, as demonstrated by <span style="font-style:italic">Re HA</span>, if a child were to continue to live in England whilst subject to care proceedings or their equivalent in another Member State, in particular because this court would no longer have any substantive jurisdiction and would be confined, at most, to provisional measures under Article 20.</p>
