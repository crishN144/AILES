	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Their marriage was to a significant extent spent apart because in 2010, as I find at H&#8217;s instigation, the family moved to England but H&#8217;s business interests mainly kept him in Russia.  For tax purposes he had to spend no more than 90 days a year in England and not less than 180 days a year in Russia, but his business commitments meant he was often in England much less than that. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On H&#8217;s case the marriage came to an end, apart from an attempted reconciliation in 2016, on 1 April 2014.  On W&#8217;s case the marriage came to an end in 2017. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is common ground that H was a wealthy man when they met.  It is H&#8217;s case that in 2011 he placed the vast majority of his assets in a Curacao Foundation (&#8220;the Foundation&#8221;) and that since then he has owned very little himself.  It is W&#8217;s case that during the marriage H became financially even more successful.  Thus it is that the parties have set the stage for a titanic battle about the ownership of assets and marital accrual.  W has sought to make a sharing claim whilst H argues that the court in Russia, in which country they were divorced and where financial proceedings first took place, made a fair and reasonable award and that W is entitled to nothing more. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">A quick glance at the asset schedules shows graphically how far the parties are apart.  W claims that the marital assets are &#163;29m (throughout this judgment I shall use round figures) of which H owns &#163;26.5m and W &#163;2.5m (being broadly her half interest in the matrimonial home).  H claims that after repayment of the sums that he has borrowed from the Foundation he is worth -&#163;6m and before repayment the total assets are only &#163;7.6m of which he possesses &#163;2.9m and W &#163;4.6m. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The parties have lost all perspective of what this case is really about.  They have each made arguments which I regard as unsustainable.  They have sought to argue every point available to them and have thus between them expended some &#163;2.1m on costs and have deluged the court with material far in excess of what is permitted either by rules for good practice or orders of the court.  On the other hand, the requirements for an agreed chronology and schedule of assets have been ignored.  The way that the case has been run has added to the difficulty of the judicial exercise.     </p>

He was living in Moscow, having originated from what is now Ukraine, by the time he and W met in St Petersburg, where she lived.  He was by then financially successful and in 2006 had sold his shares in a company developing a residential complex for in excess of $20m.  This was just one of a number of enterprises in which he was involved but much the most financially remunerative.   </p>

W has calculated that the benefits that she was at that time receiving from H amounted to $20-25k pm.  From then on W has been financially dependent upon H. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">By the end of 2009 the parties had agreed to move to London.  Neither party had any connection with England nor spoke the language.  W had no assets of her own of any significance and the motive was plainly financial in order to best protect H&#8217;s wealth.  In January 2010 the family visited London and they arranged through Coutts Bank that W would obtain a UK Tier 1 investor visa.  She named H and S as her dependents.  The arrangement was done in this way as it would have been difficult for H, who was then working for government in an important role in construction and reconstruction, to be seen to be making such an application.  H instructed his lawyer to draw up a loan agreement which he then required W to sign for the &#163;1m that he provided to W to obtain the visa.  She had no legal advice at the time and did as H asked.  At that stage the parties were still only engaged rather than married. </p>

It cost &#163;2.95m and the 10% deposit was paid in equal shares, W&#8217;s portion coming from the &#163;1m provided by H for the investor visa.

This was one of a number of documents which I shall examine in more detail later in this judgment.  Another raft of very important documents were entered into in July 2011.  The trust acted as director of a private Foundation (&#8220;the Foundation&#8221;) at the request of H and which was used to make monies available to H. </p>

It is H&#8217;s case that he has to date borrowed a little over &#163;13.5m in various tranches against a loan facility of &#163;15m.  Although all these loans have repayment dates, many of which have passed, H accepts that it is highly unlikely that any of the loans will be called in during his lifetime. </p>

It was thus that the second matrimonial home in The Bishops Avenue, London was purchased in 2013 in joint names for &#163;8.65m, the whole of the purchase price (&#163;9.2m inclusive of SDLT and other expenses) being produced in tranches by way of loans from the Foundation, save for the last &#163;1.7m which came from a private development carried out by H with Foundation funds.  </p>

There is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of section 16, but it will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law, and an award was made in the foreign country. In such cases mere disparity between that award and what would be awarded on an English divorce will certainly be insufficient to trigger the application of Part III. Nor is hardship or injustice (much less serious injustice) a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction, but if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate, in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made, and may affect the nature of the provision ordered.

The conditions which can be attached to leave, together with the court's case management powers, can be used to define the issues and to limit the evidence to be filed, as was done by Munby J in this case.

If traced back, a significant but unquantifiable amount of the current value of all his projects would be found to originate from previous projects.

Big sums were put into what turned out to be failed investments. A very high standard of living was maintained.  These will have only reduced what might otherwise have been an acquest.

His explanation of placing it in the name of his son to help him obtain a Cypriot passport when he had already obtained one as his father&#8217;s dependent was unconvincing.  Further, H provided all the funds for the purchase at the time that the financial proceedings were ongoing and it is hard to see how the transaction might not be set aside if that relief was sought.
