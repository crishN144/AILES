They hope to improve their present difficulties with the assistance of mediation once these proceedings have concluded and stresses are reduced. L is a much loved child, by her parents and also her grandparents. She is healthy, happy and settled in placement with her paternal grandparents and spends regular time with her parents. She smiles easily, is generally quite placid in nature and likes the company of others. She is starting to explore her world and her communication is developing. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">This is a very long judgment. I make no apologies for that. This is a very complex and difficult case. This bundle has in excess of 1500 pages and until a short time before the final hearing the matter remained fully contested with a 10 day hearing listed. It was mistakenly believed that the parents had physically separated (the father had vacated the home prior to the Ground Rules Hearing/Pre-Trial Review, apparently intended to be temporary) but certainly their positions in these proceedings diverged shortly before the pre-hearing review and this has had considerable impact upon subsequent events. Following what I expect was a great deal of challenging work by advocates and professionals alike, the mother&#8217;s position also changed to be one where she initially no longer sought to challenge most of the evidence or threshold and then finally to a position not to challenge either. </span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000">It is clear that the mother has only agreed to the plans with considerable reluctance and indeed seemingly on the basis that they are to be short term only. There still remains limited evidenced acceptance of the concerns of any of the professionals as to risks to L and the realistic options for her care on the part of the mother. I express the hope that mother now fully supports the placement of L with the paternal grandparents and positively acts to support this, as she has indicated a wish to do in her final evidence. It is important that the mother accepts, in very simple terms, that solving the housing issue and successful mediation are, alone, not reasons for unravelling the plans which have been made; they are only small parts of a very complex future picture.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The parties have now agreed threshold in a form which reflects the gravity of this case and I accept that this is sufficient to establish threshold under s31(2)CA 1989.</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000"> They are also agreed that L is to remain in the care of the paternal grandparents, albeit that the potential duration of that placement is not set in stone. Many of the incidental matters relating to the care plan were not fully agreed until the first day of the hearing but are now set out in an agreed placement plan. The mother still seeks rehabilitation at the earliest opportunity and I sadly anticipate that there may well be further litigation in this matter in the future. It is important and I consider that it is vital that I set out fully and in detail my reasons for approving the outcome of these proceedings.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">I am invited to approve the plans as drafted. The welfare of the child requires the Court to be satisfied that those plans are in the child&#8217;s best interests and I intend to express my reasons, relying upon the evidence filed in the case which is now unchallenged, for approving those arrangements.  I intend to survey that evidence to provide clarity as to my reasons for accepting that placement with mother is not a realistic option at this time and that the long term placement plan for the child of  placement in foster care with the paternal grandparents is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the foreseeable future. I have read and taken into account all of the evidence even if not specifically mentioned.</span></p>

The basis of the application was that the arrangement had broken down due to the paternal grandparents no longer feeling able to support the placement and raising concerns about the maternal grandmother&#8217;s behaviour within the household which led the Local Authority to be of the view that L&#8217;s safety demanded immediate removal into the care of paternal grandparents at their property. With the benefit of legal advice, an agreed position was reached whereby L would stay with her paternal grandparents until the next hearing on a few days later when the court could properly consider the issues.

Initially the 6 month plan was for maternal grandfather to fund a caravan on the driveway for the PA and to use other existing staff. (The property has only 3 bedrooms). Father would then care for 2 days and 2 nights when he was not working and a maternity nurse would stay in the house for 6 days in every 8 day cycle.

The Guardian had concerns about the potential for attachment issues for L given the number of people caring for her but was reassured that mother was clear on meeting L&#8217;s needs and the bond had started to develop. She considered, however, that it was essential that the father should also be present at home rather than working away. There were already tensions between the family and the Local Authority, particularly in relation to placing L&#8217;s needs first.

This included concerns that she was attempting to control the plan and was failing to allow social care staff to engage with the parents. Following L&#8217;s birth these continued, including concerns that she had been dishonest and misleading, such as staging a video of L being fed by her mother to give the impression that mother could feed independently whereas the reality was that she had fed L only for around 10 seconds alone before L was removed. Further, she</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11.5pt;color:#000000"/><span style="font-family:Arial">shared that it was her firm opinion that mother can, with support, meet all of L&#8217;s basic care needs whereas although mother tries to engage in things such as nappy changes or feeds for L, she would often stop and allow father to take over due to her movements not enabling her to do this securely. This raised concerns in respect of the maternal grandmother recognising her daughter&#8217;s limitations whilst also further raising concerns in respect of her ability to work open and honestly with the Local Authority for the best interests of L. Her behaviour also led to significant tensions with the paternal grandparents. In short, the Local Authority and paternal grandparents considered that she was taking over. Father also indicated that she took over and controlled matters and was hostile and abusive to his parents.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The issue of the family dynamics is of particular relevance in this matter. Sadly there are chasms between them, with neither set of grandparents having any working relationship with the other and the parents caught in the middle. There are also issues between the parents themselves which have ultimately led to acknowledged difficulties at the time of the final hearing. They also have their own loyalties to their families added to the mix. Further there are then issues with the ability of the parents, particularly the mother, and the maternal grandmother to accept advice and work openly and honestly with the Local Authority. I have already addressed some of the issues which have arisen in the background section of this judgment. In the bundle is a detailed document entitled &#8220;Chronology of Tensions&#8221; which sets out considerable details about the issues and problems between the families and the Local Authority between over the 9 month period since proceedings commenced. The document was not challenged by the parents, nor was the updated information of continued tensions set out in the social workers statements. They make for troubling reading and it is clear that the paternal grandparents as carers for L are often under attack, mainly by the mother and her own mother but also by the father. They, to their credit, have seemingly not fought back and have clearly put L&#8217;s needs first. They have effectively placed their own lives on hold to care for L, particularly in complying with the extensive contact arrangements, which I am aware has been stressful for them. </span></p>

Even one or more of the mother&#8217;s PAs (not identified which; she has up to 10) has been drawn into the disputes and on occasions challenged and attempted to over-rule the social worker&#8217;s guidance, with examples being over the use of Gaviscon and over feeding after a swimming session (chronology of tensions). It appears that there have been frequent comments made by parents and maternal grandmother in the presence of or to the social workers which criticise advice and the care given to L.</span></p>

Father accepts this. The social worker considers that father does not stand up to mother if she disagrees with his views and he will &#8220;go quiet&#8221;. The father has consistently shared with Children&#8217;s Services, Adult&#8217;s Services, and his parents that he does not wish to care for L on a full-time basis and his preferred option is for L to live with his parents &#8220;during the week and come home with me at the weekend with support of a nanny&#8221;.

His main priority is to ensure he can continue to work full-time, this is imperative to him as he states it supports his mental health and he has worked hard to obtain his HGV licence which provides him with feelings of independence and freedom. He has expressed a hope to work across Europe in the future. That of course would mean much longer periods away from home. </span></p>

Both sets of grandparents have had to contend with children with disabilities and they have supported them throughout their childhoods. It is clear that the parents have been given significant support for their whole lives and the commitment and encouragement by the grandparents to their respective children has been excellent, allowing them to achieve considerable success and independence in their lives. They are to be commended for this. However the strength of their commitment to their children may inadvertently have made it more difficult for them to accept the position of the Local Authority and the Court, that it is L&#8217;s interests which come first in this matter, not those of the parents themselves.</span></p>

MGM has also expressed her preference as to which social worker speaks to her daughter and when, and has requested on several occasions information via email correspondence and telephone that the LA go directly through her rather than the social worker contacting parents directly. During telephone conversation with the Team Manager, MGM was quoted to have said to prevent children&#8217;s social care from speaking with mother, she would contact mother and request her to block Children&#8217;s Services&#8217; number.&#8221;</span></p>

The report highlights </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">&#8220;Whilst there have been previous attempts by the MGM to step back from her involvement in the provision of M's care, this has not been sustained due to staffing issues. I accept that this is the position that the MGM hopes to get back to in the future, but at present, the MGM's role in relation to M's care remains a significant one. This leads to worries as to how the MGM would manage in future, should there again be gaps in staff availability to support M, or, if M's needs were to increase as they have done previously at times where her health has deteriorated.&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">The assessment concluded that the MGM remained &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">focussed on M's needs, and this is perhaps understandable given the context of her involvement and support to M over the years.

I accept that was a correct decision, as mediation would have proved very difficult with bitterly contested care plans and there was a risk that it could entrench positions further if used as a battleground concerning placement. At the pre-hearing review I recommended that the Local Authority should now take steps to commence the process so that it could be in place and commence immediately following the final hearing. It would be vital for the mediation to take place as family support forms part of the Local Authority&#8217;s own care plan but would equally be relevant if L was to be cared for by the parents with support.</span></p>

It will require a very experienced and competent mediator. Indeed there are no guarantees of success and the personal and emotional impact upon the families during the process will be great. They will have to put aside their own thoughts, feelings and opinions and leave the past behind them. I suspect this will be very hard for the mother to deal with if she is not L&#8217;s main carer, her potential resentment towards the father for not supporting her and the parental family for &#8220;taking L away&#8221; may fester and create ongoing problems throughout L&#8217;s life if mature and child focussed positions are not assumed.

Ms King, the ISW also confirms that she believes that the tensions and conflicts are not resolvable within L&#8217;s timescales. I do not criticise the Local Authority for delaying the start to mediation. It was not appropriate to commence this whilst the issue of L&#8217;s residence remained contested and undetermined, no proper mediation could be made or attempted without this being resolved. Accordingly, there has been, in my judgment, no failure by the Local Authority in this regard in not pursuing this earlier. I am satisfied that the plans for future mediation are suitable and will help to safeguard L as well as alleviate the family tensions.</span></p>

Father&#8217;s assessment demonstrated that he has Care Act eligible needs in the domains of accessing and engaging in work, training, education or volunteering and managing and maintaining nutrition. Additionally, he appears to have eligibility in regards to carrying out any caring responsibilities for a child, though it is less clear as to whether this arises from his disabilities or from confidence in his abilities to parent L and the limited time he has spent with her.</span></p>

His educational history would support the view that he has some difficulties learning in a formal setting and requires support to take in and understand new or complex information. However, his adaptive functioning suggests formal testing may be an underestimate of his overall functioning. He lives independently and reports no difficulties on a day-to-day basis.

Concerns highlighted his lack of commitment to gaining the skills required. He was said to continue to lose concentration and spend time on his phone despite this being discussed with him. He was said to lack the ability to pick up on L&#8217;s cues, could not offer suitable care without constant prompting. Certainly he would not be able to look after her alone, all night. Sadly he had not developed his parenting skills as she had hoped. His parents were also of the opinion that he could not look after L alone. He lacked motivation to change his work arrangements and adjust his life to enable a shared care arrangement.

They did not consider that a shared care arrangement would be sustainable and it could break down. Concerns were also expressed about the family conflicts and hostility which had directly led to the paternal grandparents withdrawal. A shared care arrangement would likely create a situation whereby there would be constant conflict and differences of opinion with regards to L&#8217;s care and it would fail.

As a result of this, and to ensure that all options could be considered, she drafted a support plan which is contained within the bundle at C407-410. This plan was not supported as a viable option by the Local Authority. The plan was prepared with input from the mother&#8217;s PAs who work, collectively, 24/7 to support the mother. A nanny would be required for L so that mother&#8217;s own care is not compromised. There were concerns regarding the PAs&#8217; availability and high staff turnover which has historically meant that father has had to care for mother alone and how this would impact upon L. Discussions were held with Nanny Plus who recommended that a minimum of 5 nannies would be required with two handovers per day to support staff sustainability. This did not take into account holidays, emergencies and sickness. Ms B expressed concern that this would negatively impact upon even minor aspects of L&#8217;s routine which should not be undervalued, e.g. a different nanny attending to her during the night and L not knowing who she will be waking up to each day, thus adding to the instability.</span></p>

The effect of her being cared for by the parents (with support) would mean involvement with multiple professionals, a chaotic environment, her needs not being consistently met, ongoing parental conflict and the level of professional supervision and support would amount to &#8220;substituted parenting&#8221; for a long period of time, potentially her whole childhood until she is more self sustainable.

It is clear from the statements that family tensions, between the parents themselves as well as the extended families and social workers, had not improved over time, indeed little had changed in that regard. Concerns as to the parents ability to care for L also remained evidenced including failure to accept advice and guidance. The paternal grandparents were still constantly subjected to criticism, mother&#8217;s position on caring for L was inflexible and sometimes inappropriate (examples being insisting on nappy changes on her lap despite L becoming more mobile leading to risk and refusing to allow contact at the paternal grandparents home when L was unsettled and distressed following immunisations), parents were reluctant to agree to holidays, father still used his phone when caring, lack of transparency with the mother and other issues. On one occasion the maternal grandmother sought to place L on mother&#8217;s lap in order to help to settle the mother even though not safe for L and father intervened. This is in my judgment clear evidence of the conflicted loyalties of the maternal grandmother and failure to put L first.</span></p>

This sets out in considerable detail what is expected of all the parties and in my judgment is comprehensive and appropriate. It is not for the court to micro-manage the care plan and indeed it will not be for the parents to do this once matters are finalised. The plan confirms that the IRO will keep L&#8217;s plan under review at a minimum of twice per year and also there will be care planning meetings every 8-12 weeks. Reassessment will be considered at each review on the basis of what is best for L as she grows. </span></p>

It has proven to be anything but &#8220;easy&#8221;. Mother proposed initially that her PAs with 1 nanny, father at home sometimes and familial support would be sufficient. Her package, she says &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">would allow L to be cared for by her parents with minimum number of adults involved in her day to day care when father is at home it would be the parents only with the additional support from PA&#8217;s to assist the mother in personal care and housework and when the father is at work there would be the same nanny attending each day&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Sadly there is no evidence to support this, even if the families could work better together. The professional assessments point to much more significant support being required and of course the PAs are already occupied caring for the mother. The mother proposed that when the father is home, they would be the carers together, when he was not at home a nanny would assist, together with input from PAs. The father has simply not shown sufficient ability or inclination to care for L himself and the mother is physically unable to do most tasks for L. The PAs are employed on the basis of mother&#8217;s own assessed care needs and not to care for an additional completely dependent child.  I accept that the mother truly believes that she can care for L with little assistance, but the reality is that she simply cannot according to the now unchallenged evidence, her position until recently was unrealistic.</span></p>

She sets out the support she offers mother, emotionally as well as physically. They have a very close relationship and she is obviously and clearly very loyal to the mother but in my judgment, may lack independence and perspective and is more focussed on the mother&#8217;s needs than L&#8217;s. She is critical of the paternal grandparents suggesting for example &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Some issues are very subtle, such as sending L to family time dressed in T shirts with comments on such as &#8220;daddy&#8217;s little girl&#8221; but never with anything relating to mum. Other issues are not so subtle, such as the invite to F to stay overnight on Christmas eve so that he could see L on Christmas morning but making it clear that invitation was not extended to her.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> Such criticism is unfortunate and unbalanced, for example reading so much into a T shirt and in criticising them for seeing their son at Christmas when clearly the mother could not attend due to the familial conflict.

He also reveals that he believes that an incident when mother took L to hospital was possibly an attempt by the mother to stop his parents going on holiday with L. Also in this latest statement is yet more evidence of vacillation by father. Despite stating specifically on several occasions throughout the proceedings that he did not want to live with the paternal grandfather, now he indicated that this was something which he would like to pursue. I query whether pressure is again playing a part in that decision.

The factual matters of this case are different in various ways, not least that there was agreement in LCC v AB that the children should be looked after by the Local Authority whether an order was made or not. Here of course, L&#8217;s future living arrangements remain contested. The Local Authority have had to exercise their parental responsibility in relation to L, to remove her to her paternal grandparents care, and to facilitate and arrange contact; in LCC v AB actual exercise of PR was never needed. Further the mother&#8217;s condition in LCC v AB was terminal, there were no other potential carers and the children were ultimately made wards of court.</span></p>

I accept that here the mother does not have learning difficulties in the more common sense, but the father does have learning difficulties and I agree with the Guardian that they are analogous to the difficulties these parents have with their physical  health disabilities. In Re H the court of Appeal confirms that the correct approach is firstly to identify and describe the level of support needed by the family, secondly to ascertain what can and should be being done under the Local Authority's obligations, and thirdly to determine whether, with that in place, the child's welfare needs will be met. This involves a careful assessment of what the package would look like, how practical it is and how intrusive it would be for the child.</span></p>

For example, in this case, the evidence shows that there is no amount of education or teaching work which would enable the parents to care for L fully without 24/7 assistance. It is not an issue of failing or not having tried to support the parents, the evidence from all of the professionals is clear that it would not work and it cannot be and is not therefore appropriate and necessary and in the best interests of L for it to be tried and fail. Sadly the parents&#8217; ability to meet L&#8217;s needs is not likely to change for a considerable period of time, even if issues such as suitable housing and practical equipment etc had been resolved immediately. It is not a case of looking at individual issues but the whole picture must be considered. Further, I am satisfied that the process of assessing any package, its practicalities and the effect upon L has been carried out by the Local Authority and considered by professionals and the Guardian and I accept their evidence.</span></p>

The initial threshold at issue is based upon the likelihood of future harm (physical and emotional) to L as a result of both parents&#8217; disabilities, neither being able to independently offer safe and consistent care to a newborn baby. At the time that proceedings were commenced, much less information was available than now in relation to the concerns held by the Local Authority about the parents ability to care. The final threshold is much longer and more detailed. The Local Authority rely on Re G (Care Proceedings: Threshold Conditions) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 FLR 1111" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 FLR 1111</ref> to rely on events occurring since 26 October 2022 which are capable of proving the state of affairs at that date. At the time of issue, the evidence showed that the concerns were instantly the parents ability to care for a new born baby, the issues with the families, particularly the maternal grandmother as barriers. In my judgment the threshold has not changed in nature but has merely become more detailed and expanded due to the evidence and is entirely compliant with Re G. I am satisfied that the risks in the present final threshold all existed at the time of the initial threshold.</span></p>

None of the present PAs or future nannies could be guaranteed to remain as carers for any lengthy period. In the main, the carers/nannies will need to attend to most of L&#8217;s physical needs with mother either simply being present and watching or assisting as much as she can. She will lack stability. She would also be at risk of the various factors set out in the evidence and summarised by the social worker including potential exposure to family issues with the maternal family and the fractured, potentially unbalanced, relationship between the parents. </span></p>

The simple fact is that if there was no intervention and an order was not made, L would not have the care from a parent which it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give. The reason for that is that the mother and father, through no fault of their own, just cannot provide it without support which is of such a level that the impact upon L would be extremely harmful to her emotional welfare. Equally it is highly likely that as a result of the parents lack of capacity to provide the care which it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give, L would be likely to suffer significant harm in the future if an order were not made.</span></p>

Sadly these initial conclusions and recommendations have led to considerable confusion and no doubt raised the hopes of and upset the parents who sought to rely on them. The questions raised by the Local Authority and others which changed Ms King&#8217;s recommendations have led, I consider, the mother to feel a real sense of grievance and sadly to place the blame for the changes at the door of the Local Authority. She does not accept why contact was not extended as the original recommendation suggested and feels a sense of injustice. This may well have damaged her view of the Local Authority and made an already fraught working relationship worse. From what I have read about the mother she appears to be a very strong willed young woman with clear opinions and she does not take advice lightly if it goes against what she believes.</span></p>

It will have been a very difficult decision to make, but it was the correct one, the outcome of a contested hearing looked to be inevitable, and she has saved herself considerable heartache by agreeing to the plans instead of listening to all of the evidence in court. I express the hope that she now becomes fully supportive of the carers&#8217; efforts to look after L and gives them the respect to which they are most certainly entitled. Mediation will assist but there needs to be a significant shift in the mother&#8217;s position towards the carers for it to be successful. It is not simply a matter of different parenting styles but of allowing them to look after L without constant scrutiny and being accepting of their knowledge of L&#8217;s day to day routines and what may be best for her at the time. I fully accept that this will be difficult for the mother who is strong willed, holds strong beliefs and is not hesitant in expressing these.  Sometimes it may help not to do so, however hard that may be. It is also vital for the mother to listen to the father&#8217;s voice and opinions and give him respect for these.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The mother&#8217;s case changed dramatically following the ground rules hearing, her brief separation from the father and the father&#8217;s change in position. Prior to that she had firmly sought rehabilitation and challenged much of the evidence. In my judgment, her change of position is not as a result of accepting the evidence and concerns of the professionals but as a result of the father&#8217;s position and acceptance that housing needs were not met in a manner suitable for L. I remain of the belief, due to the nature of her final position statement, that she does not truly accept that she cannot care for L and she intends to seek rehabilitation as soon as she has moved house and settled, suggesting this may be a few months. Sadly such a position is wholly unrealistic and it is important that I set out why I and others consider it so within this judgment, I have attempted to do precisely this although I have not addressed all of the pertinent evidence in detail. Any such attempt to change the plan at an early time would likely fail and cause distress to everyone involved in the case and may even destabilise the placement with the grandparents leading to a less positive option, namely stranger foster care. The mother needs to be realistic and accept the decisions which I and others have made as being in the best interests of L for at least the short-medium term until L is older, more independent and more resilient.</span></p>

It is merely hypothetical at this time. The grandfather has not yet even contacted his landlord to enquire about changes to the property. There will be a need for consent and then if granted for detailed plans to be drawn. Following that it may be necessary for planning permission to be granted and the intricacies of that process can take a significant amount of time to be resolved with potential challenges, changes or even refusal by the panel and a need for appeal. It is then likely to be many months before any work is completed. In any event, I will be very clear for the benefit of the mother and father. Housing is only one issue in this matter. Solving that issue alone is not in my judgment a suitable trigger for reassessment for rehabilitation. There is also, of course, a real question as to whether the father would actually agree and move into the property in any event given his vacillation. </span></p>

In the father&#8217;s final statement he goes some way to accepting that there may be an impact but even then he seeks to minimise the impact and is unrealistic: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">&#8220;I would like to say that there would need to be multiple nannies involved in supporting M caring for L but presumably this would be a different nanny each day and there wouldn&#8217;t be multiple nannies there on the same day.&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> The evidence from Nanny Plus within the social worker&#8217;s statement is that there would need to be 2 handovers each day so a minimum of 3 nannies each day with 5 nannies in total, not taking into account holidays and absences etc. Although presently the mother does not challenge the plan, I do not accept that she has truly accepted the concerns of the Guardian and others and she does still seek an early rehabilitation. I have considered her position in her final evidence, which is relevant as this would likely be the basis for her plans for her challenge at that time. Mother accepts that with L at home, there would be up to 10 individual PAs involved at the home, an unspecified number of nannies (say the 5 suggested by Nanny Plus) but I have not seen anywhere in her evidence an acceptance that this could affect L emotionally or destabilise any attachments. From her statements, mother seems to consider that by being there she would be the primary attachment figure but this is not always possible when the physical care and immediate response has to be undertaken by others. Unless I have missed any specific reference to this issue of attachment it is simply glossed over. The effect of damaged attachments is clear, supported by evidence and is life-long. It is widely accepted that attachment is fundamental in enabling a child to reach their full potential. Children require a primary attachment in infancy to enable them to feel safe and comforted and it is a practical process as well as emotional.</span></p>

Sadly the mother would not be in a position to offer anything other than very limited assistance or verbal guidance. There are other physical risks which mean that she, as any small child, needs an adult to be completely available physically to supervise and respond to prevent harm and support development and learning, such as choking hazards etc. This is required to ensure that L continues to meet her developmental milestones as she is presently and for her to remain physically safe, but also to ensure that she continues to develop secure attachments in the ongoing stages of her early development. The involvement of 5 changing nannies and up to 10 changing PAs undertaking most of the physical training and care will certainly have an adverse effect upon this.</span></p>

This is particularly pertinent with the extremely tense relations between the families meaning agreement and communication is difficult to achieve. I am satisfied that the finalised Placement Plan will safeguard L&#8217;s welfare and allow each relevant party to know their role and indeed its limitations with support from the Local Authority where needed. This will continue for some time to come particularly if the mother retains her unrealistic aspirations for early rehabilitation. Responsibility for most day to day matters should be rightfully delegated to the paternal  grandparents as primary carers and being able to respond quickly with the fullest knowledge of L&#8217;s needs. They should not have to consult the mother or the Local Authority constantly, this would undermine their role and create significant pressure on them. Where possible, the parents should be involved in significant or meaningful decisions and events in addition to doctors&#8217; appointments and meetings. It must be borne in mind that the paternal grandparents are the only presently approved carers and if they were unavailable or not prepared to care, foster care could be the only alternative option. I accept that this will all be very difficult for the mother to accept and express the hope that mediation will assist.</span></p>
