	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">In these consolidated proceedings I am concerned with the welfare of 6 children who range in age from 6 to 17 years old. When issued, the proceedings involved 7 children. However, the oldest child who had made no allegations and denied any knowledge of sexual abuse in the family, reached her 17th birthday last year and was, with the agreement of all, discharged as a party.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Of the 6 children who are the focus of these proceedings, 5 were made the subjects of care orders in June 2018. Following the making of final care orders, and over a period of around 14 months, the children made allegations of sexual abuse against a number of adults and young people. They also reported sexual activity as between themselves. Allegations were made against their parents, 2 older brothers, a maternal uncle and aunt, a cousin and the stepson of another uncle. Allegations of sexual abuse were also made against the maternal grandmother and her deceased husband. Further, the children alleged that a maternal cousin was a victim of the sexual abuse they described. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As a result of the allegations made, the Local Authority issued applications for permission to terminate contact between the children and their parents. It also issued separate applications for care orders with regard to the cousin and her sister. As all applications were primarily grounded in the same factual allegations, the applications were consolidated. </p>

The hearing was originally listed for a period of 10 weeks, a time estimate that did not include judicial reading time or time for the preparation of a judgment. By the application of the principles set out by MacFarlane P in &#8216;The Road Ahead 2021&#8217;, and effective collaboration between the 6 Queen&#8217;s counsel and 14 junior counsel that represent the 10 parties and intervenors participating in this hearing, it was possible to complete the hearing of the evidence called by the Local Authority in 4 weeks rather than the 6 originally expected.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Upon notice being given by the Respondents of the applications they intended to make, the Court invited the Local Authority to review its case to consider if it wished to make any applications itself, either to withdraw proceedings or specific allegations. That review resulted in the Local Authority informing the court that it sought permission to abandon a number of the findings pleaded in its schedule. The Respondents then filed skeleton arguments in support of their applications. The Local Authority then completed a further review of its case and notified the court of further matters pleaded that it had decided not to pursue, including one allegation made against the Stepson, thereby withdrawing the entirety of its case against that one Respondent. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">If the interim applications to dismiss the proceedings are unsuccessful, it will be necessary to address evidential matters that arise from the decision of the Local Authority to abandon certain allegations and its decision to withdraw its case against one of the intervenors. It is the submission on behalf of the Respondents that the court should proceed on the basis that the abandoned matters are untrue and can, therefore, be relied on by the Respondents as examples of fantasy/dishonesty by the children. It is also submitted that the court should accept the written evidence of the Stepson and, should the Local Authority dispute the content of that statement, it is for them to challenge that evidence by way of cross-examination. It is the Local Authority&#8217;s submission that once an allegation has been abandoned, the court should put the evidence concerning those allegations to one side, there being no evidential advantage or disadvantage arising for any party by those allegations no longer being determined. In the alternative, the Local Authority submits that the Court can require the Local Authority to continue with the allegations it seeks to withdraw, if the court takes the view that the examination of those allegations is necessary when considering the &#8216;broad canvas&#8217; of available evidence. </p>

It has long been recognised, and authority need not be quoted for this proposition, that for this reason a judge exercising the family jurisdiction has a much broader discretion than he would in the civil jurisdiction to determine the way in which an application should be pursued. In an appropriate case he can summarily dismiss the application as being, if not groundless, lacking enough merit to justify pursuing the matter. He may determine that the matter is one to be dealt with on the basis of written evidence and oral submissions without any need for oral evidence. He may decide to hear the evidence of the applicant and then take stock of where the matter stands at the end of that evidence." </p>

Part 12 is a specific application to care cases of Part 1 (the Overriding Objective) and Part 4 (General Case Management Powers) and contains detailed provisions reflecting the spirit of those earlier parts of the Rules. Part 12 is therefore likely to contain all the powers that the court needs, making it unlikely that recourse to the more general procedural provisions will be necessary; at all events, in a case to which Part 12 applies the earlier provisions do not represent an alternative procedural regime.&#8221;</p>

Technically, of course, that could be enforced by committal proceedings, but the convention or practice of the court is not to do that, it is rather to draw an adverse inference from a failure to give evidence, that adverse inference being that the party has something to conceal which they are not willing to risk in those proceedings, and I have to say that, in my experience, both as the trial judge and as an occasional member of the Court of Appeal, I cannot recall any case in which a party has refused to give evidence and has not had an inference drawn against them.

Mr Thomas submits that there is evidential value in the answers to such questions and credibility issues arise. Mr Thomas submits that the Local Authority must be permitted to ask questions on matters that arise from the answers given by the Respondents in their police interviews, in terms of internal inconsistency and on matters where inconsistent accounts are given as between the Respondents. Mr Thomas says there is merit in the Local Authority exploring with a mother why she believed her husband to be capable of sexual abuse of her children but did not express the same belief about her brother. Mr Thomas argues that the Local Authority is entitled to ask questions of the parents concerning the source of the sexual knowledge of the children, that is displayed in the allegations that they have made. It is also the Local Authority&#8217;s submission that it must be permitted to explore the dynamics between family members as are apparent in the records in the bundle.

Accordingly, it is incumbent on any judge to dig deep, as deep as is reasonably practicable, before arriving at the conclusion that there is no danger to the child and that the child's account of abusive experience is incredible, not to be believed. It is not a case in which the judge can say that the child is mistaken. A rejection of the local authority's case inevitably carries the conclusion that the child had made a false allegation against her stepfather. That outcome should not be reached without the judge having the best available evidence." </p>

It may be dangerous to say 'never', but I can only conceive of a termination that rested on a concession from the applicant that that was inevitable or appropriate at the conclusion of the evidence. So long as the applicant sails on into the gunfire I think the judge has the obligation to hear the case out. His obligation derives from his responsibilities to the child. There are many obvious instances in which what may seem to be a frail case at the conclusion of the applicant's evidence, nonetheless at the conclusion of all the evidence can be seen to be one that is not without substance or foundation&#8221;</span></p>

If I make a finding in this case against a parent when I should not have made a finding, not only would that be a gross injustice to the parent, but it would disturb, upset and possibly frustrate the lives of children throughout the whole of their childhood, if not beyond. If, on the other hand, I were to fail to make a finding when I should have made a finding, it would be to expose children immediately returned to that person's care to wholly unacceptable risk of abuse in the future.

In my experience, the case of a Respondent can often be described as being at its height at the end of the Local Authority case as skilled cross-examination of the Local Authority&#8217;s witnesses can often appear to have undermined the reliability of the Local Authority&#8217;s evidence. However, save in exceptional circumstances, it is in my judgment the responsibility of the court to provide the Local Authority, and the children represented by the Guardian, with the same fair opportunity to cross-examine the Respondents as the Respondents have had to challenge the Local Authority&#8217;s evidence. This ensures the court is able to reach its conclusions on the basis of the best evidence. In my judgment the court should not readily reach a conclusion that cross-examination of a witness would serve no purpose.

I am not suggesting that a parent has an absolute right to cross-examine every witness or to ask unlimited questions of a witness merely with a view to 'testing the evidence' or in the hope, Micawber-like, that something may turn up. Case management judges have to strike the balance, ensuring that there is a fair trial, recognising that a fair trial does not entitle a parent, even in a care case, to explore every by-way, but also being alert to ensure that no parent is denied the right to put the essence of their case to witnesses on those parts of their evidence that may have a significant impact on the outcome. </p>

Of course, the Local Authority&#8217;s questions need to be more than a fishing expedition and be addressed to issues that the court must determine. As with any cross-examination, the matters upon which the questions refer must have some basis in the evidence before the Court.

The Respondents rely on the decision of the Court of Appeal in JB (A Child)(Sexual Abuse Allegations)[2021] EWCA Civ 46, and the decision by Baker LJ not to remit the case for a rehearing on the basis that the breaches of the ABE guidance were &#8216;on a scale that no court could properly make the findings of abuse&#8217;. The decision of Keehan J in Re EF, GH, IJ (Care Proceedings) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2019/75" uk:canonical="[2019] EWFC 75" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWFC 75</ref> was also relied upon. At paragraph 286, Keehan J said &#8220;I am satisfied that the conduct of the police investigation by DC Andrews was so woeful and her conduct with the ABE interviews so seriously and serially breached the ABE Guidance that I can attach little or no weight to the allegations made by the boys and in those police interviews&#8221;. Both judgments are said to be illustrative of the likely outcome in this case, it being said that the breaches of guidance here are as bad, if not worse, than those in the aforementioned cases.  However, the conclusions in JB  (A Child)(Sexual Abuse Allegations) were reached on an appeal following a first instance trial hearing during which all the evidence had been heard. In his judgment in Re EF, Keehan J describes in detail his impression of the family witnesses and how hearing that evidence supported his ultimate decision that the allegations of the children were unreliable. </p>

However, in my judgment the evaluation of the evidence that is required in this case is much more detailed than is appropriate to undertake at this stage of the case. An expert witness informing the court that an image on an X ray is not, as was previously thought, a fracture may remove from consideration all evidence of an inflicted injury having occurred. There is very little judicial evaluation required. That is a very different situation to the court having to consider each of the breaches of guidance alleged to have taken place and then trace through the chronology to assess how that breach has affected the reliability of the evidence that has come later. In my judgment the number of breaches highlighted by the Respondents does not reduce or remove the need for the court to undertake a detailed evaluation of all the evidence. The number of breaches in this case is closely matched by the number of allegations. What connection one has with the other, if any, is a matter requiring close examination that should, in my judgment, occur only once all the evidence has been received. </p>

I have no doubt that, notwithstanding that in the present case a decision had been made in the exercise of such a discretion to arrange for the disputed facts, in relation in particular to the allegations against A, to be determined at the hearing fixed to begin on 7 April 2008, Her Honour Judge Hughes also even at that stage retained a discretion to decline to conduct it. Nevertheless, in my view additional considerations fall to be weighed by a judge who is considering, at the outset of a prearranged fact-finding hearing, whether in effect to abort it. That judge should weigh, with appropriate respect, the previous decision that the exercise should be undertaken and should ask whether any fresh circumstances, or at least any circumstances freshly discovered, should lead her or him to depart from the chosen forensic course. Equally she or he should weigh the costs already incurred in the assembly of the case on all sides and the degree to which a refusal at that stage to conduct the hearing would waste them. Furthermore, she or he should weigh any special features such as, in the present case, the facts that a girl then aged 16 had been shown the court room, that she had participated in discussions with the guardian as to the way in which she would prefer to give evidence and that she was thus expecting that she would imminently be giving oral evidence in some way or another, although the judge should not on the other hand ignore the girl's likely apprehension at that prospect. What needs, however, to be avoided at all costs is a sudden decision to abort a hearing in circumstances in which, later, the findings not then made might after all be considered to be necessary. So, a judge in the position of Her Honour Judge Hughes on 8 April should in my view act most cautiously before putting the forensic programme into reverse&#8221;.</p>

As I have described above, Family Court judges express views about the evidence they hear, or are to hear, as a necessary pre-cursor to the case management decisions that they make. I have given no indications of my views other than to invite the Local Authority to keep its case under review. At the stage these proceedings have now reached, I have concluded that all that is now required is for me to hear evidence from the Respondents on the allegations that the Local Authority still seeks to prove. To do otherwise requires the court to assess the detail of each allegation, the evidence both for and against and decide whether it can now be said that the evidence is so weak as to require the Local Authority to again justify why the court should hear further evidence. That is a hugely timeconsuming exercise and should now only be undertaken once all the evidence has been heard.  </p>

Should the ward live with the one parent or the other, or perhaps with someone else in the wider family? Should the ward have contact with the other adults? If the guiding principle of law is that the interests of the ward are paramount (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>), the determination in any particular case of what is in the best interests of this child necessarily involves an intense and anxious scrutiny of all the relevant circumstances. The task can often appear daunting even to the most experienced judge. And, as any judge who has had to conduct such fact-finding hearings will know all too well, wading through a mass of evidence, much of it usually uncorroborated and often coming from witnesses who, for whatever reasons, may be neither reliable nor even truthful, the difficulty of discerning where the truth actually lies, what findings he can properly make, is often one of almost excruciating difficulty. Yet as Baroness Hale of Richmond tartly observed in Re B <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 AC 11" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 AC 11</ref>, para [31], "it is the task which we are paid to perform to the best of our ability." The task, as she acknowledged, is a difficult one, to be performed without prejudice and preconceived ideas. Judges, as she explained, "are guided by many things, including the inherent probabilities, any contemporaneous documentation or records, any circumstantial evidence tending to support one account rather than the other, and their overall impression of the characters and motivations of the witnesses." </p>

There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened." </p>

In my judgment that distinction is an appropriate one to make, as seeking a positive finding that an allegation did not happen places an evidential burden on the Respondents, although the burden of proving its allegations rests at all times on the Local Authority. </p>

That is clear from the binary approach adopted by the House of Lords in Re B:  &#8220;if abuse is not proved against a named person, then it must for all purposes be treated as not having happened. Any such person is not and must not be treated as being left under a cloud of suspicion&#8221;.</p>

All parties agree that it is more than simply a finding that a specific allegation has not been proved against them. I suggested an analysis that whilst the legal burden of proof at all times remains on the local authority, a party seeking exoneration assumes an evidential burden to satisfy a court of their innocence on a balance of probabilities. No one sought to suggest that was wrong nor to argue for any particularly different approach.&#8221;</p>

Is a withdrawn and undetermined allegation simply to be ignored? Is it to be taken into account when surveying the broad canvass of evidence and the weight it should attract only being decided within that exercise or should the allegation be treated as untrue to enable those facing allegations to point to it as an example of dishonesty or fantasy by the children? </p>

To do otherwise allows a Local Authority to withdraw from consideration potentially important credibility evidence. That would prejudice the fact-finding exercise and endanger the fairness of the proceedings. If the Local Authority wishes to withdraw the allegations on the grounds that they cannot be proved, to prevent the Respondents from relying on those allegations as being unreliable would be profoundly unfair. </p>

On behalf of the Local Authority, Mr Thomas informed the Court that the Local Authority would continue to &#8216;prosecute&#8217; the findings if the Court so required.</p>

Having now reached the decision that the Court will be assisted by hearing oral evidence from all of the Respondents, except Mr Brown&#8217;s client, I hope that I will not need to consider making orders to require compliance. Should that be necessary, I will need to assess the reasons given for the refusal. </p>

		  <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I consider that the approach outlined by Brooke LJ more fully reflects the proper approach. These are inquisitorial proceedings rather than adversarial, where the welfare of the children is at stake and where the authorities on fact-finding require the court to survey all the evidence and to avoid compartmentalisation. The legislative framework allows for the admission of hearsay evidence. The approach to lies in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Lucas </span>requires a more measured approach. At one end of the spectrum, there will no doubt be cases where the court is satisfied that a person has deliberately refused to come to court to support their written statement and where there is no excuse or explanation. In that scenario, the court might take a bright line approach and refuse to place any weight on any of their evidence and draw inferences against them that any allegations are true. In other cases, the court will need to consider the circumstances of their failure to give evidence, any explanations offered or which present themselves and the evidence itself and the issues it goes to. Where there is compelling evidence explaining an inability to attend full weight might be given and no inferences drawn.  In between will be cases where the court might determine it is appropriate to rely on and give weight (even full weight) to some evidence but not to other evidence and to draw some but not necessarily all possible inferences.&#8221;</p>
