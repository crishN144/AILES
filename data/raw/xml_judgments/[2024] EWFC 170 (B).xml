I consider that would be better for the Child than being placed with the Paternal Grandmother. Although she has put forward a heartfelt case for caring for the Child there are things that she cannot change about her life in the time that is available; her physical health, her past trauma and her lack of appreciation of the risk that the Father may pose to the Child. If a placement with her broke down it would cause very serious harm to the Child. Whilst an adoption placement is not perfect it is a much less risky prospect and offers much greater permanence and security to the Child.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">It seems the reference to outstanding safeguarding concerns related to housing and the impact of fibromyalgia was to be assessed. The Guardian asked for the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessment to attempt to address this lacuna. The document (which was not in the bundle) is dated 2 November 2022 and is brief, it effectively amounts to scoring against various activities with no key to the scoring scheme. The Paternal Grandmother scored 2 out of 8 for &#8220;Preparing food&#8230;You need an aid or appliance to be able to prepare or cook a simple meal&#8221;, 2 out of 8 for &#8220;Washing and bathing&#8230;You need an aid or appliance to wash or bathe&#8221; and 2 out of 8 for &#8220;Dressing and undressing&#8230;You need to use an aid or appliance to dress and undress&#8221;. Given that all the other questions were scored as &#8220;0&#8221; I infer 2 out of 8 is a relatively low effect on day to day life. It is also relevant to note that it is dated November 2022 and the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s oral evidence was of an improvement in symptoms since then with the assistance of medication (see below) although I do note that she is still in receipt of PIP and still accepted pain at a level of 3 out of 10.</p>

This second risk is particularly magnified by the Child&#8217;s history of 4 placement moves since birth (see under the heading Harm suffered or at risk of suffering below).</p>

Whilst I can see there may have been some merit in that it would not have addressed the longer term concerns identified in the medical report nor the risk of the fibromyalgia worsening on occasions. In relation to the latter the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s evidence in cross-examination was that the last flare up was before the medication was regulated (initially she said this was &#8220;by June or July 2023&#8221;) although that did not seem to be consistent with the report to the ISW that it may have been September 2023 [E251]. When I asked her about that she thought the pain condition only plateaued in January 2024 at which point she said she could not remember the dates. Counsel accepted the only sensible way of interpreting her evidence was of a regulation through medication in June or July 2023 before a flare up in September 2023. This evidence suggests there may be a risk of future flare-ups notwithstanding the medication regime.</p>

I struggle to accept the reality of this answer, I felt it demonstrated a minimisation of the likely effect of the pain on her ability to care for an active toddler if there was a flare up.

I am not sure this equates to full  time work but I accept it is more than 2 hours per week.

She said she had reviewed the FGC report and that had not changed her views. The minutes identify 2 additional individuals: another friend and her employer. All confirmed &#8220;24/7 availability&#8221; although 2 were &#8220;in emergencies&#8221; as they work full time. The family finder&#8217;s evidence was that in the case of a solo adopter she would be &#8220;looking to ensure that network was very strong&#8221; which does not come across from the FGC minutes. In any event, when it was later put to her that there could be &#8220;structured respite&#8221; based on the network identified at the FGC her evidence was quite compelling that &#8220;Respite is not what the Child needs, she needs consistency and stability with one primary care giver, not one where she&#8217;s being moved to respite to give the primary care giver respite&#8221;.</p>

In answer to my questions in cross-examination the Paternal Grandmother said she no longer needs the aids that were required at the time of the PIP assessment, they had been returned and she now only suffered pain at 3 out of 10 in the backs of her legs, lower back and shoulders but it does not stop her doing anything. I do note that the next PIP assessment is not due until next year and the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s case is that her symptoms are largely controlled now so this may not be an inconsistency.</p>

There is increasing research to evidence maintaining relationships between parents and children who have been adopted can have a positive influence on the stability of that placement. I would invite the local authority to explore with any potential adopters a slightly higher level of contact between the Child and her parents, this might include 2 times a year face to face, with letters at birthdays and Christmas.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for the Guardian observed that the merits of a rigorous testing of evidence in court were amply demonstrated in this case. I wholeheartedly agree. At the conclusion of the Local Authority case there were very real concerns in my mind that there had been insufficient exploration of the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s physical limitations which, in circumstances where I must be satisfied that &#8220;nothing else will do&#8221; in order to make a Placement Order might have necessitated an adjournment in the best interests of the Child. However, all of the multi-faceted concerns of the ISW, Social Worker and Guardian came to be demonstrated through the cross-examination of the Paternal Grandmother.</p>

	    <p class="Number" style="text-indent:0.5in">I am quite certain it was a horrible experience for her and it is to her enormous credit she put herself through it for the Child&#8217;s benefit. But it gave very real support to the written concerns identified by the ISW. This is not a case solely about the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s physical limitations (or not); it extends to future care concerns, lack of insight (especially of the risk posed by the Father) and open and frank working with professionals. It may well be the case that with time and support those risks could be sufficiently ameliorated to make a placement with the Paternal Grandmother good enough but that would bring with it risk of emotional harm through delay in achieving permanence and in a break down in a temporary, testing, placement. Because of the concerns, the advantages of making a Special Guardianship Order now are outweighed by the risks of harm. As to long term foster care the risk of future changes of placement for this little girl are high, she would be in care for well over 10 years. She may well suffer multiple placement moves each bringing with it further emotional harm to a Child already seemingly suffering from past placement breakdowns. It is simply not a realistic option.</p>

I give them credit for that and I know they love her very much. Through counsel I was invited to note the Paternal Grandmother&#8217;s commitment to care for the Child and I have no hesitation in doing so. She has stuck with the process which evidently she found difficult and at times upsetting. She did not shy away from offering the Child a home, she has been committed to contact. I want to reassure her that on her behalf Mr Purss said all that sensibly could be said and as powerfully as it could be said, she has given it her best shot, nothing more could be asked of her.</p>
