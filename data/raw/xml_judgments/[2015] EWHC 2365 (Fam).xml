As I speak these words, it is 16.15 in the afternoon.

I order her immediate release from custody, and hereby unreservedly apologise to her for the very great indignity and inconvenience which she has suffered and experienced, not to mention the loss of a lawful holiday this week with friends in Majorca.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">In my view, the facts and circumstances of this case highlight a serious deficiency in the language of standard form location orders in Form 1A.  The actual location order in the present case shows on its face that it was last revised in May 2011, so the wording of the present order has been in routine and almost daily use for over four years and is itself, essentially, a continuation of standard form orders that have been in routine use for a considerable number of years.</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As the facts and circumstances of this case vividly illustrate, the language of the order is capable of seriously misleading police officers who are routinely asked by the Tipstaff actually to execute these orders.  The making of location orders is, frankly, a regular and routine part of the work of High Court judges of the Family Division and, of course, part of the daily work of the Tipstaff and his staff; but it is likely that any given police officer up and down the land may be faced with executing such orders only once, or at the most a very small number of times, during his or her career.</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The essential factual background to this case is that Mrs Ludmila Taukaca is a citizen of Latvia and was married for many years to her husband, Mr Andris Taukacs.  Their marriage was, in fact, dissolved during 2014.  From their marriage they have two children.   The elder, Z, is now aged 23 and is, of course, fully adult.  He lives somewhere in Northamptonshire in England.  The younger, M, was born in September 2001 and so he is now aged 13 and three quarters.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As is relatively normal in proceedings under the Hague Convention, the father at once made a without notice application to a High Court judge sitting here at the Royal Courts of Justice for what is called a location order.  The reason why such applications are routinely made, and such orders frequently granted, is, effectively, to stabilise a situation and reduce the risk of an abducting parent disappearing again with the child concerned and, maybe, travelling onwards to some other country, including possibly a country which is not itself a contracting party to the Hague Convention.  </span></p>

But, on the basis of my own personal experience and the volume of such applications applied for and made when I happen to be sitting as applications judge, I would be surprised if the total number of such orders did not amount to some hundreds a year.  It is, frankly, quite impossible for the Tipstaff, based here in the Royal Courts of Justice, with a very small and incredibly overburdened and hardworking staff, actually to execute and implement such orders personally.  So it is that, routinely, these orders tend to be executed by the police throughout the country on the instructions of, and as agent for, the Tipstaff. That is what happened in this case. </span></p>

They clearly had copies of the order in their possession.  I have before me a pro forma document of the Tipstaff headed &#8220;Confirmation of Service of a Court Order in a Child Abduction Case by a Police Officer&#8221;.   It explains that &#8220;this document shall be completed by the police officer serving/enforcing the order.&#8221;  I have the actual copy of that pro forma document which was signed by a police constable at Tipton police station in Tipton, which I assume is local to the mother&#8217;s address in Smethwick. I will not in this public judgment name the police constable concerned, because it would be most unfair if the least criticism appeared to attach to that particular officer, the more so as he or she (I have no idea of the gender) has not had any opportunity of giving his or her account of matters.</span></p>

The mother gave her brief oral evidence this afternoon with complete clarity and intelligence and, for the purposes of my decision today and this judgment, I unreservedly accept what she told me.  She told me that three officers attended at her home address in Smethwick. She said that they made available an interpreter over the telephone. That, if I may say so, is very much to the credit of the police.  She said that they told her that she needed to surrender the passport and any other identity documents of her son, M.  She told them that she did have his passport but did not have any other  identity documents for him.  He, himself, was not present, for then, as now, he was staying with his adult brother in Northamptonshire.  The mother produced M&#8217;s Latvian passport to the police and, correctly and in obedience to the location order, they took it with them. They promptly forwarded it to the Tipstaff here at the Royal Courts of Justice.  It arrived in the post today and it is in my hands as I speak.  That passport will, for the time being, be retained by the Tipstaff, pursuant to the location order, and, of course, to prevent any foreign travel by M.  </span></p>

She did not have her ticket or any travel documents with her, because one of her friends had made the booking and still had the tickets.   But she says, and I accept, that she told the police about this proposed travel and asked them whether she was still allowed, herself, to fly to Spain.   There was no travel booking in relation to her son, M, and no plan whatsoever for him to travel to Spain or anywhere else.   Rather, he was going to continue staying with his elder brother in Northamptonshire, as I have described.  </span></p>

She went first to her local police station, but that was shut, so she then took a taxi with her friend to the larger West Bromwich police station, which she says that she attended at about 9 pm last Friday. She says that she showed to the police officer at the desk the documents and asked whether she was allowed to fly to Spain.  She told me that she wanted to be 100 per cent sure that she was not breaking any court order by personally flying to Spain.  She told me that the police officer to whom she spoke told her that there was no problem for her to fly abroad.  It was only her son who was not allowed to leave the United Kingdom.</span></p>

I was made aware by officers that Taukaca had been removed from a Monarch flight departing to Palma, Spain, this was due to her breaching a High Court order which stated that she was not to leave the United Kingdom and that she had to surrender her passport.  Taukaca only spoke Latvian and Russian, so in order to communicate with her I used Google translator on my personal mobile telephone.  At 23.00 hours I informed her that she was under arrest for breaching the court order.  Language Line was then contacted and the facts of arrest explained to her.  Taukaca was then transported to Solihull police station where the facts were related to the custody officer and her detention authorised.  I had no further dealings with Taukaca.&#8221;</span></p>

The police at the airport and later at Solihull police station took the view that both of these facts were breaches of the order.   The police at her home, and later at West Bromwich police station, had both expressly told her that she could travel and was not required to surrender her passport.   Essentially, following that, Mrs Taukaca has been held in custody ever since, as I have said, and was brought here by escorts this afternoon.   She was held for a time in the cells here at the Royal Courts of Justice.</span></p>

This lady did produce her own passport to the police.   They looked at it, but did not take it with them and left it with her. This lady did tell the police that she had a booked holiday to Spain a few days later and asked whether she could lawfully go.  The police told her that she could.  This lady took the extra trouble and precaution, which few people might have done, of going to a police station on Friday, together with her friend, to check whether she could lawfully travel to Spain. She was told that she could.  She got as far as being on the aircraft when she was removed. That of itself must have been a degrading and humiliating experience and, probably, very frightening for her; and she has now suffered being detained in custody, as I have said, for something of the order of now 42 hours and two nights, and of course missed her holiday. </span></p>

The heading of the order describes, in this case Ludmila Taukaca, as &#8220;respondent&#8221;.  The opening words of paragraph 2 require &#8220;the respondent&#8221; to hand over the specified documents, but, when one gets into the detail of sub-paragraph (b), it will be noticed that it meanders between a reference to &#8220;the respondent&#8221; and a reference to &#8220;the defendant&#8221;.  So far as I am aware, at any rate in this particular version of this order, it is only within paragraph 2(b) that there is any reference to the words &#8220;the defendant&#8221;.  But at all events, what the person designated as &#8220;the respondent&#8221;, namely in this case Ludmila Taukaca, had to hand over was any passport relating to herself &#8220;which would enable the defendant to leave England and Wales&#8221;.  It leaves completely unspecified who is meant or intended by the words &#8220;the defendant&#8221;, but a police officer might reasonably suppose that the reference to &#8220;the defendant&#8221; was a reference to somebody other than &#8220;the respondent&#8221; and, perhaps, that it was some further reference to the child concerned. </span></p>

If and when the police officers last Wednesday looked at Mrs Taukaca&#8217;s own passport, which she had handed to them, but then placed it back on the table and left it with her, when they left her home, it was the officers who were failing to understand or failing to discharge their duty under this order.

So it was that, as the mother herself describes, the police said to her words to the effect that, &#8220;Yes, you can travel to Spain.  It is nothing to do with you, but you cannot take your son abroad.&#8221;   The same ambiguity seems to have influenced the police officer whom the mother saw and from whom she received advice and reassurance when she attended at West Bromwich police station on Friday.  </span></p>

I have explained all this at some length in this public judgment.  I have ordered that a transcript of this judgment must be made as a matter of extreme urgency.  I personally am last sitting on Wednesday of this week before I go for several weeks of holiday.  I intend to ensure that the official approved transcript of this judgment is placed upon the BAILII website before I go.  It must be very urgently drawn to the attention of the President of the Family Division.  It must, of course, be very urgently and seriously considered by the Tipstaff.  It seems to me vital that very urgent steps indeed are taken to clarify and improve the wording of this standard form of order so as to avoid that any other person suffers the injustice and indignity and loss of freedom which this lady has suffered. </span></p>

She should never have been arrested, still less, detained, and I order her immediate release, repeating as I do a very sincere and unreserved apology on behalf of the legal system.
