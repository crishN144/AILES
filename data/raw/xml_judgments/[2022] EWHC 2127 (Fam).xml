The actual decision &#8211; that a conviction by a criminal court is not admissible in civil proceedings as evidence that the offence was committed &#8211; has been reversed by statute: see s.11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 . That change in the law was made on the recommendation of the Law Reform Committee in its Fifteenth Report (&#8220;The Rule in Hollington v Hewthorn &#8221;, Cmnd 3391, 1967).

It is not, of course, spelt out in those terms in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, although in so far as their decision was based mainly upon the ground that the opinion of the criminal court as to the defendant driver's guilt was as irrelevant as that of a bystander who witnessed the accident, the gap between the implicit and the explicit was a narrow one. It is in a sense true that a finding by any court that a person was culpable or not culpable of a particular criminal offence or civil wrong is an expression of opinion by the court. But it is of a different character from an expression of opinion by a private individual.&#8221;</span></p>

Our further premise is that any decision of an English court upon an issue which it has a duty to determine is more likely than not to have been reached according to law and to be right rather than wrong.

In Three Rivers , as already mentioned, the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn was treated as settled law. In Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Bairstow [2004] Ch 1, the Court of Appeal held that, even if Hollington v Hewthorn could originally have been confined to cases where the earlier decision was that of a criminal court, it had stood for over 60 years for a much broader proposition and establishes that factual findings in earlier civil proceedings are not admissible as evidence of the facts so found. That decision was followed in Conlon v Simms [2008] 1 WLR 484 , where the Court of Appeal held that the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn applied to render inadmissible in later civil proceedings findings made by a solicitors' disciplinary tribunal.</span></p>

The judgment of the court delivered by Goddard LJ concentrates on the great variety of additional issues that would arise in a civil action for damages for negligent driving but which it would not have been necessary to decide in a prosecution for a traffic offence based on the same incident, and on the consequence that it would still be necessary to call in the civil action all the witnesses whose evidence had previously been given in a successful prosecution of the defendant, or a driver for whose tortious acts he was vicariously liable, for careless or dangerous driving, even if evidence of that conviction were admitted. So no question arose in Hollington v Hewthorn of raising in a civil action the identical question that had already been decided in a criminal court of competent jurisdiction, and the case does not purport to be an authority on that matter.&#8221;</span></p>

Thus, in a family context, a judge hearing a contempt application would not be permitted to take account of, or refer to, or in any way rely upon, findings made at a substantive trial of financial remedy, or public law, or private law proceedings, or indeed any other part of the family jurisdiction. Further, H's submission that "findings of fact by earlier tribunals are inadmissible in subsequent civil proceedings because they constitute opinion evidence" means that it would never be open to the court to be referred to the prior judgment upon a subsequent enforcement application of whatever nature. Moreover, following the logic through, a substantive judgment including findings as to, for example, periodical payments, could not be before the court upon a variation application under s31 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (as amended). All of this seems to me to be extremely doubtful.</span></p>

The closest they came was brief obiter dicta by Sir James Munby P (who appears to have received no submissions by counsel on the point) in Re L (A child) [2016] EWCA Civ 173 where he said at paragraph 68:</span></p>

That issue, which was at the heart of the appeal in Re K , is not one which, in the event, arose for determination here, so I say no more about it. The point to which I draw attention, is simply this. Quite apart from the Comet principle, which, as we have seen, would prevent the use in subsequent committal proceedings of the evidence given by someone in Mr Oddin's position at a hearing such as that which took place on 8 October 2015, it is possible that the rule in Hollington v F Hewthorn and Company Limited and another [1943] KB 587[15] might in certain circumstances prevent the use in subsequent proceedings of any findings made by the judge at the first hearing. That is a complicated matter which may require careful examination on some future occasion; so, beyond identifying the point, I say no more about it</span></p>

The minor is represented by his guardian ad litem who is enjoined by the rules to make specific, detailed, inquiries and to file a confidential report. This report is rarely revealed, at least in its totality, to the applicants or others who may be making representations. The court relies upon the report of the guardian ad litem and on reports obtained by him. I have referred to the reports filed in the present case. Much of the evidence thereby presented to the court is hearsay. When welfare considerations apply, where the welfare of the minor is paramount as in guardianship or wardship cases, or a first consideration as in adoption proceedings, the very welfare of the minor dictates that regard must be had to every matter which bears upon a possible risk or benefit to the child and see the decision of the House of Lords in In Re K (Infants) [1965] AC 201 which concerned wardship proceedings. I can see no reason for making a distinction between reports supplied pursuant to the adoption order and reports originating in any other way, and plainly a decision after investigation by the Secretary of State carrying out his duties under the Immigration Act 1971 must be able to be received by this court and given due weight and consideration. Further by section 3 this court is enjoined to take into account all the circumstances of the case&#8221;.</span></p>

Whatever may be said about the decision in that case, it has never been suggested that findings of fact made in previous proceedings could be more than evidence of such facts in later proceedings involving different parties.

In North West Water Ltd v Binnie &amp; Partners [1990] 3 All ER 547 (one of the cases considered in Secretary for Trade and Industry v Bairstow) the defendants were consulting engineers engaged to design and supervise the construction of an underground tunnel link and valve house.  As a result of an accident in which visitors to the project were killed and injured proceedings were brought against the water authority and the engineers. The court apportioned liability between the different defendants, but no contributions notices were served and formally, therefore, there were no proceedings between them capable of giving rise to an issue estoppel. Nonetheless, the court held that since the issues relating to the negligence of the engineers had been fully considered in proceedings to which both they and the water authority were defendants, it would be an abuse of process for the engineers in subsequent proceedings brought against them by the water authority to dispute the finding of negligence made against them in those former proceedings&#8221;.</span></p>

The responsibility of a judge to make his or her own independent assessment of the evidence entails that weight ought not to be attached to conclusions reached by another judge &#8211; all the more so where the party to whose interests the conclusions are adverse was not a party to the earlier proceedings.  That, I think, was the principle which the Court of Appeal was expounding in Hollington v Hewthorn. In relation to previous judgments of a civil court this approach was, moreover, endorsed by the Law Reform Committee. In explaining why it did not recommend any change to the law with regard to the admissibility of such judgments, the Committee said:</span></p>

We do not include convictions by foreign courts. This is for practical reasons. The substantive criminal law varies widely in different countries. So does criminal procedure and the law of evidence. The relevance of the foreign conviction to the issues in the English civil action could not be ascertained without expert evidence of the substantive criminal law of the foreign country. Its weight could not be judged without expert evidence of the procedural law of the foreign country and reliable information as to the standards of its courts. There are, of course, many countries whose standard of the administration of criminal justice is as high as our own, but there are others in which one cannot be assured of this. It would be invidious to leave the admissibility and weight of a foreign conviction to the discretion of an English judge unfamiliar with the legal system and standards of criminal justice of the foreign country concerned. Furthermore, the burden of showing that a foreign conviction was erroneous would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to sustain, since there would be no way of compelling the witnesses in the foreign criminal proceedings to attend to give evidence in the English courts. The practical effect of making foreign convictions admissible might well be to make them conclusive and the remoter the country in which the conviction took place the more difficult it would be to dispute its correctness&#8221;.</span></p>

The UK has therefore promoted the mutual recognition of judicial decisions at EU level. And it has pressed for the mutual recognition of restraint orders to be the first area subject to any new mutual recognition agreement.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Vine further submits that there is no exception for Children Act cases. Firstly, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hollington</span> has been treated as being of general application and has been applied as such. Secondly, the general position in children&#8217;s cases is that there is no strict issue estoppel and that questions of whether an issue can be relitigated are dealt with by discretion in the manner indicated in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">In Re B (Care Proceedings: Issue Estoppel)</span> [1997] Fam 117, Hale J at [128] (as explained more recently in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re E (Children: Reopening Findings of Fact)</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 1447 and <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re CTD (A Child: Rehearing)</span> [2020] EWCA Civ 1316. This is a separate point from whether there might be an exception to the rule in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hollington v Hewthorn</span> but, taken with the fact that mostly family courts will have been concerned with convictions from courts in the United Kingdom, it may explain why the issue relating to the admissibility in evidence of <span style="font-style:italic">foreign</span> convictions has, seemingly, not arisen before. I note at this point that it is somewhat surprising that the argument about <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hollington</span> in family proceedings has not arisen before given that it is not uncommon for foreign convictions to arise. Mr Vine&#8217;s explanation that they have been approached on the basis of the Court assuming it has a discretion may be correct. </p>

The most simple analysis is that it was not a case concerned with the statutory scheme under Part IV of the Children Act 1989. The law on the admissibility of evidence and the legal considerations under the CA are very different from those in issue in 1943 in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hollington</span>.</p>

Part IV CA proceedings are very different, at their heart lies the welfare of the child and the Court&#8217;s duty under section 1 to consider that welfare. Although at this stage of proceedings the child&#8217;s welfare is not paramount, it is a highly material consideration, and one that is central to the statutory scheme. </p>

It is by reason of that public interest in the protection of children that the court in Part IV proceedings has a quasi-inquisitorial role, see Ryder LJ in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re W (Care Proceedings: Functions of the Court and Local Authority)</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[2013] EWCA Civ 1227:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For this reason, the court will rarely exclude relevant evidence. There is no dispute in this case that the evidence is highly relevant. It is important when considering the welfare interests of the children that it would be extremely difficult to prove to the English Court the facts behind the convictions. The events took place some years ago in Spain. Although E is a compellable witness, if he completely denies the offences it will be extremely difficult for the LA to establish those facts if it cannot rely on the convictions and if the burden of proof rests on the LA. </p>

The civil trial had to bring into play in its consideration of the accident other factors, including contributory negligence. This is made particularly clear by Lord Diplock&#8217;s speech in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hunter v Chief Constable of West Midlands Polise</span>, see above, and Lord Lane CJ in the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A:A Solicitor</span>.</p>

Therefore, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hollington</span> can be distinguished on that ground alone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, as Leggatt J set out in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hoyle v Rogers</span>, one analysis of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hollington</span> is that it was concerned with ensuring fairness to a third party who was not a party in the original proceedings. As I have explained above, I am not convinced that this was central to the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hollington</span>. However, it certainly lay behind the reasoning in the earlier judgments, including that in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Duchess of Kingston</span>. That issue does not arise in the present case. E was a party to the criminal proceedings in Spain and is a party to the present proceedings. In my view, it is irrelevant that the Spanish prosecutor is not a party to the present proceedings, or that the LA was not a party to the Spanish proceedings. Plainly, the concern of the courts has been to protect the interests of someone who might be adversely affected by finding him/herself bound by earlier findings they had no ability to influence. That does not arise in the present case in respect of E.</p>

The Mother is not bound in any true sense by these findings. They impact upon her interests as they do those of the children, but they are findings in respect of E not the Mother. Importantly, the Mother is not in a position to give evidence that has any relevance to the findings.  </p>

However, on Mr Vine&#8217;s case, he could not rely on the underlying facts which led to the convictions and the subsequent conviction in England. In my view, I should seek to reach an outcome which avoids the judge having to go through such legal contortions.</p>

In my view, Mr Goodwin must be correct on this point. If the conviction can be taken into account as proof of the underlying facts, then the burden must be on E to prove that the convictions were erroneous. The matters which he seeks to rely on are wholly within his knowledge and the position should be the same as for a domestic conviction - there is a presumption that the conviction was valid, but that is rebuttable on the balance of probability. Given that I have found the convictions can be taken into account as evidence of the underlying facts, it must follow that the burden of displacing that evidence is on E.</p>
