Yes, it was the case that she brought things in for her mother, but they were sometimes unsuitable. For example, the chair &#8211; the donor could not sit in this because of her physical problems - trainers which were not suitable for the donor&#8217;s needs. A radio had been brought in but the television was supplied by the unit. They also said the attorney brought food in but it was not healthy &#8211; lots of sugar. The donor has a vegetarian diet and they would expect the attorney to bring such things in. Both the carers agreed that they felt something was amiss with the attorney&#8217;s mental health. I asked if she was paranoid and they thought this could be a possibility.&#8221;</p>
