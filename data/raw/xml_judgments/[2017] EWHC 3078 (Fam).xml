In February 2016, there were some troubling reports regarding Mother&#8217;s behaviour. On 4 September 2016, the mother called the police to report that the father had assaulted her. There was bruising / red marks to her upper arm. The mother indicated that the father had pulled her hair and signalled by punching her head that the father had hit her on the head. She later retracted her statement and said that her ex-partner (not the father) had hit her.  The mother refused to sign a written agreement in October 2016. The children were made the subjects of Child Protection Plans on 10 October 2016.</span></p>

The mother started to scream at which point father packed his things and left the family home. The mother says that the children were asleep in their room.

In fact, she has served only a few weeks in prison and has now been released.  We are told that there is a hearing in December 2017 at which a determination will be made as to whether she needs to serve any more of her 703-day sentence or whether it will be suspended or reduced.  There is no clarity about her precise circumstances.</span></p>

This was because the local authority had raised concerns about the maternity of the children.  The DNA tests suggested that D, E and G have the same parents.  F, the third born child, has a different father/mother, the local authority was told.  After a short debate in logic during which the authority was encouraged to apply some common sense to the situation, it was accepted that there is clear evidence that the mother is the mother of F and G &#8211; born here &#8211; and so the likelihood is that she is the mother of all children and F has a different father.  The father, I should observe, maintains that he is the father of all 4 children.  Mother&#8217;s position is as yet unclear.</span></p>

Certainly, for the younger two children the factors which make the particular connection with Romania are all through their parents.  Whilst I do not suggest that this is not of importance it is a valid point that those connections are not made through any physical connection themselves with Romania.  They were born here, have never lived anywhere else, and so far as I am aware, they have never been to Romania.  Their contact with their heritage has been through their parents.  Contact with extended members of their family has been limited to visits in this jurisdiction. Arguably, for these younger two children the factors forging the necessary particular connection do not establish a stronger proximity or connection with Romania than the proximity they establish to this jurisdiction.  </span></p>

Indeed, all children are settled in their current placement.  The immediate impact on the children of a transfer would be a change in schools for the two oldest children, removal from their current placement where they are settling together and residence in Romania, a country which is alien to the two youngest. For the elder two who are now in school, the disruption of their education would come at a time when they have had the longest period of undisrupted schooling.

It is far from clear that the Romanian authorities are properly aware of these concerns.  My faith in the Romanian system is such that I am sure the concerns expressed here would be examined carefully before such placement took place.  Thus, if the case is transferred now, the process of determining with whom they should live is unlikely to be concluded by the time they physically return to Romania raising the possibility that they may well be placed in another temporary placement before having to move again.

On a simple level, if the assessment of which court is better placed is limited to the practical considerations of where most evidence will be gathered and most witnesses will be based then Romania would be better placed to hear this case.  However, the question is not necessarily answered through a simple assessment of practicalities it seems to me.  I need to determine whether </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8220;the transfer of the case to that other court is such as to provide genuine and specific added value, with respect to the decision to be taken in relation to the child, as compared with the possibility of the case remaining before&#8221;</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> this court.</span></p>

It adds no genuine and specific added value.  If I am wrong about that let me move on to the more powerful reason for not transferring the case now under the third test.</span></p>

The factors relevant to deciding the question will vary according to the circumstances. It is impossible to be definitive. But there is no reason at all to exclude the impact upon the child&#8217;s welfare, in the short or longer term of the transfer itself. What will be its immediate consequences? What impact will it have on the choices available to the court deciding upon the eventual outcome? This is not the same as deciding what outcome will be in the child&#8217;s best interests. It is deciding whether it is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the court currently seized of the case to retain it, or whether it is in the child&#8217;s best interests for the case to be transferred to the requested court&#8221;.</span></p>

Thus, the court having jurisdiction must assess any negative effects that such a transfer might have on what the court considered were the familial, social and emotional attachments of the child concerned in the case or on that child&#8217;s material situation (Para 59).  The desirability of the case being determined by the court best able to do so may, therefore, be overridden by some negative effect on the transfer of a case on the circumstances or situation of the child.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">I disagree that the welfare decision in respect of these children, as in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">Re D</span><span style="font-size:11pt"> case, is driven inevitably by the fact that they are Romanian nationals and their family is all in Romania. I do see that there is likely to be a strong argument that they must in due course return to Romania but at this stage, given the negative experiences that they might have had in the care of their parents and extended family, combined with what is an increasingly strong connection with this country, I do not feel able to be sure that a return will be the only possible outcome.  Whilst their links to Romania are far from tenuous, neither are their links to this jurisdiction.  These children have a connection with this country that has established jurisdiction. For the younger two in particular it goes further than that.  Their connection to this country is relatively strong.  Even for the older two their life in Romania in the care of their parents has seen them, it is believed in the care of the authorities.  </span></p>

The disruption to them would be considerable and yet I can prevent them having to suffer that disruption by concluding the proceedings in this country.  This does not prevent full and proper consideration of their repatriation in due course.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:11pt">I bear in mind in assessing the negatives, the issue of contact between the children and their family in the interim. Whilst the children remain here and their parents in Romania there can be no face to face contact. If the proceedings were to transfer they would at least have more meaningful contact with their parents. Of course, the children have not had face to face contact with their father for some time.  I accept that this is problematic but it does not, in my view, outweigh the negative effects of a move now to Romania.  </span></p>

In circumstances in which they are provided with no contact to their parents by the local authority the balance on best interests may well shift.  For now it remains firmly in favour of hearing the proceedings in this jurisdiction.</span></p>

I should add that the issue of transfer in this case has been finely balanced.  So much so that, I consider it necessary to keep this issue under constant review.  If, despite all efforts, it becomes apparent that these parents cannot be properly assessed here, for instance, or there is some other change in their situation impacting upon the issue of where the proceedings should be heard, there is no reason why a further application for an Article 15 transfer cannot be made.</span></p>
