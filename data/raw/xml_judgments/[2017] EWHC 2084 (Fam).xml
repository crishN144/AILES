ZX has made it clear that it cannot care for X after Monday 14 August 2017; and explained, by reference to the relevant legislation and regulations, which there is no need for me to explore, why, as a matter of law, although it can accommodate X so long as she remains subject to the detention and training order, it cannot thereafter do so. It adds some detail which I need to quote:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;&#8230; the home has made all and every effort to meet [X]&#8217;s needs by providing additional staffing at a cost (to date of this hearing) of &#163;125,200.35p. This cost has been wholly met by [ZX]. The Youth Justice Board (England) have failed to provide additional resources to cope with the 3-1 care regime that is needed to maintain the safety of [X] despite requests being made to them on 06 June, 12 July and 17 July 2017.  NHS (England) have provided a Health Care Assistant to perform observations but not direct care since 17 July 2017.</p>

Since [X&#8217;s arrival], 13 young people resident at [ZX] have expressed (verbally or in writing via their independent advocate, social worker, youth offending worker or other representatives) that they feel that the quality of the care they are receiving is in breach of their statutory rights. This is a result of staff having to be deployed in an emergency to assist in maintaining the safety of [X] when she is being restrained as a result of attempts to self-harm. This has resulted in a reduction in these young people&#8217;s right to engage in agreed structured interventions, enrichment and contact with their key workers. In my analysis the inappropriate placement of [X] is infringing the rights of the other young people resident in [ZX].</p>

The first was a report from Deputy Mental Health, Programme of Care and High Secure Lead (Interim), in NHS England&#8217;s North of England Specialised Commissioning Team (North West HUB), explaining why, in NHS England&#8217;s view, an interim placement for X in an adolescent (CAMHS) PICU would be the least worst option:</p>

In the course of the conference, it was noted that if X was an adult, she would potentially meet the threshold for an adult MSU &#8211; but that the child criteria was different. The legal arrangements that would need to be made under the Mental Health Act were also discussed &#8211; with consensus that any admission prior to her release from [ZX] would be under s47 MHA.

This, however, is not a matter for congratulation; on the contrary, it is, of itself, yet further cause for concern. The provision of the care that someone like X needs should not be dependent upon judicial involvement, nor should someone like X be privileged just because her case comes before a very senior judge. I emphasise this because a mass of informed, if anecdotal, opinion indicates that X&#8217;s is not an isolated case and that there are far too many young women in similar predicaments.
