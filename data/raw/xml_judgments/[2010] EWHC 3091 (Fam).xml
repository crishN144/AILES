I found that two agreements entered into on 6 March 2007 between H and Mr Fishman were avoidable under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 23</ref> but did not meet the stiff test needed to demonstrate a sham, notwithstanding that there were many suspicions and oddities surrounding them. Those transactions were effected in the context of the disintegrating marriage and H&#8217;s stated intention in May 2007 to render W and the children utterly destitute. I stated in paragraph 5 of my judgment:</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8230;any transaction undertaken by H from the beginning of 2007 onwards must be judged, at least presumptively, to have been affected with the intention, if not the dominant intention, of achieving that stated end.</p>

On the first day of the hearing I did receive an unsworn written statement from EK and there are Affidavits from H deposing to the bona fides of the transaction. However, it is clear from a number of documents that have been obtained that the transaction was at all times completely fake.</p>

A letter was written by conveyancers instructed by H to the sellers of the property stating that they acted for W in connection with the proposed purchase of the property in the sum of &#163;1.95m.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Kosta appears to be the candidate nominee at that time. On 6 June 2007 contracts were exchanged in relation to South Lodge with H named as purchaser. The purchase money derived from off-shore entities called Garry Trading Inc, Gratex Finance Ltd and Tricommerce SA. On 1 August 2007 South Lodge was transferred into the name of Everclear Ltd as H had earlier assigned the benefit of his contract to buy South Lodge to Everclear upon completion. Thus Everclear was the nominee H decided to use at the time of purchase.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 27 September 2007 a Stock Purchase Agreement was entered into between H and EK. This agreement was stipulated to be governed by English Law and provided that H would sell the sole share in Everclear to EK for &#163;2.1m. There are a number of documents in the bundles purporting to evidence payments by EK to H&#8217;s off shore entities in satisfaction of the contractual consideration; however, there are inconsistencies between these instructions and the list of payments referred to by EK in his statement of 15 November 2010. I accept the submission of Mr Stirling that whilst it is possible, in fact probable, that money did flow between EK and H this was in all likelihood in respect of other transactions between H and his close associate EK. That the purported transfer of South Lodge (by means of the transfer of the share in Everclear Ltd) is fake is demonstrated beyond any doubt by the EFG memorandum of May 2008 referred to in paragraph 3 of my previous judgment. This memorandum concerned EFG&#8217;s mortgage over the former matrimonial home, Whitecliff. It records:</p>

He has however known EK for a long time having met him in 1998 and he has done a deal of business with him in the import and export of jewellery, watches and cars to and from Kazakhstan and Russia. GC was born and lived in Russia until about 1995 when he moved to Florida and it was in Florida that he met EK. GC and his wife Nelly have four children and they became concerned that education at primary and secondary level in Florida was not good enough. His wife had lived in London as a child, her father being a Soviet Diplomat. They formed the view of moving to this country where they believed that the education for their children would be better.</p>

They were friendly in the way that the expatriate Russian community here is friendly; there were a few occasions when they were on holiday together; and their child Alexi became friendly with the Agrest&#8217;s child Maxim - they were in the same class at school.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On his arrival here GC was plainly a man of considerable means. A mortgage application form, to which I will refer later, dated 26 August 2008, records him as having a little over &#163;4m of net assets in the UK and &#163;12.5m outside the UK. That fortune had been accumulated a long time before he had ever met H. His relationship with H is to be clearly distinguished from the relationship which H had with Mr Fishman as clearly described in my earlier judgment. That relationship went back many years and involved much mutual business activity. Unfortunately I consider that W has elaborated her evidence in order to play up the nature of the relationship between H and GC. Although it is not mentioned anywhere in her written evidence, she stated for the first time in the witness box that she had voice recordings of the two men which show the closeness of their business relationship. This is an example of exaggeration on the part of W in order to transform what was a casual and not particularly close relationship into something far more substantial. </p>

For example on 27 March 2008 at a time when South Lodge was purportedly owned by EK, a Tenancy Agreement was entered into between Everclear and Jolima. Jolima is a company referred to in paragraphs 21, 30, 31, and 33 of my judgment in the committal proceedings dated 16 April 2010. It is a company based in Cyprus which purports to be H&#8217;s employer, but which is obviously H&#8217;s alter ego.</p>

During the course of the hearing the solicitors&#8217; file relating to the obtainment of that mortgage was produced and a number of documents from it were placed into the trial bundle. It appears that GC instructed Guillaumes Gosling and Wilkinson to deal with the mortgage on 4 September 2008. A number of matters needed to be dealt with including the preparation of a Tenancy in favour of Jolima in a form acceptable to the bank &#8211; this was not completed until 30 January 2009; the obtainment of a statutory declaration on behalf of Jolima &#8211; this was achieved on 28 January 2009; and the obtainment of a personal guarantee from GC &#8211; this was done on 11 December 2008. At all events it was not until 3 March 2009 that all matters had been dealt with and the bank was in a position to advance the mortgage money. After costs and other expenses the net amount transferred to Everclear Ltd on 3 March 2009 was &#163;1,397,870.98.</p>

Although GC was not able to give an explanation for this false document I accept Mr Stirling&#8217;s submission that it was part and parcel of a deceit being practised on the bank. By the mortgage application form GC had represented that the mortgage money was to be used to purchase other investment properties rather than South Lodge and this further document was no doubt intended to demonstrate to the bank that South Lodge had indeed been fully paid for. Mr Stirling accepts that this deceit does not of itself demonstrate the falsity of the transaction with which I am concerned other than to show a regrettable disregard for the truth on the part of GC. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have already mentioned above the Tenancy Agreement purportedly dated 1 August 2008 and the Amendment thereto dated 2 August 2008. It is not disputed that no rent was paid to GC pursuant to those agreements. Nor was any rent paid by Jolima to Everclear under the agreement insisted on by the bank executed on 30 January 2009. Rather, on 1 March 2009 the original Tenancy Agreement was amended to provide that the rent would be &#163;3,000 per month rather than &#163;12,000 per month. &#163;3,000 per month roughly corresponded to the mortgage interest. Thus it can be seen that Jolima (H&#8217;s alter ego) was paying the interest on the mortgage which had been raised to send part of the consideration to H through his nominee EK. This has all the appearances of a circular transaction.</p>

The consideration for such agency/consultancy services was stated to be 5% of the transaction price. GC explained to me that the standard rate would have been 7% and he would have expected to pay $50,000 up front. He explained that the quid pro quo for the more benign terms in this contract was the reduction in the rent referred to. Needless to say Jolima failed to find any potential purchasers for the Bank.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reduced rent of &#163;3,000 began to be paid on 30 March 2009 after the mortgage money had been made available. This is wholly consistent with the agreement being conditional upon the receipt of the mortgage funds, as GC had explicitly stated to me. The mortgage money was sent to Everclear via Credit Suisse and thence to a bank account in the name of GC with AUB Bank in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. This shows sums arriving from Everclear on 10 March 2009 and being transferred to EK in the converted sum of $1,968,000 on the same day. That dealt with about half of the $4m purchase price. The balance was provided in a way which was unusual to say the least. On 2 April 2009 GC, as part of a wider transaction, purchased bonds issued by AUB Bank in Bishkek with a face value of &#8364;1,489,850. These bonds did not mature until 11 March 2011. I do not believe they carried interest. Given the distance of the maturity date GC was able to buy the bonds at a discount to face value of 25% i.e. &#8364;372,462. The next day, 3 April 2009, GC signed over the bonds to EK. In a note attached to the copy of the bonds he stated that:</p>

W has produced a clear record of an email being sent to GC&#8217;s wife on 30 May 2009 enclosing the Order. GC says that the first time he saw the Order was in October 2009 after it had been sent by W on 29 September 2009. In this regard I conclude that W did indeed send the Order to GC on 20 February 2009. It would have come as no surprise to GC given his knowledge of it as revealed in the solicitors&#8217; file from which I have quoted. Plainly, GC was aware from 20 February 2009 at the latest that there was a dispute between H and W as to the ownership of South Lodge and that W was seeking to prevent H from alienating it to her disadvantage.</p>

By an Order dated 18 October 2009 W was to set out her case against GC by 31 October 2009. On 17 November 2009 W made an Affidavit &#8216;to clarify my position regarding South Lodge&#8217;. W had earlier, on 20 February 2009, made an Affidavit in which she sought the setting aside of H&#8217;s disposition of South Lodge as being made with the intention of defeating her claim for financial relief. On 16 April 2010 I made an Order that W was to set out her case by 16 May 2010. Again W failed to do so; again her time was extended and yet again she breached the time limits so that her position statement did not materialise until 8 October 2010, a mere twelve days before the original scheduled commencement of this case. The hearing in fact began on 15 November 2010 with a time estimate of 3 days. That was exceeded and a further two and a half days had to be found. Initially there existed 5 court bundles; by the end of the case, by virtue of further documents being produced, they had enlarged by a further 4 bundles. W was represented by Mr Christopher Stirling; H was not represented; GC was represented by Mr Frank Feehan QC. Both counsel advanced their respective cases with great skill.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the contract was made on 27 August 2008 for the sale of the single share in Everclear, it was amended in December 2008. Much more importantly it was the subject of a clear, albeit unwritten, collateral agreement to the effect that GC could reverse out of the deal if he could not obtain mortgage finance on South Lodge to supply part of the consideration. It is accurate to describe the obtainment of mortgage finance as a condition precedent for performance of the contract. Therefore I agree with Mr Stirling that the effective date of the second transaction for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 23</ref> is 3 March 2009 when the mortgage was completed and the funds made available.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although there are many oddities and suspicious aspects to the second transaction, whether it happened in March 2009 or August 2008, I am not satisfied that the evidence has established with clarity that it was and is a sham. As I stated in my earlier judgment, the test is a stiff one and although I have quite strong misgivings and doubt I am not prepared to say that the evidence carries me over the threshold to a conclusion that the transaction was fake. Equally, if I were to consider the transaction as at 27 August 2008 and absent the collateral agreement I would have difficulty in concluding that GC had not established the defence in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/23/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 23(6)</ref>. Plainly, full valuable consideration had been contracted for (even if not paid &#8211; it is at least arguable that the obligation to pay suffices); and notwithstanding the suspicious features I have referred to, there is a deficit of clear evidence that GC was either acting in bad faith or that he had knowledge, actual or constructive, that H was at that time, and by that transaction, seeking to defeat W&#8217;s legitimate claims. Evidence that they were friendly is simply not enough to prove the required knowledge. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, as at 3 March 2009 the picture is very different. By then GC plainly knew both of the fact and of the nature of the dispute between H and W concerning South Lodge. If he did not have actual knowledge then he plainly has to be fixed with constructive knowledge, given the circumstances prevailing at that time. I therefore conclude, although my decision is marginal, that the third limb of the defence is not satisfied as at 3 March 2009. Accordingly the transaction is liable to be set aside, all the other elements as between H and W being plainly satisfied, namely that the transaction was done by H with the intention of defeating W&#8217;s claim and had that effect.</p>

Mr Stirling argues that in making that decision I should have regard to the relative impact of my decision: who would suffer more - GC or W? Mr Feehan QC strongly disagrees and says that the discretion should only be exercised by reference to the circumstances surrounding the transaction itself. I believe the Court can take into account the full range of facts when deciding whether to exercise its discretion, including the fact that about &#163;600,000 - &#163;800,000 of equity in the property will make a significant difference to W&#8217;s claims to relief, for the reasons explained in my previous judgment. At this stage it is a question of striking a balance of fairness as between W and GC.</p>

If I were to reverse the sale of the single share in Everclear then I must go on to reverse the assignment of the Kyrgyzstani Bonds to EK as a consequential Order (no one is suggesting that I can or should reverse the mortgage in favour of the Bank of Scotland). Having regard to the nature of the relationship between EK and GC I have little doubt that the bonds will in fact be returned to GC. Thus other than in relation to some costs referable to South Lodge (including the loss of rent from Jolima since April 2010), he will have suffered minimally if the transaction is set aside. I will in any event order that H indemnify GC against all expenses and costs incurred by him in this transaction and the subsequent litigation to include any cost order made by me against GC in W&#8217;s favour. Although GC is liable to the Bank of Scotland under the personal guarantee it is unrealistic to think that the Bank will recover its money from any source other than the proceeds of South Lodge.</p>

In practice, especially in 'big money' cases, the husband (as I will assume) will often make a concession that company/trust assets can be treated as his, whereafter the case proceeds conveniently on that basis. It is pragmatic, saves expense and usually works. Problems such as have arisen in this case are rare and anyway can be avoided where there are other assets against which the lump sum order can be enforced. </p>

He submits that it is clear from that case and the two cases discussed within it that in order to create a condition precedent (i.e. in contract law terms to create sufficient uncertainty as to prevent the formation of the contract before satisfaction of the condition) in a contract expressed to be "subject to satisfactory mortgage" (or similar contract) the said condition must be entirely unsupported by any other elements of a contract such as the assumption of the obligation by a named party and/or a time limit on performance and/or amount to be raised etc. Where there is the clear assumption of the obligation and/or a time limit the contract is sufficiently certain and becomes a full contract at the time it is entered into, albeit one that can be rescinded if the performance of the term is found not to be possible by reasonable or enforceable efforts. In such a case, says Mr Feehan QC, there is plainly no condition precedent nor any collateral contract, merely terms of the main contract that can be enforced.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Feehan QC argues that here there is a promissory note creating an obligation and a time limit; there is no doubt that GC was responsible for finding the mortgage and that he used considerable efforts to do so evidencing his assumption of what he considered to be an enforceable obligation; and there is certainty as to price. Thus the implication of a condition precedent in this case cannot stand. That being so the purchase of Everclear/South Lodge took place on 27August 2008 and the defence in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23</ref> is made out.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Stirling meets this argument thus. He says that the ratio of <span style="font-style:italic">Johanmammed v Hassam</span> is that a contract subject to obtainment of a mortgage satisfactory to the applicant is not void for uncertainty. It does not follow however that it is not a conditional contract. Rather, on the facts of that case it was accepted that the condition precedent had been complied with. Mr Stirling concedes that it may well be that the oral agreement in August 2008 was a valid and enforceable conditional contract but that is not the point. It only became enforceable when the condition precedent was fulfilled. The point here is that the condition precedent had not been fulfilled at the time that GC ceased to be acting in good faith and without knowledge. Indeed, at the time of compliance with the condition precedent he could only do so by knowingly breaching a court order to obtain the mortgage. As such, when the transaction completed he could not avail himself of the statutory defence.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Stirling points out that there is no definition of &#8220;transaction&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.23</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MFPA 1984</ref> (or in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s37</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>) and there is no clear authority on the point. He submits that an anti-avoidance statute such as this should be given a purposive construction. If a party after commencing a transaction but before completion thereof becomes aware that the transaction is for a wrongful purpose it is submitted that he cannot rely on an earlier period of innocence to nonetheless proceed to complete the transaction. <span style="font-style:italic">A fortiori</span> where to do so he must act in defiance of a court order expressly forbidding him from taking the necessary step to fulfil the condition precedent. The logical result of the contention to the contrary is deeply unattractive. For if GC had complied with the court order the transaction would not have concluded. He would have had no mortgage and the sale would not have proceeded. Instead of course he chose to ignore the court order. GC cannot, submits Mr Stirling, be in a better position, i.e. with a completed transaction that is incapable of attack, by reason of such deliberate avoidance of the terms of a court order.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I prefer the submissions of Mr Stirling. The authority relied on by Mr Feehan QC does not inform the question of what was the true operative date of the transaction for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/23" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s23</ref>. Until the mortgage money was paid GC had every right to exit the transaction. He could not be sued by H (through his nominee EK) for specific performance. Until he received the mortgage money GC did not exercise the basic rights of owner by receipt of rent &#8211; if that was paid at all (which I doubt) then it was paid by Jolima to EK. I agree that the statute must be interpreted in a purposive way and that it would be utterly unreal to treat this transaction as having been completed in all respects on 27 August 2008. This transaction actually took place when GC received the mortgage money and set about paying for the property using that very money for half of the purchase price. The fact that the mortgage was formally offered and accepted in December 2008 does not alter the picture.</p>
