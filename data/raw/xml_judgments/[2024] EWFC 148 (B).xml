	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in"><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The matter proceeded to final hearing. Whilst there had been an initial direction for a parenting assessment of BT a combination of her clear acceptance of the findings; her stated intention to remain separate from MR, and; the evidence of good care being provided to Z by her, led to this not being pursued and the professionals agreed Z should remain in her care without need for any public order. MR had been subject to a risk assessment from Lucy Faithfull, an organisation with particular skill in assessing risk posed by those with a sexual offending profile. This assessment raised concerns as to the risk he posed to children including Z. Ultimately, MR did not pursue the contact he had argued for and a final order was made under which BT was not required to make Z available for contact with his father or provide to MR any information pertaining to Z. I made a section 91(14) order in respect of MR for 5 years.

		<p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.28in;margin-right:0.26in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:10pt">&#8230;I would wish to give a clear indication with respect to the impact of the order for no contact with the father so that the mother is in no doubt. This is not a decision following which I consider the mother should feel free and unencumbered to choose equally between contact with the father or not. I have not reached a neutral evaluation as to contact. Rather the order is phrased in the manner it is because she has expressed a clear understanding of the Court&#8217;s findings and agrees these concerns place the child at risk. It is quite clear to me that the mother should not be contemplating any direct contact with the father without the clearest evidence of progress with respect to his risk profile. I would expect this to include some form of professional work and re-evaluation of risk akin to that proposed by the Lucy Faithfull organisation. Were it to be suggested that this had been undertaken then I would not suggest she simply rely on statements to the same but should require sight of the same and should seek professional advice from children&#8217;s services before acting upon the same? A failure to self-protect in this manner may in future call back into question her ability to safeguard her son. </span></p>

He helped her move into her new property and when they knew social workers were visiting, he would absent himself from the property. In support of this evidence MR produced a photo album which demonstrated his consistent presence in Z&#8217;s life throughout the period in question.

As part of this deception, she had met with the social workers and Mr Smith and provided a convincing account which led those same professionals to gauge that Z would be safe in his mother&#8217;s care because she both understood and accepted the risks MR posed to Z. It is clear from the evidence that BT determined from her own observations that MR was not a risk to Z and proceeded on this basis to allow him to see his son including periods when he was left in the sole care of his father. MR equally prays in aid this period of time as evidencing his case that he is not a risk to his son.</span></p>

The evidence suggests MR may have developed a level of jealousy or insecurity when he discovered BT had spent the day with the male. After the tussle MR entered the property and was emotional. Z was present throughout. MR grabbed BT and it is reported she fell to the floor. She temporarily left the property during which time MR placed Z in his car and left the property (it seems BT had returned at this point but Z was not returned to her). MR then telephoned a duty social worker explaining some of what had happened. Later that day the police attended at his parents&#8217; property and took Z into police protection. I have the police disclosure relating to this involvement.

The circumstances of this relationship are that Z also had a child in care; that this child was placed in the same placement as Z, and; that whilst at a contact centre Z and BT developed a level of friendship. The applicant has concern as to the circumstances of the relationship with particular regard to the fact that Z then moved into BT&#8217;s property (with her and MR); that Z was not informed as to the concerns surrounding MR, and; that Z was thereafter transported by MR to contact with her own child at the contact centre. It seems clear the applicant was concerned as to the potential for manipulative and potentially exploitative abuse of the vulnerabilities within this relationship. Z subsequently alleged MR had been abusing BT. When the fact of the relationship was discovered, the parents were required to address the circumstances of the relationship. In summary BT explained she had met Z in emotional circumstances at contact. That she and MR had assisted Z in a charitable fashion being sensitive to the circumstance she was in. That the relationship had broken down after Z expressed a level of romantic feeling towards her which BT did not reciprocate and that Z had then made false allegations as a result of this rejection.

It is not a case of lack of knowledge about risk factors in relation to the Findings made against MR. [BT] still had good recall of the Findings when I reassessed her. Her safeguarding deficits are more profound, in my opinion, and centre around BT resolutely trusting in her own internal reality and judgement at the expense of trusting, or being willing to comply with, the judgement of an outside authority &#8211; such as the child protection system. From a psychodynamic attachment perspective, this might be due to the lack of trust in primary care givers, like her parents, with this lack of trust then projected onto child protection professionals, whom she views suspiciously as limiting her freedom&#8230;.BT gaining sufficient psychological security to live independently with a child without MR, to dispense with or relax her subjective frame of reference and to place trust in the professional view that MR does pose a risk, would take long term depth (sic) therapy of at least two years, in my view. Even then there would be no guarantee that this would enable BT to make sound objective decisions about risk, rather than making very unwise choices about risk driven by the emotions of the moment.</span></p>

On the information available the assessor remained concerned BT would resume a relationship with MR. She drew attention to the conclusions reached by Mr Smith and noted both the long-term nature of such work and the uncertainty as to the prospects of success of the same.

The evidence highlighted a continue risk based on potential for a repeat of the deception previously deployed and had reference to what was felt to be BT&#8217;S continuing inability to accept the risk posed to Z by his father. The evidence drew on the expert risk and parenting assessments. The social worker was concerned as to the potential for post-adoption contact to destabilise Z&#8217;s placement. The final evidence confirms that at that point no alternative carers had been proposed. At section 7 of the final evidence the social worker addresses the competing options. I will return to these points in my own assessment set out below. The social worker concluded placement was the appropriate outcome for Z.</span></p>

She accepted contact between Z and both of his parents was positive and Z gained significant benefit from such contact. An adoption route would require careful planning and would be assisted by the input of the foster carer who looks after Z and has developed a strong relationship with him. The applicant was not suggesting BT had not provided Z with good care, the issue was the deception she had maintained and the risk that flowed from this. The social worker was of the view it is inevitable this home environment must have been surrounded by heightened levels of stress and anxiety given what was being hidden. She accepted there would be a significant impact on Z of moving from his current foster care but this was inevitable as she cannot provide long term care. The social worker explained the role of a MAPS team (Multi Agency Psychological Support) and the ability of the applicant to draw on this in assisting them in successfully transitioning Z through a placement process. She agreed the mother had not undermined the placement &#8211; indeed there was evidence of BT being keen for the placement to be maintained. She was opposed to the notion of post adoption contact on the facts of the case for a number of reasons including the risk of deception and destabilisation. She agreed direct contact had the potential to assist in a placement settling but also noted there were potential issues if Z were told he could not live with his parents due to a risk but then was taken to see them. There was an inherent conflict in MR posing a sexual risk to Z but Z nonetheless being brought into his company. She pointed out the likelihood that adopters would need to agree with contact in any event and that a suggestion of a need for an open placement (open to direct contact) might make finding a placement more difficult. She agreed adoptions can break down but felt adoption would bring a higher level of stability and security.</span></p>

She agreed other things being equal that a sooner placement was better than a delayed option. She gave an overview as to the contact transition were placement to be ordered. She considered that so long as Z was properly supported, he would be able to settle consistent with the timelines being suggested for placement. She gave evidence as to the narrative that would be shared with Z and agreed this had some complexity. She accepted LTFC came with benefits over adoption and particularly ongoing contact but she felt it would not provide sufficient security and she worried that over time risks might increase. She confirmed the understanding of the applicant that there was an open and ongoing police investigation of alleged sexual abuse perpetrated by MR outside of the matters within the fact-finding and it was unknown what the outcome of this would be or how this might impact on the issues being considered. She was asked about the parents request for photographs of Z. Ultimately it seemed agreed this could be agreed prior to any placement but thereafter it was not supported due to the risk of identification and placement confidentiality being compromised.</span></p>

She also accepted that a placement option did not come with guarantees. She felt the inevitable need to inform Z as to the details of the case would come with an emotional impact but that this would arise whichever option were selected by the Court. She accepted there was a balancing act to be undertaken and accepted there were positives and negatives on each side of the scales. She did not agree one could have confidence at this time as to parental separation but agreed with the passage of time this might be clearer. She accepted a plan for LTFC left open the possibility of a future discharge application and a return to family life. However, in her view we were obliged to act on the information we currently possess and within Z&#8217;s timescales. She accepted LTFC did not have to be a bad option but in her experience the prospects of breakdown were real and higher than were there to be a placement decision. She acknowledged the positives of contact seen between Z and MR. She expressed concern that risks around contact could increase as Z got older. She agreed with a number of the propositions put to and agreed by the family finder but felt the timescales here were relatively normal and they did not dissuade her from supporting the placement application. She did not agree with a fixed time for securing placement failing which an alternative strategy would be required. She considered this was something that would need to be assessed in the prevailing circumstances as and when this point in time was reached. She agreed it would be very harmful were an adoptive placement to break down but considered it was less likely to occur in the first place.</span></p>

My finding was that MR was a risk to Z whether directly or indirectly. The direct risk was of directed sexual abuse of Z. The indirect risk was of sexual harm arising out of abuse of a third-party child or otherwise from blurred sexual boundaries. Up to final hearing MR sought to care for Z. It seems likely the foundation of this position was that nothing untoward had happened to Z during the period of disguised care. I have not been asked to reach any findings referable to this period and on the evidence consider the only appropriate observation is one of neutrality. However, in my assessment the proven absence of any misconduct during this period would not remove the concern previously established. I judge MR continues to require focused and expert work in order for risk to be reduced, and there is a potential that even after such work he would remain a risk. I do not consider the risk can be said to be reduced simply by proof of a period in which he has not been shown to have acted inappropriately given that the character traits are sufficiently embedded.</span></p>

The evidence indicates Z has been left alone with MR and as such there can be no absolute certainty as to what has taken place. Furthermore, and in any event, the nature of abuse of this sort is of manipulation and the exercise of a power imbalance. This can operate as much in the adult sphere as in the child-adult relationship. The history of this case is of exploitation for personal sexual satisfaction. It is clear to me BT is a vulnerable individual. As such I would be concerned for Z whether or not he was left alone with MR. One can see in the earlier proceedings how a child came to be abused within (not outside) an adult relationship. The reality of abuse of this sort is that it often has a creeping and insidious form permeating a relationship with the passage of time. I gauge BT would not be well placed to guard against this and indeed it is clear to me she has in fact allowed this state of affairs to continue notwithstanding an awareness of the risk. This is despite her evident love for her son. This plainly points to a situation in which she has permitted her own personal needs (for a relationship with MR) and wishes (for Z to have a &#8216;family&#8217;) to outweigh Z&#8217;s need to be kept safe.</span></p>

This deception has been sustained and sufficiently sophisticated to fool a range of professionals engaged with Z over a period of many months. Whilst this was being done the Court was separately misled by applications for contact made by the father (whilst he was in fact having contact). There can be no doubt now that this was aimed to further deceive. This is a concerning set of circumstances indeed when considering a case involving risk of sexual abuse from one of his care givers. I have read the logic given by BT in this regard - that she considered she would use this deception to effectively evaluate the question of whether MR could enjoy safe time with Z &#8211; and consider this to be a matter of the most significant concern. A true test by its very nature lends itself to two possible outcomes. That BT went ahead in such circumstances cannot be disregarded.</span></p>

In the light of the history of this case I am not willing to take such a statement at face value. It would be foolish in the extreme to simply accept this when, judged from her perspective other than being caught, nothing material has changed. The factual matrix remains the same, as does the risk, from the time when she continued the relationship. I accept over time sustained separation may give greater grounds for acceptance of separation but on any objective assessment the strength of the bond between the parents must be viewed as particularly strong given the risks the parents were willing to take to keep the relationship going. In my assessment it will be some considerable time before such optimism would be warranted and certainly outside Z&#8217;s timescales within this decision-making process.</span></p>

Sadly, there is a risk dynamic arising out of the parental relationship which would need to be guarded against even on occasions in which MR is not an active participant in contact.

The core of this evidence was to inform me as to a likely prospect of family finding within 6-9 months and placement within 9-12 months. In my experience this fits closely to expected timetables for other children without significant and particular needs. The evidence placed before me accepted that both the aging process and the issues in the case would have the potential to reduce any pool of possible candidates for placement but did not come close to suggesting the pool of candidates would be drained or come close to being drained. At 3 &#190; years of age I judge Z remains within an age group of children who do not face a specific difficulty in placement. It has to be recognised that he will retain a knowledge of his parents and his history were he to be placed and it has to be accepted that this is a complicating feature, but it is one shared with a substantial number of children who are placed successfully. The point is that placement is not purely the reserve of children below the age at which family memories have been embedded.</span></p>

It is likely that this feature might turn off some prospective carers but it should also be borne in mind that this is not a case in which Z is known to have suffered personal abuse. Further, it is accepted by the applicant and guardian that he has in many ways received a good and loving level of care during this period. It seems to me that these are balancing features which may impact on the number of candidates for placement but again will not reduce the number of candidates to a point where the search for a placement becomes purposeless. In making this point I bear in mind that Z does not share many of the features that surround the early life of children within the care system looking for a placement, i.e., substance abuse or considerable evidence of mental health difficulties in the family, physical or emotional development needs or chaotic upbringing. As with nearly everything in this field there is a balance that exists and the prediction of how the balancing features will level out is bound to remain somewhat opaque.</span></p>

He appears to enjoy the time he spends with them and there would seem to be no basis for believing he would not want this to continue without interruption. This assessment must be considered in the light of the reality of the case and the strong likelihood, that were placement refused, that contact would be significantly reduced in quantum. Whilst a clear plan has not been reduced to writing at this time it seems plausible that contact would continue at no more than once a month or every other month. It would be time limited and surrounded by significant safeguards. It plainly would be quite different to the fluid relationship which was occurring prior to November 2023.</span></p>

I am struggling to clearly assess the levels of stress and anxiety that must have been in play over the recent time period and during a time when at any moment the deception maintained by the parents might have been discovered. I also cannot assess with clarity the additional stress upon BT and likely conveyed to Z of maintaining this artifice at the same time as knowing her partner had abused another child and had been found to be a risk to their son. As I have observed BT has vulnerabilities and I judge this period must have been a deeply challenging period.

He will simply not understand the concerns that exist let alone the risk that his father poses and the concerning decisions his mother has taken. A time will come when these matters have to be addressed with him. This will be a complex piece of work and will likely pose an emotional impact for Z. If a relationship is to continue with his parents, then this will be surrounded by safeguards which will be required to ensure contact is safe. These safeguards will over time begin to raise likely questions in Z&#8217;s mind. Again, this will place in focus the need for a sophisticated but child focused approach to the risks and the need for protection. It is difficult to predict how Z will respond to a growing understanding of these matters. He might challenge the perceived risk preferring to view his parents through an idolised lens. Such a response might lead to Z potentially allowing himself to be placed at risk. He might be disgusted by what he learns and may turn against his father and lose trust in his mother for her choices. With knowledge may come instability in any relationship with his parents (if subsisting) and with any carers. It would not be surprising if at some point Z were to question either of his parents about these matters. It is known his father continues to dispute the truth of the findings and his mother has plainly shown a level of equivocation. Were this to be the response of any questioning then this would also be destabilising of the protective work and of any placement.</span></p>

I have already commented on the evidence of a solid bond between Z and his mother. Within the last proceedings this was identified and acknowledged as a significant positive feature for Z. It was the foundation upon which the outcome of placement with her was constructed. Whilst the updating evidence does bring new and significant concerns it does not cause me to recalibrate the essence of this positive relationship. I now also have to bring into this assessment the relationship Z shares with MR. I recall at the conclusion of the last proceedings MR appeared not to have had contact with Z for a sustained period. He had rejected any attendance at a contact centre until late in the proceedings. At final disposition he had accepted the Court should not order any contact between him and Z in the light of the undermining impact this might have on Z&#8217;s placement with his mother. I now know this was a dishonest presentation. I am now obliged to have regard to the reality in existence whether or not this was best for Z or in compliance with the Court&#8217;s decision making. As such I have regard to the relationship which exists between Z and his father and the positives that derive from the same and will equally likely be lost on adoption.</span></p>

I will return to this subject later within this judgment but I consider it would be unhelpful to bring into the assessment a false sense of optimism in order to deal with this issue. Whilst post-adoption contact has the potential to be a positive and stabilising experience for a child it is nearly always a decision made by actual adopters. In the circumstances of this case, it is easy to see why adopters may be wary of contact between Z and his parents. They will need to reflect on the risks posed by the parents and the danger of a level of deceit in their engagement. They will also have to factor in the management of life story work for Z alongside such a relationship and, as noted above, the potential for the contact to sit in contradiction to the perceived risks of the same. They will have to gauge whether addressing this life story work whilst contact is continuing will be stabilising or destabilising of Z&#8217;s home life. Judged today in this prospective fashion I consider there is a likelihood of contact being limited to indirect contact only.</span></p>

Whilst I do not accept his age is such as to prohibit a successful placement outcome it has the potential to impact on any placement success. There is a general understanding that, other things being equal, with greater age comes a reduced prospect of successful placement. Whilst I would not be happy to take this point to far, I do accept the basic proposition. But there is an explanation behind this concept which should not be disregarded. One of the challenges with an older child being placed is not just that they know their family members and what they are losing (as I have noted this applies to most children over 2 and successful placements do still occur), rather their age has to be seen in the light of their experience to date. Where a child is aged 5 and has lived in an abusive home, or one in which domestic violence or substance misuse is prevalent, or where there is sustained neglect and chaos, then they will likely over this period have embedded this experience and this by its very nature adds to the difficulty in finding a long-term successful placement. Children can end up damaged by their experience and this damage can be lifelong. It is therefore hardly surprising the extended experience of neglect etc will impact on the stability of a future placement. Such children needs a form of reparative parenting and even with this good care attempts at repair may not be enough.</span></p>

I have documented above the benefits of contact in general and for Z in particular. I bear in mind that this is both a principled point and a quantum point. In principle and on the facts of this case it is difficult to conceive of Z not having a level of direct contact were a LTFC outcome to be favoured. As noted above this is far less likely to be the case following adoption. Second, even were contact to be maintained post adoption then it is highly likely the quantum (amount) of contact arising following LTFC would be significantly in excess of that following adoption. In an adoptive scenario it is most likely any contact would be set out an identity level at around 1-2 times per annum. In contrast, under a LTFC outcome contact would likely arise on at least a bi-monthly basis. That level of contact has a much greater likelihood of maintaining the essence of the child-parent relationship. Third, there must be a possibility that were contact to continue after adoption that this might be for BT only. In substantial terms this would be a matter for any adopters and I cannot rule out adopters taking a differential attitude to each of the parents given where the direct risks lie in this case.</span></p>

Moreover, LTFC leaves open the possibility of future rehabilitation to parental care. This is an outcome which is not intended to be any part of an adoption outcome. By leaving this open it has the tendency to encourage the parents to make changes and improve. Indirectly this has the potential to have benefits for Z.</span></p>

It is a matter of debate whether he will find it easier or harder to come to terms with his father&#8217;s conduct if he has maintained a relationship with him. This is a matter requiring speculation however and it may be Z loses trust in those around him if a time comes when he has to understand why contact has been maintained with his father despite his father&#8217;s actions.</span></p>

Were this to be the case then the additional resources and expertise available to the applicant might be a feature which leans in favour of LTFC. Addressing Z&#8217;s needs would in such a scenario not be a matter for the services available to the adopters or those which they can advocate for, rather he would have a statutory parent with resources open to it to use for his benefit.</span></p>

I have made contrary observations in this regard. But I do accept a LTFC placement would likely be in place earlier than an equivalent adoptive placement. On the evidence I have a LTFC placement would likely be in place well in advance of the 9-12 months identified as likely for adoption. It is argued this has a separate benefit in establishing the basis for future security at an earlier date thus enabling Z to begin to settle in sooner rather than later. The applicant accepted the proposition that &#8216;sooner was better than later&#8217; and I agree. The issue is as to whether the difference between the two is sufficiently material to weigh the outcome differently as a result.</span></p>

It simply would not have the sense of permanency or belonging for Z that is associated and expected of adoption. He would undoubtedly be cared for and I do not overlook the potential for LTFC to provide a warm and loving home. Yet it simply is not the same as for adoption. A foster carer is a statutory carer subject to the overarching decision making of the applicant. Any such placement is inherently fragile as a result and subject to a host of different destabilising factors that simply would not arise in an adoptive setting. LTFC is not for life and creates no lifelong obligation to the child. I accept that many foster carers develop a commitment to a child which endures beyond childhood but this is not an expectation or requirement. For every child that has this experience will be a child who experiences a number of moves in care with the associated disruption of schooling and other related bonds.</span></p>

In contrast to adoption Z&#8217;s parents will remain a part of his life and as I have noted it may become increasingly unclear to him why it is that he is not with them. Such an outcome may lead to an acceleration of the time at which the life story history is considered and there is an enhanced danger of this being a problematic process if in contrast to adoption Z is receiving a different level of emotional support when at home. I have already noted the potential issues that may arise in circumstances in which the life story conflicts with that which is accepted by either or both parents.</span></p>

Rather it provides an intended safe home environment. Yet this remains surrounded by contact and the management not removal of risk. Over time Z will develop independence and there must be at least a risk of illicit contact taking place away from supervised contact. This would be a matter of real concern and would raise a continuing risk of significant harm. I appreciate the evidence as to current co-operation and the arguments around available safeguards. But I consider it na&#239;ve to assume there would be no dynamic over time and the possibility of risk arising outside of agreed contact.</span></p>

Having undertaken a careful and comprehensive evaluation of the risks in this case it appeared a long-term family solution had been found for Z. I very much recall ending the last proceedings on a positive note. Yet even then my judgment sought to make it abundantly clear to BT as to the risks to Z should his father enter his life in an uncontrolled fashion. I specifically cautioned her as to the impact such decision making might have on the security of his placement.</span></p>

Whilst they both explain this in the context of benefitting their child it is quite plain it had the very opposite effect. That this would be the case was entirely predictable and was well within their understanding. I do not expect them to readily accept my sustained concern as to risk of abuse. But I do expect them to have had the maturity and insight to follow through on their decision making. Even now I cannot countenance what they thought would happen as and when Z approached schooling and spent more of his life in open sight. They should have thought ahead and if they had of done so they would have immediately appreciated their deceit would likely come into open sight with the outcome one now sees writ large in these proceedings. As such the stark choice facing the Court is a consequence entirely of the parental decision making. This may appear a harsh point to draw but it is the reality and needs to be stated without hesitation.</span></p>

I am in no doubt this is now an imperative requirement to meet Z&#8217;s welfare needs and can in fact only be obtained by the making of a placement order with a plan for adoption. In my judgment he needs to be at the centre of a family where he has a legal place and in which his placement is not subject to uncertainty and instability. I have borne in mind his age but I did not assess this as being the issue which the parents would make of it. Z is still under 4 and will likely be placed within 12 months before his 5</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt"> birthday and commencement of schooling.

In my assessment the future work with Z will be better understood by him if it is undertaken within an environment distant from his parents and the likely denial of the same that will flow from their involvement in his life. I also consider the statutory overview of Z in LTFC and the stigma it brings may well be exacerbated given the facts of this case. Z needs to have the opportunity for full time parents who can address this history in part by providing a consistent and supportive account of this history. He cannot afford to have any sense of mixed messages around this issue.</span></p>

Whatever the parents say as to willingness to be supportive of LTFC I cannot overlook their tendency to be deceitful to professionals or the potentially problematic interaction they may have with the instability of such a placement and the non-acceptance of the risks in the case.

In general, there is much to be said for consideration of open adoption. It does have the potential to provide stability to a placement and particularly so where the child in question carries a powerful sense of their family identity. But each case turns on its facts. I have set out in this judgment the competing positives and negatives associated with the options before me and in doing so I have commented among other matters, on the relationship between Z and his parents.
