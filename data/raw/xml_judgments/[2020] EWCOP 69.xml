Thirdly, following the cessation of nutrition and hydration, RS has been provided with morphine and midazolam (a sedative). The continuous infusion of these was suspended (although RS continues to be prescribed these on an as required basis) when intravenous fluids, saline and glucose solution were instated, with it would appear, an increase in his agitation.

Secondly, that voice should be used calling the patient by his name at different volumes. Thirdly, there should be specific requests, for example to blink or move an eye or a limb or say something. Then fourthly, sensory stimulation &#8211; touching, scratching, painful stimulation, grips on places where it would hurt.

He said, I am sure rightly, that no proper conclusion, diagnosis or prognosis can be made on video evidence alone. You need the full picture, in this case now enlarged by the new EEG showing an absence of commensurate electrical activity by way of response to stimulation. It confirms the absence of cortical brain processing. The passage of time has reduced the figure of a 10-20% chance of RS reaching MCS minus.  </p>

It does not signify any recovery of cognitive function or ability to communicate or show emotion. There is nothing, says Dr Bell, to be said for allowing more time. 8 weeks is sadly quite sufficient to be able to give a prognosis where RS suffered such a severe injury. Very sadly, things have got worse for RS, not better. </p>

RS had transitioned from coma to VS and that explains his somewhat increased level of activity but he had not approached the criteria for MCS which he defined as follows: </p>

There is he says no significant change and his views which were less optimistic than Dr Bell&#8217;s on 9 December 2020 have sadly proved correct. </p>

Bleakly he said, there is no possibility of a satisfactory outcome for RS. In all respects he agrees with Dr Bell. Dr W also strongly endorsed the view that to understand an apparent response to a stimulus it has to be repeated in systematic controlled way with periods of rest in between. A few clips without context of the wider room and without sight of stimuli given are not helpful. </p>

She saw RS separately from her medical colleagues, also on 29 December 2020 and in the presence of his wife. She says that although RS&#8217;s eyes moved and on occasion he would look in her direction on her calling his name, this was not reliable and he did not appear to fixate on her face. When she moved, his eyes did not track. He demonstrated myoclonic jerks - involuntary movements - but she was not able to ascertain if they were the result of his brain injury or a response to stimulus. There was next to no response to painful stimuli. </p>

The ECtHR has not yet decided whether to accept the reference but has refused applications for interim measures to order implementation of life saving treatment and/or transfer of RS to his birth country and/or further medical examination. That refusal was of the applications made both by the country and the family. </p>

The OS had suggested a slightly longer time but had had limited opportunity to consider the Trust&#8217;s proposal. Having now done so, in my judgment the OS is right to accept the Trust&#8217;s suggestion as appropriate and I therefore continue the stay until 4pm on 7 January 2021.  </p>
