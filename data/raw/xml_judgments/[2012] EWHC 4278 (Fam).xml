	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This matter concerns care proceedings issued by A Local Authority (&#8216;the Local Authority&#8217;) relating to four girls.  DN born <span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:10pt">[a date in]</span> 2001 now 11 years, GN born <span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:10pt">[a date in]</span> 2006 now 6 years, GRN born <span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:10pt">[a date in]</span> 2008 now 4 years and CMN born <span style="font-family:Consolas;font-size:10pt">[a date in]</span> 2009 1 year 11 months. The parents of the three younger children are MF (the mother) and RN (the father). Although at the commencement of these proceedings, it was thought the father was also the father of DN, DNA tests have proved otherwise. DN`s mother is said to be the Second Respondent, CY, but it has not been possible to contact her. She is understood to live in the Cameroon. For convenience, I shall refer to the mother and father as such in this judgment, even though they have no biological connection to DN.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The central issue in this case is whether this court has jurisdiction in relation to the care proceedings relating to the three younger children GN, GRN and CMN. There is no issue regarding DN. It is accepted by all parties that she was habitually resident in this jurisdiction at the relevant time and this court has jurisdiction. This central issue turns on whether the three younger children were habitually resident in England and Wales when these proceedings were issued and served on the 30 December 2011. The local authority position is that it is more likely than not, at the relevant time, all three children were habitually resident in England. In the event that the court cannot establish where their habitual residence is, they submit jurisdiction rests on their presence here at the relevant time. This position is supported by the Children&#8217;s Guardian. The mother and father contend the children were habitually resident in France at the relevant time.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in">There seems to have been a complete failure to appreciate the importance in cases such as this, where credibility is in issue, of the need for statements (with a declaration of truth) to be signed and in the court bundle. This is particularly so when English is not the first language of the person giving evidence. The first 1 &#189; hours of the mother&#8217;s evidence in this case was spent trying to establish which of her statements were signed, and in what circumstances they had been translated. I, of course, accept the very detailed letter to the court from the mother&#8217;s solicitor offering an explanation and unreserved apology, but the message needs to go out loud and clear that signed statements must be in the court bundle.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in">An increasing number of cases now involve parties and/or children who have spent time in other Member States of the European Union. As a result it is often necessary to request relevant information from that Member State. Chapter IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003<span style="font-weight:bold"/>(BIIR) sets out the European Union legal scheme for Cooperation between Central Authorities in matters of parental responsibility. Articles 53 &#8211; 56 set out the requirements for central authorities to assist in the collection and exchange of information (i) on the situation of the child (ii) on any procedures under way (iii) on decisions taken concerning the child and they are therefore the proper avenue for the exchange of information between a local authority situate in England and Wales and equivalent bodies in Member States of the EU to which BIIR applies. The proper procedure for local authorities is to contact the central authority for England and Wales (The International Child Abduction and Contact Unit) and request reciprocal assistance for exchange of such information, through the central authority of the other Member State. Consideration must be given early on in proceedings as to whether such information is needed. If it is, such requests should be made promptly, to ensure there is minimum delay.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The mother gave evidence through an interpreter. Although Mr Verdan Q. C., on behalf of the local authority, invited the mother to give her evidence in English and only call on the interpreter when she needed something explaining, she declined that invitation. The invitation was made as it was suggested to her that she was seeking to hide behind the interpreter, as she appeared to have no difficulty in giving her answers in English to the police when she was interviewed in November 2011. Whilst of course acknowledging that English is not her first language, I am satisfied her comprehension of it was, in my judgment, significantly more that she was willing to admit. I have reached that conclusions as it was quite clear from the interviews with the police that she was able to understand the questions being asked and her answers were clear and coherent. There was one occasion in the interview when she said her English was not very good and got muddled with the meaning of skirt and shorts. But apart from that her answers were clear and comprehensive. In her oral evidence she said she asked for an interpreter on a number of occasions, that does not appear on the record of the interview and I was not directed to any other evidence that supported that request repeatedly being made. She had a solicitor there during the interview.</p>

There were a number of occasions when he simply lied in his evidence. The most notable example was his description of taking the mother and children to St Pancras to get the Eurostar train to go France in July 2011. His first account was that he had driven them all to the station in a Fiat Punto. When he was pressed about how he could fit in two adults and four children (two of whom required a baby seat), he continued to maintain the account and then realised it was simply not credible, only then did he start to retreat. His final account of how the mother and children left to go to France involved them getting a bus on the Walworth Road to St Pancras Station. Even a simple question, such as the journey to St Pancras, produced a web of untruths and half truths. That continued to be a recurring feature of his evidence.</p>

Throughout the periods of time they were in France they remained named on housing applications in this jurisdiction. This was supported by the father signing a tenancy agreement on 24 October 2011 which named all four children, including the three youngest, as being occupants of the home. Both DN and GN remained registered at RB Primary school. The father&#8217;s attempt to distance GN from attending that school was against the weight of the evidence. She had been attending that school since January 2010. If it had really been intended to be a permanent move to France in July 2011 there would have been no reason to continue their enrolment at the school after that date. All the children remained registered with the family GP. The fact that the mother was able to open a bank account in France and apply for, and receive, state benefits doesn&#8217;t, of itself, connote a change of habitual residence, without considering all the other factors and the wider evidence.</p>

Whilst it was said by the parents they agreed on 12 October 2011 that GN was going to return to France after the half term holiday; that was not communicated to RB Primary School. Whilst the evidence does establish that the children were all enrolled for school with insurance (GN and GRN) and childcare centre (CMN) in France that cannot be looked at in isolation of what school places had been retained in England. In particular, the school places here were not retained by default; when asked about DN and GN`s  whereabouts the father did not say they were not returning to the RB Primary School. On the contrary, by his answers he implied they were going to return.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Tenthly, the children had lived with the father since the parent&#8217;s separation. Whilst the mother did return and see the children the parents have given inconsistent accounts as to frequency, and whether she stayed overnight. For example, the father, in his oral evidence at the criminal trial, said that the mother did not stay overnight. In France the mother had obtained some temporary accommodation, but it was not permanent. On the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October the father signed a tenancy agreement with the local authority in which he stated all four children were occupants of the property in London. The tenancy agreement was clear in its terms.</p>

The mother had never been there before. She came here from Cameroon in January 2008 and England was her home prior to 22 July 2011. Neither party had any relatives in France save for the mother&#8217;s aunt, Mme Tu, who lived in Tours and whom the children had not met.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Twelthly, the father continued to claim state benefits here, as if the children remained living here or were expected to return in the near future. He conceded he claimed and had been paid child benefit for all the children from 22 July 2011 to date. He agreed he had been paid child tax credit until June 2012. Continuing to receive these benefits was wholly inconsistent with an agreed plan between the parents for a permanent move to France.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">For the reasons outlined above I am entirely satisfied it is more likely than not that the younger three children were habitually resident in England and Wales throughout 2011. The periods of time the mother and all/some of the children spent in France during 2011 did not change that position. As a result this court does have jurisdiction to determine the applications before it. In the light of this conclusion it is not necessary for the court to consider any issue of prorogation.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is no issue that the threshold is met in relation to DN. It is quite clear the evidence establishes she did suffer significant harm. Both the mother and father have been convicted of serious offences relating to harm they have each caused to Danielle. They do not seek to go behind those convictions, but in their oral evidence there was no real acknowledgement by them of what they had actually done. The father still denies harming DN in any way. The mother&#8217;s evidence was in some respects chilling, particularly in her complete failure to empathise in any way with what happened to  DN, particularly when her head was injured by the father. She sought to maintain that the father was a good father. It is difficult to know if this was due to her own failure to empathise, or was a consequence of the dynamics of her relationship with the father.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is an issue about the risk of significant harm to the younger three children. Neither parent accepts this. A central plank of the local authority&#8217;s case is that the younger children are at risk of significant harm from both parents as a result of the history of care and harm that was caused to DN. This risk is enhanced by the parents&#8217; failure to accept the convictions in relation to DN. I agree. Having had the opportunity to observe the parents give their evidence I am satisfied there is a risk of significant harm being caused to the younger three children. This is not only due to the convictions relating to serious harm caused to DN , but also the failure by either of the parents to accept any responsibility or display any regret for what happened to DN.</p>
