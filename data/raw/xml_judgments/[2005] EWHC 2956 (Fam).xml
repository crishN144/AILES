He fled Iraq after years of persecution, imprisonment and torture. There is undisputed expert medical evidence that he suffers Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the torture and imprisonment.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">On 19 June 2004, when she was only 15, K was unlawfully married by her family to Mr A (aka Dr K) a man aged 27. Mr A, as I shall refer to him, is a medical doctor who, as I understand it, was at the time employed in that capacity by the National Health Service. The marriage ceremony was a religious ceremony which took place before an Imam in a mosque in a British city. I have been shown the formal document drawn up and signed by the Imam and have also been supplied with a translation. The &#8216;marriage&#8217;, whatever validity it may have in the law of Islam, is, of course, void as a matter of English law: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref>. There is forensic evidence showing that the marriage was consummated (see below). According to the police, Mr A admitted in the course of an interview on 7 January 2005 that he knew K was under age. On the face of it, Mr A has on his own admission committed an offence under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/9/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 9(1)</ref> and 9(2) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sexual Offences Act 2003</ref> carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years&#8217; imprisonment. That assumes that the sexual intercourse was consensual. If not, he will have committed the offence of rape contrary to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, an offence carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.    </p>

She alleged that she had been raped by Mr A and physically assaulted by her father until she consented to sexual intercourse with Mr A. The GP made a referral to social services. K was put under police protection and placed at an undisclosed address the same day. On 22 and 24 July 2004 Achieving Best Evidence interviews were conducted. K alleged that between 19 June 2004 and 10 July 2004 she had been physically assaulted, beaten, tied up and threatened by her father, including threats to kill her. This continued until she had agreed to engage in sexual intercourse with Mr A. She repeated her allegations of rape by Mr A. A medical examination on 23 July 2004 revealed no forensic evidence, nor any injuries. </p>

K was placed with foster carers at an undisclosed address. An application for a care order was issued on 17 September 2004. On 21 September 2004 K was placed with family friends following her refusal to remain in the foster placement. The local authority&#8217;s application for an interim care order came before the court on 23 September 2004. At that hearing the mother entered into a detailed written agreement with the local authority and the matter proceeded by way of the &#8216;no order&#8217; principle. K remained with family friends. The matter was listed for further directions on 15 October 2004. K attended the hearing and stated that she wished to return home to her parents. Again the local authority entered into a written agreement with the parents to ensure K&#8217;s safety at home. A further directions hearing was listed on 11 November 2004. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">On 11 November 2004 K came to court, made a number of allegations against her father and stated that she was very unhappy at home. There was an unpleasant scene after the hearing between K and her mother. K refused to go home. As it was very late and the local authority was unable to find K a placement the guardian identified a hotel for K to spend the night. The case returned to court the next day (12 November 2004) when an interim care order was made for seven days. The local authority&#8217;s care plan was for K to stay in foster care. The foster carer became so concerned about K&#8217;s behaviour that K spent two nights in hospital where she was seen by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist who concluded that she had an adjustment disorder and mild depression. K was then placed in a unit for young Muslim girls but left the following day and refused to return. She went missing from 5.45pm on 16 November 2004 until midnight on 17 November 2004 when she arrived at a family friend&#8217;s home. She claimed that she had spent three nights sleeping in a public park. The family friend alerted the police and K was placed in a girls unit on 18 November 2004. </p>

She spoke to the judge (District Judge Crichton) and stated that she wished to return home. She had previously talked of suicide and presented as fragile and volatile in her mood. The local authority sought a secure accommodation order with a view to carrying out a full psychiatric assessment. The application for a secure accommodation order was fully supported by the guardian but opposed by K and her parents. The District Judge made a secure accommodation order and an interim care order, both for four weeks and therefore expiring on 17 December 2004. He transferred the matter to the PRFD for hearing on 25 November 2004. K was placed in a secure unit. Arrangements were made for her to see a child and adolescent psychiatrist, Dr T, on 26 November 2004. Dr T provided a report dated 2 December 2004. </p>

He considered the matter complex and transferred it to the High Court. On 29 November 2004 the local authority was advised by the police that if K were to return home she might be killed. There was an ongoing police investigation by the specialist community liaison group at Scotland Yard. A secure accommodation review panel met on 14 December 2004 at the secure unit.  </p>

I made an order authorizing the local authority to keep K in secure accommodation until 12 January 2005 and an interim care order for the same period. Dr T provided a further report dated 27 December 2004, stating that K would like to die, but was more likely to self harm, and that she was at risk. A medical report dated 5 January 2005 expressed the opinion that it was not possible to state definitively whether K remains a virgin.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">The matter returned to court before me on 17 January 2005. It was agreed that K could return home, the father having sworn an oath on the Koran that no harm would come to K when she came home. Arrangements were made for K to receive psychotherapy once a week and for an assessment at the Marlborough Family Centre. This assessment was to be undertaken on behalf of the parents; the local authority was not to be involved in any way with it due to the mistrust the parents had of the local authority. I made an order for securing K&#8217;s passport and granted injunctions prohibiting the parents from obtaining travel documents and/or a passport for K (whether from the Iraqi Embassy, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office or the Passport Office) and prohibiting them from removing K for the jurisdiction of England and Wales without the express written approval of the court. </p>

By then the estimated length of the hearing, which had earlier been reduced to five days, had been further reduced from five days to two. Serious delay had been caused by the family&#8217;s failure to provide the Marlborough Family Centre with a proper letter of instruction. It was then proposed that, instead of the Marlborough Family Centre, the work could be done by the local CAMHS. That was agreeable to the local authority, though it seems not to have been taken up by the family. The father attended a meeting in October 2005 but K has not attended any appointments. </p>

More recently, however, the police have contacted social services to inform them that the mother had told them that she has K&#8217;s &#8216;marriage sheet&#8217; &#8211; indeed, apparently she has had this all the time. The latest information I have been given is that forensic testing of the marriage sheet has produced results which have led the police to re-open their investigation of Mr A. Their intention, apparently, is to charge him with criminal offences, for the forensic tests seem to show that the &#8216;marriage&#8217; was indeed consummated. </p>

That was a case of a 26-year-old Nigerian Muslim man who entered into a potentially polygamous marriage in Nigeria with a Nigerian girl aged 13; both were domiciled in Nigeria and the marriage was valid according to Nigerian law.

Nothing was arranged without her express knowledge and consent; indeed she was enthusiastic for the wedding to take place. The arrangements that were made were in keeping with the family&#8217;s religious and cultural practice. K was aware of each step being taken. Her father would have expected the marriage to be consummated, but would not have expected or in anyway condoned the use of force &#8211; he would, says Ms Russell, view such behaviour as entirely wrong and inexcusable. But it is not considered acceptable for male family members to discuss with female family members intimate physical or sexual matters, so he did not discuss such matters with K at any time. He does not dispute her description of her treatment at Mr A&#8217;s hands, however he has not discussed it with her nor would he consider it appropriate to do so.  </p>

He has been concerned by those allegations, which are without foundation, not only because K made them but because of their effect, not only on him but on the family as a whole. The father, says Ms Russell, remains concerned that K may make further allegations. It was because of that fear, and because of his concern for her, and the effect on K and the rest of the family, that he was reluctant for her to return home at the inception of the proceedings. Although K has been at home for some months now, she has refused to attend school and has not kept appointments with her therapist, despite both parents encouraging her to do so. Indeed, says Ms Russell, her refusal is against their wishes as they believe it would be in her best interests to go for therapy and to continue her education. However they cannot force her to go; she is sixteen and a half years old. K is apparently expressing a wish to be married again and has told her solicitor she wants to marry and have a baby so as to parade before Mr A&#8217;s work-place carrying her baby. But her parents have not planned and are not planning a further wedding for her, either in this country or abroad. </p>

There is, she complains, no definition or outline of the way or ways that the father put his needs before K&#8217;s. There is no recognition of the needs of the rest of the family, of K&#8217;s siblings for whom the father is also responsible and who were frightened and distressed by the behaviour of the police. There is no acknowledgment of the fact that K, according to the father, expressly asked her parents to arrange a marriage for her. Neither parent believed that Mr A was anything other than an honourable person who would treat K properly and with respect. Moreover there was considerable concern on the father&#8217;s part that if K made further allegations about him the police would again become involved and again cause distress and fear to his other children. It is not clear, she says, what he was supposed to do to show he was &#8220;putting K&#8217;s needs before&#8221; his own, a nebulous concept at best, she says, and without meaning here. </p>

It considers that the issues raised in this case are very concerning. K was &#8216;married&#8217; when she was 15 years of age. She has made extremely serious allegations of sexual abuse against her &#8216;husband&#8217;, Mr A. She has had periods of time when she has been estranged from her family and has made serious allegations of physical abuse against her father. She has said that the divorce brought shame on the family. At one point whilst K was in secure accommodation (on 29 November 2004) the local authority was told by the police that if K were to return home she would be killed. The local authority has also received advice from The Muslim Law (Sharia) Council UK that K would be at risk if she left this country in the foreseeable future, particularly if she returned to Iraq.  </p>

It has had difficulties working with the parents to support K. The parents have mistrusted the local authority. The present social worker has managed to maintain a working and civil relationship with K and the parents although more recently K appears to have withdrawn her cooperation. (In the six weeks prior to the hearing K did not engage with the social worker and missed a number of appointments.) The local authority fears that in the absence of an order and on-going court proceedings the family&#8217;s cooperation, which has been limited to date, may be further withdrawn. Ms Youll submits that, although K presently says that she will not cooperate with social services, that is not, of itself, reason enough for the court to refuse to make a supervision order. </p>

While the family has not welcomed the involvement of social services the family has, over the last nine months when there has been no order, cooperated to enable the social worker to meet with K at the family home. They have also attended, to a limited extent, the CAMHS services offered, and facilitated K&#8217;s attendance for counselling. The guardian is concerned that the making of an order against the parents&#8217; wishes will make them less likely to seek and utilise the support of social services in the future. </p>

They are that I have a girl aged almost 17, and her parents, who are unwilling to cooperate with public authorities if required by order to do so. Compulsion was recognised as long ago as January 2005 to be no longer appropriate. K has been living at home for some time now, without the local authority having the benefit of any kind of public law order at all. It is clear that, whatever may remain to be done, things are much better for K now than they have been for quite some time. Relations between K and her parents seem much improved. There has been no recent repetition of the florid episodes of a year ago. To an extent, K and her family have been able to cooperate with the local authority despite the absence of any formal order. That cooperation is much less than might be thought desirable, but I do not think that a supervision order is going to improve matters, or increase the chances of cooperation; if anything the reverse.  </p>

The mother says she has had to try to balance K&#8217;s interests with those of her other children and this will remain a concern for her for the foreseeable future. K&#8217;s interests within the family, therefore, cannot be seen in isolation from those of her siblings. It is not for lack of a willingness to cooperate that the parents did not want the other children involved in social work visits during the course of these proceedings or in family therapy or in other ways, but rather due to a concern that they may become involved in K&#8217;s particular difficulty. But the mother is content for K to continue to see and to speak to the social worker, outside the home, after the conclusion of the proceedings.  </p>

K has stated very clearly that she will not cooperate with any supervision order which the court might make at the conclusion of the final hearing. Furthermore, she has stated more than once her wish to be married and put her &#8216;marriage&#8217; to Mr A behind her. Although this might be a course of action of which the court, her parents and the social worker do not approve, it appears to be something that K wants very much. The mother thinks that K may be correct in her belief that it may be the only way for her to recover from her current very unhappy emotional state. The mother has tried to discourage K from the idea of remarriage but she remains resolute. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">The mother is concerned that if K is not allowed to remarry or to marry legitimately, she may do something much worse. She does not know what but gives some examples: she might self harm; she might abscond; or she might enter into a sexual relationship in any event. The mother does not want any of these things to happen to K. Furthermore, the mother believes that it would be preferable for K to be in a marriage than in a sexual relationship outside marriage. This would be better and safer from an emotional and also from a cultural point of view. The mother would refer to the very serious consequences culturally, not only for K but also for her siblings, in the event that she was to have a sexual relationship outside marriage. If she were to do this, the chances of ever securing a legitimate Islamic marriage in the future would be very poor &#8211; definitely for K and more than likely for K&#8217;s sisters. These are, says Ms Kirby, very real concerns that the mother has and which she wishes to draw to the court&#8217;s attention. Furthermore, the mother wishes the court to recognise that it must take the responsibility for any of these things happening in the event that I make an order forbidding a marriage before K&#8217;s eighteenth birthday. </p>

The guardian is concerned that K is expressing a wish to marry again before the age of 18. She believes such action would be contrary to K&#8217;s welfare needs. She also believes that the likelihood of K precipitously entering into a further marriage is increased should she travel to Iraq or Kurdistan. In addition the guardian is concerned that K&#8217;s safety and welfare would be jeopardised were she to travel to these areas, due to the political instability and uncertainty as to arrangements for her care. She believes the court should retain control of K&#8217;s passport to ensure any travel abroad is monitored by the court. She therefore supports the court taking control of K&#8217;s passport and making orders under the inherent jurisdiction to prohibit K marrying or travelling abroad without leave of the court.

As Cretney points out, one of the effects of Lord Hardwicke&#8217;s Act (the Clandestine Marriages Act 1753) was to require parental consent to the marriage of an infant (or, as would now say, a child). The current requirement is to be found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref>. Thus ever since Lord Hardwicke&#8217;s Act there has been a gap between the minimum age for marriage, which always has been and still is an age below the age of majority, and the age for free marriage, that is the age at which a person, having attained his majority, can marry without the need for parental consent.  </p>

The problem which became one of increasing concern was not so much that young people were marrying but rather that they were (notwithstanding the provisions of the criminal law) having sex and conceiving and bearing children &#8230; Confident statements made by official bodies in the late 1960s &#8211; for example, that the trend then observed to earlier marriage would continue, and that because boys and girls become sexually mature at an earlier age than their parents it followed, not only that they would feel &#8216;sexual desire and be sexually at risk at an earlier age&#8217; but also that because of this &#8216;more of them are likely to decide to get married&#8217; &#8211; have been completely falsified by events.&#8221; </p>

I should be surprised if many judges in recent years have actually had to consider whether or not a ward of court should be allowed to enter into some proposed marriage or had occasion to consider the same question under any other statutory or non-statutory jurisdiction. And a judge if faced with such a case might find the task of deciding whether or not to give consent a matter of no little delicacy and difficulty. Cretney tells us that, once upon a time, when considering the suitability of a particular marriage, the court would be concerned that there should be a &#8220;fair equality of rank and fortune&#8221; between the couple and that a proper settlement of the girl&#8217;s property was made. Such an approach is hardly suited to current conditions.  </p>

And supposing the judge says no. Is that really likely to serve the child&#8217;s best interests? The only effect of what may be perceived by a defiant teenager as paternalism of the most patronising kind is likely to be either a continuation of the relationship, openly or clandestinely, without the benefit of matrimony or a hardening of attitude with the child merely counting off the days until she or he can escape from the court&#8217;s fetters.  </p>

Traditionally, wardship was a remedy invoked by parents seeking the court&#8217;s assistance in reinforcing the parental right to object to an unsuitable marriage of which the parents disapproved. Today, the inherent and wardship jurisdictions are more likely to be invoked by a local authority, or even the child, seeking the court&#8217;s assistance in overriding parental pressures to enter into a marriage which the parents desire but which the local authority or child wants to prevent. Traditionally the court&#8217;s powers were invoked in support of parents and parental rights. Now they tend to be invoked in opposition to parents and in order to prevent the abuse of parental power. The paradigm case, and the situation where the appropriate exercise of the court&#8217;s powers is most urgently and imperatively required, is, of course, the forced marriage. In this context the court continues to play an absolutely vital role.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">Secondly, and again in common with Sumner J (see at paras [101]-[102]), I think that the court is justified in intervening in this kind of case where there is a real possibility of harm, in the sense in which the words were used in <span style="font-style:italic">In re H and others (Minor) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] AC 563" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] AC 563</ref>. That, after all, accords with Lord Eldon&#8217;s approach. And, particularly in this context, we need to bear in mind that prevention is better than cure. As Singer J pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re SK (Proposed Plaintiff) (An Adult by way of her Litigation Friend) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/3202" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 2 FLR 230" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 2 FLR 230</ref>, at para [4], a forced marriage is voidable, but that alone is plainly not an adequate remedy because, as he went on to observe, such a &#8220;marriage&#8221; is &#8220;nevertheless one which might engender irreparable and severe physical and emotional consequences for its victim.&#8221; So the protective jurisdiction is particularly important where the need is to take preventive steps in advance. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">This leads me on to the third point. We must guard against the risk of stereotyping. We must be careful to ensure that our understandable concern to protect vulnerable children (or, indeed, vulnerable young adults) does not lead us to interfere inappropriately &#8211; and if inappropriately then unjustly &#8211; with families merely because they cleave, as this family does, to mores, to cultural beliefs, more or less different from what is familiar to those who view life from a purely Euro-centric perspective. It would be a tragic irony if the full weight of the wardship jurisdiction was to be deployed against those sections of our community who, paying particular regard to the importance of marriage and to the unacceptability of pre-marital sexual relations, tend for that very reason to marry young, whilst leaving untouched those sections of our community who, treating pre-marital sexual relations and co-habitation without the benefit of matrimony as almost the norm, tend for that reason not to marry until they are well into their twenties. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">It would be idle to dispute that K is at risk and that she is, although almost 17, a child who in certain respects is still rather vulnerable. But it is important to identify and so far as possible to evaluate the degree of that risk. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">Despite what has happened I do not think that K&#8217;s parents pose a very significant degree of risk to her. I repeat: there are no findings of physical abuse by the father; the local authority has not established that this is a case of forced marriage; it was an arranged marriage, and arranged, as I have said, in circumstances and in a manner acceptable in the context of the family&#8217;s beliefs and cultural mores. Moreover, K has been living at home, it would seem reasonably happily, for some months, without the protection of either a care order or any order preventing her marriage and in circumstances where there is no suggestion that she has come to any further harm. Furthermore, the local authority has accepted &#8211; in my judgment properly and responsibly accepted &#8211; that this is not a case where it needs to share parental responsibility for K with her parents. Indeed, I have decided, with the support of K&#8217;s guardian, that it is not appropriate for me to make even a supervision order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">My impression is that K&#8217;s parents are decent, honest people, primarily motivated by concern for the welfare of K and, indeed, the welfare of all their children. Through the proceedings and the police investigation they have learned what I am sure has for them been a very painful lesson. Much, though not of course all, the explanation for what has gone wrong is to be found in what it is fashionable to call a clash of civilisations, working itself out against the background of the father&#8217;s horrific experiences at the hands of Saddam Hussein. K&#8217;s parents are, I believe, law-abiding people who seek to make their home in this country; indeed, as I understand it, they are currently seeking naturalisation. I may be wrong, but I see them as people who, having once fallen foul of the system, will now want to strive to avoid any repetition. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">The greater risk, I suspect, is not so much that K&#8217;s parents will seek to do anything inappropriate but rather that K herself may wish to marry, perhaps in circumstances disapproved of by her parents. That, of course, is a risk that needs to be guarded against. Indeed, as I understand it, that is the risk that the guardian has particularly in mind. But a number of other factors have also to be borne in mind.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">The first is that the law &#8211; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76" uk:canonical="1949 (12, 13 &amp; 14 Geo. 6) c. 76" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Marriage Act 1949</ref> &#8211; reposes in parents the primary responsibility of protecting their minor children against inappropriate marriages. The court should be slow to intervene unless there is real reason to fear that parental responsibility alone will not suffice to give adequate protection. Secondly, there is the fact that if I make K a ward of court it is almost certain that she, and indeed her family, will simply decline, on principle, to make any application to the court for permission for K to marry. I say it is a fact. I make that finding on the basis of what I have been told by or on behalf of both K and her parents. In other words, if I make K a ward of court I will probably in reality be deciding, here and now, that she is not to marry until she is 18. That may be as a result of her choice, her family&#8217;s choice, rather than because of the strict terms of any order I might make, but it is nonetheless the practical reality. And it is at this point that I have, as it seems to me, to have regard to what I accept are the very real concerns raised by Ms Kirby on the mother&#8217;s behalf (see in particular paragraph [65] above). There are, in my judgment, and very much for the reasons identified by Ms Kirby, serious potential disadvantages for K if I seek to control her marriage. Those disadvantages, those risks, have to be evaluated and put in the scale against the disadvantages, the risks, if I do not make the order. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">I appreciate that on this aspect of the case I am departing from the considered recommendations of the guardian. But at the end of the day I have to form my own view and come to my own judgment. Evaluating on the one hand the risks to K if I do not make the order, against what I am satisfied are the risks to her if I do make the order, I think the balance comes down in favour of there being no order in relation to her marriage. I make it clear that a significant part of the calculus reflects my evaluation that, on the one hand, the risk presented to K by her parents is small, whereas the risks identified by her mother if I make the order sought are significant. In this particular case, K&#8217;s interests are appropriately met, indeed in my judgment best </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.47in;margin-right:0in">Thus far I have been focussing primarily on the issue of marriage. For very much the same reasons I have concluded that I should not make any order restricting K&#8217;s ability to travel. I was attracted at one stage by the idea of permitting her to travel to (say) western Europe and Scandinavia but not any further afield. But at the end of the day I agree that this would be an unnecessary and disproportionate intrusion in K&#8217;s life. She is, after all, almost 17. She is not, to repeat, at significant risk of any harm from her parents. I accept that her parents are motivated, as I have said, by concern for her welfare. I do not believe they are going to take her abroad, let alone to Iraq, for any inappropriate or potentially damaging reason.  </p>
