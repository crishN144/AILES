Although the facts of the case concern testamentary guardians rather than natural parents, it has become clear as the case progressed that it would make no difference to the arguments if K&#8217;s parents were alive and themselves exercising parental responsibility.</p>

Keehan J considered the argument, advanced on behalf of the Trust, that D&#8217;s parents could not consent to the deprivation of liberty at [49]. At [55] onwards the Judge took into account D's condition in determining what decisions would fall within the zone of parental responsibility:</p>

Thus a decision to keep such a 15 year old boy under constant supervision and control would undoubtedly be considered an inappropriate exercise of parental responsibility and would probably amount to ill treatment. The decision to keep an autistic 15 year old boy who has erratic, challenging and potentially harmful behaviours under constant supervision and control is a quite different matter; to do otherwise would be neglectful. In such a case I consider the decision to keep this young person under constant supervision and control is the proper exercise of parental responsibility.</span></p>

The Judge held that the parents could no longer consent to the deprivation of his liberty once D had become 16. Keehan J held that once a child reached the age of 16 Parliament had afforded them a special legal status to those who had not yet attained the age of 16, see [103] to [115] of the judgment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> That decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal. Sir James Munby P, in a comprehensive and closely reasoned judgment on behalf of the Court, overturned Keehan J&#8217;s decision. The Court of Appeal held that a parent could in principle consent to the deprivation of liberty of a child under the age of 18 if they had not attained <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competence, see [125]. The Court of Appeal held that Keehan J had not properly applied the principle in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick v West Norfolk Health Authority</span> [1986] AC 112 that the exercise of parental responsibility continued until the child attained <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competence. Although subsequently overruled by the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment remains highly relevant to the issues before me concerning under 16 year olds. I will refer to some of the detail of that judgment below. </p>

Do the restrictions fall within normal parental control for a child of this age or do they not? If they do, they will not fall within the scope of article 5 ; but if they go beyond the normal parental control, article 5 will apply (subject to the question of whether parental consent negates limb (b) of the Storck criteria, see para 42 below). Quite clearly, the degree of supervision and control to which D was subject while in Placement B and Placement C was not normal for a child of 16 or 17 years old. It would have amounted to a deprivation of liberty in the case of a child of that age who did not lack capacity. The question then arises what difference, if any, does D's mental disability make?</span></p>

Thus a teenager of the same age and familial background as MIG and MEG is the relevant comparator for them. If one compares their state with a person of similar age and full capacity it is clear that their liberty is in fact circumscribed. They may not be conscious, much less resentful, of the constraint but, objectively, limitations on their freedom are in place.</span></p>

This adjusts with their maturation and change in circumstances. If MIG and MEG had the same freedom from constraint as would any child or young person of similar age, their liberty would not be restricted, whatever their level of disability. As a matter of objective fact, however, constraints beyond those which apply to young people of full ability are - and have to be - applied to them. There is therefore a restriction of liberty in their cases. Because the restriction of liberty is - and must remain - a constant feature of their lives, the restriction amounts to a deprivation of liberty."</span></p>

They were entitled to the same human rights, including the right to liberty, as any other human being. The fact that the arrangements might be made in their best interests, for the most benign of motives, did not mean that they were not deprived of their liberty. They were entitled to the protection of article 5 , precisely so that it could be independently ascertained whether the arrangements were indeed in their best interests.</span></p>

Limb (a) of the three Storck criteria for a deprivation of liberty (see para 1 above) has been met. There was, however, an argument that the consent of D's parents supplied a substitute for the consent of the person confined, so that limb (b) was not met. It suited counsel in Cheshire West (as recorded in the last sentence of para 41) to argue that Nielsen should be regarded as a case of substituted consent, because no person has the right to give such consent on behalf of a mentally incapacitated adult. But, as also pointed out in Cheshire West , it is striking that the European Court of Human Rights has consistently held that limb (b) can be satisfied despite the consent of a person with the legal right to make decisions on behalf of the person concerned: see Stanev v Bulgaria (2012) 55 EHRR 696 , DD v Lithuania [2012] MHLR 209 , Kedzior v Poland [2013] MHLR 115 , Mihailovs v Latvia , unreported, and now Stankov v Bulgaria [2015] 42 ECtHR 276 . In Stanev , the court did observe, in passing, that "there are situations where the wishes of a person with impaired mental facilities may be validly replaced by those of another person acting in the context of a protective measure and that it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the true wishes or preferences of the person concerned" (para 130). However, as Keehan J observed in the Court of Protection (para 118) that is very far from adopting a general principle of substituted consent. The consent of a legal guardian may have been sufficient to make the confinement lawful in the domestic law of the country concerned, but that did not prevent its being a deprivation of liberty, or guarantee that it fulfilled the Convention requirement of legality. In the cases where limb (b) has been held to be satisfied, it is because the evidence showed that the person concerned was willing to stay where he or she was and was capable of expressing that view. Parental consent, therefore, cannot substitute for the subjective element in limb (b) of Storck.&#8221;</span></p>

But it would be a startling proposition that it lies within the scope of parental responsibility for a parent to license the state to violate the most fundamental human rights of a child: a parent could not, for example, authorise the state to inflict what would otherwise be torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon his child. Likewise, section 25 of the Children Act 1989 recognises that a parent cannot authorise the State to deprive a child of his liberty by placing him in secure accommodation. While this proposition may not hold good for all the Convention rights, in particular the qualified rights which may be restricted in certain circumstances, it must hold good for the most fundamental rights - to life, to be free from torture or ill-treatment, and to liberty. In any event, the state could not do that which it is under a positive obligation to prevent others from doing.</span></p>

Although there is no doubt that they, and indeed everyone else involved, had D's best interests at heart, we cannot ignore the possibility, nay even the probability, that this will not always be the case. That is why there are safeguards required by article 5 . Without such safeguards, there is no way of ensuring that those with parental responsibility exercise it in the best interests of the child, as the Secretaries of State acknowledge that they must. In this case, D enjoyed the safeguard of the proceedings in the Court of Protection. In future, the deprivation of liberty safeguards contained in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (as amended by the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Act 2019 ) will apply to children of 16 and 17. I would therefore allow this appeal and invite the parties' submissions on how best to incorporate this conclusion in a declaration.</span></p>

The common law may draw a sharp distinction, in relation to the deprivation of liberty, between those who have reached the age of 16 and those who have not, but the extent to which that affects the analysis under the Human Rights Act is not clear to me and we have heard no argument upon it. I therefore prefer to express no view upon the question. Nor would I express any view on the extent of parental responsibility in relation to other matters, such as serious and irreversible medical treatment, which do not entail a deprivation of liberty. Some reference to this was made in the course of argument, but it does not arise in this case, which is solely concerned with depriving 16 and 17-year-olds of their liberty.

In my view, as I said above, it is of real significance that in Gillick, the House of Lords were dealing with a materially different issue. The respondent recognises that the focus of Gillick was specific to the issue of consent to medical treatment of children under 16, but invites this court to conclude that the test laid down there applies beyond that scope and up to the age of majority. I accept that certain things that were said in Gillick were capable of being interpreted as applying to a situation such as the present, but it would not, in my view, be appropriate to interpret them in that way, so as to draw into the Gillick net a situation which is diametrically opposed to that with which the House was concerned (not the tempering of parental responsibility in relation to the under 16 age group, but its expansion in relation to those aged 16 and 17 so as to give it a role which would not otherwise be afforded by the common law). My unwillingness to adopt this interpretation is reinforced by what I perceive to be the distinct, and rather special, features of the field of deprivation of liberty with which we are here concerned. It follows that the rights of a parent in relation to restricting the liberty of a child remain, at common law, as described in Hewer v Bryant . The inescapable result of that is, I think, that it is not within the scope of parental responsibility for parents to give authority for their 16 year old child to be confined in a way which would, absent consent, amount to a deprivation of liberty. In so saying, I do not intend in any way to water down the important changes brought about by Gillick or to alter the way in which it has been applied in many spheres of family law. I have only been concerned to consider its application in the very specific context of confinement of children of the ages of 16 to 18.</span></p>

It could be argued, for example, that the Gillick decision is more readily applicable to under 16s than to over 16s, given that this was the age group with which the House was concerned. It would then be arguable that the position in relation to that group was as the President set out at para 85 of his judgment (quoted above) ie that the parental ability to restrict a child's liberty continues to be as described by Sachs LJ in Hewer v Bryant , but with a Gillick test rather than the previous fixed ages. But the effect of this, applied to a child who lacked capacity, would not be to leave a gap in the parent's powers to cater for the particular needs of a child with disability. On the contrary, the child not having attained Gillick capacity, there would be nothing to bring to an end the parent's common law power to confine the child as required in the child's interests. To put it in the terms used in this appeal, it would remain within the ambit or zone of the parent's parental responsibility. However, there would, no doubt, be other arguments to be aired on the point, and I have not formed even a preliminary view about it.</span></p>

For me, this reinforces the conclusion to which Lady Hale has come by the route she sets out in paras 42 to 49 of her judgment. She concludes, in para 50, by saying that logically her conclusion would also apply for a younger child, but I would prefer to leave this separate question entirely open, to be decided in a case where it arises. I should also stress, before moving on to the discrete issue in relation to section 25 of the Children Act 1989 and its potential application to living arrangements such as D's, that I have been looking specifically at the common law power of a parent in relation to a child's liberty. I have not intended to cast doubt on any existing understanding about the operation of parental responsibility in different spheres of a child's life. And nothing that I have said is intended to cast any doubt on the powers of the courts, recognised in the early cases to which I have referred, and still available today in both the parens patriae jurisdiction and under statute, notably the Children Act 1989 , to make orders in the best interests of children up to the age of majority, with due regard to their wishes and those of their parents, but not dictated by them.&#8221;</span></p>

In practice most wise parents relax their control gradually as the child develops and encourage him or her to become increasingly independent. Moreover, the degree of parental control actually exercised over a particular child does in practice vary considerably according to his understanding and intelligence and it would, in my opinion, be unrealistic for the courts not to recognise these facts.

The care and upbringing of children normally and necessarily require that the parents or an only parent decide where the child must reside and also impose, or authorise others to impose, various restrictions on the child&#8217;s liberty. Thus the children in a school or other educational or recreational institution must abide by certain rules which limit their freedom of movement and their liberty in other respects. Likewise a child may have to be hospitalised for medical treatment. Family life in this sense, and especially the rights of parents to exercise parental authority over their children, having due regard to their corresponding parental responsibilities, is recognised and protected by the Convention, in particular by article 8 . Indeed the exercise of parental rights constitutes a fundamental element of family life.</span></p>

However, it does not follow that the present case falls within the ambit of article 5 . The restrictions imposed on the applicant were not of a nature or degree *1801 similar to the cases of deprivation of liberty specified in paragraph 1 of article 5 &#8230; Indeed, the restrictions to which the applicant was subject were no more than the normal requirements for the care of a child of 12 years of age receiving treatment in hospital. The conditions in which the applicant stayed thus did not, in principle, differ from those obtaining in many hospital wards where children with physical disorders are treated. Regarding the weight which should be given to the applicant&#8217;s views as to his hospitalisation, the court considers that he was still of an age at which it would be normal for a decision to be made by the parent even against the wishes of the child. There is no evidence of bad faith on the part of the mother. Hospitalisation was decided upon by her in accordance with expert medical advice. It must be possible for a child like the applicant to be admitted to hospital at the request of the holder of parental rights, a case which clearly is not covered by paragraph 1 of article 5 &#8230;</span></p>

This means that he requires far more supervision and attention than any normal parent could reasonably provide or be expected to provide, and in accommodation which none of them have, that is accommodation provided for the very purpose of restricting a child&#8217;s freedom. This is miles away from &#8216;grounding&#8217; a teenager, or ensuring that a group of teenagers at a boarding school are all back within school bounds by a certain time each evening, or any other manifestation of normal parental control. If the restrictions necessarily imposed on K for his own safety and that of others were imposed on an ordinary boy of 15, who did not pose the problems requiring a secure accommodation order, in my view, there would be a strong case that his parents were ill-treating him.&#8221;</span></p>

This power rests on the common law principle in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hewer v Bryant.</span> He points out that both Lady Hale at [48] and Lady Black at [88] in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D</span> refer to the possibility of the parents authorising the State to detain the child, although both reject that power in respect of a 16 year old child. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Hunt, on behalf of the Guardian, takes what might be perceived to be a more straightforward approach. She submits that the Court should follow Keehan J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Trust A</span> and the analysis of Sir James Munby in the court of Appeal and hold that a parent may exercise parental responsibility to consent on behalf of a child to care and support arrangements which amount to complete supervision and control until a child is 16. She points to the fact that there are strong similarities between the present case and that of Child D at the time of Keehan J&#8217;s first decision.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The conclusion I have reached is that a parent can consent to a deprivation of liberty within <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Storck</span> component (b) for a child under 16, who lacks <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competence, where there is no dispute that such a deprivation is in the child&#8217;s best interests. As I have explained above, none of the previous domestic cases are binding upon me in respect of the role of parental consent for under 16 year olds. On the other hand, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Nielsen</span> expressly dealt with the point and the ECtHR found the deprivation of liberty in that case did fall within the parental power to deprive a child of his/her liberty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> I agree with Munby P that, using the language of the subsequent case of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Storck</span>, the ECtHR in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Nielsen</span> at [73] was finding that the mother could consent to the child being deprived of his liberty in the hospital. It is possible to analyse the case as finding that the mother was able to &#8220;authorise&#8221; the State, through the hospital, to deprive the child of his liberty. However, in my view, that introduces an extra and unnecessary level of complication into the analysis. It is simpler, and more in keeping with the domestic caselaw, to see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Nielsen</span> as being about the child&#8217;s deprivation of liberty falling within the scope of parental responsibility. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The power of parents to exercise custody over their children, or in modern parlance, to deprive children of their liberty, has long been accepted by the common law, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hewer v Bryant</span>. That power in respect of under 16 year olds has not been removed by statute. There can be no doubt that in respect of very young children, as Lord Kerr phrased it, they can be restrained to a point where <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Storck</span> (a) is met, whether in the family setting or in school or any other setting. </p>

There are a host of statutory provisions which mark the legal importance of attaining the age of 16, and the legal separation that gives between a child&#8217;s rights and those of his/her parents. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, the position is different for a child under 16 years old, both in common law and under the ECHR. It follows that the very nature of &#8220;family life&#8221; and therefore the protections under Article 8 for the parents&#8217; rights, will be different for a younger child. It is however critical to have in mind that the exercise of any parental rights in respect of a child must be for the benefit of the child. If the parent was exercising parental rights, including consenting to the deprivation of liberty, in a way which was said to be contrary to the child&#8217;s best interests then such a decision would no longer fall within the zone of parental responsibility. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the heart of the issue in this case is whether the Court should take the approach of Lord Scarman and Lord Fraser in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> and consider the scope of parental responsibility (and the powers inherent within it) as depending on the specific characteristics of the individual child. Alternatively, whether the Court should take the approach of Lord Kerr in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Cheshire West</span> and compare the child to a hypothetical child of the same age in deciding the extent of parental responsibility. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Lady Hale distinguished <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> at [24] in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D</span> on the grounds that it concerned medical treatment and not deprivation of liberty, which as a matter of fact is undoubtedly correct. However, I am not convinced that for under 16 year olds that distinction is critical to the principles that should apply in this case. In terms of the importance of the decision in question, the decision on medical treatment can be fundamental to the child&#8217;s life. In the most extreme cases it can determine whether the child lives or dies. If a parent consents to the treatment, then in the case of a non-<span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> competent child, that can lead directly to their death or to life changing medical treatment, simply on the basis of parental consent. The decision as to medical treatment can therefore be just as important, and just as much an intrusion into the child&#8217;s human rights, as any decision relating to Article 5. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Lady Hale said at [48] that the parent could not licence the State to intervene in the child&#8217;s fundamental human rights. However, the parent can consent in medical cases to such an intervention, so long as the clinical view is the intervention is in the child&#8217;s best interests. However, it is noteworthy that there is no requirement in every case, even the most serious medical treatment cases, for that decision to be approved by the Court. It is one for the parents falling within the zone of their parental responsibility, so long as the clinicians involved are satisfied it is in the child&#8217;s best interests. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not clear to me why a different approach should be taken to parental decisions about deprivation of liberty. Both Lady Hale and Lady Black relied on the fact that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick</span> involved contracting the boundaries of parental responsibility, whereas <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re D</span> might have been said to be extending them. However, as explained above, <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Hewer v Bryant</span> establishes the extent of such powers for parents, therefore this is not a case of expanding parental rights. In any event, it is clear, as I have set out above, that any exercise of such responsibility can only be undertaken in the child&#8217;s best interests. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">More fundamentally, when dealing with children, whose ability to understand the issues will vary greatly depending not simply on their age, but on their psychological and emotional maturity, their family support and their life experiences, in my view it is more appropriate to consider the characteristics of the individual child than try to compare them with a hypothetical child of the same age. Whereas it is appropriate to assume that someone over the age of 16 will have capacity, and therefore there is a benchmark to compare the non-capacitous adult with, that is a much more difficult and arguably less possible exercise for children under 16. For that reason, I prefer the approach of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Gillick </span>to consider the characteristics of the particular child. </p>
