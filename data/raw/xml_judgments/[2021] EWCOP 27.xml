The application was brought because since 2018, P has refused to take the antiretroviral medication she has been prescribed to treat her HIV. P has fixed delusional beliefs and ongoing auditory command hallucinations, and hears God telling her not to take her HIV medication, but rather to pray. P has also previously seen snakes emerge from her HIV medication.  </p>

The difference between taking and not taking the medication is, usually, the difference between life and death. In this case the medical evidence is that there was a 50% probability that P would die within a year if she were to continue to refuse to take the medication; by contrast if she took the medication then she could expect to enjoy a normal life expectancy reduced by 5 to 8 years. </p>

At that hearing, I made an order that it was in P&#8217;s best interests to take daily oral HIV medication, and I directed P to take the daily medication. It was hoped that the existence of such an order would result in P taking her HIV medication, even if begrudgingly, given that she takes her antipsychotic medication, albeit reluctantly, because of the existence of the CTO.  </p>

I believe that because P&#8217;s delusions are encapsulated and because she is coherent and not thought disordered she will, with assistance be able to participate in litigation proceedings and understand the process. She is also fully aware of the fact that her delusional belief system is at odds with her medical and psychiatric team&#8217;s advice, but nevertheless she remains adamant not to comply with that advice due to her delusions, hence the need for the application to the Court of Protection.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0.5in">Apart from P being guarded in presentation, her delusional system is quite limited to her beliefs that God communicates with her and tells her not to take medication, specifically her HIV medication. Despite the illogicality that such delusions imply, she is able to communicate and argue her viewpoint coherently. P is not thought disordered in terms of the form of her thought. P would be able to understand with appropriate assistance the issues on which her consent or decision is likely to be necessary during the course of these proceedings, even though she absolutely refutes that such proceedings are necessary. P would fully understand, retain and weigh the rules about confidentiality in such proceedings. Therefore, P has litigation capacity despite the fact that she does not have subject matter capacity.&#8221; </p>

The scope of her delusion is narrow and her cognition and ability to understand, retain and weigh up information is not otherwise affected. While it will be rare for a person to have litigation capacity who does not have subject matter capacity, it is possible in principle (see <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield City Council v E </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2808" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust v AB </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2020/40" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCOP 40" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCOP 40</ref>) and this is one of those rare cases.&#8221;  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;I now agree that P lacks litigation capacity, my reason for my change in opinion is that I have considered Michelle&#8217;s assessment (Exhibit RK1) and have spoken to her about P&#8217;s case. Michelle was able where I was not to ascertain that P did not think the proceedings related to her. Secondly, P&#8217;s refusal to read the court papers and to communicate with others about the proceedings would be replicated in refusal to engage with counsel in my opinion, to instruct and take expert evidence.&#8221; </p>

That document included a transcript of the meeting. It was clear from that transcript that P had failed to engage with Ms Grant&#8217;s questions as to these proceedings. She said that she did not want anything to do with court, that she was not going to take any medication, and that she would not attend court even if she had someone to support her. She did not answer when she was asked whether or not God still spoke with her and told her not to take her medication.  </p>

I therefore directed that before considering the substantive issue of P&#8217;s treatment, I would hear submissions from counsel, and evidence from Dr Kemp and Ms Grant, on the preliminary issue of whether or not P has litigation capacity.

Dr Kemp told me that a key factor in her change of mind as to P&#8217;s litigation capacity, which she said she herself had not picked up on when she performed her first capacity assessment, was that Ms Grant had picked up on the fact that P did not think these proceedings had anything to with her. Consequently, Dr Kemp was of the view that P may not be able to instruct counsel or take expert advice, as a result of being &#8216;closed off&#8217;, intransigent, unable to think logically, and believing that she did not need to be involved in the court process.  </p>

This is consistent with the principle that an individual who, by themself, lacks capacity on the subject matter in issue should be facilitated to make a capacitous decision on that subject matter by the taking of all practicable steps to help them to do so. Where a litigant in person lacks capacity to conduct proceedings absent advice and assistance and lacks capacity to instruct advisers, he or she will lack capacity to conduct proceedings. A question remains as to the position where a litigant in person lacks capacity to conduct proceedings in his or her own right but has capacity to instruct advisers to conduct those proceedings and <span style="font-style:italic">chooses</span> not to do so. However, for the reasons set out below, that is not the situation in this case and it is not therefore necessary for me to consider that point.&#8221; </p>

I differ because, as MacDonald J himself eloquently explained, conducting proceedings is a dynamic transactional exercise requiring continuous, shifting, reactive value judgments and strategic forensic decisions. This is the case even if the litigant has instructed the best solicitors and counsel in the business. In a proceeding such as this,  a litigant has to be mentally equipped not only to be able to follow what is going on, but also to be able figuratively to tug counsel&#8217;s gown and to pass her a stream of yellow post-it notes. In my opinion, a litigant needs the same capacity to conduct litigation whether she is represented or not.  </p>

The opposition expressed by P was, and is, completely irrational and directly contrary to her best interests. There is no doubt that she suffers from an impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, her mind. As a direct consequence it is clear that she cannot understand the information relevant to the administration of the antiretroviral medication, nor can she use or weigh it as part of her decision-making process. The assessment of P&#8217;s incapacity in this regard was open and shut, and was rightly made by Dr Kemp and Ms Grant. </p>

As indicated, the court has to decide for itself two separate questions concerning P&#8217;s capacity. First, it must decide whether P has capacity to decide to receive that medication and, if the answer is no, then go on to make the best interests decision under s.4 on her behalf. The second question is whether P has capacity to conduct the litigation. If the answer is no, then she must have a litigation friend to conduct the proceedings on her behalf. The answer to the first question does not depend on the answer to the second question. The court will make its decision on the first question irrespective of its decision on the second question. The second question merely determines how P conducts the proceedings. Does she do so directly either in person or by instructing lawyers, or does someone do so on her behalf? </p>

This understanding, and this weighing, will be the key drivers of the formation of the forensic decisions that she will  make in the litigation process. Thus, she weighs all the information, both written and spoken, to formulate instructions to her lawyers in order to equip them to cross-examine and advocate generally on her behalf.  </p>
