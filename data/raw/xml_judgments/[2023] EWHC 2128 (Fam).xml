They were taken by their mother without the knowledge or consent of their father.  They have been in this country ever since.  The abduction complete, the mother then wrongfully retained them in this jurisdiction.  Their father is deeply concerned.  He wants his daughters back in their home country.  The mother objects.  Since the parents cannot agree whether the children should return, this court must decide.  That is the essential purpose of this judgment.</p>

They were taken without his consent and in breach of his rights of custody.  The father has an Irish guardianship order which is equivalent to parental responsibility in respect of the eldest child D.  That was granted in 2011.  He also possesses guardianship in respect of the younger daughter E, because the parents cohabited with the children for 12 consecutive months after the relevant statute came into effect in the Republic of Ireland in 2016.  However, in November 2022 he applied to the Irish court formally for a guardianship order in respect of E and for access to both children.</p>

She accepts that the father did not consent to them living in England.  She also accepts that he has relevant rights of custody within the meaning of the Hague Convention.  However, she opposes the application on two bases: first, child objections under article 13 of the Convention; second, article 13(1)(b) - grave risk of harm or otherwise intolerable situation.</p>

Within the context of this tension between the need to evaluate the evidence against the civil standard of proof and the summary nature of the proceedings, the Supreme Court further made clear that the approach to be adopted in respect of the harm defence is not one that demands the court engage in a fact-finding exercise to determine the veracity of the matters alleged as grounding the defence under Art 13(b). Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest and then, if that risk meets the test in Art 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm can be identified.</span></p>

This may be relevant in a subsequent custody case but has no relevance to an Article 13(1)(b) analysis.

The exception itself is brought into play when only two conditions are met: first, that the child herself objects to being returned and second, that she has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of her views. These days, and especially in the light of article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, courts increasingly consider it appropriate to take account of a child's views. Taking account does not mean that those views are always determinative or even presumptively so. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11.5pt;color:#000000">Once the discretion comes into play, the court may have to consider the nature and strength of the child's objections, the extent to which they are "authentically her own" or the product of the influence of the abducting parent, the extent to which they coincide or are at odds with other considerations which are relevant to her welfare, as well as the general Convention considerations referred to earlier. The older the child, the greater the weight that her objections are likely to carry.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11.5pt;color:#000000"> But that is far from saying that the child's objections should only prevail in the most exceptional circumstances.&#8221;</span></p>

I will examine them principally under child&#8217;s objections and will not unnecessarily duplicate the analysis.  There is of course a classic tripartite test in respect of child&#8217;s objections.  Although in his opening skeleton, the father disputed whether the views of the children did amount to objections, this was conceded at trial by Ms Baker, quite sensibly.  These children clearly object to return to Ireland.  Therefore, the first two limbs of the requisite test are conceded by the father.  First, that the children object to the return to the Republic of Ireland; second, they are of sufficient age and maturity for their views to be taken into account.  Thus, the focus of the court&#8217;s analysis is the evaluation of the relevant factors.</p>

She said that although she missed her family in the Republic, there was nothing else she missed about living in Ireland.  She expressed partially negative experiences about the Republic, and did not enjoy school there.  She said that if the Judge did decide that she must go back that she would be &#8220;depressed and sad&#8221;.  She was worried about her brother and also about Mr. Y remaining in England and therefore was concerned about separation from them.  She says that she has never had such good friends as she now has and did not like conditions in her father&#8217;s home.  At times, she was scared about his behaviour.</p>

There are concerns about sanitation, a lack of activity and stimulation.  That anxiety is not now relevant for this particular application because as part of the package of protective measures, the father has agreed that the children will not have staying time in his home unless and until the Irish court so directs.  There have been concerns expressed about his behaviour at times.  Sometimes the children say that he gets angry, he can speak to them in [his native language] in a way that they find upsetting.  He shouts at them at times.  Once more, the relevance of this has diminished as the father agrees that the children will not have direct contact unless and until ordered by the court in the Republic.  There are other concerns about social life and education, but I will look at those shortly.</p>

The mother has indicated that their brothers will return to Ireland should the court order that the children must return, thus this concern has vanished.  As to separation from Mr. Y, while I accept they may miss Mr. Y because he has lived with them for several years now and has been part of the arrangement for caring for them, the court must also weigh against that his chequered record.  That includes a history of disturbing offending against a child, not very different to the age of these children.  This lessens the weight the court can place upon this particular factor in the scales against return, but I emphasise, does not eliminate it.</p>

Mr Lill put it this way: he said there were two camps about the relocation to Ireland.  The children were very much aligned with the mother.  He said that there is a sense that the children are impacted by the conflict between their parents and find themselves in a situation where they have, as he put it, taken a side.  He said they are aligned to the mother&#8217;s happiness, thus the mother&#8217;s wishes exert a more subtle and nuanced influence on her daughters.  She is their primary carer.  Nobody disputes that they are well aware of the mother&#8217;s wishes and ambitions, which are all about living in this country.  It cannot be forgotten that the mother enlisted the children into the deception that made the flight to Ireland possible, and further that the children have been part of the subsequent retention.  The children cannot but know the mother&#8217;s wish to live in the United Kingdom.</p>

The children are aware that they were going to the United Kingdom, but the level to which the children were exposed to her feelings and rationale to me is a concern.  The idea that the family may be separated is unhelpful and may consolidate their wish to stay [in the United Kingdom].&#8221;</p>

There was going to be a first hearing on 9 December.  The mother accepted that she received a letter in the post dated 22 November 2022 from the father&#8217;s lawyers to say there was to be this hearing on 9 December to deal with his application for E&#8217;s guardianship and also for access to both girls.</p>

Therefore, they had to act deceptively as if nothing was amiss.  This was, it seems to me, a very serious act by the mother and is undoubtedly harmful to the children to enlist them in all of this, to put them into a position where they had to practise adult deceit on their own father.  It is telling that D has little remorse and regret for what has happened.  It meant that the children did not say goodbye to their friends.  As Mr Lill said, &#8220;It is concerning that even in a position where they were urging their father to relocate, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s inevitable or normal for children to be aware of relocation plans.

First, grave risk of serious harm; second, intolerability generally.  The mother puts it this way.  The children would be separated from her present partner Mr. Y if they returned to the Republic.  She has handed in notice for their accommodation in their local town. The mother&#8217;s other family members do not have sufficient room in their property to permit the children to stay with her in the Republic.  The father has behaved in a physically and emotionally abusive way towards the children.  The mother may be arrested for the offence of child abduction with the Irish police on her return given the father&#8217;s criminal complaint.  She would not qualify for Legal Aid to pursue any application for leave to remove the children from the Republic and this will cause her mental health to suffer as she will be unable to return to England to live with the (other) children and her partner.</p>

That resulted in the children having to live in a country that is not their own and of which are not nationals, having to enter a school system in a different jurisdiction, having to leave their friends behind without saying goodbye, and having to deceive their father.  The court considers that Mr Lill&#8217;s evidence that the children will be able to manage the return to be persuasive.  </p>

She has Legal Aid here.  The Good Practice Guide makes clear that her lack of legal funding is not a basis to find that the exception is met (see paragraph 69).  If necessary, of course, the mother can appear in person in the Republic.  Many unrepresented court users do so in cases in the courts here.  But very importantly, I come back to the ethos of the Convention.  It is for Requested States generally to have confidence and trust in the legal system of the home country, unless there is reason to doubt it.  That is fundamental to the principles of comity and mutuality.  This jurisdiction can certainly and does trust the legal system of the Republic of Ireland.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In conclusion, I find that there is nothing remotely close to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm that these children would be exposed to.  There is no other intolerability they would suffer.  The evidence comes nowhere near to establishing either limb.  Given this conclusion, the court does not need to move on to consider protective measures being satisfied, as I am, on the evidence before the court that there is not a grave risk of harm, nor other intolerable situation that shall arise to be protected against.</p>

The return must be forthwith, but there is a limited discretion to delay the return in the best welfare interests of the children.  Listening carefully to Mr Lill&#8217;s recommendation, the court has determined that the appropriate point of the children to return is immediately after the end of the school year.  The precise date will be agreed between the parties.  If it cannot be the court will decide it.</p>

It means that she took the law into her own hands.  There is no defensible justification for doing so.  Any welfare issues must be resolved by the home court which is the Republic of Ireland.  As suggested by Mr Lill, the court has agreed to write a letter to the children.  It is important that the return does not exacerbate the conflict.  The children should not view the outcome of this case as being one parent winning and the other losing.  Instead, the court will carefully explain how it is the decision of the Judge and that that decision has been made looking at what is best for each child.  In other words, in their best interests.  </p>
