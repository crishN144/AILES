Mr C and Mrs C have a strong family ethic and I believe they will strive to maintain a solid relationship so as to help all of the children.  M has settled well with this family and, although it now exists in a different format, I feel that the &#8216;new&#8217; family is working over the two households.  I would see no value in withdrawing our support of this adoption application and feel that this would be damaging to M.

Mr and Mrs C living separately should not necessarily be a contra-indication to them being able to remain as active parents in M&#8217;s day to day life.  It is my view that this application remaining a joint one is important as it will give both Mr and Mrs C an equal legal position and a level of responsibility for M throughout her journey to adulthood.  This may then make it more likely that both parents will remain as part of M&#8217;s life and not bring about further dramatic change.  Both applicants have said, separately, that they wish the application to remain joint and I can see no reason for not supporting this &#8230;</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:-0.11in"><span style="font-size:12pt">It is clear, as demonstrated by the evidence referred to above, that M is fully integrated into and a part of a family that consists of Mrs C as her mother, Mr C as her father and F and O as her siblings.  Taking Baroness Hale&#8217;s classification, Mr C is in practical, psychological, terms, M&#8217;s father and M is his daughter.  In the same way, Mrs C is her mother and M is her daughter.  In my judgment, it would promote and secure M&#8217;s welfare throughout her life for the legal position, namely for them </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">both</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> legally to be her parents, to be allied with the psychological position.  I agree with Miss R that not making such an order, and creating a stark division between them, could well cause significant problems in the future.  It would also mean that Mr C had no legal obligations in respect of M.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:-0.11in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Finally, although the parties are separated, they have continued to co-parent M by agreement and, importantly, without significant disagreement or dispute.  This is an important feature of this case as is the fact that both applicants, for sound reasons, support the making of a joint order.</span></p>
