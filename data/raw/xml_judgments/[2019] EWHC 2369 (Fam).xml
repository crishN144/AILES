M wanted her older child (a daughter, G, who was born in January 2001 so is now 13 years old) to give evidence at the fact finding hearing about some of the violent incidents, those in question having occurred during 2011, and her application to this end was considered by Judge Cameron on 12 February 2014.

The purpose of the section is to lay down the principal functions of the body established by s.11. By s.78, those functions include both powers and duties. By paragraph 9 of schedule 2, they are to be performed in accordance with any directions given by the Lord Chancellor (for Lord Chancellor now read Secretary of State &#8211; see note at paragraph 28 above). All of this is very general in nature. So too is the wording of the functions themselves. That is true not only of the functions in sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section (1</ref>), to "safeguard and promote the welfare of children", "give advice to any court &#8230;", "make provision for the children to be represented &#8230;" and "provide information, advice and other support &#8230;", but also of the duty in subsection (2) to "make provision for the performance of any functions conferred on officers of the Service &#8230;". There is nothing in any of this to suggest a legislative intention that all or any of the duties created by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/43/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.12</ref> are owed to the individuals for whose benefit the functions are to be performed. On the face of it, these are general public law powers and duties. Nor was our attention drawn to anything within the other parts of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/43" uk:canonical="2000 c. 43" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CJCSA 2000</ref> that might suggest a different view.&#8221; </p>

This court understands that it is, however, common-place for guardians to advise that the child should not be called to give evidence on the basis that they will or may suffer emotional harm as a result of doing so. Where such advice is based upon the consideration of harm alone, it is unlikely to be of great assistance to the court which is required to consider not only 'harm' but also the other side of the balance described in the <span style="font-style:italic">Guidelines</span>, namely the possible advantages that the child's testimony will bring to the determination of truth.&#8221; </p>

Counsel for the local authority conceded this point but submitted that &#8216;common sense&#8217; must be applied to limit the scope of what a court may require of Cafcass. I do not find this, to put it mildly, to be an attractive nor a persuasive submission: rather it undermines the local authority&#8217;s contention. I cannot accept that Parliament intended to create a statutory national body to advise and assist the court in family proceedings, and to represent the children who are the subject of those proceedings, without any restriction or limit on its function and roles. Still less would Parliament have intended that the restrictions or limitations on the role of the service would be determined by applying common sense. </p>

Similarly, a children&#8217;s guardian may be required to enquire into and advise the court about a wide range of matters and about a diverse group of people (eg relatives, friends and connected persons etc). This could include advising the court on the benefits/disadvantages of a non-subject child being called to give evidence in the proceedings. What is key, however, is that the objective and focus of these enquiries and of the advice is, and must be, establishing the welfare best interests of the subject child. </p>

I have not been referred to any statute nor to any relevant rule of court which makes provision for such an appointment in these circumstances. I am satisfied such an appointment is outwith the statutory function and role of Cafcass. </p>

Given, however, the increase of the workloads for all concerned in the child protection and family justice systems, now is not the time to consider widening the scope of the functions of Cafcass with its current resources. </p>
