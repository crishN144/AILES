There is simply no excuse for this. Orders, including interlocutory orders, must be obeyed and complied with to the letter and on time. Too often they are not. They are not preferences, requests or mere indications; they are orders: see <span style="font-style:italic">In re W (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Court&#8217;s Function)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1227" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1227" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1227</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 WLR 1611" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 WLR 1611</ref>, para 74. </p>

An order that something is to be done by 4 pm on Friday, is an order to do that thing by 4 pm on Friday, not by 4.21 pm on Friday let alone by 3.01 pm the following Monday or sometime later the following week. A person who finds himself unable to comply timeously with his obligations under an order should apply for an extension of time <span style="font-style:italic">before the time for compliance has expired</span>. It is simply not acceptable to put forward as an explanation for non-compliance with an order the burden of other work. If the time allowed for compliance with an order turns out to be inadequate the remedy is either to apply to the court for an extension of time or to pass the task to someone else who has available the time in which to do it. </p>

The failures by the London Borough of Bexley in this matter are stark. This hearing would not have been required if they had complied with their orders and, in my judgment, it was right that this matter was listed at the earliest opportunity to address those failings and to enable the other parties to make submissions as to when they could comply with their obligations to file documents. Accordingly, I am in no doubt that it is right that the local authority should be ordered to pay the costs of this hearing. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 July 2014, His Honour Judge Wildblood QC, sitting in the Family Court at Bristol, was hearing the IRH in care proceedings brought by Bristol City Council. The final hearing was the following week, having been fixed, as I understand is the practice in Bristol, at the initial case management hearing some months before. Judge Wildblood had to adjourn the final hearing, for reasons he set out in an ex tempore judgment of which I have seen the transcript. The fundamental problem was that the assessment of a family carer which the court had required Bristol City Council to undertake had not been completed. As Judge Wildblood put it, an adjournment could not be avoided because there was no full assessment and no prospect of it being finished in time for the final hearing.</p>

The case was unremarkable except for the fact that the four children with whom I was concerned although having the same mother each had a different father. The relevance of that for present purposes is simply this. There were seven parties: Bristol City Council, the guardian of the four children, the mother, three of the four fathers (the other was playing no part in the proceedings) and a member of the mother&#8217;s wider family who was putting herself forward as a carer for some of the children. The &#8216;domino&#8217; effect of any non-compliance with the court&#8217;s orders was therefore likely to be particularly serious.</p>

Albeit the relevant court contact details had not been filled in, the order contained the usual requirement that &#8220;All parties must immediately inform the Court &#8230; if any party or person fails to comply with any part of this order.&#8221;</p>

The final statement of the social worker is dated 17 June 2014 but it was not until 24 June 2014 that Bristol City Council filed everything. So Bristol City Council was over two weeks late. The consequence was that, if the respondents were to have the two weeks contemplated by Judge Rutherford, the guardian would be denied the two weeks provided for by Judge Rutherford&#8217;s timetable for the preparation and filing of her final analysis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The consequence was all too predictable. By the beginning of the week commencing 30 June 2014, there was no evidence from any of the respondents. The guardian nonetheless began work on her draft, understandably postponing work on the &#8220;analysis&#8221; section pending receipt of the further evidence (in fact by 7 July 2014 only one of the respondents had filed any evidence). In order to ensure that, despite all these obstacles, she should be able to comply with Judge Rutherford&#8217;s order, the guardian resumed work on her draft at 5am on the morning of 4 July 2014. Progress was delayed by her need to answer several telephone calls from family members, and her draft once completed then had to be &#8216;quality assured&#8217; by CAFCASS before it could be filed and served. In the event the guardian was not able to email it to her solicitor until 5.43pm, by which time &#8211; this was a Friday &#8211; he had already left the office. In consequence, it was not until the Monday, 7 July 2014, the day before the IRH listed for 8 July 2014, that it reached the court and the other parties. </p>
