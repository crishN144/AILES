	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">PS was admitted to hospital on 22 January 2007. She was ready for discharge by 7 February 2007 but at that point a crisis emerged. Her daughter, CA, informed the hospital that she was intending to discharge her mother into her own care rather than into the care of the T unit, a residential care and elderly mentally infirm unit where PS had lived since 28 July 2006 and which had been identified as suitable for meeting PS&#8217;s permanent needs at a meeting, convened by the local authority and attended by CA, on 7 November 2006. Concerns were increased by CA&#8217;s request to the hospital that they not inform the local authority of what she was planning.</p>

The reason why there were no fewer than five declarations in relation to capacity is, of course, because questions of capacity are always issue specific: <span style="font-style:italic">Masterman-Lister v Brutton &amp; Co (No 1)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2002/1889" uk:canonical="[2002] EWCA Civ 1889" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] EWCA Civ 1889</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 1 WLR 1511" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 1 WLR 1511</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (An Alleged Patient); Sheffield City Council v E and S</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2808" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 965" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 965</ref>.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first point arises in this way. The local authority had understandable concerns that CA might attempt to remove PS from the T unit. In the circumstances I was persuaded that it was appropriate to grant an injunction, backed by a penal notice, restraining CA from doing anything to obstruct or prevent PS from remaining at the T unit. But the local authority was understandably concerned that the injunction would not of itself enable the local authority to prevent PS&#8217;s removal if CA were to take the law into her own hands and seek to remove her mother from the T unit, albeit in defiance of the injunction. Equally, the local authority was concerned that if it took steps itself to prevent PS leaving or being removed from the T unit without the protection of an appropriate order of the court it might be unlawfully &#8216;depriving PS of her liberty&#8217; in breach of Article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and thereby exposing itself to a possible claim for compensation under Article 5(5): see <span style="font-style:italic">HL v United Kingdom </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2004) 40 EHRR 761" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">(2004) 40 EHRR 761</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re DE, JE v DE and anor </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/3459" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 3459 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 3459 (Fam)</ref>. </p>

	  <paragraph eId="para_8">
	    <num>8.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances the local authority sought an order permitting it to use appropriate means to stop CA removing PS. This raised two questions: first, does the court have jurisdiction to make such an order, and, secondly, if it has, when and how should the jurisdiction be exercised?</p>
	    </content>

	    <num>9.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second point arises in this way. PS is in receipt of both the State retirement pension and a small private pension which are paid into her bank account. She also has some modest savings in a building society account. CA has practical control of these funds &#8211; she is, for example, empowered to sign cheques on her mother&#8217;s behalf. The local authority and the Official Solicitor, who acts as PS&#8217;s litigation friend, are concerned that these funds may be at risk of dissipation and that they are in any event not being appropriately applied in meeting PS&#8217;s requirements. They are anxious that they should therefore be brought under proper control. But whereas there would be a mechanism under regulation 33 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987, SI 1987/1968, to ensure the proper application of PS&#8217;s State pension by means of a statutory appointment of some appropriate person to receive and deal with it, that would not be available to deal with PS&#8217;s other income or her savings. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority sought the appointment of a receiver. This raised two questions: first, does the court have jurisdiction to make such an order, and, secondly, if it has, should the jurisdiction be exercised when it would be open to the local authority to make an application to the Court of Protection for the appointment of a receiver under Part VII of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> (still in force though prospectively repealed by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref>)?</p>

PS does not require that kind of restraint. What is required &#8211; all that is required &#8211; is appropriate &#8216;perimeter security,&#8217; designed to ensure that PS cannot leave by simply walking out of the premises, and appropriate monitoring of visits to ensure that she is not taken away by CA. (Compare the factual situation in <span style="font-style:italic">Re DE, JE v DE and anor </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2006/3459" uk:canonical="[2006] EWHC 3459 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWHC 3459 (Fam)</ref>.)

I can see no reason why in principle the court in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction should not, in an appropriate case, appoint a receiver of an incapacitated or vulnerable adult&#8217;s property if that is an appropriate way of protecting his interests and promoting his welfare. Welfare, after all, in this context is not confined to someone&#8217;s physical or emotional welfare. It extends to embrace the material and financial: see the well-known passage in the judgment of Lindley LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">In re McGrath (Infants) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1893] 1 Ch 143" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1893">[1893] 1 Ch 143</ref> at page 148. </p>

I can see absolutely no reason why the inherent jurisdiction in relation to incapacitated or vulnerable adults should be any different. And this is as it should be, for a refusal to exercise the inherent jurisdiction on the basis that an alternative remedy was available could lead to the child or adult in question falling between stools and not receiving the protection he needs: see the discussion in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (Detention: Medical Treatment) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 180" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 180</ref> at pages 190 and 198. </p>
