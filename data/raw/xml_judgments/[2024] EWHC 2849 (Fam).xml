	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The respondents, K and E told the applicants of their story as to how they became parents. In February 2023, the applicants, to whom I shall refer as Mr and Mrs W, travelled to Germany for a visit with their friends, and to meet the youngest of their children for the first time. Mr and Mrs W had always wanted children. However, by the time they met, Mrs W was unable to have children herself. The couple considered foster parenting and adoption. They were directed to an intensive course on becoming foster parents, delivered by Children Services and specialist childcare social workers. At the completion of the course however, both Mr and Mrs W felt that neither fostering nor adoption was the right option for them, and they turned their energies and research to surrogacy arrangements. They joined Surrogacy UK and attended various monthly meetings convened around the country involving meeting numerous intended parents and surrogates. The couple realised that whilst there were many who aspire to be parents, there were limited surrogates available. With heavy hearts, Mr and Mrs W decided that if they could not secure a surrogate within two years of joining Surrogacy UK, they would discontinue their journey towards completing their family, recognising the strain that the process placed on them.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the visit in February 2023, K and E recognised in Mr and Mrs W their sadness at not being able to have a family. Nothing had been said, it was just intuitively understood. On the second day of the visit, K offered to be a surrogate. Mrs W, in particular, felt <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;it was like a dream come true&#8221;</span>. K&#8217;s motivations were entirely altruistic. Explicitly, she did not wish for any payment. However, given that she would have to forego work as a teacher, Mr and Mrs W were eager to offer something by way of reasonable compensation. They were aware that reasonable compensation is all that is permissible in relation to surrogacy in England and Wales. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Surrogacy is legal in the UK, although surrogacy arrangements are not enforceable in law. At birth, the surrogate (and, if she is married or in a civil partnership, her consenting spouse or civil partner) will be the legal parent(s) of the child. Following the birth, a legal process &#8211; the Parental Order process &#8211; takes place to transfer legal parenthood from the surrogate to the intended parents ('IPs'). The application for a Parental Order is regulated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 54</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Parental Order) Regulations 2018, and Part 13 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010. When IP(s) submit a Parental Order application, the court will usually ask CAFCASS to appoint a Parental Order reporter to investigate the circumstances of the case and submit a Parental Order Report.</p>

A parental order does not require that presumption to be made. Both orders are transformative, but a parental order proceeds on the assumption one of the applicants is the biological parent. That is one of the key criteria in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54</ref> HFEA. It doesn't change the child's lineage as an adoption order does; a parental order creates a legal parentage and removes the legal parentage of the birth family under the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref>. Unlike adoption there is already a biological link with the applicants before the parental order application is made. Its purpose is to create legal parentage around an already concluded lineage connection.</span></p>

A family, in the eyes of the law, like any other. F has a wonderful life story which will be unfolded to him in the years to come. He is a much wanted and loved child. His birth was generated by adult kindness, friendship and empathetic cooperation. This is a generous legacy of which, I am confident, F will be rightly proud.</span></p>
