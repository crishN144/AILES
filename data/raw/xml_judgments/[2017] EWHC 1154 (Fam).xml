Although they are now separated, Y is wholeheartedly supportive of X&#8217;s application. The clinic, the HFEA, the Secretary of State for Health and the Attorney General have all been notified of the proceedings. None has sought to be joined, though the clinic attended the hearing in the person of its &#8220;person responsible&#8221; and was represented by counsel. Given the nature of the issue (see below) I decided that there was no need for C to have a guardian appointed. </p>

The first relates to the impact on X of discovering that there was a question over her parentage of C:</p>

I know that [C] wouldn&#8217;t understand this or wouldn&#8217;t view me any differently but that didn&#8217;t change how it had made me feel. I felt that I was an inferior person in [C]&#8217;s life so far as the outside world was concerned. I felt that the confidence that I had been given in the change in the law to allow same sex couples to have children and be considered legal parents had been snatched away from me. I simply felt that I was no more than a step parent to [C] rather than [C&#8217;s] actual parent who had been involved in every part of [C&#8217;s] life from deciding to have [C], the fertility process, [C&#8217;s] birth and then &#8230; upbringing.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Despite all that I have been through emotionally in this matter I felt that the CFGL empathised and understood how their negligent error had effected me and that they only wanted to assist me in putting matters right. However, having read the statement prepared on behalf of the clinic by &#8230;, I don&#8217;t believe that they have any understanding whatsoever about how this has affected me or the gravity of their mistake. Yes they accept in the statement that they made a mistake but they seem to somewhat try to pass it off as insignificant and non consequential in terms of the effect that this has had on me. I felt sick to my stomach when I read the statement &#8230; because I felt that they, of all people, would have at least recognised the harm and upset that they would have caused.&#8221;</p>

She suggests that on this basis the clinic would have expected the costs to be about &#163;12,500 (inclusive of VAT). As against that, it is to be noted that the costs in these cases are sometimes much higher: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Re the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (Cases F and H) (No 2) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/964" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 964 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 964 (Fam)</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008</ref> (Case N) (No 2) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2017/965" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 965 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 965 (Fam)</ref>.</p>

Having regard to all the circumstances, and to the realities of practice in a small firm, the fact that the partner did various things which in a larger firm (probably charging significantly more) would have been delegated to a Grade C is not, in my judgment, any reason for reducing this part of the bill. So far as concerns the basis of charging in relation to letters and emails, the bill, as I read it, records not the number of letters (emails) but the number of hours&#8217; work involved. No doubt there is an element of  &#8216;rounding&#8217; here but nothing, in my judgment, which requires adjustment to the bill.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns counsel&#8217;s fees, it is important to emphasise, as I have already noted, that this case raised a point which had not arisen before; this was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span>, as in many of the other cases I have had to consider, a case &#8216;on all fours&#8217; with some previous case. In these circumstances, it was obviously necessary for counsel to examine, with care, what is now a substantial volume of decisions, in order (a) to be sure that there was not, in fact, any case directly in point and (b) to marshall the best arguments in favour of his client&#8217;s case. Whilst not going so far as to suggest that &#8216;no stone should be left unturned&#8217;, the issues in these cases, and the potential life-long implications for both parent and child, are so important, so grave, that there can be no question of cutting corners. And the fact that, in the event, the judge has come to a conclusion without hesitation, cannot be read back to support any suggestion that much work was not required on the part of counsel, both in researching the law and in preparing a proper bundle of authorities for the assistance of the court. In all the circumstances there is, in my judgment, no justification for any adjustment.</p>
