	  <intro>
	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>B and L were married on 25th May 1995.  On 22nd January 2016 B (to whom I shall refer to henceforth as the wife and L as the husband) issued a petition for divorce.  Jurisdiction was founded pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Council Regulation.  It is useful to go back to basics and remind ourselves of what these familiar provisions say.  Article 3 provides as follows, </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1in">&#8216;In matters relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment, jurisdiction shall lie with the courts of the member state, (a) in whose territory the spouses are habitually resident.&#8217;</p>
	    </content>
	  </subparagraph>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in">And then a number of other additional matters are of course recited.  It is common ground and agreed between the parties that both the husband and the wife are habitually resident in England.  It is therefore clear that pursuant to Article 3(1) this court has jurisdiction to entertain these divorce proceedings.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The husband has lodged a comprehensive and detailed position statement and skeleton argument and he has been ably represented today by Miss Chatterjee, who has developed on his behalf her principal arguments.  So far as the husband is concerned, he says that he was married pursuant to Sharia law, that is a religious contract, and he contends that only Pakistan has the jurisdiction to hear this divorce.  I make it clear, however, that he does not want to get divorced and does not intend to get divorced.  The consequence, therefore, of his proposition is that the wife, who works and lives in England and pays her taxes in England and is habitually resident here, and domiciled here, at least for tax purposes, should have to travel to Pakistan to secure a divorce.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>That is a submission which carries with it all sorts of very far reaching consequences indeed.  It would mean that she would be subjected to different rules of English law than people of other faiths or other nationalities living here.  It seems to me that the consequence or a consequence of the husband&#8217;s submission would be that I would therefore be approving both racial and gender discrimination, which is something that no judge of this country would be prepared to do.  Why do I say that?  Well it would be racial discrimination because what is said is that because the wife has dual nationality, both British and Pakistani, that as a national of Pakistan she should be treated differently from a British citizen who is not a national of Pakistan.  She, the husband contends, should be denied the rights that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> (as amended) grants to all British citizens, which is the right to get divorced, subject to fulfilling the necessary conditions, because of her Pakistani nationality.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Why do I say that it would amount potentially to gender discrimination?  There is no expert evidence before me about the position in Pakistan but it is reasonably clear from what I have been shown that the rights granted to men in Pakistan to secure divorces pursuant to the laws of that country are different from the rights granted to women and that it is more onerous for a woman to secure a divorce in Pakistan than it is for a man.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I have been shown some proposed amendments to sections 5 and 7 of the Muslim Family Ordinance 1961 and the document which appears, starting at section D, page 89 of my bundle, refers to some amendments which were approved by the Commission in Pakistan, and one of those amendments is to section 7, which is to give women the same right of Talaq e Tafweez as men have.  When asked by me whether that approval to those amendments had found its way into Pakistani law, Miss Chatterjee very fairly said to me that she did not know.  What I do read from what seems to be the editors of the relevant text book which has been put before me is that, </p>
	  </intro>
	  <subparagraph>
	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.5in">&#8216;The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 was promulgated inter alia for the proper registration of marriages and divorces, so as to safeguard and protect the rights of women, including their right to maintenance, etc.  This ordinance has been subjected to criticism not only from the point of view of Sharia but the women&#8217;s rights activists are also not fully satisfied with it.  This law has been reviewed time and again by the Council of Islamic Ideology and the Secretariat of the Law &amp; Justice Commission of Pakistan and amendments have been proposed to certain provisions thereof.  Some of its provisions have been declared by the Federal Sharia Court as repugnant to the injunctions of Islam and appeal against the judgment is pending in the Supreme Court.  However, sections 5 and 7 of the Ordinance need to be reviewed and reformed.&#8217;</p>

I do not know whether women have the same right to Talaq in Pakistan as men do.  I have been given no expert evidence at all about the state of family law in Pakistan.  This is the husband&#8217;s case, he has to prove it, and his failure to produce any expert evidence is manifest and important in my judgment.</p>

That proposition is unsupported by any expert opinion.  If correct, it means that any Pakistani national living in England, having secured a divorce pursuant to the laws of England and Wales, would have committed and would presumably still be committing a criminal offence.  It is not for me to make any findings in respect of that, other than to express my surprise, (a) that that could possibly be true, and (b) that if the husband wants to assert that it is true that he has come equipped with no expert evidence at all to establish it.</p>

I am absolutely satisfied that Article 3(1) of Brussels II (revised) grants this court jurisdiction to hear these divorce proceedings, the wife is a domicile of England and habitually resident in England and Wales, it is her right to seek a divorce pursuant to the provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act (as amended), jurisdiction having been granted by the Article of Brussels II (revised), to which I have referred and therefore the husband&#8217;s claim is dismissed.</p>

If he chooses to defend it and has permission to defend it, for his time for filing and answer has already expired and I will be dealing with that, I suspect, later today, then the only witnesses to the petition, it seems to me, would be the husband and the wife.  I may be wrong about that but I find it certainly has not been suggested to me that there will be any witnesses who would be called who live anywhere other than in England.  The primary witnesses, of course, would be the husband and the wife themselves, who of course live here in England.</p>

They each have pensions and I would expect, although I have not got any detail about this, that working for the NHS they have valuable pensions, it may or may not be that in due course one or other of them will want to make a pension sharing claim against the other.

I do not need to amplify this point any more because I have already dealt with it in my earlier judgment.  If the husband wants me to say that this country should not deal with this very English divorce, if I may say so without any disrespect at all to the parties&#8217; Pakistani dual nationality, if the husband wants me to find that this divorce should be disallowed in this country and it should be proceeding in Pakistan on that basis alone, that is that he would be a criminal if he divorced in England, then he should have come here equipped with hard law, an expert report, which he could have applied for pursuant to Part 25, to show that this unusual, if unique, proposition of his is a correct one.  He is asking me, through his counsel, to make all sorts of assumptions and I am not making any assumptions, I am going to apply the law of England and Wales, which is where this case is being heard.  I have absolutely no doubt at all that the proper forum for this parties&#8217; divorce is England and I think therefore I now need to go onto the next phase because I think there will be further applications to follow.</p>

I am not going to recite again the background or the chronology save as relevant to this part of the case, which is the applications by the husband to set aside the certificate of entitlement to a decree nisi.  I have already given some of the background to this matter.  What I have not yet referred to, because it was not material to the earlier judgments that I gave, is that there are three children of the family, in fact the oldest of whom is now, I think, sixteen and then there are twins, who are to be fifteen next month.  Plainly there are therefore relevant children of the family, albeit that I am not dealing with an application under the Children Act.</p>

On 12th January the husband&#8217;s solicitors wrote back confirming that they were acting, the husband therefore had representation at the relevant times.  </p>

The chronology prepared on behalf of the wife suggests that it was received by him on the 25th.  If I look at B10 I see that when his acknowledgement of service was filed, in answer to the question, &#8216;On which date and at what address you receive the petition?&#8217; he said, it looks to me more like the 26th actually than the 25th, but it matters not which of those two dates it was.  </p>

The answer should therefore have been filed by either 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> or 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February and it was not.  </p>

He challenged jurisdiction, a matter which I have dealt with in the first of the three judgments that I have given today.  On 17th March his solicitors wrote enclosing the acknowledgement of service.  On 24th March the wife&#8217;s solicitors wrote to the court explaining that the husband was out of time to defend the petition and they applied, as they were entitled to, for a decree nisi under the special procedure.  They have been criticised by counsel for the husband for taking that step when they knew that the husband was contesting jurisdiction.  It seems to me that although not every solicitor would have done what they did, they were within their rights, as a matter of their legal rights, in taking the step that they took.  The wife knew that the husband was going to raise principled objections to divorce and she was entitled to take such steps as were available to her to try and progress matters.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>The husband has had the opportunity throughout to apply for relief from sanctions.  The sanctions in this case, I agree with Miss Chatterjee, are severe, because the consequence of the husband&#8217;s failure to comply with the time limits are that he faces the court granting a certificate of entitlement to a decree and granting a decree nisi, and I accept the proposition that has been made that that is a life changing status for the husband.  I also recognise that the husband has principled objections to being divorced.  He asserts that the marriage has not irretrievably broken down.  That is an assertion which I find difficult to take very seriously in circumstances where the parties have now been separated for a very long time, but I entirely accept, and I have already indicated in my earlier judgments that I respect his principled objection to being divorced and that is obviously a highly material part of the background of this case.  I, of course, deal not with morals, beliefs, views or religion but with the law.  My duty is to apply the law.</p>

I am prepared to dispense with the formality of the formal written application, I have even dispensed with the formality of oral evidence, not least because I have substantial written evidence from both parties here and I take the view that everything that the husband would have said, had he filed a statement in support of an application for relief from sanctions, has been said by him in the statements that have been filed and the comprehensive position statements that have been filed on his behalf, and also he has been ably represented throughout today by Miss Chatterjee, so I am satisfied that everything that could have been said on his behalf has been said and therefore I am against Miss Bond when she says to me that I should not consider this as being an application for relief from sanctions.  </p>

I start with the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">interest of the administration of justice</span>.  It seems to me that this is a significant point in the husband&#8217;s favour that not giving him relief will, in all probability, lead to a decree nisi of divorce and I accept that that is something that he does not want and something that is highly significant in his life, and I have already agreed with the use of the words &#8216;life changing&#8217;.</p>

I will come back to deal with those in another context later but I think in my judgment the interests of the administration of justice weigh in the husband&#8217;s favour but balance in the wife&#8217;s favour as well because she is entitled to proceed towards a decree of divorce on her petition, which is, as I have indicated, now already old.</p>

I do not expect that he is familiar with 4.6 of the Family Procedure Rules, who would be, apart from a family lawyer?</p>

So far as the husband is concerned the effect is that he has imposed upon him a divorce which he does not want.  In contrast, so far as the wife is concerned, she has to continue to suffer inordinate delay at considerable expense.  She is entitled to get on with the rest of her life and at the moment she cannot because of the delay and so I think in terms of the effect which failure to comply has had on each party it is equal on each of them.</p>

The wife, in her second witness statement, says, and it is typical of these cases &#8211;  and I do not say that with any sense of criticism, it is what happens - that if the husband does get permission to defend or is going to defend the divorce petition she will &#8211; and this is my expression &#8211; she will ratchet up the allegations.  Sensibly, and properly, divorcing litigants all over the country are encouraged to file anodyne particulars of behaviour so that these matters can proceed through the courts amicably, or relatively amicably, without having defended divorces, and the higher the status of the allegations the more likely they are to be defended, and so her petition contained what I regard as thoroughly anodyne behaviour allegations.  And crucially they contain the statement, which I understand not to be disputed, that the parties have been separated since 6th July 2015, so that is fifteen months.  I have no doubt, as in most of these cases, that if the husband does get leave to defend that she will want to amend her petition to insert more detailed allegations.  There is more than just a hint in this evidence that she has filed that she will be seeking to rely on allegations of domestic violence.  I can think of really nothing much worse for these children, the twins being not yet fifteen years old, than to have their respectable, decent, professionally qualified, hardworking parents, slogging it out in open court, arguing about the past, who did what to whom and when, and I think that it would have a devastating effect on the children who are, although not my paramount concern because it is not an application under the Children Act, who are nevertheless a concern that I have and who plainly, in my judgment, fall within that definition that I have just referred to in rule 4.6 of the Family Procedure Rules.  </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I am also entitled, if not bound, to look at how this is likely to play out in the longer term.  There will be a hearing of a defended divorce if the husband&#8217;s application is successful.  There will be evidence from each of the parties.  I dismiss completely the suggestion that was put to me by Miss Chatterjee that this would only take a couple of hours.  If each of the parties is going to have their proper say and the parties are going to be cross-examined on what really happened, the minutiae of the uglier disputes in their marriage &#8211; I do not say that out of a sense of criticism to them but that is the way it will be &#8211; this will probably take a day to be heard.  And ultimately it is not for me to gainsay what a judge might do but it seems to me that a judge is likely to find that the marriage has irretrievably broken down because by the time this gets to court they will have been separated for certainly more than eighteen months, and it seems to me that if one party says, &#8216;I regard the marriage as over&#8217;, you cannot make the party who says that, in this case the wife, go back and live with the husband when she does not want to.  And so a judge, in my judgment, is likely to find that the marriage has broken down irretrievably.  </p>

That is not to make findings now against the husband, it is simply to state the obvious, which is that these defended divorces do not usually end up with there being no decree.  I would regard, therefore, the idea that I put this off to allow that awful battle to continue would be damaging to the children, damaging to the parties, would cause delay, heartache, upset and very significant expense.</p>

Therefore I am now going to grant a certificate of entitlement &#8211; well I do not know whether I need to grant it, I think I just reinstate the certificate of entitlement to a decree.  I dismiss the husband&#8217;s application.  That is probably the right way &#8211; thank you Miss Chatterjee.</p>
