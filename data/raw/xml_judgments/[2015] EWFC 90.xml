	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2014 applications were made for parental orders under s 54 of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act (HFEA) 2008 in respect of twins (L and M) born to a gestational surrogate in India on the 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014. The Applicants had entered into a commercial agreement through a surrogate agency and clinic in India. To allude to words used previously by Mrs Justice Theis this is a case which again raises some of the difficult questions regarding the law of surrogacy, particularly in cases involving surrogacy arrangements made in another jurisdiction. The consequences of what the court has to decide are of fundamental importance to the parties and the children, not only because it concerns orders which determine who the legal parents of these young children are, but also because it determines the individual legal status of each child throughout their lives.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The difficulties that were encountered by the court in this case are illustrative of the complex issues seen in cases with an international element as a result of international surrogacy. These difficulties are not novel and mirror some of those found in cases of inter-country adoption; they arose in cases under the 1990 HFEA. Following the decision of Mr Justice McFarlane (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G (Surrogacy: Foreign Domicile) </span>[2007] EWHC 2814; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1047" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1047</ref>, there should have been some consideration given at the first directions appointment for the application for parental orders to have been transferred to be heard by a High Court Judge. The Judges of the Family Division have developed an expertise in dealing with international surrogacy and this judgment will give some guidance as to the practice that should be followed by the Family Court in future. Paragraph <span style="font-weight:bold">[73]</span> sets out the guidance on the allocation of surrogacy cases where the child is born overseas that has been approved by the President of the Family Division and is to be followed in all cases where a child is born abroad as the result of a surrogacy agreement and a parental order is sought. In addition the judgment contains reference to the advice given to parental order reporters by Cafcass and the regulations contained in the Family Procedure Rules (FPR) 2010 and relevant Practice Directions (PDs). Further guidance is given here at <span style="font-weight:bold">[86] </span>concerning the need for parental order reporters to see the child with the applicants as part of their investigations when preparing their report concerning the child&#8217;s welfare. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Re G </span>the judgment concluded [52 c)] that the issues raised in foreign surrogacy were of a similar standard and complexity to those raised in cases of inter-country adoption and so there were strong grounds for any parental order application that involves an international element being transferred to a nominated inter-country adoption county court or to the High Court at the first directions hearing. This case predated the 2008 HFEA and the formation of the Family Court. During the intervening period (before the Family Court came into being in 2014) the practice had evolved in London and in some family courts in England and Wales whereby all cases involving an international surrogacy agreement were transferred to be heard in the High Court at the outset of the proceedings. In this case the applications were not listed to be heard by a judge of the Family Division for a full eight months (the order itself transferred the case to the High Court but following the formation of the unified Family Court this was erroneous).</p>

	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The practice of transferring international surrogacy cases in the past was consistent with Schedule 1, 3 (f) (iv) of the Distribution of Business in the High Court of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/54" uk:canonical="1981 c. 54" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Senior Courts Act 1981</ref>, which assigned all proceedings under s30 of the 1990 Act to the Family Division. For the purpose of allocation at present rule 13.9 (1) (e) of the Family Procedure Rules (FPR) 2010 which reads that the court should, at the first appointment, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">consider, in accordance with rule 29.17, whether the case needs to be transferred to another court and, if so, give appropriate direction&#8221; </span>and Schedule 1 paragraph 4(f) of the Family Court (Composition and Distribution of Business) Rules 2014 (in force from 22 April 2014 on the formation of the Family Court) which provides that proceedings pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/54" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 54</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22" uk:canonical="2008 c. 22" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">HFEA 2008</ref> in which the child&#8217;s place of birth was outside of England and Wales should be heard by a Judge of the High Court, Family Division, supports this practice. The practice of allocation to a Judge of the Family Division is by no means uniform and it is intended that the guidance in this judgment should provide for uniformity of practice in future. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Outline of facts</span> The facts in brief are as follows; this case concerned twin girls born to a gestational surrogate (Y) as a result of in-vitro fertilisation following a commercial surrogacy agreement entered into in India between Y and the applicants who are British citizens domiciled in England. Y has no biological connection with the children and the Applicant and commissioning father is their biological father. The non-identical twins were born on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2014 and the application for parental orders was issued on 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August 2014; however, the infants remained, effectively, stranded in India because of an inordinate delay in the issue of their travel documents and did not travel to the UK with the applicants until May 2015, by which time they were just over a year old. The situation for them and for the commissioning parents was increasing parlous as time passed placing a significant and increasing financial and emotional burden on the family as well as denying the children the opportunity to develop the important initial bond that babies need.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Despite the difficulties that the children and the applicants were facing, the case was not allocated to a specialist High Court judge and it is not unreasonable to suggest, as was later submitted by counsel for the applicants, the children&#8217;s counsel, and on behalf of Cafcass Legal not only that it should have been, but that the fact it was not contributed to the delay in the resolution of their difficulties. The case gave rise to many potentially complex legal issues that are not uncommon in applications for parental orders for children born abroad as the result of commercial surrogacy agreements which are discussed below, over and above the consideration of the provisions of the HFEA itself. </p>

They are both British born citizens of Indian/Sikh ethnicity. They married in 1999. The Applicants found that they were not able to have children despite intervention so decided to have a family by surrogacy. The 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Applicant&#8217;s first statement in these proceedings set out the difficult background to their decisions to arrange for surrogate births for their children, she suffered from severe endometriosis and infertility and underwent nine unsuccessful attempts at IVF. In May 2010 she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a chronic illness with an unclear and uncertain progression and prognosis. </p>

A member of staff from the agency and the commissioning mother were present. The forms were translated from English for Y by a translator and by the commissioning mother, who ensured that Y understood their contents. On the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2014 the Applicants applied for British passports for the twins at the British High Commission in Delhi. Their passports were not issued until May 2015. It remains far from clear why there was such a long delay for in the event once the case was allocated to be heard by a judge of the High Court and orders were made by me directed at the FCO and the High Commission in Delhi the twins were able to travel within a month. There was, it appears, to have been some doubt about the authenticity of the death certificate for the husband of Y (the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> respondent and the gestational surrogate mother) in India raised by the personnel of the High Commission in India and those at the relevant passport office in the UK; later they raised questions about the identity of Y herself; by the time the passports were issued there were not any substantive reasons given for the earlier obstructions and for the considerable delay. </p>

It is clear that at the time the commissioning parents in this case issued their application that was <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> the purpose of that application and that they had acted in good faith. The question was once they had encountered difficulties with immigration issues, could the Court properly make an order so as to enable the twins to acquire citizenship and bypass those difficulties even though the delays were directly and significantly affecting the welfare of the children.</p>

The twins had to remain in India being cared for by nannies, because the applicants had their home with their child in England; their employment and means of support was in England; and, as they were domiciled and resident in the UK, they could not remain in India with the twins for prolonged periods of time. I shall return to the situation regarding the long delay in issuing passports for the twins so they could travel to the UK with the commissioning parents below. On 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2014 the first appointment took place in the absence of the parties before District Judge Maughan who made an order for the Applicants to file some documentary evidence of the surrogacy agreement and listed it for a first directions appointment on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2014 at 10.30 am before Her Honour Judge Hindley QC at the Family Court at Birmingham.<span style="font-style:italic"/>At this stage the case should have been allocated to be heard by a Judge of the Family Division.</p>

In February 2015, the commissioning father had travelled to India to care for the children as the nannies employed by the applicants were no longer available and it was not a financially viable situation for the family to continue with the expenses that arose as a result of the arrangement that had been put in place for what was supposed to be a temporary solution to the twins remaining in India. The Applicants relied on the income of the commissioning father and being in India compromised his ability to earn the money necessary to support the family. He had no choice; had he not returned to India it is possible that the children would have had to have been placed in a charitable institution or orphanage. In addition to the concern of the Applicants and Ms Dawe the twins were forming attachments with the nannies because of the amount of time they had been caring for L and M. They had all been confined in their rented apartment because of a perceived fear on the part of the Applicants of the children being abducted. The commissioning mother was unable to stay in India for more than a few weeks at a time as her medication for multiple sclerosis (which is supplied by her healthcare company) was not available for her in India.  </p>

The family was in an increasingly difficult position. The conditions at the new property were not ideal; there was no air conditioning, intermittent power and communications and the commissioning father was left on his own caring for two very young children with no support. By April, when the hot weather was set in they were living in reduced circumstances in very high temperatures. The commissioning mother was very concerned about the real strain her husband was under as a sole carer and there remained a fear for them both that if the situation was not resolved the children would have to be placed in a charitable institution or orphanage. </p>

On 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> April I was invited on behalf of the applicants to make parental orders without the children being present in the jurisdiction and without a parental order report having been prepared. Ms Dawe said through her counsel that, as a last resort, she was prepared to give oral evidence in support of parental orders based on their care of their daughter K and the investigations she had been able to carry out up to that point. I could not accede to their request to deal with the application without the children being seen by Ms Dawe and, on the basis of the positions of the parties as put on that date, it seemed that in part at least that the parental orders were being sought to try to circumvent the difficulties in bringing the children to the UK as British Citizens and on British passports. Ms Dawe considered the family&#8217;s circumstances seemed exceptional and both she and the Applicants felt that no other solution was available. In those circumstances, Cafcass Legal was invited to act as advocate to the Court, given the implications of such a course of action and questions of public policy which arose. Cafcass Legal were contacted by telephone that day and, I am told, acceded willingly to the request. </p>

In fact they had offered to arrange for Y to come to be interviewed by the consular officer. I accept the submission of Ms Cronin, counsel for the Applicants, that this omission was significant as Mr Wharton had said  that the consular officer had concerns about how the surrogate was approached to undertake the surrogacy and gone on to dispute her identity even though the Applicants had provided her official identity card with complete biometric markers and photograph, and secondly,  as the facts in the death certificate  recording the date of the death of Y&#8217;s late husband had been verified in notarised documents signed by local assembly members in the relevant Ward, including by Mr H J A, a legislator who knew the deceased personally.</p>

The Applicants and the children were unrepresented until February when an order was finally made for a rule 16.4 (FPR 2010) guardian. Although the situation for the family was resolved fairly rapidly once it was transferred there was a considerable delay in the twins being able to join their family in England and they were effectively stranded in India for over a year. </p>

To paraphrase Mr Justice Hedley, the court must take care not to be involved in anything that looks like payment for buying children overseas. The court cannot be a party to any arrangements which give effect to or sanction commercial surrogacy agreements even if they are legal in the country in which the surrogacy agreement was entered into and where birth took place.</p>

Against that the effect of the 2010 Regulations, namely that the court must regard the children's welfare as the paramount consideration, means that the decision whether to authorise payments retrospectively is part of the decision relating to the making of a parental order to be decided in the light of the welfare of the children rendering virtually impossible to conceive of circumstances in which, by the time an application for a parental order comes to court, the welfare of any child, particularly a foreign-born child, would not be gravely compromised by a refusal to make the order as said by Mr Justice Hedley in <span style="font-style:italic">Re X and Y</span> (2008) and as he said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L</span> at [10] "<span style="font-style:italic">it will only be in the clearest case of the abuse of public policy that the court will be able to withhold an order if otherwise welfare considerations support its making."</span></p>

There is no evidence of moral taint in the Applicants&#8217; dealings with Y or with the nationality, immigration, the High Commission or the Indian authorities. I have no reason to doubt that the Applicants are entirely genuine and have at all times acted in good faith. Moreover, and as I have already alluded to, the payments are not disproportionate and so the granting of parental orders would offer no affront to public policy and would clearly be in the best interests of the children&#8217;s welfare. The payments to the agency and clinic and the figures provided by them are not broken down in sufficient detail to separate medical treatment and other reasonable expenses from profit and agency fees; this is not unusual, the Applicants have been parties to a legal agreement and made the payments asked of them in keeping with Indian law. The legality of the contract has been confirmed by an independent lawyer instructed by the Applicants who provided his expert opinion that the surrogacy agreement is a legal and valid agreement. </p>

These documents or fact-sheets were only just published within a few weeks of the final hearing of this case on 7th July 2015.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Penny Logan of Cafcass Legal, who appeared before me and Ms Lakin, counsel on behalf of the children, both told the court that they were unaware of a case that had been<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>reported where the parental order reporter has not seen the child.  This was accepted by Ms Cronin on behalf of the Applicants. Ms Logan pointed out, and as this court is well aware, members of Cafcass Legal routinely act for High Court team guardians in cases where the children are parties. The court was reminded of the fact, well known to it, which is that the High Court team undertakes a large proportion of the parental order cases in the High Court and most of the international ones<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">. </span>Ms Logan told the court that she was unaware, through Cafcass, of any case reported or unreported, where the parental order reporter has not seen the child. Although this court is aware of one such instance in a reported case (see the reference in [86] below)<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"/>it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which a parental order reporter could properly report on welfare without having seen the child with the Applicants. Ms Logan went on to inform the court she was, at that time, involved in another surrogacy case where determination of the application hade been delayed for a year for similar reasons.</p>

It is the experience of this court that applications for parental orders are made by commissioning parents who do not presently reside in this country (when one or both have a UK domicile). In such cases parental order reporters see children with commissioning parents/applicants when they visit this jurisdiction as in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">CC v DD </span>(supra) [2014] EWHC 1307. </p>

However, without the children being in the country the application cannot be progressed.

In any event a welfare decision is required as part of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/37/section/30" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 30</ref> application and the Guardian cannot complete her assessment until she has seen the children living with the applicants in this country.

Thirdly the court must be careful not to usurp functions which specifically belong to the executive.

It was rightly observed on behalf of the Applicants that such an arrangement would not be feasible if the subject children, as they were in this case, are stateless and cannot lawfully leave India or travel to the UK. The Applicants submitted the legislation and practice guidance appears to provide the Court with the discretion to direct or judge the scope and arrangements for the welfare oversight needed in any particular case and that the HFEA differs from adoption law and practice as neither the statute nor the regulations require that the subject for children are seen by the parental order reporter in their home. This is an accurate exposition of the statutory and regulatory provisions as it has always been accepted that Parliament did not intend to replicate the adoption regulations, however not seeing the child at all is quite different from not visiting the child at home. The FPR 2010 and PD 16A Part 7 (rule 16.35 which must be exercised in accordance with PD 16A) do not require that the parental order reporter sees the subject children either with the Applicants or otherwise as part of the investigations for the parental order report.</p>

Although he had not seen the child he had the benefit of a comprehensive independent report from a South African social worker on which both he and the court could rely. The social worker had visited the child and her family, including the applicants and her older sibling who was the subject of a parental order granted by Mr Justice Hedley in 2012.  It is worth noting that not only was this possible because of the independent social work report but also there is an admirable and well regulated legal framework for altruistic surrogacy arrangements which are overseen by the South African High Court under their Children Act 2005. The arrangements are put in place before conception and the provisions of the legislation are framed to ensure that there is no exploitation of the surrogate. </p>

It is central to his being, whether as an individual or as a member of his family. As Ms Isaacs correctly puts it, this case is fundamentally about Xs identity and his relationship with the commissioning parents. Fundamental as these matters must be to commissioning parents they are, if anything, even more fundamental to the child. A parental order has, to adopt Theis J's powerful expression, a transformative effect, not just in its effect on the child's legal relationships with the surrogate and commissioning parents but also, to adopt the guardian's words in the present case, in relation to the practical and psychological realities of X's identity. A parental order, like an adoption order, has an effect extending far beyond the merely legal. It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, and social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious, consequences. It creates what Thorpe LJ in Re J (Adoption: Non-Patrial) [1998] INLR 424, 429, referred to as "the psychological relationship of parent and child with all its far-reaching manifestations and consequences."

I cannot think so. Parliament has not explained its thinking, but given the transcendental importance of a parental order, with its consequences stretching many, many decades into the future, can it sensibly be thought that Parliament intended the difference between six months and six months and one day to be determinative and one day's delay to be fatal?

Why should they be barred? Even more to the point, why should the wholly innocent child is barred by such mishap?

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Earlier in the proceedings (as alluded to above) an issue arose as to whether the court should make a parental order which would have had the effect of conferring British citizenship allowing the children to travel to the UK as British citizens.  Applications for parental orders cannot be used to circumvent immigration law; as long as twelve years ago Mr Justice Munby (as he then was) set out the relationship between the family court and the immigration authorities in <a href="http://intranet4cafcass/departments/Documents/Legal%20Services/TRAINING%20MATERIALS%20AND%20HANDOUTS/ROADSHOWS/2010/LAW%20REPORTS/Re%20A%20(Care%20Proceedings.%20Asylum%20Seekers)%20%5b2003%5d%20EWCJ%201086%20(Fam)%202%20FLR%20921.doc"><span style="font-style:italic">Re A (Care Proceedings: Asylum Seekers) </span>[2003] EWCJ 1086 (Fam) 2 FLR 921</a>: </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is established practice in adoption applications with international elements for the court to notify the Home Office and ask whether it wishes to intervene in the case. As a result of this practice consideration of the role of the Home Office is to be given at the first directions hearing in an application for adoption; as provided for in FPR 2010 PD14B (<span style="font-style:italic">The First Directions Hearing &#8211; Adoptions with a Foreign Element</span>) 14(2) (d) (ii). It is not always necessary to do so in applications for parental order applications nor is it required by the FPR Part 13. It is clear, however, that in this case, that notification and/or invitation should have been given (on the face of a court order) to the Home Office, the Passport Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at the first opportunity after it had become apparent that there were difficulties in the children leaving India.  As noted by both Ms Cronin and Ms Logan it was only when the matter was the subject of an order of, and requests made by, a High Court judge that formal, if partial, explanations for the delay were forthcoming. Soon after that the children were able to join their family in England.</p>
