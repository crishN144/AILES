On 21 March 2013 the District Judge made an interim care order. It was extended on 2 April 2013. On 22 April 2013 the same District Judge made a further interim care order and transferred the matter to the High Court on the ground that there were significant complexities in the case (one being the potential use of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref>) and that it might be appropriate to invoke the wardship jurisdiction. The order recorded that the matter was listed for hearing in the High Court on 3 May 2013.</p>

The local authority applied urgently the same day to Pauffley J, who made E a ward of court. The matter came before Sir Peter Singer, sitting as a Judge of the High Court, on 3 May 2013. He ordered that E remain a ward of court, discharged the interim care order, and gave comprehensive directions, including directions in relation to E&#8217;s treatment, which there is no need for me to rehearse. </p>

Sir Peter permitted Mr Igor Pokojn&#253;, Counsellor-Minister and Head of the Consular Section of the Embassy of the Slovak Republic in London to be present at the hearing &#8220;in a non-participatory capacity as an observer.&#8221; The order records concerns about reporting of the case in the Slovakian press.

The request referred to the fact that a media and social media campaign had been started in Slovakia and that the case had become &#8220;extremely sensitive&#8221; and &#8220;a focus of attention&#8221; in Slovakia.

I gave various directions, including a direction giving the mother&#8217;s solicitor leave to come off the record as the solicitor acting for her. In response to the Article 55 request, I permitted the local authority to disclose to the Slovakian Central Authority the order I made at the conclusion of the hearing and, subject to any further order of the court, any further orders; I permitted Mr Pokojn&#253; to provide an account of the hearing to the Slovakian Central Authority; and I permitted the Slovakian Central Authority to obtain a transcript of the hearing.</p>

The order I made the following day, 25 September 2013, included a direction that the local authority disclose various documents to the Slovakian Central Authority.</p>

It suffices for present purposes to note that I decided that, since it had not been demonstrated that the mother lacked litigation capacity, the hearing was to be conducted on the basis that she did. I approved a care plan providing for E to be placed in the care of the local authority but living with his maternal aunt. The wardship was to be discharged. I decided to make a reporting restriction order. I reserved judgment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Leaving on one side altogether the circumstances of this particular case, there is a wider context that cannot be ignored. It is one of frequently voiced complaints that the courts of England and Wales are exorbitant in their exercise of the care jurisdiction over children from other European countries. There are specific complaints that the courts of England and Wales do not pay adequate heed to BIIR and that public authorities do not pay adequate heed to the Vienna Convention. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_14">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the nature of things it is difficult to know to what extent such complaints are justified. What is clear, however, is that the number of care cases involving children from other European countries has risen sharply in recent years and that significant numbers of care cases now involve such children. It is timely therefore to draw the attention of practitioners, and indeed the courts, to certain steps which can, and I suggest from now on should, be taken with a view to ameliorating such concerns.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would be idle to ignore the fact that these concerns are only exacerbated by the fact that the United Kingdom is unusual in Europe in permitting the total severance of family ties without parental consent: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-S (Children) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1146" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1146" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1146</ref>, para 19, referring to the speech of Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Down Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust and another v H and another</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2006/36" uk:canonical="[2006] UKHL 36" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] UKHL 36</ref>, para 34. Thus the outcome of care proceedings in England and Wales may be that a child who is a national of another European country is adopted by an English family notwithstanding the vigorous protests of the child&#8217;s non-English parents. No doubt, from our perspective that is in the best interests of the child &#8211; indeed, unless a judge is satisfied that it really is in the child&#8217;s best interests no such order can be made. But we need to recognise that the judicial and other State authorities in some countries that are members of the European Union and parties to the BIIR regime may take a very different view and may indeed look askance at our whole approach to such cases.</p>

They have exposed us, often if only in translation, to what our judicial colleagues in other jurisdictions are doing in a wide range of family cases. They have taught us the sins of insularity. They have taught us that there are other equally effective ways of doing things which once upon a time we assumed could only be done as we were accustomed to doing them. They have taught us that, beneath all the apparent differences in language and legal system, family judges around the world are daily engaged on very much the same task, using very much the same tools and applying the same insights and approaches as those we are familiar with. Most important of all they have taught that we can, as we must, both respect and trust our judicial colleagues abroad. </p>

But we must, and we do. International comity, international judicial comity, is not some empty phrase; it is the daily reality of our courts. And be in no doubt: it is immensely to the benefit of children generally that it should be.&#8221;</p>

The key point is that, where BIIR applies, the courts of England and Wales do not have jurisdiction merely because the child is present within England and Wales. The basic principle, set out in Article 8(1), is that jurisdiction under BIIR is dependent upon habitual residence. It is well established by both European and domestic case-law that BIIR applies to care proceedings. It follows that the courts of England and Wales do not have jurisdiction to make a care order merely because the child is present within England and Wales. The starting point in every such case where there is a European dimension is, therefore, an inquiry as to where the child is habitually resident.</p>

And although, within the meaning of Article 15(3), E has a particular connection with Slovakia, it did not seem to me that the other requirements of Article 15 were met, so as to justify making a request to the Slovakian courts. Nor, as will be appreciated, was any Article 15 request received from the Slovakian courts. On the contrary, the Slovakian Central Authority formally notified this court that it did not dispute the jurisdiction of the English court and fully accepted its competence. The Article 55 mechanism worked smoothly and effectively, facilitating in the particular case the inter-State cooperation and assistance which is so desirable in every case.</p>

As a general principle, any attempt by the English court to control foreign media, whether directly or indirectly, is simply impermissible. In the first place, what justification can there be for the courts in one country seeking to control the media in another? If the media in a particular State are to be controlled that must be a matter for the relevant authorities in that State. For the courts of another State to assume such a role involves an exercise of jurisdiction which is plainly exorbitant, not least as involving interference in the internal affairs of the other State. What would we think, what would the English media think, if a family judge in Ruritania were to order the Daily Beast to desist from complaining about the way in which the judicial and other State authorities in Ruritania were handing a case involving an English mother? Secondly, the exercise of such a jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the principles I explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J</span>, paras 44-65.
