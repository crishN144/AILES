Their relationship endured for some 22 years during the course of which three children were born to this couple.  In the context of divorce proceedings which were issued in 2009, they were able to resolve all issues arising in the context of the pending ancillary relief proceedings (as they were then known).  On 1 June 2010, Deputy District Judge Marco approved the terms of a consent order which provided W with a comprehensive financial award on the basis of a clean break between the parties.  The global wealth available for distribution between the parties at that time was said to be in the region of &#163;15.7 million.  W&#8217;s settlement was worth slightly less than half of that sum.  </span></p>

In essence, her case in the substantive proceedings (which are due to be heard by Moor J between 6 and 8 July this year) is that she did not know until May 2014 that H (as opposed to their three children) was the primary beneficiary of two family trusts.  At the heart of her case in relation to the alleged non-disclosure lie the central allegations that (a) he failed to disclose the existence of two trusts; (b) she was unaware at the time of the agreement which underpinned the consent order that the trusts had recently received payments amounting to just over &#163;4 million; and (c) that he was the primary beneficiary under the terms of both trusts.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">H denies the non-disclosure allegations.  His case is that there is no substance whatsoever to W&#8217;s allegations and he has filed detailed written evidence setting out his case in relation to precisely what he disclosed and when.  Further, and of central importance to the matters which I have to decide, he says that W has failed to act promptly in bringing her appeal.  Her allegedly inexcusable delay in progressing matters is another ground on which he relies in his opposition to any attempt to re-open these matters now.  The material which lies at the heart of the application before me is an email which suggests that W was, or may have been, alive to potential issues of non-disclosure as long ago as September 2012 yet she failed to take any action until almost two years later.  Leaving aside the factual dispute in relation to his disclosure in the early part of 2010, the delay in itself is another reason why he says her present attempt to overturn the 2010 consent order should fail </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">in limine</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">.</span></p>

W&#8217;s case is that the contents of the email were (and remain) privileged and this court can and should prevent the use of the material at the forthcoming appeal hearing and require H&#8217;s entire legal team (who are now privy to that information) to withdraw from the case.  H says no such privilege exists and he is entitled to use the email and the information within it in support of his case before Moor J in July 2015.</span></p>

On behalf of H, Mr Green maintains that W&#8217;s current application represents an extensive and wholly unwarranted extension of the general law in this area and that I should be cautious before expanding the scope of well-established legal principles.  It seems to me that, before turning to consider the law, the first step I must undertake is an examination of the facts and, in particular, those facts which gave rise to the creation of the email in respect of which privilege and/or confidentiality is asserted on behalf of W.</span></p>

That letter is dated 29 May 2014.  She says that in 2012 (she does not say when), some two years or more after the consent order was approved by the court, she wanted legal advice.  She does not descend into any more detail than that in relation to the nature of the advice she was seeking or the reasons which had prompted her to seek such advice.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">She states that in September 2012 she had spoken to a friend of hers called Debra Spurway.  It seems that these two ladies had been friends for some 35 years having known each other from their school days.  Miss Spurway had also known H for some 17 years and had introduced him to the accountant he employed after the sale of one of his companies.  Thus, whilst a close friend of W&#8217;s, she was also familiar with the family and knew something about H&#8217;s business affairs.  Miss Spurway&#8217;s evidence suggests that she had spoken with W &#8216;a few times&#8217; during mid-September 2012.  She considered her conversations with W to be &#8216;absolutely private and confidential&#8217;.  She does not provide any further detail as to the substance or subject matter of those conversations but she had been keen to provide W with help &#8216;as her friend&#8217;.  Miss Spurway appears to have spoken to another friend of hers called Patricia Ledwith who had told her that she knew DBQC (whom she described as &#8216;a top family lawyer&#8217;).  Having spoken again with W, Miss Spurway asked Miss Ledwith to put her in touch with DBQC.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">There is nothing further in the papers to assist me in relation to the substance of the conversation which DBQC and Miss Ledwith must have had within the next 24 hours but it is clear that they did indeed speak.  I know that because Miss Spurway tells me that Miss Ledwith arranged for her to speak to DBQC.  Miss Spurway&#8217;s evidence is that the conversation which took place between them was short.  It appears to be common ground that DBQC and Miss Spurway did not know one another and had no previous communications prior to the introduction effected by Miss Ledwith.  Miss Spurway tells me in her statement dated 1 April 2015 that she considered her conversation with DBQC to be &#8216;wholly private and confidential&#8217;.  She says that she mentioned during the course of that short conversation the name of the family company and that she &#8216;discussed sensitive and private matters relating to [W] and her family which I understood Miss Bangay QC would not share with anyone else&#8217;.  Pausing there, and on the assumption that a court were to find this to be an accurate representation of what transpired during the course of that conversation, it would follow that unless she received contrary instructions, DBQC herself would not have been at liberty to divulge to any third party (including any solicitor whom W might subsequently instruct) the factual content of that discussion.</span></p>

It is clear that there was some discussion about the possibility of DBQC representing W because Miss Spurway recollects her saying that she herself did not accept instructions on the basis of the direct access scheme.  She gave Miss Spurway the name of a solicitor she might contact with a view to his arranging an appointment to see W.  That solicitor was Mr Ribet of LMP.  It is quite clear that his name was being put forward in this context as no more than a recommendation at this stage because Miss Spurway&#8217;s understanding was that &#8216;if [W] instructed Mr Ribet then he could instruct Miss Bangay QC on [W&#8217;s] behalf&#8217;.</span></p>

Equally clear to me is the fact that at this point in the time line, DBQC had not been formally instructed to act on behalf of W.  There is nothing in the evidence thus far to suggest that she offered any legal advice during the course of the short conversation she had with Miss Spurway.  In my view, the fact that she is alleged to have invited Miss Spurway at the conclusion of their conversation to &#8216;keep me in touch with what&#8217;s happening&#8217; (paragraph 7 of Miss Spurway&#8217;s statement) offers no further assistance one way or the other.  It might just as easily be interpreted as a common courtesy as a follow up to her recommendation of Mr Ribet.  There is no doubt, however, that what she did was to provide Miss Spurway with Mr Ribet&#8217;s contact details with a view to any further steps being initiated once W (if she chose) had met with Mr Ribet and decided to engage his services for the purposes of securing legal advice.  Miss Spurway tells me in her statement that, having emailed Mr Ribet&#8217;s details to W, she had a subsequent conversation on the telephone with W to tell her what DBQC had said during the course of their own conversation.  I have no further details and Miss Spurway does not suggest that she was relaying to her friend what was, in substance, legal advice.  It is at this point that Miss Spurway&#8217;s involvement in the line of communication comes to an end.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">By that time, H&#8217;s previous solicitors in the 2010 matrimonial proceedings (Burges Salmon) considered themselves to be conflicted as a result of the fact that a representative of that firm might be required to give evidence in relation to the allegations of non-disclosure which underpinned the proposed appeal.  On 11 September 2014, H instructed new solicitors, Pinsent Masons, and Mr Michael Pulford took over the conduct of the matter on his behalf.  Prior to Burges Salmon&#8217;s withdrawal, and quite by coincidence, DBQC and Mr Sear had been instructed to advise H in consultation.  Apparently in ignorance of the fact that she had previously been approached by Miss Spurway on W&#8217;s behalf, DBQC had accepted instructions to act for H with Mr Sear as her junior.  When it became apparent that Burges Salmon&#8217;s position as a firm was compromised because someone from that firm might be required to appear as a witness in the appeal hearing, DBQC suggested that LMP might act for H and the name of another partner in that firm (Mr Simon Pigott) was put forward.   It appears from Mr Pulford&#8217;s witness statement that, although Mr Pigott had been due to attend the consultation with H and his leading and junior counsel, he withdrew prior to its scheduled date (10 September 2014) on the basis that neither he nor his firm could act for H.  Mr Pulford&#8217;s understanding is that Mr Ribet (Mr Pigott&#8217;s partner) subsequently made contact with DBQC to remind her that she had introduced W to LMP and they were thereby conflicted. </span></p>

It is this evidence which persuades me on the balance of probabilities that DBQC is unlikely to have had any further involvement in this case as far as W&#8217;s instructions were concerned once, in 2012, she had recommended Mr Ribet as an appropriate point of contact in terms of any future legal advice.  Had she been formally engaged to represent W and/or attended a consultation, it is difficult to see how she might have accepted instructions from Burges Salmon to act on behalf of H.  Whilst I have no direct evidence apart from those facts and matters within Mr Pulford&#8217;s knowledge and understanding, Mr Ribet&#8217;s telephone conversation with her in September 2014 suggests her involvement did not extend beyond anything more than her initial recommendation of his firm. </span></p>

It records the fact that, in the absence of W having indicated any intention to take steps to prevent disclosure to H, a copy of the emails had already been provided to him.  Other than to assert a bare claim to privilege, there had been nothing in Farrer &amp; Co&#8217;s letter to explain why the email was to be regarded as privileged.  Amongst a number of requests for information was a request for production of LMP&#8217;s file.  Mr Green has since confirmed that it is no part of H&#8217;s case before me that the file should be produced.  He recognises that to be privileged material and merely seeks on behalf of his client to admit in evidence at the permission hearing before Moor J in July this year the content of the email, and to ask questions of W and (if necessary) her supporting witnesses in relation to her state of knowledge about potential non-disclosure issues in September 2012.</span></p>

He has referred to the existence of those emails and their content in his witness statement dated 23 January 2015.  It was not until 3 March this year, some five months later, that the issue of privilege was re-engaged by the parties&#8217; respective legal teams.  On 3 March 2015, the day before the issue of her first application, W&#8217;s solicitors wrote to Pinsent Masons and recorded the fact that they had now met with Mr Pointer in consultation.  Whilst his name did not appear in that letter, he has confirmed that he did indeed see his client in this context at that time. I collect the date of that consultation (26 February 2015) from W&#8217;s statement dated 17 March 2015.  The letter written by Farrer &amp; Co repeats W&#8217;s contention that the information relayed to DBQC during the telephone conversation with Miss Spurway was confidential.  Further, they allege that the information which was then relayed to Mr Ribet who was subsequently instructed as W&#8217;s legal advisor, was privileged.  In the absence of any waiver by W, the use of the email and its disclosure to H was an attempted breach of that privilege.  The issue had now become magnified by the reliance by H upon that information in his written evidence to the court.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.45in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">W has filed a fifth statement in these proceedings.  It is dated 31 March 2015.  In that statement she refers to the fact that she has deliberately refrained from including in her earlier statements the substance of her conversation with Miss Spurway in September 2012.  She continues to maintain that this conversation was confidential and any information passed on to DBQC by Miss Spurway and from DBQC to Mr Ribet was similarly impressed with that confidence.  In order to &#8216;cure&#8217; or remedy the absence of any specific details, she has provided a summary of that conversation in a sealed brown envelope lodged with the court which she invites me to read despite the fact that she continues to maintain her privilege and confidentiality over that material.   I indicated at an early stage of these proceedings that I was not minded to accede to any request which might be made of me by Mr Pointer and Mr Webster to read that material.   Whilst I accept that I am entitled to look at that information, I take the view that it would be wholly inconsistent with my obligations to reach a conclusion in these matters on the basis of a fair and transparent hearing in which neither party had any forensic or other advantage over the other.  It would have placed Mr Green and his junior counsel, Mr Hickman and Mr Sear, in an impossible position.  Further, it might well have resulted in my having to produce a redacted version of my judgment if and insofar as it might have included reference to the &#8216;brown envelope&#8217; material.  The lawyers and the parties in this case are fully entitled to know the reasons underpinning any decision I might reach.  That would prove impossible if I were to have read material which I regarded to be relevant, the contents of which were unknown to H and his team.  Transparency and openness lie at the very heart of fairness and judicial impartiality.  Whilst there may be circumstances in which other outside interests and public policy considerations might entitle a judge to read material which is not disclosed to the other side (for example, in situations regarding public interest immunity applications), this is not such a case. As I shall explain when dealing with the law, the authorities to which I have been referred make it quite clear that there is an obligation upon an applicant who seeks to rely upon LAP to include in his or her evidence as much detail as possible in his or her evidence in support precisely in order to avoid this sort of situation arising.</span></p>

The other alternative is that these issues were identified by Miss Spurway herself without any input at all from DBQC and the tentative nature of her succinct email to Mr Ribet was no more nor less than a reflection or reportage of what she had been told might be the subject of W&#8217;s wish to seek legal advice.</span></p>

Whilst the unauthorised use of confidential material will usually engage the court&#8217;s equitable jurisdiction which arises so as to protect the beneficiary&#8217;s privilege, the balancing exercise which is often required in the context of confidential material is not consistently applied in circumstances where the material is not only confidential but also attracts the protection of LAP.  In these circumstances, there is more usually an in-built presumption that the court&#8217;s jurisdiction will be exercised so as to protect that privilege :  see, for example, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Goddard v Nationwide Building Society </span><span style="font-family:Garamond"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] QB 670" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] QB 670</ref> at 685, per Nourse LJ.  It is also clear that the balancing exercise is unlikely to have a place in circumstances where the court is being asked to restrain the unauthorised use of confidential information which has been obtained by the inadvertent disclosure of privileged material during the course of litigation.

In that case, somewhat unusual on its facts, there was correspondence between a litigant and his solicitors about an email with an unidentified third party whom the litigant believed to be assisting him in the context of his claim.  He thought he could trust this individual and share confidential information with him in the hope and expectation of obtaining from him relevant information.  When in due course that third party shared with the defendants to the litigation his communications with the claimant and his solicitors without their consent, it issued an application for injunctive relief to prevent the use of that material in the litigation.  Lawrence Collins J accepted the court&#8217;s power in these circumstances to protect the litigant&#8217;s privilege and his right to have the documents kept confidential through the grant of an injunction.  But he also observed that, even in cases where such material was incontrovertibly shown to be privileged, there could be circumstances where the court had to conduct some form of balancing exercise when weighing up whether to restrain the use of the protected material.  On the facts in that case, he concluded that it would be inappropriate to grant the injunctive relief sought on the ground of the public interest in the disclosure of wrongdoing on the part of the claimant who had additionally provided misleading information to the court.  No such circumstances pertain in this case.</span></p>

H&#8217;s previous solicitors have now ceased to act for him because of the potential status of the partner involved as a witness of fact in relation to his 2009/2010 (pre-consent order) disclosure.  DBQC has herself now withdrawn from the case as H&#8217;s leading counsel (albeit it at a fairly late stage of these proceedings) because of her position as a possible witness of fact in relation to W&#8217;s state of knowledge in 2012.  The fact she has taken that step does not establish one way or the other whether or not she will have anything useful to add to the evidential matrix of the July hearing even if she is called.  Despite relevance, it is clear from the authorities to which I have referred above that the material in respect of which LAP is claimed will be excluded from the material put before the court at the substantive hearing of this matter (i) if and insofar as that material is privileged, unless (ii) H makes out some equitable ground which might involve the court in some form of balancing exercise.  W has made it clear that she does not waive the privilege which she claims for this material.  </span></p>

Where in addition the information in question is not only confidential but also privileged, the case for a strict approach is unanswerable.  Anything less fails to give effect to the policy on which legal professional privilege is based.  It is of overriding importance for the proper administration of justice that a client should be able to have complete confidence that what he tells his lawyer will remain secret.  This is a matter of perception as well as substance. It is of the highest importance to the administration of justice that a solicitor or other person in possession of confidential information that is privileged information should not act in any way that might appear to put that information at risk of coming into the hands of someone with an adverse interest.&#8221;</span></p>

In that case, a husband sought an injunction to restrain his wife&#8217;s matrimonial solicitor from continuing to act for her in circumstances where he had previously engaged her services notwithstanding that the divorce had not proceeded until some seven or eight years later by which time the solicitor had become a partner in a different firm.  Granting the injunction sought by the husband, Bodey J considered the principles to emerge from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Bolkiah </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">and held that there was no &#8216;family gloss&#8217; to be applied to the law established in that case simply by virtue of the fact that the case involved a financial remedy or related application flowing from divorce proceedings.  A party who sought to restrain by injunctive relief a solicitor or another member of his legal team from future involvement in the case had to establish : (i) that the solicitor was in possession of information that was confidential to him, to the disclosure of which he had not consented; and (ii) that the information was or might be relevant to the new matter in which the interest of the other client was, or might be, adverse to his own.  If this burden, which was not a heavy one, was discharged, the evidential burden then shifted to the defendant firm of solicitors to show that there was no risk that the information in question wold come into the possession of those now acting for the other party; this burden was a heavy one and the starting point was that unless special measures were taken, information moved within a firm.  In </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Z v Z</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">, the husband had failed to take any steps to protect his interests for a period of five weeks after he became aware of the facts which underpinned his application to restrain the wife&#8217;s solicitor from continuing to act.  Bodey J did not consider the delay as a sufficient reason and/or failure to act on the husband&#8217;s part which should disentitle him to the relief which he sought.  The order for costs which he made in the wife&#8217;s favour would enable her to remake a solicitor/client relationship with another specialist in this field of legal work.</span></p>

He argues that it is not necessary for a lawyer-client relationship to be, or to have been, in existence for the jurisdiction to be invoked.  The test, he says, is whether the court is satisfied on the facts that the respondent firm (or, in this case, the professional adviser approached &#8211; here, DBQC) was in possession of confidential information in respect of which the applicant had not consented to its disclosure, and that circumstances had since arisen where that firm (or professional adviser) was proposing to act for another client with an interest adverse to her own in a matter in which the information was, or might be, relevant.

It is Mr Green&#8217;s case on behalf of H that the imparting of confidential information </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Garamond">per se</span><span style="font-family:Garamond"> does not provide W in this case with any platform for equitable relief unless and until she is also able to establish that the information which she seeks to protect is also covered by, and subject to, LPP (and, here, more particularly LAP).  In terms, Mr Green submits that confidence per se, absent the overlay of an element of LAP, could never preclude H&#8217;s lawyers from cross-examining Miss Spurway about her own conversation with W even if it did touch upon matters which W regarded as including personal or confidential information about her family and related financial matters.  The essential requirement, he says, before the existence of confidential information will give rise to equitable relief flowing from the court as a protective measure is the existence of a fiduciary relationship between a client (or potential client) and his or her professional adviser (see White Book para 31.3.6).  In </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Bolkiah</span><span style="font-family:Garamond">, that fiduciary relationship flowed from the instructions delivered by Prince Jefri (the then chairman of an investment agency established to hold and manage assets of the Government of Brunei) to KPMG which was employed to provide forensic accounting services in the context of major litigation relating to his financial affairs.  Here, the initial conversation or conversations which give rise to the confidence occurred between W and Miss Spurway.  Had Miss Spurway not taken steps to initiate contact with DBQC through the intermediary of Miss Ledwith, it is inconceivable (says Mr Green) that she would not be both competent and compellable as a witness in the forthcoming hearing before Moor J.  If this is right as a proposition of law, the issue then becomes the &#8216;chain of communication&#8217; between the four individuals involved and an examination of whether or not, at any point during the relevant time line, W can point to the existence of a fiduciary (or client) relationship between herself and DBQC.</span></p>

He reminds me of the principle that LPP embraces the instructions which a client gives to his or her lawyers as well as the advice which they receive.  The description of a set of facts upon which a lawyer will be asked to advise can properly constitute confidential and privileged information which a court will protect.  He nevertheless accepts that if the facts as I find them to be do not fall within existing legal parameters and principles, he will fail in his application for injunctive relief.  In other words, he does not accept that in this case I am being asked to extend or redefine the law of privilege as it applies to clients and their professional advisers.  He further accepts that I would need to find that Miss Spurway was acting as W&#8217;s agent in establishing contact with DBQC before I could find an established fiduciary relationship such as would give rise to a claim in respect of LAP.</span></p>

Taken at its highest, it seems to me that if I am looking at the whole chain of dialogue, whatever Miss Spurway&#8217;s position may have been vis &#224; vis W, DBQC&#8217;s status as part of that initial chain on 19/20 September 2012 is far less obvious, a position which Mr Pointer appears to accept.  (In para 17 of his and Mr Webster&#8217;s written skeleton, he describes her potential agency status as &#8216;perhaps ambiguous&#8217;.)  In addition, whilst we know that Mr Ribet acknowledged DBQC&#8217;s email within minutes of receipt, there is nothing at all in the evidence to demonstrate when, after 20 September 2012, W formally instructed him to act.  Her statement refers only to contact being made &#8220;in late 2012&#8221;.  That could have been at any point between 21 September and 31 December 2012 and there is, as I have said, not a scintilla of evidence to suggest that there was any further communication whatsoever between DBQC and Mr Ribet and/or DBQC and W during that intervening period.  Further, it appears to me to be highly unlikely that any formal instructions would have been delivered to DBQC even after W&#8217;s initial contact with Mr Ribet &#8216;in late 2012&#8217;.  If she had been instructed formally to advise on the merits in writing or to meet with W in consultation, it is highly probable that her subsequent instruction by Burges Salmon on H&#8217;s behalf would have produced a positive conflict check within her chambers' administrative systems.  We know that did not happen because it was only after she had recommended LMP as Burges Salmon&#8217;s replacement that Mr Pigott (another partner in LMP) had to decline the invitation to attend a consultation with DBQC and H on 10 September 2014.  The potential conflict was revealed by LMP&#8217;s internal system and not by DBQC&#8217;s chambers&#8217; system.  This is why I have concluded that it is highly improbable that DBQC had any further involvement in the case on W&#8217;s behalf once she had sent the email to Mr Ribet on 20 September 2012.</span></p>

To this extent, he and Mr Green are agreed.  But Mr Pointer argues that even in the absence of an established lawyer/client relationship, the provision by W of information to Miss Spurway (and by her to DBQC) was, and remained, confidential.  That much is confirmed by W in her written evidence and she is supported in that contention by Miss Spurway.  He and Mr Webster accept on W&#8217;s behalf that the court has power to compel the provision of confidential information if it is both relevant and admissible.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"/><span style="font-family:Garamond"> However, in these circumstances, the court has a discretion whether or not to allow the information into the case and I must weigh in the scales whether, in order to dispose fairly of the proceedings,  it is likely to be probative of any issue which is material to outcome in the case. Since the central issue in the forthcoming hearing in July 2015 will be whether or not H complied in full with his disclosure obligations in 2010, the email sent to Mr Ribet by DBQC in September 2012 can have no possible bearing.  It does not assist one way or the other in terms of establishing whether or not W knew about the details of the two family trusts in 2012, her case being that this information was only revealed to her in 2014.</span></p>

Indeed, it seems to me be the central focus of his defence to W&#8217;s current application.  Whilst his primary position is that there was no breach of his duties in relation to disclosure prior to the 2010 consent order, he will say that W has left it far too late to challenge</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond"/><span style="font-family:Garamond">that disclosure in any event.  If she had indeed been alive to potential issues of non-disclosure in 2012 but allowed matters to rest for a further two years before taking any steps to set aside the consent order, that factor will undoubtedly be one which the learned judge will wish to consider in deciding whether to grant W the relief which she seeks.  In this context, it seems to me that her state of knowledge in 2012 is likely to be highly relevant and material.  </span></p>

He invites me to preclude the use of the email and require H to redact his written evidence so as to expunge any reference to it and/or the dialogue between Miss Spurway and DBQC.  In these circumstances, he recognises that it would be possible for junior counsel, Mr Sear, to continue to act along with Pinsent Masons and Mr Michael Pulford.  Whilst his primary position remains that the entire legal team must withdraw, the latter solution would &#8211; he accepts &#8211; be an acceptable compromise from W&#8217;s position.</span></p>

Their Lordships consider that this was playing with words.  It confuses the nature of the documents with the rights to which the arrangements with Mr Ennor gave rise.  The documents are privileged because they were created for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice.  If they are not produced voluntarily, production cannot be compelled.  If they are produced voluntarily, the right to withhold production no longer attaches to them.  In that sense the privilege may be said to be lost.  But they are the same documents, and it is not inappropriate to describe them as privileged.  Their inherent characteristics are the same.  The policy which protected them from unauthorised disclosure is the same.  The cat is still a cat.  It can be put back in the bag.</span></p>

But they do not rely on privilege to found their cause of action. A party who has parted with possession of documents may have a right to recover possession on any one of a number of grounds.  He may reclaim them because they belong to him; or because he has a contractual right to recover then; or because they are confidential; or because he has parted with them for a limited purpose and equity will not permit the recipient to retain them once that purpose is fulfilled.  In the present case the documents are both privileged and confidential, but the appellants do not rely on privilege or confidentiality to found their claim to recover them.  They rely on the terms of the arrangements under which they were supplied and the limited purpose for which they permitted use to be made of them.  Their case is that there is no legal basis on which the Society can retain and make use of the documents free from the limitations which Mr Lusk imposed and Mr Ennor accepted.&#8217;</span></p>

If W is to secure the water-tight protection she seeks, she must establish that the conversations she had with Miss Spurway attract LPP and that, they submit, she cannot do.

It does not protect all confidential communications which a man must necessarily make in order to obtain advice, even when needed for the protection of his life, or of his honour, or of his fortune.  There are many communications which, though absolutely necessary because without them the ordinary business of life cannot be carried on, still are not privileged.  The communications made to a medical man whose advice is sought by a patient with respect to the probable origin of the disease as to which he is consulted, and which must necessarily be made in order to enable the medical man to advice or to prescribe for the patient, are not protected.  Communications made to a priest in the confessional on matters perhaps considered by the penitent to be more important even than his life or his fortune, are not protected.  Communications made to a friend with respect to matters of the most delicate nature, on which advice is sought with respect to a man&#8217;s honour or reputation, are not protected.  Therefore it must not be supposed that there is any principle which says that every confidential communication which it is necessary to make in order to carry on the ordinary business of life is protected.

At page 1287, his lordship stressed that the doctrine of LPP was confined to cases of counsel, solicitor and attorney and &#8216;in order to raise the privilege, it must be proved that the information, which the adverse party wishes to learn, was communicated to the witness in one of those characters&#8217;.  Later he said, &#8216;It is indeed hard in many cases to compel a friend to disclose a confidential conversation; and I should be glad if by law such evidence could be excluded. It is a subject of just indignation where persons are anxious to reveal what has been communicated to them in a confidential manner &#8230;.&#8217;.</span></p>

There is nothing in the evidence of either W or Miss Spurway which demonstrates that Miss Spurway was acquainted with DBQC prior to their short conversation in September 2012.  The inference which I can draw is that the latter&#8217;s name was only made known to Miss Spurway by Miss Ledwith who facilitated the conversation by providing DBQC&#8217;s contact details at some point after she had sent her the email on 19 September 2012 at 15:29.  Further, there is nothing in paragraphs 4 to 8 of Miss Spurway&#8217;s statement which supports the submission made on behalf of W that Miss Spurway had been asked by her to &#8216;explain the nature of the problem&#8217; as a direct precursor to &#8216;elicit[ing] from that silk as to how W should proceed&#8217;.

Having conveyed to W DBQC&#8217;s recommendation of Mr Ribet, Miss Spurway accepts that her involvement in the matter came to an end.

No doubt that description (or words to that effect) was conveyed to W by Miss Spurway in the context of her securing W&#8217;s authorisation to speak to DBQC on her friend&#8217;s behalf.  Whatever the nature of the &#8216;sensitive and private matters&#8217; which were discussed on that occasion, it is clear that DBQC explained to Miss Spurway at some point during their short conversation that she could not accept instructions directly from W (and thus could not give advice). </span></p>

During the course of one of those conversations, W learnt that Miss Spurway had been able (through assistance from a friend of hers, unknown to W) to identify a &#8216;top family lawyer&#8217; with whom contact had been established through the good offices of this friend.  W accepted her friend&#8217;s offer to speak to this lawyer with a view, as I find, to securing a recommendation as to whom she might go to for professional advice.

Had Miss Spurway intended to pursue the conversation beyond the point of securing a recommendation, she was stopped firmly in her tracks by DBQC who made it plain that she could not accept W&#8217;s instructions (and thus, in my view, could not give advice) other than through formal instructions from a solicitor.  I am satisfied that there is nothing in the material put before me which establishes that W herself authorised Miss Spurway to act as a conduit or agent for the purposes of a specific request for legal advice or, upon the receipt of any such advice, for onward transmission back to her.  All that W said was that she was happy for Miss Spurway to speak to DBQC on her behalf.  She provides no evidence which would come close to establishing on the balance of probabilities that Miss Spurway was being instructed as an agent of communication to relay information on her behalf to a lawyer.

It matters not whether that solicitor has by that stage been formally engaged by the prospective client.  The House of Lords approved that test and explained that &#8220;the contemplated relationship &#8230; of solicitor and client &#8230; was sufficient&#8221; (per Lord Buckmaster at 588, above).  </span></p>

The facts will simply not support that analysis at this point of the time line.  DBQC&#8217;s rejection of her ability to assist unless and until she received formal instructions to act does not, in my view, place her in the position of a prospective adviser to W.  She gave her recommendation of Mr Ribet.  W could have conducted further research about Mr Ribet&#8217;s professional credentials on his firm&#8217;s website or from any other source and decided not to instruct him.  Even in circumstances where she did subsequently instruct Mr Ribet, I am satisfied that he, on her instructions, did not deliver any formal instructions to DBQC to act on W&#8217;s behalf.  It is just as possible that W might have been presented with a number of different barristers&#8217; names by Mr Ribet and she might well have decided to instruct someone other than DBQC.  In these circumstances and applying the law as I have referred to it above, I have reached an equally clear conclusion that the conversation between Miss Spurway and DBQC on 19 September 2012 did not, and could not on any basis be said to, attract LPP.</span></p>

I have followed a path of analysing individually the separate steps and constituent elements of the time line of events as they unfolded because it seems to me to be the logical way of approaching this matter.  Had I approached my task in the manner contended for by Mr Pointer, I should have reached the same conclusions in relation to LPP in this case.  Standing back and looking at matters by way of a more holistic overview of the case, I cannot find any basis for upholding W&#8217;s claim to privilege.  I do not find any basis for Mr Pointer&#8217;s submission to me that DBQC might have been acting in some way as a sub-agent for the purposes of the legal advice which W wished to seek.  He sought to persuade me that, if he was wrong about there being a direct prospective relationship between W and DBQC based upon the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Garamond">Minter v Priest </span><span style="font-family:Garamond">principle, then DBQC can be considered as a further link in the chain between W and Mr Ribet.  It seemed to me that this submission would have involved a finding by me that, because W ultimately instructed Mr Ribet on a privileged basis, any conversations between W and Miss Spurway and Miss Spurway and DBQC on the road to that instruction were somehow covered by LPP.   I can find no basis for that proposition in any of the case law to which I have been taken and I take the view that, were I to accede to that line of logic, I should indeed be extending the doctrine of LPP in a wholly unprincipled and unjustified way.</span></p>

Here, it is difficult to see how it can be said that H / his legal team came into possession of the email of 20 September 2012 by mistake.  It had been sent by DBQC to her new instructing solicitors once she became aware of the potential conflict when reminded of her transmission of that document by email to Mr Ribet following Mr Pigott&#8217;s non-attendance at the consultation which had been arranged on 10 September 2014.</span></p>

In the course of litigation, her employer, whose routine system of operation included annual detailed assessments on every employee, agreed to produce the reports referable to the claimant but not in relation to the two employees who were successful in their bid for promotion.  The tribunal had initially ordered disclosure.  One of the successful candidates objected to his own report being disclosed to a third party on the basis he himself had not seen the report.  He was supported in the Court of Appeal by the employer who argued that real harm could arise in the field of employment if its confidential system of assessing its employers was opened up to third party disclosure.  The appeals were allowed and the disclosure orders made by the tribunal below reversed.  The House of Lords dismissed the subsequent appeal from that decision.

He says that there is nothing in the confidential information which is likely to advance the case one way or another as to W&#8217;s actual knowledge in 2012.

Whether or not I have jurisdiction to grant the declaratory relief which H seeks in his cross-application dated 15 April 2015 (the email and any record of it and the conversations between W / Miss Spurling / DBQC can be adduced as evidence) seems to me to be subsidiary to the principal point in issue.

Mr Green tells me in paragraph 8 of his skeleton argument that she has accepted that, if the material is not privileged, H should be provided with her written &#8216;summary&#8217; of the conversation she had with Miss Spurway.  That may enable both sides to take a view as to the way forward.  As I have already said, I have not read this material and it may very well be that W has a complete answer to H&#8217;s allegations as I have set them out in paragraph 102 of my judgment.  </span></p>

If other issues remain (including costs, which I suspect may follow the event in this case), I shall deal with them as the parties wish.  I would hope that any further representations can be dealt with on the basis of short written submissions.</span></p>
