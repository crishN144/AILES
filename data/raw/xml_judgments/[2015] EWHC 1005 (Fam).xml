The resulting order is dated 28 January 2009 and was sealed on 29 January 2009. </p>

Particulars of that allegation are set out in Particulars of Non-Disclosure dated 24 September 2014. Nothing turns for present purposes on the details.</p>

The reason why this technical and seemingly arid point is of practical importance is, of course, that while permission is required to pursue an appeal, permission is not a pre-requisite to an application of the kind made by the wife.</p>

It is, I venture to suggest, yet another area where there is a pressing need for legislative clarification and simplification.

FPR 30.3(1)(a) provides that permission to appeal is required where the appeal is from a district judge. FPR Part 30 is supplemented by PD30A &#8211; Appeals.

The final sentence of PD30A, para 14.1, in contrast, is concerned with an entirely different question, namely whether some other form of procedure is permissible. Similarly, FPR 30.1(1) provides that &#8220;The rules in this Part apply to appeals to &#8230; (a) the High Court; and (b) the family court.&#8221; FPR 30.3 defines &#8220;appellant&#8221; as meaning &#8220;a person who brings or seeks to bring an appeal&#8221;. I am not here concerned, at least directly, with an appeal, for the whole point is that the wife does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>bring or seek to bring an appeal. Contrary to Mr Brunsdon Tully&#8217;s submissions, the provisions to which he draws attention merely serve to emphasise how little the final sentence of PD30A, para 14.1, actually fits in with either the scheme or the detailed provisions of FPR Part 30.  </p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;I agree that in its terms the rule is not expressly confined to procedural orders &#8230; It may well be that, in the context of essentially case management decisions, the grounds for invoking the rule will generally fall into one or other of the two categories of (i) erroneous information at the time of the original order or (ii) subsequent event destroying the basis on which it was made. The exigencies of case management may well call for a variation in planning from time to time in the light of developments. There may possibly be examples of non-procedural but continuing orders which may call for revocation or variation as they continue &#8211; an interlocutory injunction may be one. But it does not follow that wherever one or other of the two assertions mentioned (erroneous information and subsequent event) can be made, then any party can return to the trial judge and ask him to reopen any decision. In particular, it does not follow, I have no doubt, where the judge&#8217;s order is a final one disposing of the case, whether in whole or in part. And it especially does not apply where the order is founded upon a settlement agreed between the parties after the most detailed and highly skilled advice. The interests of justice, and of litigants generally, require that a final order remains such unless proper grounds for appeal exist.&#8221;</p>

First, he submits that the final sentence of PD30A, para 14.1, does not encroach on the right of a litigant to apply to the court or on the substantive legal remedies available to a litigant if material non-disclosure is proved; it merely stipulates the procedural route, namely appeal, under which all these remedies are available. I cannot accept that: it encroaches upon the right of a litigant to apply to the court without first obtaining permission. Secondly, he submits that the power of the <span style="font-style:italic">family court </span>to exercise its powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>F(6) is not fettered, either by FPR 4.1(6) or by the final sentence of PD30A, para 14.1, because an appeal from a district judge sitting in the family court lies to another judge, either a Circuit Judge or a judge of the High Court, <span style="font-style:italic">of the family court</span>. This, however, as Ms Sharghy and Mr Hubbard point out, overlooks the fact that the powers conferred by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>F(6) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref> include powers to &#8220;vary, suspend [or] rescind&#8221; any order. Thirdly, he submits that the final sentence of PD30A, para 14.1, which is the relevant provision in issue here, is not the rule that imposes the requirement that the litigant can proceed only with permission, and in any event a permission requirement is not a fetter or encroachment on the court&#8217;s powers such as to lead to a conclusion that the final sentence of PD30A, para 14.1, is ultra vires. The first part of this is, with respect, legal sophistry: since any appeal requires permission, a provision that challenge can only be made by way of an appeal is, in its effect, a provision imposing a requirement that the litigant can proceed only with permission. I have already said that I do not accept the argument that the final sentence of PD30A, para 14.1, does not fetter or encroach on the rights of the litigant or, consequently, on the powers of the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are essentially two reasons which lead me to this conclusion. First, and whatever the exact ambit of the phrase &#8220;practice and procedure&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/39/section/81/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 81(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/39" uk:canonical="2003 c. 39" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2003 Act</ref>, it cannot in my judgment extend, as here, to a provision purporting to forbid a litigant to have recourse to a form of remedy long recognised by the common law, let alone to a remedy expressly conferred by both statute (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>F(6) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/42" uk:canonical="1984 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1984 Act</ref>) and rule (FPR 4.1(6)). Secondly, there is, for the reasons given by Ms Sharghy and Mr Hubbard, a conflict between, on the one hand, the statute and the rule and, on the other hand, the practice direction, which requires the latter to yield to the former. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">More than 25 years after Ward J&#8217;s first complaint, too little has yet been done to remedy matters. The continuing complexity of the law is exemplified by the necessarily detailed analysis of the point by the editors of <span style="font-style:italic">Financial Remedies Practice 2015</span>, paras 4.5-4.17. The continuing lack of clarity is illustrated by my analysis in this judgment. It is profoundly unsatisfactory that the courts should still have to take up so much of their time and their litigants&#8217; resources dealing with such matters. The final Report of the Financial Remedies Working Group, 15 December 2014, expressed the view (para 13) that &#8220;clarification of the procedures for re-opening first instance orders in financial remedy proceedings is required&#8221; and said that it &#8220;would strongly support amendments to the Family Procedure Rules for that purpose.&#8221; I doubt that anyone could possibly disagree. Remedial work is now a matter of pressing urgency, unless we are complacently to condemn another generation of litigants to a procedural maze which is a discredit to family justice. I add only this. The Working Party may wish to consider the extent to which these problems are capable of solution by either Rule or Practice Direction. It may be that primary legislation is required.</p>
