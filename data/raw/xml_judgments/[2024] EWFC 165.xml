	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During the hearing before me, it emerged that there is a dispute between the parties as to the jurisdictional requirements for H to pursue a divorce in E country. I was surprised that this had not been previously agreed, as it would appear to be of fundamental significance, and reasonably straightforward to establish. W told me that it is a necessary divorce suit precondition for H to establish that the minor children, B and N, were habitually resident in E country on the date of issue of the petition. H told me that is wrong; jurisdiction is based on the joint  nationality of the parties. On the face of it, H&#8217;s understanding is consistent with Article 3 of Council Regulation EC No 2201/2003 (to which, of course, the United Kingdom was a party until its withdrawal from the European Union) but no doubt the parties will make further enquiries to establish the position. </p>

W could not include L in the application because of L&#8217;s age (over 18) but she alleges that H is putting all three children under pressure not to return to the UK. H denies the assertions, saying that two of the children requested that the horses be transferred to F city, and they wish to remain in E country. Currently, therefore, all three children are in F city with H. </p>

He stayed the application for a return order in respect of B by reason of Article 13 of the 1996 Hague Convention on the basis that &#8220;corresponding measures&#8221; (i.e proceedings which are similar to those initiated by W in respect of the relevant children) were underway in E country and therefore this court should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction. The application in respect of the horses was adjourned to a further hearing. </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I gave directions leading to determination of the disputes on jurisdiction and forum. After the hearing before me finished, it transpired that the jurisdictional dispute can be dealt with in the autumn, rather earlier than everyone (including myself) had anticipated. It is therefore necessary to consider the financial arrangements, including legal costs, in the interim, until the hearing of the jurisdiction and forum dispute and, if that is resolved in W&#8217;s favour, until conclusion of the financial remedy proceedings. Of course, if it is resolved in H&#8217;s favour, the interim orders will come to an end at that point. I am not minded to adopt a restrictive approach to the application for MPS simply because the jurisdictional hearing is only four months away. For example, it was suggested that I might ignore items for winter holidays. It makes no sense, especially in a case of this size, to adopt that course which would inevitably lead to a variation application if W is successful on jurisdiction and forum, and the financial proceedings then commence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Because of the jurisdictional dispute, Forms E have not been filed. Nevertheless, I would have expected H to have given at least a bare outline of his resources in his statement; he did not do so. The consequence is that I know next to nothing about his case as to his own resources and liquidity.  What he does say is  &#8220;I accept that I would be able to meet reasonable orders made by the Court in relation to both LSPO and MPS albeit, depending on time frames, I may in due course have to borrow funds&#8221;. This is a form of millionaire&#8217;s defence although in my view neither that, nor the fact that H disputes jurisdiction, absolves him of responsibility to give at least some outline of his finances in a MPS application, not least because FPR 2010 rule 9.7(4) requires him to &#8220;file a statement of his means&#8221; on an application for an interim order unless he has filed a Form E.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The one matter H does refer to in his written testimony is that after separation, he settled 80% of his shares in the company into an E country family trust for W and the three children. He says W was fully aware of this, agreed to the provision being made and signed the documents. W told me through counsel that she had little knowledge of it, but accepted she had a copy of the trust deed. There was no suggestion that she has ever received money from the trust or that she can access it to meet her own needs. Quite how this all fits onto the overall scheme of the parties&#8217; financial arrangements is, at present, unclear. </p>

H  says that &#8220;Whilst we have enjoyed access to impressive properties, private jets and boats, often we have leased them from XYZ Group&#8221;. On any view, they had unrestricted use to these properties, jets and yachts, however those arrangements were structured. It is not difficult to conclude provisionally that the wealth and lifestyle of this family was fabulous. </p>

She had access (via her PA) to a UK account in H&#8217;s name from which she met the running costs of the English property, school fees, staffing costs and general expenditure. H typically topped up the account by &#163;150,000 every two to three months; during 2023 the total top ups came to about &#163;900,000 which seems to have been representative of annual expenditure on those items. H met the costs of all the other properties, yachts, jets and the horses. In addition, W had access to: </p>

H says that W overspent on the family credit card such that in the month of March the expenditure was &#163;130,000 instead of the usual &#163;60,000. So, says H, he wanted to do no more than have oversight and control although it does seem to me that in the context of this case the increased expenditure (which W says was caused by H blocking her access to a bank account) was relatively de minimis. H also pointed to W having rented a yacht in the summer of 2023 at what he termed an excessive cost of &#163;400,000, but he did ultimately pay it, and that event took place nearly a year ago; I am not persuaded that the yacht charter prompted the change in the financial regime.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A question sometimes arises as to payment of costs already incurred prior to issue of the LSPO application. The authorities on this topic are neatly summarised by MacDonald J at paras 33-37 of <span style="font-weight:bold">DH v RH <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2023/111" uk:canonical="[2023] EWFC 111" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EWFC 111</ref></span>.  They are examples of how to exercise the judicial discretion. There is no dispute that in principle an award for past costs can be made. Where, as noted for example in <span style="font-weight:bold">Re Z <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2020/80" uk:canonical="[2020] EWFC 80" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWFC 80</ref></span>, the historic costs sought related to sums due to firms no longer instructed by the applicant, Cobb J declined to encompass those costs within the LSPO. Costs in connection with proceedings already concluded may similarly not be readily recoverable, but costs reasonably and legitimately incurred by the present legal team in ongoing proceedings may, by contrast, be justifiably brought within the LSPO application because, as Cobb J said in <span style="font-weight:bold">BC v DE [2016] EWHC 1806</span> at para 22: <span style="font-size:11pt">&#8220;It is neither fair nor reasonable to expect solicitors and the Bar to offer unsecured interest free credit in order to undertake their work&#8230;&#8221;</span>.</p>

In some cases, it would have the effect of leaving a payee to fund the shortfall out of his/her own resources which may not be possible, or may not be fair to the payee. It may also be unfair to the lawyers who find themselves having to provide legal services at a significant discount. On balance I prefer to look at the sums sought in the round, taking account of all relevant factors and assess an overall reasonable figure, rather than to adopt a standard assessment discount other than as a cross check. </p>

Apart from the legal fees in the divorce/jurisdiction proceedings which are sought under the LSPO, W will incur legal fees in the E country children proceedings. Further, she is likely to incur costs in connection with financial remedies even though those proceedings are stayed, as she will inevitably have to prepare the ground for future litigation in either jurisdiction; for example, she will need to investigate the trust. She must also continue to litigate about return of the horses (those costs are not included in the LSPO application). It is not difficult to foresee that &#163;895,000 could swiftly reduce, leaving limited resources for unforeseen exigencies. Further, I consider it unreasonable (save in one aspect to which I will return) to expect W to use her own assets which are substantial by most standards, but are &#8220;modest&#8221; (to use the word adopted by Mostyn J at para 31(v) of <span style="font-weight:bold">Rubin (supra)</span>)<span style="font-weight:bold"/>when set against what appears to be the vast wealth of H. </p>

A pound for pound order risks argument which may lead to further costs, quite apart from the need for careful scrutiny and oversight of the arrangement which could lead to further dispute.

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The sum of &#163;1,078,100pa for W to rent a property in the South of France comparable to the property she had access to until recently seems high. I have very little evidence on this and have had to do the best I can. H&#8217;s alternative rental particulars seem to me to be far below what W has been used to. As a guide, the French property is rented out at &#8364;150,000pw in high season and &#8364;100,000 at other times but I doubt that W would in fact go there for 10 weeks per year, particularly as the children are now more independent. I will reduce the figure by &#163;300,000.</p>

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The sum of &#163;1,198,000pa for holidays should be reduced. It includes a figure for alternative rental and spending money in the Caribbean at &#163;342,000pa, but in fact she has not been to the house there since separation, although H did pay for her to rent there last year; in the circumstances H&#8217;s offer of &#163;150,000 for rental/spending there seems reasonable. I am inclined to consider W&#8217;s figures for the use of private jets as not unreasonable in principle. I am less persuaded that &#163;499,000 for 1 week a year yacht rental is tenable given that one of the family yachts is rented out at &#8364;150,000pw, although there would be additional costs on top. I will provide for an overall figure of &#163;700,000 rather than the sum claimed. </p>
