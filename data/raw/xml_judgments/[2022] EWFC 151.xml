		    <content>
		      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;In my view, the logical approach by which to determine whether the court should decline to make an order in the terms of the award, is by reference to the appeal procedure and the approach found in the FPR 2010. In other words, when presented with a refusal on the part of one party to agree to the conversion of an arbitral award into a consent order, the court should, at an initial stage, 'triage' the case with the reluctant party having to 'show cause' on paper why an order should not be made in the terms of the arbitral award. Such approach would be similar to the permission to appeal filter found at FPR rule 30(7) where the trial has taken place under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>. If the judge is of the view that there is a real prospect of the objecting party succeeding in demonstrating that the arbitral award is wrong, then the matter can be set down for a hearing. That hearing will, as with an appeal, be confined to a review and will not be a rehearing, subject to any case management directions which the judge may make in relation to updating or other evidence and subject to, as under FPR 30.12(1)(b), the court considering that "it would be in the interests of justice to hold a re-hearing" (para 73).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thus, the approach to be taken by the court on a challenge to an arbitral award in financial remedies, howsoever the challenge is made, is the appellate test i.e whether the determination was &#8220;wrong&#8221; or &#8220;unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity&#8230;&#8221; (FPR 30.12(3)). </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Where a party challenges the award, the court should conduct a triage exercise on paper. The test at this filter stage is the same as on an application for permission to appeal, namely whether &#8220;the court considers that the appeal would have a real prospect of success&#8221; or &#8220;there is some other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard&#8221; (FPR 30.3(7)). If the court is satisfied that the hurdle is passed, then it should list the application for a full inter partes hearing of the challenge, akin to a hearing of an appeal against a court order which operates by way of a review of the lower court&#8217;s decision (FPR 30.12(1)). If it is not so satisfied, then the court can &#8220;<span style="color:#000000">make an order in the terms of the arbitral award without more ado&#8221; (para 96 of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000">Haley v Haley</span><span style="color:#000000">).</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, the same principles apply to a children&#8217;s dispute determined by arbitration. A judge being invited to make any welfare order under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> must be independently satisfied that it is a proper order to make, the paramount consideration being the welfare of the child under s1(1) thereof. Upon making an order after a contested hearing, or endorsing an order made by consent, the judge has a duty to have in mind the welfare checklist and to ensure that the order is compatible with the paramountcy principle. The same, in my view, applies to the making of an order which one party (if the determination is challenged by the other party) or both parties (if there is no challenge by either party) invite the court to make after an arbitration determination. Of course, if there is no challenge to the determination, it is highly likely (albeit not inevitable) that the court will make the order sought. But the parties cannot oust the jurisdiction of the court and, whether the order sought is agreed or opposed by one or other party after the arbitration determination, the court&#8217;s overarching duty to consider whether the order is consistent with the best interests of the children remains the same. The mere fact that the parties have submitted to an arbitration does not prevent the court from scrutinising the subsequent order and, if appropriate, refusing to endorse some or all of its provisions. </p>

But the rights of challenge do not stop there. Sub-paras (b) and (c) to my mind expressly envisage that that the court may depart from the arbitration determination as it thinks fit, including at sub-para (c) in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. In other words, parties to a children&#8217;s arbitration enter into the process explicitly accepting that the court, applying the foundational principles of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, may make an order which differs from the determination. The IFLA clearly considers the rules, and ARB1-CS form, to state the law correctly, and in my opinion, they are right to do so. The parties are equally right to understand that the court retains its welfare jurisdiction in the manner explained in the ARB1-CS form. </p>

In the court setting, the appellate test is the same for financial and children&#8217;s cases, and in my judgment, the same should apply when an arbitration award or determination is challenged. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I agree with those words. In my judgment it is hard to conceive of a situation where a challenge to an arbitration award in a financial case, or an arbitration determination in a children&#8217;s case, procedurally needs any more than one application. That application will, of course, contain in the supporting skeleton argument the grounds upon which the challenge is pursued. Those grounds can include the matters mentioned at <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/68" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s68</ref> and s69 of the <span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Arbitration Act 1996</ref></span>, but these should not be separate free standing applications. The test will be the same, namely whether the award or determination was wrong; within that test, procedural irregularity or error of law may form part of the grounds of challenge. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#000000">"The Deputy Judge exercised a discretion under CPR Part 13.3. It is not open to me as a judge exercising a parallel jurisdiction in the same division of the High Court to entertain what would in effect be an appeal from that order. If the Defendant wished to challenge whether the order made by Mr Berry was disproportionate and wrong in principle, then he should have applied for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. I have been given no real reasons why this was not done. That course remains open to him even today, although he will have to persuade the Court of Appeal of the reasons why he should have what, on any view, is a very considerable extension of time. It seems to me that the only power available to me on this application is that contained in CPR Part 3.1(7), which enables the Court to vary or revoke an order. This is not confined to purely procedural orders and there is no real guidance in the White Book as to the possible limits of the jurisdiction. Although this is not intended to be an exhaustive definition of the circumstances in which the power under CPR Part 3.1(7) is exercisable, it seems to me that, for the High Court to revisit one of its earlier orders, the Applicant must either show some material change of circumstances or that the judge who made the earlier order was misled in some way, whether innocently or otherwise, as to the correct factual position before him. The latter type of case would include, for example, a case of material non-disclosure on an application for an injunction. If all that is sought is a reconsideration of the order on the basis of the same material, then that can only be done, in my judgment, in the context of an appeal. Similarly, it is not, I think, open to a party to the earlier application to seek in effect to re-argue that application by relying on submissions and evidence which were available to him at the time of the earlier hearing, but which, for whatever reason, he or his legal representatives chose not to employ. It is therefore clear that I am not entitled to entertain this application on the basis of the Defendant's first main submission, that Mr Berry's order was in any event disproportionate and wrong in principle, although I am bound to say that I have some reservations as to whether he was right to impose a condition of this kind without in terms enquiring whether the Defendant had any realistic prospects of being able to comply with the condition."</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I conclude that a party who seeks to set aside or vary a triage/paper decision made in respect of an arbitration award/determination is entitled to apply under FPR 2010 4.1(6), but the application is only likely to be allowed if it demonstrates exceptionality justifying a reversal of the triage/paper decision. I also take the view, for reasons which I will attempt to explain, that in any event a route of appeal (where the ultimate test is whether the order was wrong, a lower threshold than exceptionality on a set aside application) lies against the triage/paper decision and, accordingly, there is little or no practical benefit in applying to set aside the order under FPR 2010 4.1(6).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am of the view that the triage/paper decision is susceptible to the appellate route in accordance with FPR Part 30. I do not consider that it is permissible to circumvent, or ignore, the established right to appeal under Part 30. Thus, the party aggrieved by the triage/paper decision requires permission to appeal. Assuming the decision has been made by a circuit judge, the route of appeal is to the High Court, and the usual test will apply i.e whether the appellant can demonstrate that the triage/paper decision was &#8220;wrong&#8221;. In a sense, the appeal from the triage/paper decision would be tantamount to a second appeal. Accordingly, in my view (but this will ultimately be a matter for the appeal court) it may be that the permission to appeal application should be informed by not only whether there is a &#8220;real prospect of success&#8221; but also whether the appeal would &#8220;raise an important point of principle or practice&#8221; (CPR 52.7). I acknowledge that this applies to appeals to the Court of Appeal, and is not replicated in the rules for appeals to the High Court, but in my judgment such an approach might be a logical way for an appellate court to consider an appeal against a triage/paper order which in itself procedurally is treated as an appeal against the arbitration award/determination. </p>
