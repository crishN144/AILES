As this judgment will make clear the scope of this case has encompassed almost every issue that can arise within a matrimonial finance case.  In some ways that is hardly surprising.  I know of no other case where the breakdown of a marriage has engendered litigation on the scale witnessed in this case.   </p>

The husband (&#8220;H&#8221;) has issued proceedings against the wife (&#8220;W&#8221;) in the Chancery Division, in the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division for the tort of deceit, and in the Family Division in respect of the child of the family and financial proceedings.  So far, he has spent some &#163;6.5m on the litigation.  As he lives abroad, he pays no VAT.  W has spent some &#163;3.8m inclusive of VAT but exclusive of the sum of &#163;1.05m paid by her father for a forensic investigator. </p>

In March 2018 H moved to Dubai, where he has lived since then, as I understand it for a combination of business and fiscal reasons.

She says that she was shocked by the results of the tests.  One of the issues that I have been called upon to determine is the state of W&#8217;s knowledge or suspicion of the true paternity of C.  H says that it is inconceivable that W did not know the truth of the paternity and that her non-disclosure of it to H amounts to conduct that it would be inequitable for me to disregard pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 25(1)</ref>(g) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>.

In 2016 W took 44 flights by private jet.  In just 3 months in 2017 W spent &#8364;150,000 in three visits to single shops buying fashion items.  H spent at a similar level.  Summer holidays would normally involve the rental of luxury villas and/or chartered yachts.  Parties were thrown of unbelievable lavishness costing massive sums of money.  The main family car was a Rolls Royce Ghost and W had a series of customised Ferraris. </p>

He has provided minimal evidence as to the source of funds but says that much of the cost was put through various family companies, the details of which he is unable to specify.  If the payment was not to be made by himself personally, he would simply contact the family office to make the necessary arrangements.  He says that he had the use of his brother&#8217;s credit card, just as his brother was able to charge items to H&#8217;s credit cards.  Sometimes bills were paid by proxies.</p>

I doubt very much that the parties knew or gave any thought to how much was being spent.  Judging by the standard of living I suspect that it was well in excess of &#163;5m p.a.  The level of H&#8217;s disclosed income is no guide whatsoever to the level of funds available to be spent.  All expenditure was funded by H. </p>

We have what is understood in India as a Family Arrangement. I understand that such Family Arrangements have not been defined statutorily under Indian laws (but Indian lawyers can confirm that). I also understand that Halsbury's Laws of England define it as an agreement among members of the same family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family, either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family property or the peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by saving its honour. It is a hybrid between a trust and contractual agreements.  </span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.69in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:-0.01in"><span style="font-style:italic">It is a verbal arrangement by which the members of my family have settled their inter se ("among themselves&#8221;), rights in relation to a property to avoid disputes and to promote family harmony. The purpose of a family agreement is to secure mutual co-operation and to avert future disputes. It maintains peace and harmony in the family. I understand that a family arrangement is a valid, legally-binding and enforceable understanding. I am told that the Indian courts give great force to a family agreement. The Courts have upheld family arrangements that also include those who are not members of a joint family, or those whose entitlement to inheriting a property is doubtful. Courts lean in favour of upholding a family arrangement instead of disturbing the same on technical or trivial grounds even if they suffer from a legal lacuna or a formal defect. The courts in the past have applied the rule of estoppel &#8212; a legal bar to alleging or denying a fact because of one's own previous actions or words to the contrary &#8212; to prevent the unsettling of a family agreement.  </span></p>

To go back a full four years is unrealistic in the context of a Family Arrangement. My family and I make gifts to each other regularly; our family assets and finances are fluid. As such, it is simply not possible for me to detail every transfer I have made to family members or associates since February 2014.  </span></p>

What is critical here is that this is non-matrimonial money; the provenance of the money is entirely from my family. It should only be invaded in case of need. (I note that the Respondent is alive to this which is why she has recently embarked on an entirely litigation-driven spending spree aimed at giving credibility to what I suspect will be an absurd claimed income need).  </span></p>

Assets and monies are transferred between family members at the drop of a hat and members of the family come in and out of companies and trusts whenever it is decided that it is useful.

But, I have no reason to believe that the &#8216;loan&#8217; was other than genuinely made.  I do not find that the property is a resource that is available to H to dispose of as he wishes.  It is part of the family arrangement, available for H to use whenever he wishes.  It is entirely foreseeable that the loan from H&#8217;s brother will be dealt with by an adjustment of assets between the brothers and that adjustment may well involve entities of which I am unaware.  I accept that the purchase was funded from resources that were not part of H&#8217;s wealth and were by way of loan, and I therefore conclude that the value of the property should not be treated as a resource available to H.  H must indemnify W against any liability to the lenders. </p>

On the one hand H says that these loans are recoverable by his father on behalf of the family at any time, which I reject.  But, on the other hand he says that the monies that are owed to him emanate from or represent funds provided by his family and do not come from his own business endeavours.  This is a more persuasive argument and one that I will consider later in the judgment when dealing with the origin of funds.  For the avoidance of doubt, I make it clear that I accept that these are monies which are indeed owed to H by the entities set out in the schedule.

Five properties and plots of land were valued by Smith &amp; Williamson for the purposes of a return to HMRC.  Mr Todd QC questioned their basis of valuation but I have no reason to think that it was anything other than a proper market valuation.  Six properties were valued by Savills and others pursuant to an order made by me.  The ratio of value against cost falls between 1.16 at the low point to 7.59 at the high point.  This is not necessarily a criticism of the accounts as the properties no doubt will have appeared at cost price.  The effect of applying the mean of 2.54 (as W proposes) to the cost value of the properties/noncurrent assets would enhance their value by some &#163;228m, as the schedule sets out.   </p>

I am satisfied that H has or will have in the imminent future, a substantial interest in Company V, probably to the extent of 16.67%, being the original interest of W and C before their removal.  That would put him in a position of equality with his brother and with his parents.  However, I can form no assessment at all of its likely value, although I am satisfied that is it substantial. </p>

She should receive them free of charge.  It is the only home that C has known.  The suggestion by H that C should live in a property about a quarter of the value to what he knows with no room for any staff is unrealistic and the polar opposite of the life he enjoys when with H.  The family home is of course a very substantial property for a spouse and one child, but virtually every aspect of the parties&#8217; lives exceeds needs. </p>

It makes no economic sense for W to have the expense and anxiety that would go with a holiday home in the South of France when she would spend next to no time there, as most of her holidays would be spent in India, restricted as she is to England during the school terms. </p>

Thereafter, the money that was made was largely subject to various family arrangements which permit the older generation to recall the funds.  Insofar as assets are in his name, they are in the main the product of funds advanced to him by his family and their genesis is nonmatrimonial.  Therefore, he says that W&#8217;s claim is not a sharing claim but is one to be calculated on a needs basis, the vast bulk of which he says is available to her from her own resources. </p>

Both H and W&#8217;s budgets include eye-watering figures &#8211; for example each of clothing and holiday costs over and above the costs to his parents for this 9 year old boy at &#163;100,000 p.a. per item.

Mr Todd on behalf of H readily accepted that if H was to meet financial ruin nevertheless his family would give him full financial support and in all probability his life would continue as before.  I am sure the same applies to W.  The sum that I am ordering H to pay to W is in the big scheme of things a small part of the resources available to H and a very small part of the family resources, amounting to about 8 years of family expenditure.  Pride is very important to H and I fully understand how hurtful the breakdown of the marriage has been.  Mr Todd floated across my bows the difficulties that H may say he has in complying with an order for payment.  I very much hope that these premonitions do not turn out to be accurate, but they cannot be a reason for the court not making what it regards as a fair order. </p>
