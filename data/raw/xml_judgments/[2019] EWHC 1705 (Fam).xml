	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This was an urgent application within matrimonial proceedings for further injunctive relief (comprising both mandatory and prohibitory orders) against and relating to the Sixth Respondent (&#8220;Straight&#8221;), a Liechtenstein establishment. These proceedings were previously heard by Haddon-Cave J (as he then was), sitting in the Family Division. He gave several reported judgments in respect of which the Respondents remain in breach. In summary, the Applicant, Ms Akhmedova, is the former wife of the First Respondent, Mr Akhmedov. By a judgment dated 15 December 2016 and an order dated 20 December 2016, Ms Akhmedova was awarded an amount equal in value to &#163;453,576,152 (&#8220;the Award&#8221;) by this court pursuant to her application for financial remedies following the breakdown of her marriage to Mr Akhmedov. Save in respect of a very small proportion (around &#163;5 million or so), the said award remains outstanding in its entirety and thus Mr Akhmedov is in breach of the court&#8217;s order dated 20 December 2016. On 21 March 2018 Haddon-Cave J made, amongst other orders, a freezing order against Straight up to the sum of US$487,278,000 (&#8220;the </p>

It is believed to be the only one of Mr Akhmedov&#8217;s assets against which there will be any enforcement in the near future. By paragraph 1 of the Straight Order, Straight was declared by this court to be Mr Akhmedov&#8217;s alter ego and, by paragraph 9 of that order, Straight was ordered to transfer the Vessel to Ms Akhmedova. However, and in breach of the Straight Order and in contempt of court, Mr Akhmedov and Straight failed either to transfer the Vessel to Ms Akhmedova or to pay her the monetary equivalent set out in that Order.  </p>

In making this application, Ms Akhmedova and her legal team recognised that it was unlikely that the injunctive order sought would be either recognised or enforceable in Dubai (where the Vessel is located) or in Liechtenstein (where Straight is incorporated and the <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> directors appeared to be domiciled). It was, however, submitted that the orders sought had real practical utility as the <span style="font-style:italic">de facto</span> directors were Liechtenstein-based lawyers and business people with reputations to protect who would not wish to be the subject of committal proceedings in the English court. </p>

Unusually there was time for me to read and hear argument that day though I had no time to give a judgment. At the conclusion of the hearing and having taken time to reflect, I indicated that I would grant the order sought and hand down a judgment at a later date, probably in April 2019. Unhappily, by reason of serious illness which necessitated a very lengthy leave of absence from work, I have been unable to hand </p>

I propose to set out in a little more detail the background pertinent to an understanding of how and why this application came to be made. I will then consider matters pertaining to the service of this application on the Respondents as I was invited to treat this application as on notice application on the basis that service was sought to be abridged due to urgency. I then consider the merits of the injunctive relief sought before determining whether and in what form a penal notice should be attached to the order for injunctive relief.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Akhmedova issued her petition for divorce on 24 October 2013 and applied for financial remedies on 25 October 2013. She was granted a decree nisi on 2 December 2015. The financial remedy hearing was heard by Haddon-Cave J between 28 November and 15 December 2016. Although he was not represented at that hearing, Mr Akhmedov had submitted to the jurisdiction of the English court in the financial remedy proceedings as confirmed by a letter dated 18 June 2015 from his then solicitors, Sears Tooth. Mr Akhmedov and his legal representatives participated fully in the proceedings up to and including the pre-trial review in October 2016. However, Sears Tooth came off the record in November 2016 though it only became apparent at the start of the November 2016 hearing that Mr Akhmedov would not be represented at that hearing. Neither he nor the then other Respondents &#8211; (a) Woodblade, a Cypriot registered company and the trustee of a Bermudian trust, the Akhmedov 2013 Discretionary Trust (Mr Akhmedov being the sole director of Woodblade) and (b) Cotor Investment SA, a Panamanian company which Mr Akhmedov contended was within the Trust and which was said to hold the bulk of the wealth in this case &#8211; appeared or were represented at the November 2016 hearing. Mr Akhmedov&#8217;s failure to appear at the November 2016 hearing was in breach of court orders made as recently as the pre-trial review in October 2016. Haddon Cave J was satisfied that service of the proceedings and notice of the trial was properly effected on Mr Akhmedov, Woodblade and Cotor.  </p>

Ms Akhmedova was also awarded her costs in the sum of &#163;1,096,971. Following his judgment, a series of developments resulted the delivery of two further judgments from Haddon-Cave J, in consequence of which 2 further Liechtenstein entities, Qubo 1 and Qubo 2 Establishments, were joined as Fourth and Fifth Respondents to the proceedings.  </p>

When Ms Akhmedova learned that the Vessel was in Dubai, she applied for and obtained a freezing order and an arrest of the Vessel from the Dubai courts. Straight applied to set aside the freezing order on the basis, inter alia, that Straight was not a party to the Award. Accordingly, Ms Akhmedova applied to this court on 21 March 2018 (a) to join Straight and Avenger Assets Corporation as Respondents to the matrimonial proceedings and (b) for substantial relief and a freezing order against Straight, to include the Vessel. Avenger Assets Corporation is another entity apparently controlled by Mr Akhmedov.   </p>

In response, Mr Akhmedov filed jurisdictional challenges and in May 2018 he applied for a declaration that the court of the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC) did not have jurisdiction over the dispute. In the same month, Straight&#8217;s appeal on personal jurisdiction was allowed but the freezing order remained in place pending an application to join Straight to the substantive proceedings before the DIFC. On 11 July 2018 the Joint Judicial Committee of Dubai decided that the Dubai Court of First Instance rather than the DIFC had jurisdiction over Ms Akhmedova&#8217;s application for recognition. On 12 July 2018 the Dubai Court of First Instance granted an arrest over the Vessel pending the substantive decision on Ms Akhmedova&#8217;s application. </p>

Ms Akhmedova appealed and it appears that a decision on her pending appeal will be handed down on 27 March 2019. If Ms Akhmedova is unsuccessful in her appeal, Straight may well be able to remove the Vessel from Dubai on 28 March 2019 (which is understood to be the earliest date on which the arrest could be lifted). It is unclear whether Ms Akhmedova could obtain a stay pending a further appeal. If the Vessel is removed from Dubai, it may become practically impossible to enforce her ownership.  </p>

She has begun proceedings in the Marshall Islands to re-register the Vessel in her own name. It is understood that Straight is contesting those proceedings. If she is successful in those proceedings and the Vessel remains in Dubai, it is believed by her legal representatives that Ms Akhmedova will be able to take control of the Vessel in Dubai. However, if the Vessel is removed from Dubai to a third party jurisdiction, it is unclear whether Ms Akhmedova would be able to exercise her ownership rights. </p>

A response was requested by 25 March 2019. &#8220;Bounce back&#8221; emails were received as described above.

That, however, was not the end of the matter since Ms Akhmedova sought an order, validating both the steps taken to serve the application (which included service by email) and declaring that such service on 21 March 2019 constituted good service on Straight. She was concerned that Straight might seek to argue that service by email would constitute a criminal offence in Liechtenstein and thus would not be good service. I observe that, out of an abundance of caution, the material sent to Straight and its directors in Liechtenstein was expressed to be by way of &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">notification</span>&#8221; rather than by way of service. </p>

Mr Penny QC gave me an informal translation of the order made which is in similar terms to that which Ms Akhmedova invited this Court to make. The Liechtenstein order required Ms Akhmedova to provide security of CHF 5 million before it could be served. Though this requirement is the subject of a without notice appeal by Ms Akhmedova, it might well be argued that she should provide such security in order to obtain relief in the very jurisdiction where Straight and its officers were based or that she should at least wait until the appeal was resolved before applying to this court. Mr Penny QC informed me that Ms Akhmedova had insufficient funds to provide such security and her litigation funder was not currently prepared to offer it either. Her financial situation was as a direct result of Straight and its alter ego, Mr Akhmedov, refusing to comply with this court&#8217;s earlier orders. Given that, I am persuaded, notwithstanding the existence of the Liechtenstein injunctive order, that Ms Akhmedova had good reason to make this application and was not merely &#8220;jurisdiction shopping&#8221;. In any event, it seems to me that waiting for the outcome of the appeal in Liechtenstein was not a sensible option as the Vessel may have long departed from Dubai by the time the appeal was resolved (estimated by Mr Penny QC to be a few weeks hence). Furthermore, in the event Ms Akhmedova&#8217;s appeal in Liechtenstein succeeds, Straight and its officers can apply to the courts if any inconsistency between the order made by this court and the order made by the court in Liechtenstein emerges. The mere possibility of any inconsistency is insufficient in my view to deny Ms Akhmedova the relief she seeks from this court. </p>

Further, she anticipated making a cassation appeal in Dubai (which might also be successful) and she might also seek a delivery up order from this Court backed with a penal notice to ensure compliance. She was also taking steps to persuade the relevant authorities not to allow the Vessel to depart from Dubai pending judgment in the Marshall Islands but there is no certainty about the outcome of these representations.

Practice Direction 37A 1.1 provides for a form of words to be used in a penal notice but it is clear from the proviso &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">or in words to substantially the same effect</span>&#8221; in both paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 that the requirements are not fixed. As the commentary on page 2037 of The Family Court Practice 2018 notes, it has long been recognised that the form of penal notice prescribed by rules of court is not rigid and may be adapted to the facts of a particular case so long as it is clear and substantially accords with the standard wording given that a clear penal notice is an essential prerequisite to enforcement. The White Book Vol. 1 (2018) commentary at paragraph 81.9.2 (p.2308) deals with the requirements of a penal notice in the other divisions of the High Court and recommends specific wording in the case of a corporate respondent, which includes naming the directors or officers. In the interests of fairness and clarity, I have adopted the approach to naming directors and/or officers set out in the White Book to the penal notices made within these proceedings which are governed by the FPR. </p>

The majority in the Supreme Court were clear that the question as to whether a person is a de facto director of a company is very much one of fact and degree, there being no single decisive test. All the circumstances must be taken into account. In paragraph 94 Lord Collins suggested the test was <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;whether Mr Holland was part of the corporate governing structure of the composite companies and whether he assumed a role in those companies which imposed on him the fiduciary duties of a director&#8230;</span>&#8221;. Thus, though this will be but one relevant factor, it is not enough for Ms Akhmedova to rely on the fact that the interested parties are directors of Counselor and then that Counselor is the sole director of Straight. Leggatt J asked himself in Touton whether the individual was the person having primary control over the company [paragraph 6] and held that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a de facto director for this purpose means someone who has assumed the status and function of a director so as to make himself responsible as if he were one</span>&#8221; [paragraph 13].

The affidavit of Ms Akhmedova&#8217;s solicitor stated that the above was understood to be the case from Ms Akhmedova&#8217;s Liechtenstein lawyers. In fact, inspection of the company search undertaken in Liechtenstein on behalf of Ms Akhmedova revealed that all five Counselor directors named in company documents relating to Counselor Trust Reg. dated 3 August 2017 &#8211; Dr Andreas Schurti, Urs Hanselmann, Dr Ernst Walch, Dr Barbara Walch and Dr Rolf Blasy &#8211; had sole signatory authority over Counselor [&#8220;Einzelunterschrift&#8221;] (Bundle page 377). That document plainly strengthened Ms Akhmedova&#8217;s case. All these individuals thus had the capacity to individually bind Straight (through its sole director Counselor) and so could be said to be part of the corporate governance structure of Straight. </p>
