The plan (his plan at least) had been for the mother to join him at the hotel, in part so that they could celebrate their third wedding anniversary.  The mother did not, however, join him; she remained at the home of the maternal grandmother.  The father was able to see K most days during the trip.

Almost immediately upon her arrival in Dubai she set about taking steps with the objective of securing K&#8217;s residence in that jurisdiction, the first such step being the registration of the company on 3 August 2023.  While she took various unilateral steps, both administratively and through the courts, she was duplicitous.  She sent the father messages aimed at giving him the false impression that the parties continued to be in a loving relationship.  After she had obtained interim orders from the court, including a travel ban, the tone of her messages changed and she restricted her communications with him. </p>

His degree of integration was insufficient to bring about a change.  In particular, his time in Dubai lacked the necessary quality of stability to amount to an habitual residence on 13 November 2023.  For the initial period, I was informed by Mr Alyas that he and his mother were staying in the maternal grandmother&#8217;s property.  They only moved to their own separate accommodation on 30 September 2023.  K&#8217;s situation in Dubai was fundamentally unstable.  There were no arrangements in place for him to have contact with his father on a regular basis (or at all).  The mother had taken actions which had the effect of preventing him from returning to his country of birth and nationality. The father was being marginalised and prevented from exercising his parental responsibility. K was the subject of litigation in Dubai and caught in the middle of an increasingly acrimonious dispute.  He was on the point of being the subject of litigation in England.  All of those matters lead me to the conclusion that this was a case in which a transfer of habitual residence from England and Wales to Dubai would, to paraphrase Lord Wilson, be slow to occur.  That transfer had not, in my judgment, been achieved by 13 November 2023.</p>

I was informed by Mr Alyas that in Dubai any decision about K&#8217;s custody was likely to be a foregone conclusion.  The fact that the father is a non-Muslim will almost inevitably mean that custody will be awarded to the mother.  I attach no weight to the fact that the Dubai proceedings were issued first in time, given that this was achieved to a significant extent by the mother&#8217;s duplicity.</p>

When I sought further clarification, he added (again on instructions) that the mother wants the father to have a good relationship with K and would be happy to give him visitation rights in Dubai.  The mother&#8217;s equivocal response to my enquiry, coupled with her actions to date and her duplicity in her communications with the father leave me with no confidence at all that she would seek to promote K&#8217;s paternal relationship. Neither does an email which the mother sent to the court on 7 December 2023 in which she made clear that while she was in agreement to the father having visitation, he would need to go to court in Dubai to claim his rights; in the event that he were to proceed with this hearing she intimated that she would have no other option but to withdraw all contact (direct and indirect) unless authorised by the Dubai court.  Moreover, her stated willingness to disobey orders of this court is a matter for considerable concern.  In my view, if K were to remain in Dubai it is likely that he would see his father at best for limited periods of time over such occasions as the father was able to travel to Dubai.  Such limited contact would be wholly contrary to K&#8217;s interests given his young age.  It would not meet his emotional needs. His inability properly to develop his relationship with his father would have potentially enduring consequences for him.  Aside from his father, K has a right to be able to spend time with his paternal family (with whom he lived for the first few months of his life) and to spend at least some time in the jurisdiction of which he is a national (although this latter factor may be more of a long-term consideration).</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Allowing K to remain in Dubai would have significant disadvantages for the forensic process.  It would be harder at the end of the process for the court to reach reliable conclusions as to the jurisdiction in which K should live on a long-term basis and the parent with whom he should live, if he had not had the opportunity to spend regular and meaningful time with his father.  In assessing the extent to which K should divide his time in future between his parents, it may well be of value for any independent welfare reporter to observe K in the company of his father.</p>

I find it difficult to conceive of a long-term welfare-based conclusion which did not entail K spending at least some time in England.  Ensuring that this happens as soon as possible is likely to promote his interests.</p>

These include financial undertakings to pay for return flights, independent accommodation and maintenance in an amount to be agreed.  If the amount cannot be agreed, I will hear submissions as to how the issue should be resolved.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The other undertakings proposed by the father are to ensure that K is not removed from the mother&#8217;s care save for agreed or ordered contact, not to enter nor attempt to enter the mother&#8217;s accommodation, non-molestation undertakings and additional undertakings not to seek without notice orders from the court.  In my view, these matters should be regulated by orders rather than undertakings.  I invite the parties to draw up appropriate orders under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> to cover these points. A breach of a non-molestation order would likely lead to the father&#8217;s arrest, a proposition which will provide the mother with additional protection and reassurance.</p>

It will be much to K&#8217;s benefit if she comes to England and participates fully in proceedings here.  She wishes ultimately to return to live in Dubai and this is an outcome which, in my view, has a realistic prospect of success following a full welfare evaluation.  The court is more likely to be sympathetic to her position if she comes back to England and demonstrates that she is sincere when she says that she wishes to promote K&#8217;s relationship with his father.</p>
