W was born in Russia and has a number of different nationalities.  H was born in Ukraine and likewise is a national of a number of different countries.  The marriage took place in Russia.  It appears to be common ground that in April 2014 there was a significant argument between the parties. </p>

The seamless cohabitation/marriage was only of some 5 years if it came to an end in 2014 but if 2017 the marriage would be deemed to be one of 8 years.   </p>

I accept that I signed the petition which was in English and just put in front of me, but at no time was it translated in Russian either on paper or orally so that I could check it.

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0.25in">However, in our view, the answer to the question whether waiver has occurred or not depends upon considering together both what has been disclosed and the circumstances in which disclosure has occurred. As to the latter, the authorities in England strongly support the view that a degree of reliance is required before waiver arises, but there may be issues as to the extent of the reliance. Ultimately, there is the single composite question of whether, having regard to these considerations, fairness requires that the full advice be made available. A court might, for example, find it difficult to say what side of the contents/effect line a particular disclosure falls, but the answer to whether there has been waiver may be easier to discern if the focus is on the question whether fairness requires full disclosure. </p>

If on the other hand there is reliance, it is only fair that the full advice (at least with respect to any relevant issue disclosed) should be produced. </p>
