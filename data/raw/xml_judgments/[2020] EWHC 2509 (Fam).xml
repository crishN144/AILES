It transpired that he was the father&#8217;s fourteen-year old nephew (&#8216;C&#8217;).  C had been living in the paternal family home in the village in Northern Pakistan where the extended families on both sides reside.  The children of the parties have also been living in that home since March 2020; prior to that they were living in the maternal family home, a short distance away.  I have no doubt that the children will have been close to their cousin.  The news was extremely shocking and upsetting for both parties, but especially the father.

In answer to an enquiry from me as to the possibility of resuming the evidence on day 4 (my other listed case having gone short), he told me that he did not consider that it would be professionally proper for him to take over the cross examination started by his predecessor.  I accept this, in the particular circumstances of this case, and given all of the difficulties I have described.  He initially expressed some surprise that oral evidence was being heard at all, his view being that &#8216;cases of this type&#8217; would normally be dealt with on submissions.  On further reflection, he later submitted to me that in circumstances where the court had begun to hear oral evidence it would not be appropriate to make any determination of the issues on the basis of submissions<span style="color:#FF0000"/>alone. </p>

I make no findings, without having heard from the father, about where the responsibility for this lies.  During the course of her oral evidence the mother said that she has been able to speak to one out of three children on an approximately weekly basis; but not with more than one child on any given occasion of telephone contact.  She also stated that the calls were frequently cut short.  It was not put to her that these factual matters were incorrect.  On behalf of the father, it was instead suggested that the reasons as to the unavailability of the children at various times (matters such as being in another room or eating a meal) were likely to be genuine, a point disputed by the mother.  Whatever the reasons for this unsatisfactory contact, it seems to me that it is likely to be compounding the emotional harm from which the children will have suffered since being separated from the mother. </p>

They are living in a household which is likely to be consumed by grief and shock.  The degree of upset felt by the father was such that he felt unable to continue with the case and wishes urgently to be reunited with his family.  The level of distress felt by C&#8217;s parents will inevitably be far worse; I can also imagine that C&#8217;s grandparents will be feeling a terrible sense of loss, as will other members of the paternal household.  I consider the children are likely to be feeling a mixture of shock, distress, confusion and fear.   </p>

However it is my view that at this stage there is no threshold for progressing the case to initial child protection conference however the family are not willing to work with care under a child in need plan. However mother has agreed to work with the local children's centre, who will be able to support her regarding social isolation, finances and visa. Additional workers will also be able to provide support regarding domestic abuse.&#8217; </p>

In the context of the father&#8217;s allegation within these proceedings that the mother had been repeatedly urging J &#8211; &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">brainwashing</span>&#8217; her - to tell her teachers that &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">I hit and argue with her mother</span>&#8217; it is relevant to note also that: (a) this was not an explanation which was offered by the father at the time of the assessment; and (b) there was an element of detail given by J in her account which does not sit easily with the notion what she was saying was merely rehearsed.  Nor did the father assert at the time that, as he now claims, the day prior to J making one of her allegations to the school, the mother had specifically encouraged her to &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">tell school tomorrow and say to them that dad hit you</span>.&#8217; </p>

If parents do not change how they manage their differences or disputes then this could result in the situation escalating and the children being exposed to domestic incidents in the future. Subsequently, the children's safety needs will not be met by parents and the children are likely to be at risk of emotional and physical harm. Furthermore, [the father] has not taken any responsibility for the physical violence he has caused to [the mother] and has minimised and deflected this when challenged by CSWS. This raises concern around [the father&#8217;s] ability to work openly with professionals.  Observations of [the father] during the assessment are positive.

In October 2018 the visa had been extended for two and a half years.  It is in my view improbable, in that context, that the mother would have abandoned her long-held desire to live in England under a settled immigration status and instead relocate to Pakistan. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.02in;text-indent:0.12in">One of the mother&#8217;s reasons for not wishing to live in Pakistan was, on the father&#8217;s evidence, that she had no wish to live with his family and her own family&#8217;s home was unsuitable as a home for the children.  It was unsuitable as it lacked certain basic amenities and was too small for the number of people in occupation.  It is, in my view, highly unlikely that the mother would have agreed to give up the secure family home in Leeds and relocate to Pakistan in circumstances which would require her to choose between two wholly unsatisfactory options as to housing. </p>

The children &#8211; J and K in particular &#8211; were given no opportunity to say goodbye to their teachers and friends.  I do not believe that the mother would have allowed J or K to depart in these circumstances.  If she had known that family were leaving Pakistan never to return, there would have been no reason not to tell the school.  Apart from the fact that failing to inform the school in such circumstances would have been discourteous (which I do not believe the mother to be) it would also have been contrary to the interests of J and K. </p>

On the contrary, I consider that her contacting the school for help is consistent with her being in a state of desperation.  She had nothing to gain by making a false allegation in circumstances where she was in Pakistan at the time, completely reliant upon the father to provide her with limited financial support and in close proximity to the extended families on both sides. </p>

Mr Vollenweider submitted that, without wishing to inform me what he had been told, I should bear in mind that the Peshwari word which has been translated as &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">made</span>&#8217; may have a more nuanced meaning encapsulating the notion that actions taken by the father were done for the mother&#8217;s benefit and with the best of intentions.  I do not consider that submission to be persuasive, especially bearing in mind that the certified translation was obtained by the father.  In the absence of a proper explanation from the father, I find that the messages should be interpreted as they read. They amount to an admission by the father that he did as the mother alleges, namely leave her stranded in Pakistan against her wishes.  Even if it was the father&#8217;s view that he was acting with the best of intentions that would not mitigate the seriousness of what he did.  I should also note that the messages and the hint of an explanation I was offered are inconsistent with the father&#8217;s written evidence that the genesis of the trip to Pakistan was the mother&#8217;s wish to see her grandmother. </p>

I have seen a cargo receipt and an email confirmation which together demonstrate that the father caused 200 kg of cargo to be sent (I infer to Pakistan) in October 2018 and a further 220 kg to be sent in January 2019.  There is no evidence as to what the earlier shipment contained or to whom it was sent.  The cargo receipt shows that several different bags of differing weight were sent in January.  The mother accepts that a significant quantity of items were indeed sent to Pakistan; but on her case these essentially comprised provisions for the month the family were to spend in Pakistan as well as extensive gifts for the wider family.  Without hearing oral evidence I am not in a position to make findings as to what exactly was sent to Pakistan.  In my judgment, however, the documentary evidence on this point is consistent with both parties&#8217; cases and is not sufficient to outweigh the considerable evidence which points to the truth of the mother&#8217;s allegations. </p>

It is a fallacy that a victim of domestic abuse is likely to display at all times a meek or cowed demeanour.  Domestic abuse can arise in many circumstances with differing degrees of seriousness.  A person can experience periodic abuse while at the same time, in other contexts, leading a successful life.  Domestic abuse &#8211; especially abuse that is coercive or controlling in character - often stems from an imbalance of power in a relationship; the relationship becomes abusive when that imbalance is misused.  It seems likely to me that the power in this marriage lay with the father who &#8211; as I have said &#8211; did not expect his wife to &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">disobey</span>&#8217; him.  She, by contrast, was vulnerable: she was socially isolated; her immigration status was insecure; her English was very poor; she had no means of supporting herself financially and was wholly dependent upon such provision as the father chose to give her.  The mere fact that there exists an imbalance of power does not, of course, mean that it has been misused. </p>

He did not intend to alter the key question which, in every case, is: where is the child habitually resident? Even though the acquisition of a new habitual residence can be expected to coincide with the loss of the previous one, hence the see-saw analogy, this issue is not determined by asking simply the question whether a child has lost their habitual residence. In addition to the passages I have quoted above, this is clear from his observation, at [46], that &#8220;the identification of a child&#8217;s habitual residence is overarchingly a question of fact&#8221; and from the balancing exercise he undertook, at [49] and [50].&#8217; </p>

This requires an analysis of the child&#8217;s situation in and connections with the state or states in which he or she is said to be habitually resident for the purpose of determining in which state he or she has the requisite degree of integration to mean that their residence there is habitual.  </p>

It was acknowledged that in some cases it may be appropriate for this to be through one of the child&#8217;s parents.  When a court is considering whether to make an interim order for the return of a child who has been abducted to or is stranded in another jurisdiction it may well not be possible to canvass the view<span style="color:#FF0000">s</span> of the child by independent means.  While this means that the court may be more cautious before making a return order in such cases, it does not mean that it is precluded from doing so.

In my judgment, however, they have an urgent emotional need to be reunited with their parents.  I consider it untenable for them to be in a jurisdiction without either parent, in particular their mother who has been their primary carer throughout their lives.  For reasons set out below, I will refuse to permit the father to travel to Pakistan on an interim basis while they remain in that jurisdiction; this means that if I do not order their return the parental separation will continue.  The recent tragic event involving the children&#8217;s cousin means that it would, in my view, be intolerable for the children to remain away from their parents.  To allow the situation to continue is likely to aggravate the emotional harm from which they will have suffered and be suffering as a result of being apart from their parents. </p>

In his own statement, he refers to his concern in March about the children being in an &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">emotional state&#8217;</span> when they found themselves in Pakistan without their parents.  In my view, the fact that he has not taken steps to facilitate contact with the mother coupled with the absence of any proposal from him to bring the children back to England in light of the tragic news concerning their cousin, suggests to me that he finds it difficult to prioritise the children&#8217;s needs when these conflict with his wider agenda to ensure that they are brought up in Pakistan with or without their mother. </p>
