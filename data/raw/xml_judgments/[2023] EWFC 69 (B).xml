Most cases are based on incorrect beliefs or misplaced anxiety which, unchecked, can cause children to undergo harms ranging from missing school and seeing friends, to undergoing unnecessary and painful or even harmful tests and treatments. Paediatricians, and other professionals, have a duty of care to the child but, in almost every case, their work will form part of a collaborative approach which involves the parent or carer as well as the child.&#8217;</span></p>

The proposed paediatric assessment was jettisoned.  Contrary to the guidance, no referral was made to a paediatrician to take the lead with regard to all decisions relating to the children&#8217;s health.  The child protection medical and proposed blood tests were abandoned.  Any thought of discussion with the mother, or discussion with, or assessment of the children&#8217;s father was abandoned.  It is not clear whether there had in fact been any investigations into what medication the mother held at home.  The rationale for supposing that either of the children were in imminent danger from poisoning seems to be an anticipation of the mother&#8217;s response to being dismissed from her job, that decision due to be communicated to her imminently, and Dr R&#8217;s assertion that because she was &#8216;on google all the time&#8217;; she had the knowledge and intention to induce seizures using anti-epileptic medication. </span></p>

Parents against whom an EPO is made ex parte are entitled to be given, if they ask, proper information as to what happened at the hearing and to be told, if they ask: (i) exactly what documents, bundles or other evidential materials were lodged with the FPC either before or during the course of the hearing; and (ii) what legal authorities were cited to the FPC. The local authority's legal representatives should respond forthwith to any reasonable request from the parents or their legal representatives either for copies of the materials read by the FPC or for information about what took place at the hearing. It will, therefore, be prudent for those acting for the local authority in such a case to keep a proper note of the proceedings, lest they otherwise find themselves embarrassed by a proper request for information which they are unable to provide.</span></p>

Extensive guidance has been issued by central government (Safeguarding children in whom illness is fabricated or induced&#160;&#8211; Department of Health 2002) explaining the particular approach that is required in such cases. A key message to social workers from this guidance is that any concerns about a child's health must be discussed with the GP or a paediatrician. Whether or not a child may be at risk of induced or fabricated illness must of necessity involve a medical assessment of his past health and parental care. It is not a diagnosis that can be made by social workers acting alone, it is a matter that requires skilled medical appraisal.</span></p>

The facts of that case were different and involved a baby being removed at birth, but the court clearly held that where the possibility of harm arose from the mother introducing something into the child's system (such as a laxative) that did not justify separating mother and child. In the present case, even on what the social workers apparently believed, there is no suggestion of positive action by the mother to induce symptoms, and the implication must be that under the ECHR there is even less justification for emergency removal of the child in those circumstances.</span></p>

At the earliest opportunity Mr Lewis and Ms Mettam pressed for the local authority to specify how it met its duties to the parents and children in light of the FII guidance, and to set out its rationale for the without notice application to be made.

Some matters remained in dispute, not least the application made by the mother and supported by the father for costs.  Other than that, although the local authority had confirmed it would not be seeking public law orders, there were outstanding questions to be resolved about the narrative to be given to the children, teachers and relevant health professionals, whether there should be any further involvement with the local authority in the family&#8217;s life at all, and if so, under what legal framework.  The possibility of a family assistance order had been raised.  The local authority wished there to be an ongoing &#8216;safety plan&#8217;.  The parents were particularly concerned that there should be a clear understanding of the position on all sides, otherwise they feared that they would continue to be subject to undue scrutiny from the local authority in their lives, and the allegations would continue to hang over them. </p>

The local authority was entrenched in its pursuit of threshold findings, notwithstanding it did not have the evidence to support them.  Further, had the local authority reflected on the bigger picture, in line with long-established guidance in FII cases, it is argued that it would surely have been driven to the conclusion that the proceedings could safely come to a conclusion without the need for public law orders. </p>

In June 2022, the local authority discovered that the mother had apparently lied not just to colleagues at work, but teachers at her children&#8217;s school, and potentially the children, about having had breast cancer.  Both children had been subject to various investigations into health-conditions.  There was justified cause for concern and certainly a need for further investigation. It is understandable that Dr R and the children&#8217;s headteacher felt shocked and overwhelmed by the discoveries that Dr R had made.  In that moment they no longer knew whether to trust any information that came from the mother, and could not trust their own experiences of her to inform risk assessment.  But it is for precisely this reason that the guidance is there, to enable informed, evidence-based, independent professional assessments of the risk to be made before rushing to action.</p>

The local authority has been consistently poor in responding to those requests, later made orders of the Court, and continued to disregard those orders, neither providing reasons, nor applying to the Court for extensions. Arguably, this did not just prevent the parties from understanding what had happened, and caused additional work for other parties&#8217; representatives, but contributed to the overall lack of reflection from the local authority on its own position as the case proceeded;</p>

All the FII guidance points clearly towards striving for a collaborative approach.  However, the local authority appeared to be focused only on driving the case towards a fact-finding exercise, notwithstanding at no point did it have expert evidence to substantiate its own pleaded case.</p>

Setting out the route by which I have come to this conclusion at some length in this judgment is not intended as a means of haranguing the local authority, or singling out any individual for personal criticism.

Upon receiving the evidence of the jointly instructed consultant paediatrician which did not support a finding of FII, and having received the parents&#8217; responses to threshold, the local authority should have analysed and reflected on the evidence base.  The local authority did not, and instead doubled down on its stance, which was an unreasonable one.  As a result, the parents and children were subject to the continuation of the proceedings, and to the intervention of the local authority in their lives, for longer than necessary.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">Dear Emma and Harry, </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">My name is Judge Vincent and I work at the Family Court in Oxford.  </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">My job is to make sure that children are safe, and that their mums and dads can look after them.  If mums and dads need help to look after their children, I make sure they get the help they need. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">Social workers also have the job of making sure that children are safe.  If social workers have a worry, they come and tell me about it.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">I know that both of you are happy and healthy children.  Your mum and dad love you more than anything in the world.  They look after you and give you everything you need.  They can keep you safe.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">I know that both of you had some health issues.  Your mum was the one who took you to the appointments.  A good parent takes their child to the doctor to make sure they are well.   But sometimes a mum or dad is so focused on wanting their child to be well and healthy, they can start imagining that the littlest thing is a sign of illness.  Then, they can start believing their child is seriously ill, when they are not ill at all.  Instead of the child going to the doctor to get better and keep healthy, they might get medicine or treatment when they don&#8217;t need it.  That can be dangerous for them.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">This is what the social workers were worried about with your mum.  This is the reason that she had to leave home for a few months. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">I am happy to tell you that the social workers have looked into everything.  They know now that your mum, and your dad, can keep you safe. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">I would like to reassure you that the two of you have done nothing wrong.  There is nothing wrong with going to see the doctor if you have a worry about your health.  In fact, it is a very good idea.  </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">If in the future you are not feeling well, you can always talk to your mum or your dad about it, and they will make sure that you get the care you need.  Your mum is not going to be in trouble for taking you to the doctor.  She is a great mum.  I know that she can be trusted to look after you.  So can your dad. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">I know you missed your mum when she was away.  It was a really hard time for you and for all your family.  You knew that your mum would never hurt you, but I am afraid your mum had to stay away until the social workers were sure it was safe for her to come home.  </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">I am very sorry that you and your family had to go through this experience.  It was to make sure that you were safe, but it must have been very hard for you all. </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">I am pleased to tell you that now the social workers are happy your mum and dad can keep you safe, there is no need for there to be a case about you in the family court.  You can live your normal family life again.  I hope that you two feel very proud of yourselves for how you have looked after each other, and managed this very difficult time in your lives.</span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">I would like to wish you all the best for the future.   </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">Yours sincerely, </span></p>
	    <p><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">Her Honour Judge Joanna Vincent,</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';font-size:12pt">The Family Court, Oxford</span></p>
