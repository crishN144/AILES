There is a dispute as to the date they separated, the Husband saying that the Wife moved into a separate bedroom in 2013 and the parties finally separating in March 2016 when the Wife left the family home. The Wife says the date of separation was April 2018. A divorce petition was issued in 2021 and decree nisi pronounced the same year. Whether the marriage was 11 or 13 years, it is one of a medium length. There are no children of the marriage although the Wife has three children from another relationship with RK, twins aged 5 and another child aged 23 months.</p>

He accepts that he has an interest in the property at BR but says that this is 16.6%. Whilst accepting that this was the family home he asserts that it was never a matrimonial asset as the interest was transferred to him post separation. His case is that his late father had a property portfolio which was inherited by his mother on his father&#8217;s death. Whilst he accepts that he was a sole or joint legal owner of the other properties, with the exception of HR, he disputes that he has ever had any beneficial interest in the properties as alleged by the Wife or at all. He also says the Wife has undisclosed assets and land in India although this is disputed by her. He proposes that there is an immediate clean break between the parties with each retaining their own assets and liabilities.</p>

But if it is clear that a party is fully aware of the implications of an ante-nuptial agreement and indifferent to detailed particulars of the other party's assets, there is no need to accord the agreement reduced weight because he or she is unaware of those particulars. What is important is that each party should have all the information that is material to his or her decision, and that each party should intend that the agreement should govern the financial consequences of the marriage coming to an end.&#8221;</span></p>

Despite saying she required the assistance of an interpreter because of her limited understanding of English, all her statements are in English. None contained the required confirmation that they had been translated for her or that she understood them and the accepted practice of preparing the statement in her own language and then having it translated into English had not been complied with, even in respect of statements prepared and filed by Solicitors representing her at the start of these proceedings. In fact the Wife&#8217;s evidence was that her Solicitors had all their communications and correspondence with her brother which might reasonably have been expected to put them on notice as to the formal requirements necessary in respect of her written evidence, if necessary. Whilst the Wife said that the statements had been prepared with the assistance of her brother and sister and had been read back to her there was no evidence to confirm this and nothing to suggest the statements had not been prepared by her or that she could not understand them other than her own assertion this was the case. Both the Husband and his brother RV say she was able to speak and understand English without difficulty.</p>

On another occasion when asked why she had not stated in her written evidence her allegation that the Husband had told her she was free to go anywhere and have sex with anyone and that she could have a baby with anyone, she said she didn&#8217;t think it relevant to financial issues, and subsequently when asked whether she was pregnant in 2016 did not answer with a straightforward &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; but that she did not admit to it.  On other occasions, her evidence was not plausible such as when she said she could not recall having a practicing certificate or being on the role of the Bar Council in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

At one stage in his statement dated 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2022 the Husband refers to the parties signing the agreement in October 2006 before he returned to the UK but in oral evidence said it was signed after the parties married. </p>

However, later in the same statement he says the parties signed the agreement after they obtained legal advice and that the affidavit was signed in front of a notary public at the same law firm they received legal advice from. This was his position in oral evidence when he said he and the Wife went to court and signed a pre-nuptial agreement together. He said it was typed out and was explained to the Wife. He accepted this was the first time she had seen it. However, he then became confused and said he didn&#8217;t know anything about the pre-nuptial agreement and then that they went to another lawyer in India to get advice.</p>

However, in her oral evidence she admitted signing the affidavit, but said it was without being told anything about it and that it was given to her by her father-in-law with other papers to sign and was told it was to do with the visa for immigration and marriage. She confirmed she did not read the document before signing it. It is implausible that the Wife would not have mentioned this, either in her statement dated 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2023 or in her statement filed in respect of the divorce petition in which she provides a third version of events, namely that her father-in-law took her signature on the affidavit stating that if she left the Husband who is very well off then she would not be entitled to any financial claim or compensation.  I am satisfied that the Wife did attend before the notary on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2007 when she signed the affidavit, the contents of which were explained to her.</p>

However, the fact that the Wife had a practicing certificate in law, as I am satisfied she had based on the information given to the Immigration Tribunal, does not mean that she has or had any detailed knowledge of matrimonial law. Neither does the fact the Notary explained the legal terms and conditions of the affidavit, which may in any event have differed from any other document said to constitute the pre-nuptial agreement, mean the Wife was given any legal advice as to the consequences and implications of signing the agreement and whether it would be in her best interests to do so. The Husband&#8217;s own case appears to be that the parties went to see a lawyer, whether it was the notary or some other lawyer, together, although again at one stage in evidence he said that the Wife went by herself to see the notary, and then that she went with her mother. However, there is no clear evidence that she obtained or was advised to obtain independent legal advice as to the proposed pre-nuptial settlement and its effect.</p>

Under the terms of the affidavit, if it is in fact the pre-nuptial agreement, the Wife would receive nothing in the event of separation or divorce, regardless of how long the marriage lasted or whether there were any children, whether or not the Husband had any assets at the time of the marriage or subsequently. In SC v TC (ZZ21D12436) HHJ Hess, in summarising the principles relating to &#8220;Agreements&#8221; said that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;parties are unlikely to have intended that their ante-nuptial agreement should result, in the event of the marriage breaking up, in one partner being left in a predicament of real need, while the other enjoys a sufficiency or more, and such a result is likely to render it unfair to hold the parties to their agreement.  Equally, if the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned&#8221;.</span></p>

To the extent the terms prevented the Wife from making any financial claim against the Husband whether in respect of matrimonial property or to meet needs regardless of the length of the marriage or the Husband&#8217;s assets was unfair to the Wife at the time the agreement was entered into and is unfair now. I attach no weight to any agreement in determining computation and division of assets in this case.</p>

The Husband says the marriage broke down in 2013 when the Wife moved into a separate bedroom and she left the home in 2016 and did not return. The photographs relied on by the Wife to support her case are not evidence that the parties continued to live together between 2016 and 2018. None show the parties together. It is accepted that post- separation she has maintained a relationship with the Husband&#8217;s brother SV and his wife and so it would not be unusual for there to be photographs of them in social settings at which the Husband might also have been present, such as the temple. In his divorce petition the Husband says they stopped living together as a couple in August 2018 but also says she left in March 2018. However, this is contradicted by the previous sentence which states that the Wife left the marriage in 2013 and continued to visit the family for another 3 &#8211; 4 years. RV also says that the date of separation was 2015/16 although he also says that she left home later in 2016 for 6 months or so. It is accepted by RV and was also accepted in evidence by the Husband that after she left the Wife returned to cook for their father whom RV said did not judge the Wife. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">There is no evidence to support the Husband&#8217;s case that the Wife was pregnant when she left in 2016. However, on the Wife&#8217;s own case she became pregnant in the last quarter of 2017 with her twins being born in June 2018. The Wife had not suggested anywhere before the hearing that she had in effect been given permission by the Husband to have a child with someone else and I am satisfied that if correct it would have been included in the Wife&#8217;s Form E or <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25</ref> statement. Whilst Mr Giani says in his submission document that the evidence shows that the Wife&#8217;s relationship with RK and her pregnancy was condoned by the Husband&#8217;s father and, as a result had to be accepted by the rest of the family, and that in those circumstances it is implausible that she would have been thrown out of the house and only allowed to return to cook, I do not agree. If that were the case there would have been no necessity for the Wife to leave at all, if the intention was that she could have her children and continue living at the property. The Wife says the Husband and his mother threw her out, but if, as suggested by Mr Giani, the Husband&#8217;s father condoned the relationship and was the absolute patriarch of the family whom &#8220;everyone obeyed without demur&#8221; they would not have dared to take such action.  I consider it implausible that the family would have allowed the Wife to continue living with them whilst pregnant with another man&#8217;s child.</p>

It was provided during the hearing and so there was no opportunity to make enquiry as to the basis on which it was sent to the address. There may have been an explanation such as the Wife not having changed her address or records not being updated and if it was the only letter sent it does not undermine the Husband&#8217;s case because he clearly says in his statement that not much post came after separation. On the Wife&#8217;s case that she did not fall pregnant until late 2017 it is possible that between 2016 and 2017 the Wife did return to the property having left to see and cook for the Husband&#8217;s father.</p>

This is in direct contradiction to the statement she filed with her acknowledgement of service in which she said that the Husband had never worked his entire life and she was always dependent on his father for handouts. In oral evidence the Wife said that the Husband used to collect rent from the various properties but then said that sometimes his father asked him to do this but most of the time tenants came to BR to pay their rent which would sometimes be collected by the father, sometimes by the Husband and sometimes by other family members, including her. She accepted that other people sometimes did the banking and said that funds were deposited into various accounts in the joint names of the Husband and others of which she had no knowledge or details. </p>

I am sure the Husband will not be offended when I say that he is not a sophisticated man and I find it unlikely he fully and effectively co-managed a business with his father in the manner in which the Wife would have me believe or at all. I have no doubt that he did odd jobs for his father including collecting rent and depositing it at the bank but this doesn&#8217;t mean he was a partner in or co-owner of the business and there is no evidence of any other bank accounts in his sole name or in joint names with third parties.</p>

He used to help his Father part-time and received a salary of &#163;200pw. This is supported by his tax returns which show that the Husband was receiving a monthly income of &#163;833 which was paid by way of PAYE and not on a self-employed basis. There was no evidence that the Husband did any substantive work in the business and RV gave evidence that his brother was not involved in managing the properties and his involvement did not extend beyond being on the title deeds and doing some administrative work for his father. </p>

Even if he did, I agree with Mr Davies that Mrs Justice Roberts made clear in MCJ v MAJ [2016] EWHC 1672 that rental income from non-matrimonial property used to fund the parties living expenses does not change the fundamental nature of the capital asset. I am satisfied that the Husband was not a partner or co-owner of the business and as such to the extent he has any interest in the properties they cannot be said to have mingled so as to become matrimonial in nature. Any claim the Wife has in relation to those properties, if they are owned beneficially by the Husband, must be predicated on need.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">BR was purchased in the Husband&#8217;s father&#8217;s sole name in 1977. It was the home of the Husband&#8217;s parents and the Intervenor still lives there. The Husband lives there as he has done his whole life and it was the matrimonial home. On 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2016 it was transferred to the Husband, his parents, and his sister. On the death of his father, the Intervenor inherited his share under his estate. The property has an agreed equity of &#163;625,650 but there is a dispute as to the Husband&#8217;s interest. He says it is 16.6% and the Wife says it is 33.3%. The Husband and the Intervenor says this is because the father&#8217;s intention on transfer was that his 50% beneficial ownership should be divided between himself and his children. There is no documentary evidence to support this but I am satisfied that at the date of transfer the Intervenor would have acquired a beneficial interest in the property by virtue of it being her matrimonial home and so the explanation is a reasonable one. On the father&#8217;s death the Husband&#8217;s interest would not have altered as his father&#8217;s share passed to his mother. I am satisfied the Husband&#8217;s interest in the property is &#163;103,857. I am satisfied that this interest was acquired post-separation of the parties and so is not matrimonial property. However, even if I am wrong as to that, on the Wife&#8217;s own case it was acquired within a period two years prior to separation and so whilst matrimonial the Husband&#8217;s significant contribution in this respect would have to be considered and in my view means that any award based on sharing would not be appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">I directed that the Inheritance Tax forms be disclosed and I considered it might assist in determining the beneficial interest of the properties. The Intervenor was questioned by Mr Giani on behalf of the Wife at some length on the fact that the contents of the various forms appeared misleading and incorrect. In particular, the IHT404 which is a schedule of jointly owned assets only refers to the Husband&#8217;s father having an interest in property at STR and ABR. The Wife says this is clear evidence that the Husband, and not his father, has an interest in the properties in his name. The Intervenor said that no-one else in the family had assisted with the completion of the forms which had been prepared by the accountants and signed by her with a declaration that their contents were true to the best of her knowledge and belief. Initially I was concerned that the forms did not accurately reflect the Husband&#8217;s and Intervenor&#8217;s positions of the parties in relation to the properties but on consideration I am satisfied they do and Mr Foy&#8217;s submission that the fact the properties which are the subject matter of these proceedings did not need to be included in the Form as they were solely owned by him but not in his sole name, correct. The form makes it clear that in cases where assets are in joint names but one person provided all the money then their share of the asset will be the whole and so in effect not jointly owned. In addition, given that the Intervenor was the sole beneficiary of the father&#8217;s estate no inheritance tax would have been payable on his death in relation to the properties and so there appears to be no motive for not declaring the correct position as to ownership to HMRC.</p>

The terms of the order sought in the application are unclear. In the statement in support, the Wife refers to various properties in which she says the Husband has a legal interest not disclosed in his Form E and at Paragraph 6 of the statement she seeks an order restraining the Husband from disposing or refinancing the properties connected to the Husband. At paragraph 7, she sets out the properties she says that the Husband holds or has held a legal and beneficial interest, namely all those which are the subject matter of these proceedings save BR and says that the Husband has transferred these properties to family members or others without any monetary exchange during proceedings. In fact, the Husband has never been on the title deeds of HR which was purchased in the names of the Husband&#8217;s father and sister and never transferred to him and I have already made a finding that he has never had a beneficial interest in this property.</p>

The Husband has non-matrimonial property in the form of his interest in BR which is available to satisfy the Wife&#8217;s needs provided it is reasonable to both parties. Those needs must be generated by the marriage and not subsequent events. There can be no suggestion that the Husband is required to make provision for the needs of the Wife&#8217;s children from another relationship. Their needs should be addressed by an application against RK under the provisions of Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. This court is concerned with addressing the needs of the Wife arising from the breakdown of the marriage. This is a marriage in which neither party owned property or lived in their own rented accommodation but were at all times housed in the property which had been, and still is, the Intervenor&#8217;s matrimonial home. The Wife&#8217;s case was she did not work and I am satisfied the Husband earned a minimal income from working in his father&#8217;s business.  Her needs on separation would have been limited to putting her in a similar position and would not in my view have extended beyond the provision of a small lump sum to provide the deposit for rented accommodation. They would not have extended, either then or now, to the purchase of alternative accommodation to house her or the children.  The only issue for the Court to determine is whether the Wife&#8217;s needs are currently being met and to the extent they are not whether the Husband has the ability to raise a payment to meet needs.</p>
