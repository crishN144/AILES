The Court of Protection Rules 2017 3.6(4) permit the court to deal with an application without a hearing. The overriding objective (COPR 1.1) applies to the decision whether to determine an application without a hearing.  Ms Butler-Cole instructed by Capsticks LLP filed a Position Statement setting out the CCG&#8217;s position. Mr James Beck, an employed lawyer at the OS filed a statement on behalf of the OS.   I am satisfied that I can determine this case justly and in particular ensuring that SP&#8217;s interests and position are properly protected without a hearing. I am mindful that in respect of an application made by agreement there are always more investigations that can be made, questions that can be asked, stones that can be turned. Here, I am satisfied that the court had all the essential information and that further inquiries would not alter the fundamentals and would only lead to further delay in taking action on a decision that most have agreed is in SP&#8217;s best interests for some time now. </p>

The fundamental principle of the sanctity of human life is enshrined in Article 2 of the Convention: everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. Further in the present context, Article 3 (protection from inhuman or degrading treatment) is relevant. In addition it is an aim of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to secure the full enjoyment of human rights by disabled people and to ensure they have full equality under the law.  In cases such as Lambert-v-France (20160 62 EHRR 2) the European Court of Human Rights has confirmed that the withdrawal of life sustaining treatment engages a State&#8217;s positive obligations under Article 2 but that permitting withdrawal and the circumstances under which it was permitted and how the balance was struck between the right to life and the protection of their right to respect for their private life and autonomy were within the margin of appreciation of states. The ECtHR retains a right to review whether in any particular case an individuals Article 2 rights had been infringed or were within the margin of appreciation. </p>
