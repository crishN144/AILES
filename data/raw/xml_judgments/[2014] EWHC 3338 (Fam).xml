	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These proceedings concern a young person, SS, who is Romanian by birth, a Roma by background and culture, and who is currently believed to be 15 years old.   She has, it appears, lived for most of her life in Spain with her mother and siblings, but has now been living in this jurisdiction for over eighteen months.  On the evidence available to me, it appears that she is a victim of child trafficking having been brought here, away from her family, for the purposes of sexual and/or criminal exploitation.</p>

She has given her account to social workers, informally and through ABE interviews, also to her guardian and police; she has further set it out in summary in a statement to the court.  I have of course exercised caution when reviewing her version of events, given that (a) there are reasons why she may choose to give a false account of her history, and in any event (b) English is (after Romanian and Spanish) her third language.  I have particularly looked for internal consistency within her accounts and have searched for independent corroboration from within the documents generated by the official and public bodies which have knowledge of SS and her life.  The following account is, on the evidence currently available, the most reliable &#8216;working account&#8217; of SS&#8217;s life.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SS was born in Romania.  Her birth was registered on 10 May 1999.  Her Birth Certificate records her birth as 5 May 1998 but the manuscript entry of the year &#8216;1998&#8217; gives a strong impression of having been altered.  Other records (including from Romanian and Spanish social services, and the school in Spain which SS briefly attended) disclose her year of birth as 1999.  Given that the registration of birth clearly took place in 1999, I consider it more likely (on the current evidence) that she was in fact born in 1999, making her 15 years old now. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SS is the middle of five children born to her mother (&#8220;MD&#8221;) and father (&#8220;SO&#8221;); she has two older brothers, and two younger sisters.  She also has half-siblings. SS was raised for her early life by her paternal grandmother while her mother and father lived in Spain.  When SS was approximately three or four years old, her father died.  At or about that time, her mother returned to Romania and removed SS and her siblings to Spain; while in Spain the mother entered into a new relationship with a man (&#8220;ME&#8221;) who physically abused SS and some years later attempted to sexually abuse her.  SS lived in Spain for approximately 8-10 years, apart from one or two short return trips to Romania, possibly in 2010, when repatriated by the Spanish authorities &amp;/or shortly before SS left Spain for the last time, in order to renew her passport.  It is reported (by a social worker in Spain who for a time had responsibility for the family) that the family had lived in a squat in the outskirts of Madrid, which was &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">not fit for habitation</span>&#8221; (per SS&#8217;s teacher in Spain) and plainly in very poor circumstances.  For a period of time (possibly three months) the sibling group was received into institutional care in Spain given the significant concerns about their &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">neglectful</span>&#8221; (per Spanish social worker) upbringing by their mother.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In or about December 2012, when SS was approximately 13 years old, her mother &#8216;sold&#8217; her to a young Roma man (&#8220;DW&#8221;), and almost immediately he brought her from Spain, via Paris (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">for a few months</span>&#8221;), to England.  It is not clear from the accounts which I have received precisely when SS arrived here, but I infer from all that I have read that this was in early 2013 (SS says February/March 2013 in her 8 July 2014 interview, which tallies with her more recent witness statement).  SS and DW initially moved in with extended members of DW&#8217;s family. SS maintains that she was repeatedly raped and abused by DW; she further alleges that he forced her to steal for him.  DW is reportedly being investigated by the police in relation to these alleged offences.  SS has described how she then formed a relationship with an 18 or 19 year old young man (&#8220;AX&#8221;) whom she met in London; she left DW and went to live with AX (and his cousin) for a period of time (unspecified).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is some (at present unconfirmed) suggestion that SS was apprehended by the police during 2013: a reference on the Metropolitan Police Merlin database contains details of her &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">aggressively begging</span>&#8221; in Central London in July 2013.  She is said to have received a police caution at one time (although the police have not produced any record of this, it may be that SS gave false identification details at that time &#8211; she admits to having done this when finally apprehended).  She was arrested on 22 November 2013, and charged with being involved in the stealing of mobile telephones.  At that time, she told the Young Offenders Team worker that she did not want to return to the address where she lived, as she was being forced (it is unclear whether this was by DW or AX) to offend every day.  She was initially remanded by the Youth Court to the care of the local authority, but absconded from her foster placement (allegedly stealing the foster mother&#8217;s phone as she left) after only a few days.  She evaded detection for several months, being finally apprehended (for alleged fare evasion) by the Transport Police in April 2014.  Care proceedings were then launched, as were proceedings for a Secure Accommodation Order.  While the jurisdictional issues with which I am concerned remained unresolved, the Family Court exercised its powers (notionally under <span style="font-style:italic">Article 20 </span>of BIIR) to make interim care and secure accommodation orders.  </p>

She said that she wanted to continue working and enjoying her independent life, and wished to return to her life with her boyfriend (AX).  She was clear that she did not wish to return to Spain or to her mother given that her mother had forced her into &#8216;marriage&#8217; with DW.  </p>

Indeed, during the period of the secure accommodation order, appeared to thrive in the structured environment, forged relationships with the staff and residents, and enjoyed the education on offer;  she described herself as &#8216;being in a family&#8217;, and her self-esteem was observed to grow. When the secure accommodation order expired in July 2014, SS was placed with foster carers where she remains. </p>

Since April 2014 she has had a settled, structured life in the care of the local authority; in July 2014 she moved into a foster home where she gives every impression of being &#8216;at home&#8217;.  She appears to have formed a trusting and loving relationship with a foster carer who she refers to as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Mum</span>&#8221; and who she believes loves and cares for her as a mother.  She enjoys the family life of her foster home (there are three younger foster children).  She has tentatively embarked on education here, aspiring to develop her artistic skills; she has a few friends here.  She perceives England as her home, and plainly, indeed emphatically, wishes to remain here, having made this clear to all.  In these circumstances, she has in my judgment acquired the relevant degree of integration into life here in England now as to justify a finding that she is habitually resident here.</p>
