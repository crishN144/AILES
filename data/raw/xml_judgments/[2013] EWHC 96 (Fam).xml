A final hearing was fixed for January 2013.  I acknowledged that this created undesirable delay that particularly affected the younger children, but balanced this against the mother's undoubted strengths.  The adjournment had some support from Dr Asen and Ms Obe, but was opposed by the social worker, Ms Stephens, and by the Guardian, Ms Shepherd.  </span></p>

The parties lodged written submissions following the hearing and did not seek to add to these orally.  I postponed delivery of this judgment to await the outcome of the father&#8217;s renewed application for permission to appeal.  That was dismissed at an oral hearing on 11 February 2013.

She was not in any way responsible for B&#8217;s death and there were no concerns about her parenting, or indeed that of the father, before that time.   She knows and cares deeply for the children.  Her abilities are clearly seen during almost daily contact, where her enormous commitment, practical care and emotional warmth can be clearly seen.  When discussing the children&#8217;s wider needs, she shows unselfish understanding of their different and special qualities, including C&#8217;s autistic spectrum disorder and J&#8217;s developmental delay. </span></p>

He considers that the mother had not emotionally separated from the father, to whom she remains married.  He agrees that the mother&#8217;s friends, whose statements had just been filed, are clearly well-meaning and supportive, but he describes the letter from Dr O (to which I will refer below) as concerning.  He believes from long experience of such cases that there is a high probability that the mother&#8217;s resolve will weaken and that, with the reality of caring for children with considerable needs while seeing her separation from their father as enforced, she will sooner or later let him back in.  Although she has maintained separation up to now, and has much integrity, the situation with the children at home would be very different.</span></p>

Like Dr Asen, she found the mother to be reluctant to engage in this process, and she did not succeed in meeting anyone proposed on the mother&#8217;s behalf, let alone assessing them.  There had been no approach from the mother&#8217;s aunt (Aunt C) or from the father&#8217;s sister (Aunt J), who had fostered the children for several months after B&#8217;s death. </span></p>

Having heard the evidence of the mother and her witnesses, her opinion remains unchanged.  She did not think that the mother&#8217;s position has changed since July, and the supporting witnesses have come forward frustratingly late.  The children will become attuned to a belief system and will &#8216;live&#8217; the outcome.  Ms Shepherd is pessimistic about any further movement on the part of the mother, and says that the children need a decision now.  She did not think that the local authority could put protections in place throughout their childhoods.  </span></p>

She has dissociated herself from Dr O&#8217;s views.  The many positive features of the mother&#8217;s plan, as recorded above, are emphasised.  The risk of physical harm can be mitigated by supervision by the authorities, the community and friends.  Any risk of emotional harm is insufficient to deprive the children of an upbringing in their own family.  There should be a further family group conference to co-ordinate support systems.</span></p>

They have an appreciation of the court&#8217;s findings and of the risks posed by the father, and I am sure they could be relied upon to do their best to support the mother and children.  However, it is striking that even this body of opinion has not enabled the mother to move on in her own thinking.  She did not involve them over the past months in planning the future with social services.  I do not accept that this is because she did not want to trouble them: it is more likely that she did not involve them because their views do not coincide with her own.</span></p>

The nature of the risk in this case is of the utmost gravity and there are no effective measures that could guarantee the children&#8217;s physical safety over time.  Like Dr Asen, Ms Stephens and Ms Shepherd, I find that despite any current good intentions, the mother would not be reliably able to exclude the father from her life or the life of the children over the long period of years that would be necessary for their safety and wellbeing.  She does not have the inner belief to enforce separation, and she would come under increasing pressure from her own thinking, from the father, from the community, and no doubt in time from the children themselves, to let him back into their lives once the intensity of the current professional interest was in the past.  Moreover, even if the father was kept at a distance, I accept the evidence of Dr Asen about the likelihood of emotional harm to the children that would arise from being brought up in an environment in which the prevailing belief was that the father was innocent.  The consequence is that C would learn that he was thought to have harmed B, and yet none of the children could see the father or be given a good reason why they could not.</span></p>

I shall make care orders and, having considered the terms of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref>, make placement orders in relation to M and J.  In M&#8217;s case, adoption is clearly in her interests, and in J&#8217;s case, a time-limited search for adopters is in my view right, while at the same time seeking a long term foster home.  I dispense with the parents&#8217; consent to making placement orders because the children&#8217;s welfare requires it.  If an adoptive placement is not found, the placement order will have to be discharged in a timely fashion &#8211; the application can be made to me.  </span></p>

I approve the amended care plans, which justifiably differentiate between the mother and father&#8217;s contact.  My only observation is that if the placement order in relation to J has to be discharged after six months, the local authority will be obliged to provide reasonable contact to the parents.  Through no fault of the father, there has been real difficulty in his contact with J since last summer; however, I am not sure that the court would grant the local authority permission to refuse all contact under a care order unless all efforts had been made to facilitate it in a way that could be beneficial to J.  If he is to grow up in long term foster care, it may be in his interests to have some contact with his father, particularly if the parents were to reunite.  It may therefore be sensible for efforts to be made to support occasional brief contact between the father and J, even during the search for adopters. </span></p>
