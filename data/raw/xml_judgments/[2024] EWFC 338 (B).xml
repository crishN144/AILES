She is implacably opposed to C having contact with the Father. She has previously refused to comply with court orders in relation to contact (even on the making of an order committing her to prison) and attendance at court (necessitating arrest warrants) and indicated her likely future non-compliance.</p>

They are focused on Mother&#8217;s needs and there is a risk of C&#8217;s needs in their care not being met. There is a significant risk they would not promote contact with the Father if C was in their care.</p>

He is supportive of C having time with the Mother and has shown a willingness to be guided by professionals in respect of his care of C and C having contact with her Mother.</p>

It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, while others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the state to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting.

Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

The Practice Directions point up that orders under s.91(14) are available to prevent a person from making future applications under that Act without leave of the court and that s.91(14) leaves a discretion to the court to determine the circumstances in which an order should be made. The Practice Directions highlight that the circumstances in which such an order may be made are many and varied. Those circumstances include where an application would put the child concerned, or another individual, at risk of harm as provided in s.91A. </span><span class="s1" style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">In exercising the court's discretion, the Practice Directions make clear that the welfare of the child is paramount</span><span class="s1" style="font-family:'Calibri, sans-serif';font-size:11pt">.

Such conduct might also constitute domestic abuse. A future application could also be part of a pattern of coercive or controlling behaviour or other domestic abuse toward the victim, such that a section 91(14) order is also merited due to the risk of harm to the child or other individual.</span></p>

Father shows no insight into what unhealthy relationship behaviour is, nor does he take any responsibility for his actions in his relationship with Mother. Father said he was shocked that his relationship with Mother ended as in his mind they were working well together, yet at the same time recounted how Mother changed the locks on him whilst he was out. His reasoning for the relationship clearly being okay was that Mother didn&#8217;t end the relationship sooner; having no insight at all, even when I reflected back at how factors such as dependency with finances and housing can influence a victim feeling able to leave, he still denied that the relationship was abusive.  </p>

That was amply demonstrated in cross-examination of the Maternal Grandmother when it was put to her that if it was correct that the Mother was discharged from community mental health follow-up because of a lack of engagement (both Mother and Maternal Grandmother dispute this was the reason so it was a hypothetical question) would she still think the Mother posed no risk to the Child and her answer was she would pose no danger.</p>

She said a 12 month order in this case would allow time &#8220;for the dust to settle&#8221; but would also allow for a testing period of the Child in the Father&#8217;s care after the completion of the work required within the first 6 months (Father, Paternal Grandmother and Father&#8217;s wife) and for the Father&#8217;s wife and C&#8217;s paternal half-sibling to come to the UK and C to adapt to that change.

I have significant concerns about how Mother will manage an outcome that means C will not be returned to her care and in addition, her time with C will be restricted.  Mother makes numerous reports and allegations about Father and is unlikely to stop this post final orders being made. I am very concerned about Mother making reports to the police and the impact that this will have on C especially if each time if these have to be investigated by new police officers and or Social Workers. If this were to happen, there is a risk that contact between C and her mother will need to be stopped altogether.  I am also concerned about how Father will manage contact and communication with the maternal family. It is likely to take longer than 6 months to embed the new contact arrangement particularly if the reduction plan takes place over 7 weeks and then contact takes place once every 6 months [in fact this should read &#8220;weeks&#8221;].</p>

Some public law intervention is required in order to assist with transitioning from Local Authority supervised contact with Mother to some other form of supervision. It has not been possible to achieve this within proceedings given the more recent transition into the Father&#8217;s full time care following the Issues Resolution Hearing and the Mother&#8217;s implacable hostility to the Local Authority plan. Once she comes to understand the final order has been made I hope she will engage more positively with the Local Authority to reach an agreement on arrangements for her to spend time with C.</p>

In other words the contact should be supervised (direct and in default indirect) but if a supervisor could not be agreed there should be no contact. That is a very real risk given that when the Mother gave evidence she said she did not &#8220;want anyone he is friends with or a paternal family member&#8221; to supervise contact and would not in any circumstance agree to mediate to improve communication saying &#8220;He is disturbing my daughter and contact will not be the truth&#8221;.</p>

I do not find it is possible at this stage to identify what a progression of contact might look like, but the terms of any order would allow for such other contact as was agreed and the Local Authority under the Supervision Order would be in a position to advise the parents on this.</p>

It would be enormously destabilising for C to be living with the Father yet seeing the Mother every day, even if that was workable around school attendance. In any event, for all the reasons I have determined that C should live with the Father I consider it would not be in C&#8217;s welfare interest to have anything close to that level of time with the Mother. The Mother has not yet begun to address the very serious concerns that are set out above in relation to her capacity to care for C. Whilst she undoubtedly loves C very much (a point emphasised on her behalf by counsel and which I accept) loving C is not enough, she needs to demonstrate an ability to think what is in C&#8217;s welfare interest.</p>

I do not consider it is in C&#8217;s welfare interest to make that as a defined contact order. It gives no flexibility in circumstances where the Mother&#8217;s response to this judgment has, of course, not been assessed. It may be that it provokes a response that it would be adverse to C to witness and contact arrangements have to be adjusted downwards. I hope that is not the case as C needs to have a relationship with her Mother but if it were necessary to reduce contact and there was an order for defined contact in place a further application to court would be necessary which is not in C&#8217;s welfare interest.</p>

The reason for the Guardian recommending the latter was to ensure that even in the event of a breakdown in the contact between C and the Mother there would remain a link to the maternal family and C&#8217;s east European heritage, quite apart from it being in C&#8217;s welfare interest to have contact with her sister.

I extend this further to C in light of Mother&#8217;s lack of acceptance of the paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis and the inability to accept any ability on the part of the Father to care for C; I note that the social worker describes Mother&#8217;s behaviour on 23 September 2023 (irrespective of a finding of breach) as having &#8220;impacted&#8221; C [C147]. These things together present a very real risk that the Mother will seek to act to remedy the injustice, as she will see it, of me making an order for C to remain in Father&#8217;s care and that will have a negative welfare impact on C.</p>

I consider they do not go beyond that which is necessary and proportionate to protect C. As to duration, since they reflect the fact of a live with order in favour of the Father and are to support that arrangement there is no reason why they should not run concurrently with that order. The Father needs to be in a position to apply for travel documents for C&#8217;s minority and the Mother must not remove C from his care. There is provision for an agreement on the Mother obtaining travel documents, in the event permission is unreasonably withheld the remedy is an application to court.</p>

It was put to her that at the end of a Supervision Order if there was a section 91(14) order and no agreement for supervision of contact the Mother would have to apply for permission to bring an application for an order. That is right but of course it would depend on the terms of any Child Arrangement spend time with order, if as above then there would be no contact without an application for permission from the Mother.</p>

When I asked her if that tended to suggest there should be a direction for any application to initially be considered without notice she agreed.</p>

She accepted that Mother had not made any applications but was concerned that &#8220;there are lots of things Mother is worried about&#8221; and &#8220;how she might manage those in the future when we&#8217;re not in care proceedings&#8221;.</p>

There needs to be a period of stability for her. In the circumstances it is manifestly in C&#8217;s welfare interest that there should be an avoidance of proceedings if at all possible for a period. I have considered how long that should last; it needs to be beyond the period of the Supervision Order and for a significant period to allow arrangements to settle. I have considered if 2 years, rather than the 3 years sought, would meet C&#8217;s welfare needs but given the length of these proceedings I am persuaded a 3 year period is proportionate. I hope it will serve as some impetus to the Mother to engage with the Local Authority&#8217;s suggestions in relation to contact between her and C during the period of the Supervision Order so that a workable solution is found before their involvement ends.</p>
