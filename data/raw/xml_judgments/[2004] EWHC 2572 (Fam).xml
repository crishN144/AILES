	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">This is an application by Emma R (to whom I shall refer as the Mother) for a residence order and permission to take the two children of the family to live with her in Paris on a permanent basis. The children are A (who was born on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2001 &#8211; 3&#188;  years old) and C (who was born on the 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2002 &#8211; 2 years old). Mr Edward R (to whom I shall refer as the Father) objects to the children being removed from the jurisdiction, moreover he says that there should be no order in relation to residence but, if there is, then it should be a joint residence order. Whatever order I make in relation to the children&#8217;s future place of residence, each party requires some elements of contact to be defined.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Over some 5 days in Court I have been able to watch the parties closely and I have heard a great deal of detailed evidence from both Mother/Father and a number of witnesses on behalf of each. This case has been conducted fairly, but with a great deal of passion by both sides. To my mind, it was noticeable that the children&#8217;s specific needs were often relegated from being the central issue as most of the evidence was directed to the Mother&#8217;s wishes and requirements - on the simple premise that a contented and fulfilled mother makes for a happy child. I remind myself at the outset of this judgment that it is the children&#8217;s needs that are my paramount consideration.    </p>

I wish to note expressly that I consider that I have been in an unrivalled position to watch the demeanour of these parties and that this has revealed a great deal more than the statements so, whereas on paper, this case may have appeared finely balanced, in the final analysis having seen and heard the parties, my decision is clear and firm.</p>

As a result of his own father&#8217;s endeavours, his parents are wealthy. They have homes in Manresa Road, Chelsea and at Caigers Farm, Hampshire. They also have a home in Klosters (albeit that that property was placed in the names of their 3 children). The Father has two younger sisters &#8211; namely, Lorna (who was married some two weeks ago) and Selina. The Father was educated at Eton College and took a degree from the University of East Anglia. From 1990 to 1995, he worked in Hong Kong where, it seems, he lived a somewhat louche lifestyle which involved the use of call girls and the occasional use of recreational drugs.</p>

He is fortunate because his father set up a trust, now worth some &#163;2.4 million, for his benefit.

I know from the experience of recent weeks that it is a handful looking after the children. So please instead of letting this burden get to you please share it.

It does mean that the Husband was not introduced to these family members &#8211; indeed, he has never met Aunt Marie Christine (one of the Mother&#8217;s witnesses). He says that he barely knows any of them (although he would like to) because the Mother did not have a great deal to do with them during the marriage.

The Mother does not accept his version of events but I consider that the Father is being accurate when he asserts that they had terrible rows and the marriage had real problems from this early stage. He certainly felt under pressure as a result of the atmosphere at home</p>

Not surprisingly, she was devastated. It is hard to imagine a more horrific piece of news for a new mother &#8211; who would have feared not only for her own well-being but that of her child. The Father&#8217;s explanation was that he had found the pressure at home so overbearing that he had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to find some release&#8221;</span>. His behaviour was unacceptable and uncaring. Given his wife&#8217;s emotional sensibilities it was unforgivable. The Mother already had low self-esteem and this apparent rejection undermined her further. From that date onwards, she did not feel that she could trust her husband. She was always worried where he was and what he was doing. She became obsessed with knowing his whereabouts and did not like him socialising - especially with male friends. From her perspective (and given her personality) her position is understandable. But her concern about his whereabouts and attempts to control his movements made the Father feel confined, controlled and isolated. He was determined to meet friends and did not understand her fears.</p>

The Father says that he used to go to the pub for a drink after work <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;to steady himself&#8221;</span> before going home. No doubt, this only made matters worse. He described home life as increasingly unbearable with violent rows. Each party has accused the other of punching them.

She is obviously emotional (with tears that came easily) but I also observed a wilful and determined streak when matters were put to her with which she did not agree. She is feisty and strong-minded. I have no doubt that during the marriage, when crossed, she was petulant and difficult. This behaviour was overlaid with great emotional vulnerability. The Father could not deal with the combination of difficult, aggressive, even antagonistic behaviour coupled with underlying neediness. The Father lacked insight and, increasingly, lacked understanding. </p>

In January 2002, on the day that the Mother learned that she was pregnant with C, she went to celebration for Mr R senior&#8217;s 60<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> birthday at Manresa Road. A video was prepared by an uncle (it was a collage of previous films) and included the Father commenting on a previous girlfriend. The Mother became overwrought and had to leave. At home, there was a huge row. The Father left the home for some 2 weeks. He stayed at his parents&#8217; home in Manresa Road. One evening the Mother was looking at past bank statements and saw that the Father had withdrawn a large amount of cash late at night &#8211; which she assumed was for use with prostitutes. The statements were contained in a box which normally contained her passport and that of A. She noticed they were missing. By now, it was 11pm. She was in the house alone, save for A (then aged some 6 months old) who was asleep. The Mother decided to go to Manresa Road  &#8211; there and then - to recover the passports. She left A alone in the flat. When she arrived at Manresa Road, she banged on the door. The Father refused to answer. The Mother then shouted, threw a brick (she says &#8220;pebbles&#8221;) breaking a window. She hammered on the front door with her stiletto. The force used was sufficient, as I find, to leave permanent dents in the door. When this did not work, she went to her home because she knew there was a spare key to the other house. She then returned to Manresa Road &#8211; leaving A alone for a second time. She opened the door and confronted the Father (who was locked in his parents&#8217; bedroom). An argument ensued and the neighbours were disturbed by the commotion. The parties shouted through a closed door. Eventually, the Father gave the Mother her passport but tore A&#8217;s into many pieces. He told me that he had taken the documents because he was afraid that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">she would leave the country with A&#8221;</span>. I consider that this is a significant remark because, I suspect that, even at this early stage &#8211; during the course of arguments - the Mother was indicating that she would leave the UK if the marriage did not survive. </p>

To leave a vulnerable baby twice in these circumstances was foolhardy in the extreme. She had no immediate need of the passports that night. I suspect that she felt that she had to acquire them at once because she felt trapped or controlled by the Father. Even when questioned in the witness box, she did not perceive that this incident was dangerous or extreme.</p>

By this time the parties&#8217; physical relationship had come to an end and they continued to have a number of rows. The marriage was very unhappy but neither confided in their respective family members. Their parents knew nothing of the problems. Moreover, I note that the Mother did not tell any of her French relations of the difficulties.</p>

Her reasons were set out in paragraph 12 and include the following <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;I wish to make a fresh start by moving to Los Angeles with my children. The children&#8217;s father is aware of my wish and has in the past agreed to our living apart, myself in LA and he in London and to his having unfettered contact with the children. I have lived and worked there in the past and so Los Angeles is familiar to me. I recently visited LA with my daughters to introduce them (in particular the eldest) to the area. I hope to attend acting school in LA with a view to securing acting work as a source of income. I have had small parts in films and acted in commercials previously whilst in Los Angeles.&#8221;</span></p>

It is the Mother&#8217;s case that she decided that, in the final analysis, Los Angeles was too far to enable contact to be frequent or &#8220;unfettered&#8221;. Therefore, she decided that Paris was the more appropriate place.  Her reasons for choosing Paris are outlined in detail at the commencement of my Judgment but they are primarily based upon her need to live outside England in (and this has been emphasised) a supportive environment. However, I note that she did not consider a support structure was necessary when she made her initial application to go to Los Angeles. She obviously thought that she could cope alone some 6,000 miles away from London. </p>

The Father sees the children Thursday after school when they stay with him overnight at Manresa Road. He takes A to nursery next day. (Presently he is renting accommodation in Battersea which he does not consider is a suitable base for contact). On alternate weekends, he collects the children on Friday afternoon and takes them down to Caigers Farm until Sunday evening when he returns them to London. </p>

Miss Parker Q.C. asserted that his requests for additional contact have, on occasion, been tactical in order to assist his case within the context of these proceedings. It is inevitable with lawyers advising, there will be tactics afoot but I am clear that this father is committed to these girls and that he enjoys the contact &#8211; as they do &#8211; for its own sake.

The Mother says that she has hidden her unhappiness from the children, but they have never seen her as she truly is because she cannot be happy whilst she is confined to London, a city in which she does not feel at home.

When I first read the papers it seemed clear that places were available at the Bilingual Montessori School from January 2005. In fact, on about the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2004 (in the run up to this Hearing) the Father contacted the school to confirm that the places were still on offer. He was told that no places had been secured for the children and the school was full. This information was not communicated immediately for, although the Father had informed his solicitor, they waited for Counsel to authorise the disclosure. To my mind, this delay was both unnecessary and unsatisfactory. In cases relating to children, disclosure of this type must be made immediately. It had an obvious impact on the case. The Mother felt that she had been ambushed and that the delay was tactical. Disclosure in children cases must not be used to unsettle the other party for some perceived forensic gain. I suspect that in this case, the delay arose from muddle or overwork but that is no excuse.</p>

Suffice it to say, no place is available. It seems that the Mother was in contact with the school in March 2004. At that date, she informed her solicitor that she had registered the children for the September term (as it was expected that the Hearing would be completed in time for that date). She had been asked to pay a &#8364;1000 deposit for each child.  When it was clear that the start date would be January 2005, the Mother telephoned the school and gave this information to the Headmistress. She also informed the school, that she only had a sterling account and therefore could not send a cheque in Euros. She understood the Headmistress to say that, in those circumstances, she would not insist on a cheque. The end result is that there is no place. </p>

I have little doubt that some other nursery school could be found.  However, I am concerned about the apparently causal manner in which the Mother set about securing the place. To conduct these important conversations over the telephone with no confirmatory note is not sensible. Not to make any enquiries herself, to confirm the precise position, is also worrying. The suggestion that a Euro cheque cannot be sent because of the circumstances outlined shows a lack of practical initiative. It is quite easy to make the necessary transfer with the assistance of any High Street bank. </p>

It is proposed that if there are difficulties in France then Marie-Christine will contact the Father, but she does not know him at all.

Perhaps this explains why she has been so unsettled at times.

From my perspective, it was very important and enlightening because it showed that the Mother valued the support that she thought Mrs Bloomfield could provide. Far from the self-serving statements of the support she would obtain from French aunts and cousins, this was tangible proof that if she really needed help Mrs Bloomfield could and would provide it.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">I am in no doubt that the Mother needs help to resolve her emotional problems. For the last 12 years, her life has not been rooted in firm foundations. For whatever reason, she has led a rather unsettled and peripatetic existence. She has spoken of times in her life when she has felt <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;trapped&#8221;</span> or &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">controlled&#8221;.</span> Her remedy has been to fly. For her own well being, she cannot allow this to continue. More importantly, for the sake of her children, she cannot allow this to continue. As they grow up, they will inevitably present problems and there will various problems which need to be resolved. This will not be possible unless the Mother has the coping mechanisms and strategies which mean that she can offer stability, security and understanding to them. At the moment, I do not believe that she has that inner stability or emotional strength. By that, I do not mean that she cannot care for the children now. But the psychiatric evidence is to the effect that she has to learn how to deal with her own emotional turmoil so that she acts wisely and rationally when times are testing.  </p>

He would assist in any way her could. On the 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2004 or thereabouts, the Mother was anxious to obtain a letter from Mr Bloomfield indicating his support for the move. She asked him to write that letter at 9p.m. when her parents came to the flat. He refused because he was tired and wanted time to compose the letter. The Mother over-reacted to his sensible proposal and lost her temper. She shouted at her father and the commotion was so loud that her neighbours (namely Mr and Mrs Hutton) who live on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> floor of Redburn Street heard the row. For a time, there was a suggestion that the Father&#8217;s team would seek a subpoena to compel Mrs Hutton&#8217;s attendance. Fortunately, this was not necessary. The incident provides another vignette on the Mother&#8217;s inability to exercise proper control when she feels thwarted. I suspect that everyone was very upset by that outburst. In my view it would be unfortunate, if the Mother were to react that way, if (and as is likely when) the children disobey her will.</p>

I have been supplied with a schedule setting out allegation and counter allegation. From this it seems tolerably clear that, on separation, the Father was paying the Mother some &#163;1,300 per month plus the running costs of Redburn Street plus the cost of the nanny. That sum was patently insufficient. In addition, he did pay &#163;7,500 of the Mother&#8217;s legal fees to Payne Hicks Beach (her original solicitors) in July 2004 and some of her current solicitor&#8217;s accounts. A number of congestion charge bills (and related fines) were also paid by him but, it is asserted, then deducted from her maintenance. Eventually by May 2004, the maintenance had increased to &#163;3,500 per month. The Father did not disclose his annual bonus and a small pay rise (total some &#163;35,000) as early as he should have done. This is to be deprecated.  Complaint has also been made that he agreed to pay some &#163;40,000 towards the Mother&#8217;s costs but deducted some &#163;15,000 of that sum to pay Myrna&#8217;s tax and national insurance. I have not been directly concerned with financial matters but I have made it clear that I do not consider that finances should prove an obstacle to the Mother and children&#8217;s needs in this case. I so state because, apart from his own assets of about &#163;400,000 (basically his share in the Klosters flat), the Father has a trust fund worth some &#163;2.4 million (inclusive of the value of the former matrimonial home). </p>

Once that position has arisen and the custody is working well, this court should not lightly interfere with such reasonable way of life as is selected by that parent to whom custody has been rightly given. Any such interference may, as my Lord has pointed out, produce considerable strains which would not only be unfair to the parent whose way of life is interfered with but also to any new marriage of that parent. In that way it might well in due course reflect on the welfare of the child. The way in which the parent who properly has custody of a child may choose in a reasonable manner to order his or her way of life is one of those things which the parent who has not been given custody may well have to bear, even though one has every sympathy with the latter on some of the results.&#8217;</span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">&#8216;It is always difficult in these cases when marriages break up where a wife who, as this one is, is very isolated in this country feels the need to return to her own family and her own country; and, although Mr Swift has argued persuasively for the test which was suggested in the case of Poel v Poel <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1970] 1 WLR 1469" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1970">[1970] 1 WLR 1469</ref>, the test which is often put on the basis of whether it is reasonable for the mother to return to her own country with the child, I myself doubt whether it provides a satisfactory answer to this question. The fundamental question is what is in the best interest of the child; and once it has been decided with so young a child as this that there really is no option so far as care and control are concerned, then one has to look realistically at the mother&#8217;s position and ask oneself the question: where is she going to have the best chance of bringing up this child reasonably well? To that question the only possible answer in this case is Hong Kong. It is true that it means cutting the child off to a large extent &#8211; almost wholly perhaps &#8211; from the father; but that is one of the risks which have to be run in cases of this kind. If it is wholly unreasonable, as I think it is in this case, to require the mother to remain in England, assuming even the court ought to put her in the position of choosing between staying very unhappily and uncomfortably in England and going home to her own country, then I still think the answer is that where she can best bring up this child is the proper solution to this case.&#8217;</span></p>

But Miss Parker Q.C. asserts that case is akin to A v A because this Mother feels French and the family to which she feels close are in Paris. I do not consider that this submission is either fair or compelling. It is easy to make assertions and, for the reasons set out in my findings of fact, I do not consider that the evidence (apart from the self serving statements of the Mother) supports any such contention. The Mother has lived abroad but primarily in the USA not in France. She has seen her French relations for holidays and the like but, save for 1998/9, there is no evidence that she has relied upon those family members to offer advice or succour in times of deep crisis. Her mechanism when confronted with problems has, in accordance with the evidence of Dr Brener (which I accept), been flight. She was born in England, lived here as a child and her parents remain here. Her need to go to Paris is based upon her own perception that she is trapped in London and that a fresh start in that city (in which, I note, she has never lived on her own) will cause all her problems to evaporate.</p>

Once the children move to France (a) enforcement of the English order will pass to the French court; (b) any fresh proceedings will be in France, the country of the children&#8217;s habitual residence per the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1986</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.2</ref> &amp; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.3</ref>. I also consider that Brussels II will make this inevitable.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I consider that she needs to undertake the psychotherapy recommended by Dr Brener and in London. It is his professional opinion that this will take at least 12 &#8211; 18 months. I do not consider that it should take place in Paris, as I am not convinced that the Mother truly accepts that she needs help. Having seen her demeanour in Court, heard her evidence and assessing the history of this case, I consider that her motivation will not be great once she has attained her perceived goal.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">If the children move to France, then their contact with their Father will be affected adversely because (i) they will lose mid-week contact; (ii) they will be very tired on &#8220;English&#8221; weekends - although Eurostar and/or a flight to Southampton are possible, such journeys will be very lengthy for children of their ages and (iii) they will not see their father in his natural home environment on French weekends. It is also likely that the children will see much less of both sets of grandparents. Currently they see their maternal grandparents once a week and their paternal grandparents about once a fortnight. Even if Mrs Bloomfield were to go to Paris, the children would not see their paternal grandparents or their maternal grandfather as often.   </p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Mother&#8217;s current plans have not been sufficiently or carefully considered because the Mother has simply assumed that life will improve once she arrives in Paris. I do not agree. The nursery school is a practical example of her failure to make basic arrangements. She has simply assumed that matters can or will be organised.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I am of the view that,  on the balance of probabilities, if she were to move to Paris and given the history of this case she would soon become disillusioned. If she had an emotional crisis, then she would wish to move again to such place as she then thought would provide for her needs.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The relationship with her French family has not been tested under crisis. A telephone call, once a week for an hour with her aunt, Marie-Christine, is not sufficient to convince me that this lady has sufficient reserves and understanding to deal with the Mother&#8217;s needs. Furthermore, I consider that the same applies to Fabienne. I am not convinced that her French family is as close to the Mother as she asserts. I note that she has only visited them on 3 to 4 occasions since the separation in July 2003. Their support was not a feature of any moment when she thought that Los Angeles was to be her new home. </p>

This indicates to me that the Mother did not consider their French roots a vital part of their identity whilst the marriage was in being. She has started to speak to them now in French and this should continue so that they do become bilingual. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">If Dr Brener is correct the Mother will find this decision difficult to accept. I hope that she will appreciate that it is not motivated by any wish to &#8220;punish&#8221; her &#8211; as Miss Parker Q.C. submitted the Mother would see it. My decision is based on the needs of the children as I perceive them. I am sure that, if therapy is successful, then she will emerge as a stronger and better person. More importantly, she will be a stronger and better mother. I am sure that she will find that she is able to enjoy her life far more, when she is not sapped by the emotional problems that currently beset her. I am sure that flight is not the answer to her current problems because, in reality, the grass is never greener on the other side.</p>
