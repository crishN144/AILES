This is the hearing of a judgment summons brought by the wife in which she seeks the husband&#8217;s committal to prison for failing to pay sums due under the provisions an Order I made on 16&#160;November&#160;2011.  Those provisions are for the payment of periodical payments to the wife for her own benefit and for the benefit of the children of the parties, so accordingly maintenance orders.</p>

The husband is not present and applies through Miss&#160;Dines for an adjournment of the hearing.  The application for an adjournment is made on the basis that he is, to quote the husband&#8217;s words, &#8220;simply not sufficiently well to come&#8221;.</p>

I propose just to mention one or two aspects starting with my judgment of 4&#160;October&#160;2011.  That judgment followed a heavily contested hearing at which both the husband and the wife had been represented by leading counsel as were a number of companies.  The proceedings culminated in the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgment of 12 June 2013.</p>

The husband&#8217;s conduct, in Lord Sumption&#8217;s judgment (para 4), was said to have been &#8220;characterised by persistent obstruction, obfuscation and deceit and a contumelious refusal to comply with rules of court and specific order&#8221;.  He also refers to my having recited in my judgment &#8220;the long history of successive orders of the court which were either ignored or evaded&#8221;.  Later in his judgment (at para&#160;43) Lord Sumption refers to the defective character of the material as being, &#8220;almost entirely due to the husband&#8217;s persistent obstruction and mendacity&#8221;.</p>

The judgment summons was issued on 12&#160;April&#160;2013.  It was first listed for hearing on 5&#160;June&#160;2013.  The husband did not attend that hearing.  He communicated with the court by, if I recall correctly, email and requested that the application be adjourned.  In a statement dated 4&#160;June&#160;2013 the husband said that he had to be in Nigeria, as a result of an emergency, and that he might have malaria, as a result of which he might not be able to return to London for the hearing on 5&#160;June.</p>

It was not addressed because the hearing was taken up dealing with the husband&#8217;s applications to vary the lump sum and maintenance orders of 16 November 2011.  I dismissed the husband&#8217;s applications and dealt with a number of other matters but not the judgment summons.</p>

I have subsequently arranged for him to see several specialists who have concurred with the diagnosis and have advised a course of treatment which will be of 6 to 12 months&#8217; duration.  He has been advised to dramatically reduce his commitments for the foreseeable future and to remove himself from any situations that may cause him emotional or mental stress and focus on getting himself back to good health.&#8221;</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.42in">The medical evidence does not satisfy me that the husband is not able to attend today.  It is, as Mr&#160;Posnansky submits, extremely vague.  It does not indicate what the nature is of his current clinical state.  It does not indicate the diagnosis as given or identified either by the general practitioner or other specialists and it does not state in terms, in my view by implication even, that the husband is not able to attend court today.</p>

This states:</p>

There is again no detail as to the nature and extent of Mr Prest&#8217;s health problems.  It does not state what his medical and other problems are save to the say that they are stress related.  I do not propose to accede to the application.  In my view the evidence does not justify my adjourning this hearing.</p>
