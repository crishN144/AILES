Y and Z have been placed with foster carers since January pursuant to interim care orders. X remained living with his grandmother but more recently moved to stay with his father.

The mother, B, who still lives in the Czech Republic, is aware of the proceedings but has not attended or participated in the proceedings, and has not been represented.  The father of Y and Z, C had not been located until very recently when an address was given for him via the Central Authority. Although the Local Authority has written there has been no response and I am satisfied there is no other way of communicating with him.   The whereabouts of X&#8217;s father, D, has recently become known and the Local Authority has been in contact with him.</span></p>

She has been kept updated about these proceedings but has refused all assistance offered to attend court and access legal advice. More recently she has been more co-operative with the Local Authority. The court and the Local Authority (as recorded in previous orders and statements) have gone to enormous lengths to try and engage A within these proceedings. I am entirely satisfied that she has been kept fully aware of the proceedings and is aware of the orders that are being sought today.</span></p>

That consistency, together with their expertise, has enabled them to build up and maintain effective working relationships with all the relevant parties, not only the children but also A even though relations have, at times, been very difficult.  </span></p>

Pursuant to orders made within those proceedings the children have been in the care of A since they were very young.  In October/November 2009 the children came over to this country with A and her husband.  Concerns in relation to the care being given to the children soon came to the attention of the relevant authorities.  All of the children had very poor school attendance.  They were late; were regularly truanting; and were displaying behaviours which hampered their educational progress.  The children came to the attention of Social Services in early 2013.  The particular concerns were that Y and Z appeared to be involved in behaviour that was exposing them to the risk of sexual harm.  They would frequently go missing, often travelling to a local town, associating with older men, drinking alcohol, and were suspected of using illicit drugs.  They were not being promptly reported as missing, and there were concerns about A&#8217;s engagement with the local authority and with the school authorities.  In addition, X had become involved in criminal behaviour; in September 2013 he received a six-month referral order for a burglary. </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Prior to the hearing on 11 March the court had the benefit of some extra information.   Firstly, and importantly, information from the Czech Republic through the Central Authority in an email, providing certain documentary evidence about the historical proceedings in the Czech Republic and setting out and summarising the position in relation to the children&#8217;s mother. She remains in the Czech Republic; she has the care of her youngest child but does not have the care of her older child, J, who appears to be in some form of State care &#8211; possibly placed with foster carers.  They set out in general terms what the arrangements would be if the children were returned to the Czech Republic and the support that would be provided, including the involvement of the local courts and the local authority to be able to support the care of the children.  They rightly say the decision whether to transfer these proceedings and make that request to the Czech Republic is a matter for this court.  In addition, there is an email that sets out which court would be the competent court in the Czech Republic pursuant to Article 15.  It is the District Court which is in fact the court that has dealt with the previous proceedings concerning this family, and is also the area where A plans to return back to.  </span></p>

The response from JUDr. Marie Hlavata was dated 22 May, so less than a week after the request had been made. I am extremely grateful to her for it being considered so promptly.

I am entirely satisfied the threshold criteria have been satisfied in that the children were beyond the control of A.  All of these children at the time the proceedings were instigated were at risk of significant harm.  X had been in trouble with the police.  He was not living at home and was not attending school.  Y and Z were at risk of sexual exploitation in particular and their school attendance was negligible.

This is because [A] is clearly wanting to return to the Czech Republic, and they wish to be with her.  Further, it is now evident that they are again placing themselves in situations of risk despite being in the care of the Local Authority and I would not consider that a plan of them remaining in the care of the Local Authority foster carer&#8217;s would offer them a great level of protection than is currently the case, meaning they would continue to be the subject of the risks identified.  I am of the view that the most appropriate plan is for them to return to the Czech Republic with [A] in order that they can be appropriately supported by Children&#8217;s Services.  This option will give [A] the best chance of providing them with an appropriate level of care, something which I do not believe she is going to be able to do effectively if she remains in this country for the reasons that I have already given.&#8221;</span></p>
