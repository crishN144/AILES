The Court is concerned with the welfare of the child A, born 19 February 2023, currently aged 14 months.  The local authority has issued proceedings on 8 December 2023- the local authority, B, represented by Mr Roberts.  The mother in this case, C, was represented by Ms&#160;Mallon during the hearing, Mr Khan, the judgment.  The father is D, represented by Ms&#160;Spadafora.

There have been hearings previously when the issue of jurisdiction has been considered but no decision made, 13 February 2024 and 8&#160;March&#160;2024.  The main reason for that is that it was known that there were previous proceedings which took place in Hungary. Information about them was sought. On 8 March, all parties were asked to serve skeleton arguments on the questions of jurisdiction, and also, should the Court be satisfied that it has jurisdiction on the basis of habitual residence, then to consider whether there should be a request for transfer pursuant to Article 8 of the Hague Convention 1996.  I am very grateful to the advocates for their extremely helpful skeleton arguments which have been supplemented by equally helpful oral submissions.  </span></p>

She also has reported that she is the victim of sexual abuse and reported domestic violence and harassment by the father.  The Court has expressed concern around the mother&#8217;s capacity previously, and an assessment by F was directed to include a capacity and cognitive functioning report, and that report is now available.  The mother is assessed as having litigation capacity but a low-average range of cognitive functioning.  </span></p>

In October 2023, the child was taken to [redacted] by ambulance, the mother reporting that he had fallen out of his travel cot and sustained a bruise to the head.  The mother reported that she was a victim of domestic abuse by the father, and she and A moved to a refuge.  On 11&#160;October 2023, the mother took A to meet the father at a hotel he was staying at in [redacted].  The mother claimed that the father had threatened to take back the baby back to Hungary if she did not attend to meet him.  A strategy meeting was convened on 19 October 2023, with a decision to present A to the initial child protection conference.  On 2 December 2023, the mother admitted to refuge staff that she had slapped A as A pulled her hair and scratched her.  She also said that the baby is angry with her because she had to leave him with foster care.  On 6 December 2023, information was received from Hungary that the family were known in Hungary and the mother was deemed unsafe to care for A, and there has been a significant amount of email correspondence with E.  On 7 December 2023, the mother stated to refuge staff that she felt as though she as having a good day and she did not feel like hurting A.  The local authority instigated care proceedings on 8 December.  </span></p>

I agree that this is theoretically right because the child's habitual residence might have changed. However, while the court clearly needs to be satisfied that it retains jurisdiction at the date of the final hearing, I do not consider that this issue needs to be reviewed at every hearing.  In this respect, as submitted by Mr Pugh, there would need to be substantial grounds to justify the court reconsidering the issue which, typically, would have to be raised by one of the parties.  Further, as referred to above, the court will clearly know the child has moved to live in another country, for which the court's permission or approval would likely have been required&#8221;.</span></p>

It is this factor- the fact that the Hungarian authorities had terminated their involvement, which tips the balance by a very small margin in favour of the Court finding habitual residences in the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  I say that despite the very short time that the child had been living in this country before the local authority commenced care proceedings, and in addition to the fact that the father appears to have moved back to Hungary in October 2023.  There is very little evidence to reflect a degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment in England, although I recognise that the child appears to have been left with the mother in October 2023, and I accept that it was her intention to remain in this jurisdiction.  It is likely that she moved here to escape the involvement of the authorities in Hungary and speaks of her fear of returning her because she had been locked up in a psychiatric institution.  However, the father did not attempt to return the child to Hungary, even when he left.  Therefore, I conclude by a very fine balance for the purposes of Article 5 the jurisdiction is founded in England based in the child&#8217;s habitual residence.  However, there is an overwhelming case for this Court to request the Hungarian authorities to assume jurisdiction to take measures of protection as it considers to be necessary, on the basis that the Hungarian authorities are better placed to assess the best interest of the child.  </span></p>

When he was two weeks of age he was placed in temporary care by the guardianship authority due to issues in relation to the mother&#8217;s neglectful care in pregnancy and her untreated paranoid schizophrenia, conflict within the relationship with the parents, and poor living conditions.  The temporary care status was terminated in April 2023 based on apparent improvement.  However, on 1 June 2023, a protective care order was recommended to safeguard the child.  The mother had been admitted to a closed psychiatric ward.  The parents were then living separately.  A was formerly placed into protective care on 5 June 2023.</span></p>

If this Court retains jurisdiction, the assessment processes will have to start all over again and are likely to take many months.  Bearing in mind the need to carry out assessments in Hungary and the language barriers, these proceedings will extend way beyond the 26-week timetable set out in section 32 of the Children Act 1999.  It is in the parents&#8217; best interests, particularly regarding the right to a fair trial pursuant to Article 6 of the European&#160;Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 and, therefore, also in the child&#8217;s best interest that the proceedings take place in a tongue that is the parents first tongue.

The question is whether the transfer is in the child&#8217;s best interests. This is a different question from what eventual outcome to the case will be in the child&#8217;s best interests.

The proceedings can be conducted in the mother tongue of the parents and in the country where the child was born.  The father now lives there.  The extended family members are there.  The whole process of reassessment by the English courts would begin from square one and, if the Hungarian authorities accept jurisdiction, that would be avoided, and the Hungarian authorities can essentially pick up from where they left off.  The proceedings can also fully reflect the child&#8217;s Hungarian heritage.  Overall, I consider it to be in the best interest of this child that the request for transfer is made forthwith through ICACU.  That concludes this judgment.  </span></p>
