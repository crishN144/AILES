	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother has a learning disability and the Father has learning difficulties. This has significant implications for their care of the children, and for the evidence that they gave. H has four older siblings, D a male aged 25, E a male aged 20, F a male aged 17 and G a girl aged 14. For the purposes of the case before me, E and G are largely out of the picture. By the time H was born D, E and G were all in placements away from the family home, and care orders had been made in respect of E and G.  F was made the subject of a care order on 11 February 2021 but has lived away from home since 7 November 2023 when allegations were made to the police about an incident between him and H. Those allegations were the subject of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re H (Continued risk of harm)</span> [2024] EWHC 344 (Fam).</p>

This order <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">was made with the agreement of all the parties,</span> and there was no substantive hearing of any of the issues that had been considered by HHJ Lopez. A Safety Plan was drawn up, by which the parents agreed that one of them would be present when F and H were together, and that F&#8217;s interactions with H would be carefully monitored. A list of rules identified other adults deemed to pose a risk of harm to H, and placed limitations on their contact with H. These included D, E, and maternal uncles ND and SD.</p>

She also relayed a conversation she claimed to have had with the maternal grandmother (&#8220;MGM&#8221;) in which the MGM had told her that she had also witnessed F inappropriately touching H.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Most importantly for present purposes, I found that it was in H&#8217;s best interests to remain living with her parents until further work was completed with Tracey Carboni, and she could write a report on the degree to which the parents were capable of protecting H. I was somewhat critical of the Guardian and the LA for not balancing the harm to H of removing her from her parents, and in all probability leading to a situation whereby she was in long term foster care for the rest of her childhood. I acknowledged the difficult task this gives the LA, both because of the history of the parents failing to protect their children from risk of sexual harm, but also because the parents have found it very difficult to work openly and honestly with the LA. However, the Court&#8217;s focus must be on H&#8217;s best interests. Critically all the evidence was and remains that H is doing very well in her parents&#8217; care, and that save for the incident in issue the Mother is both loving and very protective of H, and they have a very close bond. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The current issue is that the parents have booked, and paid for, a holiday in Spain with H in June and the LA and Guardian are strongly opposed to her being allowed to go. They assert that the parents have been dishonest in respect of the obtaining of H&#8217;s passport and the holiday, and that increases their concern about H being taken out of the jurisdiction. The parents deny being dishonest. It is therefore necessary to consider, albeit without oral evidence, the factually contentious issues. However, in my view, what lies at the heart of this issue is actually a focus on what is the risk if H goes on holiday in Spain with her parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother and Father&#8217;s position is that H&#8217;s previous social worker, Mr Stockdale, told them in 2023 that the LA would apply for a passport for H. The parents say they spoke to the social worker about being able to go abroad with H and he told them this should not a problem. They say this conversation took place before the November incident, but they cannot give a clear date. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Father booked the holiday on 13 May 2023 with Hays Travel, for a week in Spain from 8 June 2024. The holiday was booked for the Mother, Father, H and F. I note the LA and Guardian seem concerned that it was booked to include F. But at the date of the booking F was living at home with his parents and H, in the full knowledge and agreement of the LA. So at that date it would have been wholly natural to have included F in the holiday. The safety plan at that date was that F was not to be left alone with H, but that would be no more easy or difficult on holiday as it was at home. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents say they have not taken F off the booking because if they are not allowed to go at all then it would incur extra expense if they cancelled F now, and then had to cancel the whole booking later. If they are allowed to go then they will take F off the booking and send the LA the paperwork confirming that.  Again, this makes perfectly good sense. The holiday has been paid for in monthly instalments since June 2023. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The LA rely on two witness statements from Mr Ferris. He asserts that the parents have organised the holiday without any consultation with the LA. He accepts, albeit somewhat obliquely, that although Mr Stockdale said that he was making the passport application, in fact no such application was made by the LA. Mr Ferris realised this at some point and then started the process by asking for H&#8217;s photographs, but again very little seems to have been done. No explanation is given as to why, if Mr Stockdale left in September, there was still no passport application by the LA in early April. I am also very unclear as to why the LA thought a passport was needed if they didn&#8217;t know about the holiday. Mr Ferris says that LAs apply for passports so that children in care don&#8217;t miss out on opportunities with foster carers or going abroad with school. Given that neither of these applied in H&#8217;s case I think it is highly likely that Mr Stockdale did know about the planned holiday. Otherwise the desire/need for a passport in September 2023 seems difficult to understand. </p>

This cannot be part of some devious plot to hide the fact of the passport and leave the jurisdiction unbeknownst to the LA, because it is accepted that she told Ms Ayling. The Mother has learning difficulties, and undoubtedly feels extremely nervous around communications with the LA. The level of hostility to her will undoubtedly impact on her ability to be forthcoming, but she did tell Ms Ayling, who I assume she feels more confident with. </p>

I start with the proposition that it is important that children in care, including those subject to care orders at home, can live as normal a life as possible and have the same childhood experiences as other children unless allowing them to do so poses an unmanageable risk. H needs the protection of the State, but if the State is going to prevent her from having those experiences then the interference needs to be properly justified. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To determine whether the interference in the normal family life is proportionate it is necessary to focus on what is the precise risk(s) that the LA is seeking to guard against. The background of this case shows that the parents have failed to protect their older children from sexual risk/harm.  The concern in respect of H has been, certainly up to this point, about the risk that is posed from H&#8217;s older siblings, in particular F and perhaps E. Historically there has also been a concern that the parents have not been alive to the risks posed by other risky adults within their familial or social circle.</p>

In my view this exposes the inconsistency and lack of analytical focus in the LA&#8217;s case. The family have been on holiday whilst H has been subject to an interim care order and a care order at home. In reality, it is more likely that other potentially risky family members or friends might meet up with them on holiday in the UK than in Spain. In practice, the LA have allowed such holidays. Although in theory it is easier to check on a child on holiday in Wales rather than in Spain, in practice this is a somewhat illusory level of protection. There is no evidence that the LA have in practice sought to check on the family when they have gone on holiday in the UK. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Importantly, in June 2023 both the LA and the Guardian supported the making of a care order at home and further work with the family. The history of the family, the Mother&#8217;s learning disability and the history of lack of openness with the LA were well known. Care orders at home are now only to be made in exceptional circumstances, see <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re JW (Child at Home under Care Order)</span> [2023] EWCA Civ 944. All parties agreed these tests were met on the facts of the current case, in the full knowledge of the risks inherent in H continuing to live with her parents. It may now be that the LA and the Guardian regret having agreed to that order. But if they wish to separate H from her parents they will have to satisfy the Court that separation is justified, and they have not done so. Given that H is living with her parents, and the Court considers it in her best interests to do so, there has to be some additional risk from allowing her to travel to Spain. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The suggestion that the parents would allow H to be placed at risk by an unknown third party just does not seem realistic on the facts.

I view this risk as minimal. The parents have no links with any other country, all their links are in the UK, and in particular in Shropshire. If they tried to stay in Spain, which seems extremely unlikely, then it would not be particularly difficult to get H back through the mechanisms of International Law and the Hague Conventions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, firstly, the LA need to take the parents as they find them, to coin a phrase from civil law. The Mother has a learning disability and the Father has learning difficulties. This inevitably leads to challenges with communication and the risk of misunderstandings.  Secondly, like many parents caught up in the children&#8217;s care system, the parents find it very hard to work openly with and trust the LA. This is unfortunate and there is no doubt they would be much better off being more open. But given the family history, the fact they struggle to trust the LA is no more surprising than the fact the LA struggle to trust them. Thirdly, there is some particular excuse around the parents&#8217; actions on this particular issue given that the LA seems to accept that they would make a passport application at some point in mid-2023 and then failed to do so. It is perhaps not surprising that that the parents took matters into their own hands. Fourthly, I do not accept that the parents, and in particular the Father, acted dishonestly in not disclosing to the Passport Office that there was a care order in place. The form is not particularly clear on this point and it was a reasonable mistake in my view. </p>
