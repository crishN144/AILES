Both before and after her birth, the family were based in the United States of America but travelled, as I understand it, fairly regularly to Australia, to Thailand and to the United Kingdom.  In or about March 2005, the parents and M moved to live in Australia and just over a year later in or about May 2006 they moved back to the United States.  In November 2008, as asserted by the father, and in January 2009, as asserted by the mother, the parties once again moved to live in Australia and it was there that S was born on [a date in] 2011.  In that same year sadly, in November 2011, the parents are separated but they agreed between them shared care arrangements for both of the girls.</span></p>

The father however did not sign it.  In late 2012, the mother who worked as a pilot, was off work and it is asserted by the father that she began to drink to excess.  She received help and treatment from a rehabilitation centre.  In late 2012, court proceedings were initiated in the Australian Family Court and competing applications were made by both of the parents.</span></p>

On 14 March by consent, all applications before the Australian Family Courts were dismissed, both parents having filed and served notices of discontinuance.  From that, I infer that any extant orders made as to residence and contact by the Australian court pursuant to those applications were terminated.  On 19 March this year, the parents entered into an agreement.  The agreement was that the family would leave Australia to go and live in the United States.  It is at least agreed between the parties that the plan had been to live in California, where the father it was hoped would be able to obtain work as a yacht skipper.</span></p>

Prior to that time, the contents of the family&#8217;s household goods had been packed into a shipping container to be transported to California in the United States.  The mother had resigned from her job and was accepting a new post with an Airline based in the United States.  On 4 April, the father sent an e-mail to the mother stating: &#8220;We will be there&#8221; - I interpose the United States &#8211; &#8220;in June planned.&#8221;  C43.  However, on 7 April, the father first indicated by a text message to the mother his intention to visit the United Kingdom after the stay in Thailand.  The mother did not, it is agreed, consent to that visit to the United Kingdom.  On 9 April, the father and M left Australia to go to Thailand.  On the mother's case, that was to be for a two week or a three week holiday.  The father maintains that it was agreed that was an open ended holiday in Thailand, but he says it was agreed that he and M would go to the United States by the end of June, by which time the mother would have completed training with a new airline.</span></p>

They were and are staying with their father's mother in her two bedroomed house.  M has a bedroom and the father told me that he sleeps downstairs on a bed.  Just 18 days after arriving in the United Kingdom for the purposes of a purported holiday, the father sent an e-mail to the mother in which he indicated that it was his intention for him and M to remain in England and not travel to the United States.  The mother replied that she did not consent to M being taken to this jurisdiction or remaining here.  The mother issued proceedings in relation to the custody of both of the children in the United Sates, in the courts of Minnesota, on 6 June 2013: those proceedings are extant. On 11 July, subsequent to the issue of proceedings in this matter, the CAFCASS officer undertook an interview with M about her views.  I shall return to those in a few moments.</span></p>

He confirmed in the course of his examination in chief that he did enter into the agreement of 19 March, the plan and the purpose being that the family would live in the United States in close proximity to each other, the mother looking after, in the main, S, the father, in the main, looking after M, but being in close proximity it was the parents' plan and wish that there would be frequent and regular contact between the two sisters and between each of the girls and their parents.</span></p>

Contrary to what is set out in his statement and in the first skeleton argument filed on his behalf by Mr. Bartlett, he asserted in evidence that it was only when he was in England that he decided that it was "not in my best interest to move to the United States."  Prior to giving evidence, it had been asserted by him that he had changed his mind about going to the United States when he and M were in Thailand.  He told me that "when I got to the United Kingdom, I finally made up my mind not to go to the United States."</span></p>

However, he confirmed that in recent times he knew nothing about any issues of concern in respect of the mother's care and ability to care for S.  It quickly became evident when the father was cross-examined by Mr. Setright QC on behalf of the mother and that much of his evidence was wholly untruthful and lies.  By way of example only and referring to his statement dated 6 August 2013 which starts at C334 of the bundle, he said at paragraph two:</span></p>

That was an obvious and blatant lie which the father was forced to admit.  What he was in fact suggesting was that he and the mother had agreed that he would live here in this country with M after travelling from Thailand.  Once more, he was forced to admit that that itself was a lie and there never had been an agreement by the mother to him and M living in this country.  It was no doubt because of that admission that the defence of consent which had been presented by the father was withdrawn by Mr. Bartlett in the supplementary skeleton argument filed on the Monday of this week.</span></p>

Those e-mails and those texts were in my judgment entirely reasonable and appropriate and they provide no basis whatever, objectively or subjectively, for the father to change his mind and renege on the agreement to go to the United States.  </span></p>

In light of the views expressed by M to Miss Julian, I am satisfied that M does not object to going to the United States.  What she objects to is being separated from her father.  That, in my judgment, is a wholly different issue.  What M did do was to express certain preferences, a preference that she remain in this country with her father, a preference that if she goes to America it is with her father, but in my judgment those views are no more than that and they do not reach the status of objection within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention.</span></p>

I also take account of the evidence of the father, both in his e-mail of 12 June and in his oral evidence, about how he had kept questioning M.  It is not without significance, as recorded by Miss Julian in her report, that there were matters concerning the parents and their actions reported by M which she said she had been told by her father.</span></p>

I therefore ask myself why this father would refuse to go with her.  He is, I have found and I am satisfied, a loving and caring father to his daughter.  Why would he then take such a callous and ruthless course which is wholly contrary to his daughter's interests?  It is not, in my judgment, because he is a callous or ruthless individual; rather, as part and parcel of the lies that he has told to this court, it is a litigation ploy.  He fears, I infer, that if he were to accept that he would travel to the United States with M that would in some way undermine his case and his opposition to that course being taken.</span></p>

		  <content>
		    <p style="margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-size:14pt">&#8220;One problem common to both of these situations is determining the place to which the child had to be returned.  The Convention did not accept a proposal to the effect that the return of the child should always be to the state of its habitual residence before removal.  Admittedly, one of the underlying reasons for requiring the return of the child was the desire to prevent the natural jurisdiction of the courts in the state of the child&#8217;s residents being evaded with impunity by force.  However, including such a provision in the Convention would have made its application so inflexible as to be useless.  In fact, we must not forget that it is the right of children not to be removed from a particular environment which sometimes is a basically family one which the fight against international child abductions seeks to protect.  When the applicant no longer lives in what was the state of the child's habitual residence prior to its removal, the return of the child to that state might cause practical problems which would be difficult to resolve.  The Convention's silence on this matter must therefore be understood as allowing the authorities in the state of refuge to return the child directly to the applicant, regardless of the latter's present place of residence."</span></p>
