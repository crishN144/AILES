The application for that school has to be made in September/October 2014.

I do not need to set out the detail of this engagement or the reasons for it for the purposes of this judgment.  Briefly, the children became subject to child protection plans in April 2010.  This followed KA sustaining injuries caused by her mother when she was in the bath.  KA sustained handprint and fingertip bruising to her face.  The mother received a caution and was asked to leave the family home by the local authority.  The father reported that the mother was often aggressive and angry with the children, and that he had to intervene to protect them.  The children remained in the care of the father, with the mother having frequent contact.  The local authority continued to have concerns, centred on the father&#8217;s ability to care for the children.  They were sometimes grubby and unkempt.  J appeared under-stimulated, and KA presented with behavioural problems.  Extensive support was offered through, what is described as, a &#8220;multitude of services&#8221;.  In 2011 the child protection plans concluded because of perceived improvements.</span></p>

Following this, the mother agreed, again it appears at the instigation of the local authority, to leave the family home.  Up until this date, and since his birth, the mother had been the primary and, in some respects, the sole carer for F.

To her surprise, she found that they were all still up and dressed.  She was told by KA that they were going to Ireland.  The mother tried to persuade the father, she &#8220;begged him&#8221;, to use her words, not to go, but he was insistent.

In passing, I note that this does not begin to explain why he left with so few possessions, with so little planning, and in the middle of the night.</span></p>

She submits that the father left England with the children solely for the purposes of seeking to evade the proposed care proceedings, and not in order to make a new life for the family in Ireland.  If he had genuinely intended to make such a move, he would have made some prior arrangements.  He would have been open about it rather than misleading the local authority and others.  The Guardian submits that the children are likely to be very confused about what has happened.</span></p>

Habitual residence is a question of fact.  The critical issue in this case, as submitted by Miss Kushner on behalf of the father, is whether the children had ceased to be habitually resident in England and Wales as at that date.  Of course, if they had become habitually resident in Ireland by 15 July, they would necessarily have ceased to be habitually resident in England.  The converse does not apply.</span></p>

Some habitual residences may be harder to lose than others and others may be harder to gain. If a person leaves his home country with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and acquire a new one very quickly. If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then or even later. Of course there are many permutations in between, where a person may lose one habitual residence without gaining another.&#8221; </span></p>

I reject his evidence that his actions were the result of his wish to move to Ireland for a better life, or to put distance between himself and the mother.  If he had been genuinely motivated by these factors, he would not have left when and how he did, and he would not have misled the local authority as he did.  It was clearly a very rushed decision, as demonstrated by the manner in which he left, including by failing to collect his older son for contact on the afternoon of 10 July, and failing to communicate with him or his mother.  He made no real plans and made no proper arrangements for a considered move.</span></p>

This was not a genuine relocation to seek a better life in Ireland.  I have no doubt that the father would seek to move again, if he were able to do so, in order further to endeavour to avoid care proceedings.
