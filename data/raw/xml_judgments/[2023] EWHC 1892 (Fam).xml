The background to this matter is particularly tragic as the proceedings related to Finley Boden, a young child who was killed by his parents on 24 December 2020. Finley and his sibling, Child A, were the subject of care proceedings brought by the Local Authority, Derbyshire County Council (&#8220;LA&#8221;), and had been returned to their parents following a hearing on 1 October 2020.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I held two hearings on this matter, at the first on 27 April 2023 I ordered that certain documents could be released to the media, but a process of redaction and, as appropriate, gisting had to be undertaken before the documents could be released. At the second hearing, the documents had been redacted in a way that all parties were content with, and the only outstanding issues were whether the Lay Justices and the Legal Adviser who had been involved in the original decision could be named by the media. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The brief outline of the factual background of this case is that Finley and Child A were made subject of an Interim Care Order (&#8220;ICO&#8221;) on 13 March 2020. The matter was allocated to the Lay Justices. The children were placed with the Maternal Grandparents (&#8220;MGP) under the terms of the ICO. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case came before the Justices on 1 October 2020 for an Issues Resolution Hearing (&#8220;IRH&#8221;). That hearing was held by telephone, as was normal for Justices hearings at that point in the Covid Pandemic. All parties at that hearing agreed that the children should be transitioned back to the care of the parents. The principal issue before the Justices was the length of the transition plan. The LA submitted that the transition period should be four months, and the matter then to come back before the court for final orders to be made if the transition had been successful. The LA in their submissions pointed to the fact that the parents had not been honest in relation to their drug taking, and to the particular challenges that had been posed by the Pandemic in relation to contact between the parents and the children. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not consider it appropriate to seek to summarise the arguments on both sides, particularly as the very point of this application is for the press to be able to see and report on the issues that arose in the case. It is sufficient to say that it was a balanced decision of the type that very frequently comes before the Family Court, at whatever level. There was nothing surprising, or in my view inappropriate, about the decision that was made or the process undertaken. </p>

I made subsequent RROs on 4 October 2022 and 3 April 2023. There is no application to vary the RRO and the terms by which it seeks to preserve the privacy of Child A and his/her carers. </p>

Almost certainly something would 'turn up' as it has long been acknowledged that things went wrong in this case to the significant prejudice to the mother, but mainly to the detriment of M.

It is important that the public have sufficient information to understand the difficult decisions, with competing considerations, that have to be made in cases such as this.
