However he argues that LM&#8217;s care by the community and the source from which her estate is derived would be likely to lead her to make a gift to charity. This gift would reflect LM&#8217;s gratitude for the financial provision that she has received and to further the purposes for which that provision was made by benefitting the lives of others.</p>

Furthermore it could reasonably be conjectured that if she did feel any such obligation she would feel it was met by the payment of inheritance tax which is a direct payment into public funds.</p>

It is not suggested that they are motivated by self interest. They are an important part of LM&#8217;s life. There can be no question that they have anything other than LM&#8217;s best interests at heart.
