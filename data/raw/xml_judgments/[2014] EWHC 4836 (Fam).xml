That simple statement of the reason for this hearing cannot begin to reflect the complex nature of this case: it has a longer history of court proceedings than any I have encountered during my career as a&#160;barrister and a judge.  This family has been engaged in litigation for almost as long as is possible under the Children Act 1989, given that the child at the centre of the proceedings is now aged 14&#189; and given that there have been almost continuous proceedings since 2001, when she was aged 1&#189;.  </span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">It is well recognised that litigation is stressful and has the potential to be extremely disruptive of family life.  To meet a family and a child who have been involved in proceedings for so many years is an extremely dispiriting experience.  In saying this, I am saying no more than was said by Goldsack&#160;HHJ QC when giving judgment in these proceedings on 9</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 2012 and by McFarlane LJ in the Court of Appeal on 6</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> September 2013.  Both expressed their dismay at the history.</span></p>

The Court of Appeal set aside Goldsack HHJ's order that contact should be limited to indirect contact.  In so doing, McFarlane LJ said, in the course of his judgment at para.77 said: </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"Drawing matters together, whilst I do not conclude that the outcome ordered by the judge is of itself wrong and, therefore, to be set aside, I&#160;am sufficiently concerned about the process of these proceedings as a&#160;whole, which I have held has violated the Article 8 rights of both M and her father and also, by the deficits in the judge's analysis which I have now identified, to conclude in the words of CPR r.52.11(3), that the outcome is 'unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity'.  For the previous systemic failure to end in a hearing which itself was highly unsatisfactory and where the judge has failed to conduct a&#160;sufficiently thorough analysis makes it almost inevitable that this court will consider that it has a duty to intervene with the aim of establishing an effective and full hearing.</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.58in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This decision is made with a heavy heart, as I fully understand that the idea of reopening these matters before the court will be a profoundly unwelcome one for M.  That it is necessary, for the reasons that I have given, I am clear, just as I&#160;am clear that, on this rare occasion, part of the responsibility for this turn of events rests with those of us who work in the family justice system.  But sight must not be lost of the place where the ultimate responsibility for this situation plainly rests, which is with the parents and, in this case, with M's mother in particular.  It is she who has, on the judge's clear and unchallenged findings, doggedly refused to allow M to develop and maintain a&#160;relationship with her father without any good reason whatsoever for so doing.  It is she, should she wish to do so, who could now unlock this intractable situation and permit her daughter to have some form of normality and balance in her relationship with her parents as she goes through her teenage years and beyond."</span></p>

At the first directions hearing before me, an&#160;application was made for M to be represented directly by NYAS, without either a NYAS caseworker or a CAFCASS guardian.  NYAS's director of Legal Services stated that, in her opinion, M was competent to be separately represented and to conduct proceedings without a guardian or litigation friend.  On the basis that the conditions referred to in Family Proceedings Rules 2010, r.16.6 were satisfied, I directed that Ms. Singleton, of NYAS, should continue to act as M's solicitor.  At this hearing, as previously, M has been represented by the same counsel, Ms. Pemberton.  </span></p>

This was not an&#160;appointment which fits easily within the Family Procedure Rules, as it was not for the purposes of CAFCASS representing M; it was to provide me with independent advice during the course of the proceedings and, in particular, as to what orders would be consistent with, and would promote, M's welfare.  I am extremely grateful to CAFCASS for agreeing to this appointment.</span></p>

This was opposed by Ms. Stanistreet and Ms. Pemberton.  I did not see how there could be an effective rehearing, as ordered by the Court of Appeal, in the absence of further expert evidence.  In my view, such evidence was essential and, accordingly, I directed that Dr. Berelowitz should be instructed to prepare a report, for which purposes he should see the mother, the father and, if possible, M.  In fact M refused to meet with Dr. Berelowitz, so he had to complete his report and give oral evidence without having seen her.</span></p>

At first, the LAA refused to accept my order.  This necessitated a further hearing, on 17</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2014, at which, because a decision had to be made immediately, the father agreed to contribute towards these costs, if necessary, and if the LAA did not review its decision.

		<p style="margin-left:1.08in;text-indent:-0.08in"><span style="font-size:14pt">"This litigation began in 2001 and, with some interruptions, has continued ever since.  There have been no fewer than 81 court orders since 2006, alone, and many more before then.  At least seven judges have been involved at one stage or another.  In excess of ten employees of CAFCASS have been involved as report writers and, more latterly, as children's guardian.  Eventually, following the inability of CAFCASS to provide continuity of a&#160;guardian, a mixture of health problems and limited resources, I appointed NYAS as M's guardian.  Several social workers have also been involved at various stages.  Those few statistics are perhaps the best evidence that there has been systemic failure in this case.</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.58in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The parents were in a relationship for about ten years before M was born.  Although never married, they lived together before the birth and for a few months after the birth.  An&#160;important background feature has been the mother's health problems, both mental and physical, which are of long standing.  She had at least one mental breakdown before the birth of M.  She has been variously diagnosed as having an emotionally unstable personality disorder, displaying paranoid personality traits and, periodically, suffers from depression.  These have not been helped by occasions when she has abused alcohol and/or illicit drugs.  She also suffers from Crohn's disease and was unable to attend the final hearing because she had only recently been discharged from hospital after admission for complications from that condition.</span></p>

Mother has always asserted that she wants M to have a normal relationship with her father; that ... have hardly ever been periods when that occurred, she has increasingly put down to M not wanting to go for contact, particularly staying, and, more latterly, refusing to go for contact.</span></p>

Early CAFCASS reports reveal, as early as April 2002, mother was resistant to contact moving on to overnight stays, although there has never been any doubt about father's ability to cope with the care of M; CAFCASS recommended it.  Almost immediately, mother tried to undermine it by saying M was not happy with the food father was providing and M did not want to go.  She stopped M going.  CAFCASS recommended suspending staying contact.  It was reinstated later and, in March 2003, the CAFCASS writer observed: 'The court may feel enough resources have been devolved to this case and it is incumbent on mother and father to make any order work.' </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.58in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Later that year, father saw more of M because mother was in a new relationship and wished time with her boyfriend.  M was also being left with her maternal grandparents, who were concerned that mother was drinking heavily, behaving badly and not providing proper care.  The acrimonious situation between maternal grandparents and father and, to a lesser extent, mother was noted.  A s.37 report was recommended and ordered.  The recommendation was for M to stay with mother, and parents to sort contact out between themselves, subsequently defined by the court.  Within months, CAFCASS were preparing another report because mother was not providing the contact ordered.  Father was considering an application to change residence, but he decided against it.  He wanted alternate weekends.  That is what was recommended because there was no good reason why a child of nearly five, who has a demonstrably good relationship with the non-resident parent, should not spend a full weekend with that parent.  A family assistance order was made.  Yet further difficulties resulted in the case being back before the court in March 2006, where no staying contact was ordered, pending yet another report from CAFCASS.  </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.58in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Within days of that order, M made allegations that father had sexually abused her.  The investigation into those matters was not handled well and breached all guidelines.  The judge did not feel the professionals involved had approached the matter with an&#160;open mind.  There was a five-day hearing, which resulted in the judge concluding that the alleged abuse had not occurred.  She described M as telling a story rather than reliving it.  Several matters stated in her judgment are informative and have come up time and again in the subsequent history of this case.  M is a&#160;very bright girl and mature beyond her chronological age.  She can be manipulative.  In dealings with CAFCASS and social services, mother cannot deny her negative feelings towards father, and M is very well aware of this.  M had blown a&#160;different minor issue out of all proportion.  I believe M played to her mother's sympathy and she got it in bucket-loads.  Despite the allegations, M had shown no reluctance to go for contact on other occasions.  Father does not come out of this all sweetness and light.  Father had accused mother of priming M.  The judge did not go so far as to find that proved, but did find that mother was all too ready to find bad in father, which fostered the negatives she already had.  Care would need to be taken to avoid M becoming an emotional wreck. </span></p>

M showed no reluctance and said, afterwards, that she had enjoyed it.  Unsupervised contact was recommended.  Subsequently, in February 2007, overnight contact was ordered.  By then the case was being dealt with the (by now) designated family judge, who has since dealt with virtually every hearing until September 2011. </span></p>

M was with her maternal grandparents.  The day before M was due to have her first staying contact with father, mother visited him.  When she left, father found a knife concealed down the settee, and his backdoor key was missing.  Mother brought M the following day.  There was an ugly scene and the police were called.  They found the key, and another knife, in mother's handbag.  She was charged with possessing a bladed article and harassment of the father.  She was admitted to a mental hospital.  She was subsequently made the subject of a community order, with a restraining order not to visit father's house.

She told her guardian that, although she loved father and wanted to spend a&#160;lot of time with him, she would like to return to live with mother.  Meanwhile, Dr. Hall, a chartered clinical psychologist, had been instructed to prepare a report on both the parents and M.  In her first report (April 2007), she did not consider mother was capable of looking after M properly.  By the time of her addendum (September 2007), she did, and her recommendation was that M return to live with mother.  The guardian also recommended M return to live with her mother, largely based on M's strong wish to do so and the guardian's view that M was operating at a level above her chronological age and was able to assess her own best interests. </span></p>

He told me - and it is contained in her report - that he was assured by the guardian that mother was now promising to co-operate with contact, and it was on that basis that the guardian made her recommendation.</span></p>

A week later, mother applied to suspend the order.  M had returned from contact with a bruise to her leg.  She alleged father had caused it by pinching her.  Father was to accept that that was correct but only because M at the time was hurting him, and he did it to make her stop.  Incredibly, not only was father charged with common assault, but the matter went all the way to a trial before a district judge, who decided that no criminal offence had been committed.  [I add that, for the purposes of that trial, M was required to give evidence.]  That was in November 2009.  In the meantime, the DFJ had ordered that contact was to be supervised by a&#160;maternal uncle. </span></p>

She was refusing to attend contact unless it was supervised by a&#160;person of her choice.  The guardian took the view that was appropriate.  A full hearing was directed and Dr. Hall asked to prepare a further report.  In February 2010, she advised that M should not be forced to go to contact in any way than the way she wanted it.  That recommendation was adopted by the guardian and so ordered by the court.  The mother agreed to go for mediation, at the father's expense.  The DFJ made a s.91.14 order, to last until October 2012. </span></p>

When he realised his mistake and phoned the mother, she refused to change her arrangements.  Essentially, she accused the father of being in breach of the order and letting M down.

She simply will not attend.  I have no doubt that, despite her assertions to the contrary, the mother has always been implacably opposed to contact and that includes the father's extended family, with some of whom M has at times enjoyed good contact.  Whether that is because of her mental health problems, as father is still charitably inclined to accept, is probably no longer relevant.  It is a fact which M has taken on board.  The evidence is clear that, whenever M has contact with the father, it is positive and that M does love her father.  I do not believe she is in fact frightened of her father, but she is torn by a loyalty to her mother, who does have serious medical problems.  </span></p>

Here the situation was not straightforward and did not simply involve a young person who has consistently expressed her view contrary to contact.  In recent times, despite her express view, M had been persuaded to attend contact by Carr HHJ QC and, on being told by then guardian that her mother was in favour of the contact visit, spending time with her father in February 2012.  Both of these occasions were, as the judge found, positive and enjoyable.  In the circumstances, there was a need for the judge to make express reference, in his analysis, to these matters of history and then to bring them into his analysis of the weight he could then attach to M's wishes and feelings.  Without such analysis, his statement that 'she simply will not attend contact' is an insufficient conclusion."</span></p>

There would have been a time when M was confused about what she felt, but now her expressed wishes and feelings fit with her own view of herself and her situation.  He used the term "ego-syntonic".  M is likely to have developed, in her own mind, a good rationalisation of why she does not want to see her father, why she should not be asked about it and why she should not be required to do so.  From the history, it can be postulated that her views were influenced by her mother, but, at some point, they became independent.  It is likely that M now feels, with great commitment, that these are her own wishes and feelings.  She is also likely to feel that it would be cruel for anyone to try and override them.</span></p>

However, it does not fit easily with the rest of his evidence, and he tempered it significantly by saying that it would be very complicated for M because she would have to find a way psychologically to make things small in her mind, which are quite large.

Her resilience has been noted by the psychologist, Dr.&#160;Hall, by CAMHS and by CAFCASS practitioners throughout their involvement over the years.  In Ms. Whittle's opinion, M continues to try and protect herself by seeking an end to these proceedings and the conflict which have overshadowed her childhood.

During her oral evidence, Ms.&#160;Whittle mentioned steps which the father could have taken, such as sending a&#160;good luck card for M's exams or giving her a magazine subscription.  In her view, the father needs to recognise that M is a&#160;complex person who deserves attention in her own right, and that he should not focus simply on the mother's hostility to him, which I add, in Ms.&#160;Whittle's view, is reciprocated by the father.</span></p>

The fact that a parent should be involved in a child's life is also addressed by the recent amendments to s.1 of the Children Act 1989 (as effected by s.11 of the Children and Families Act 2014).  This does not, however, mean that contact will be ordered because s.1 of the Children Act requires the child's welfare to be the court's paramount consideration.  However, an order for no direct contact is, as referred to by McFarlane LJ in this case, an extreme order which plainly engages the right to family life within Article 8 of the ECHR.  Accordingly, any decision to make such an order must also comply with the obligations placed on the court by that Article.</span></p>

I can well understand why the father seeks to place the obligation on the court to devise a&#160;solution, but the court's powers are limited to the orders which can be made.  These powers and orders can be used creatively as part of an overall strategy, again as referred to by McFarlane LJ, but the court does not have resources available to it, generally, to access other resources or other services.</span></p>

M spoke to Carr HHJ, who ordered contact to take place immediately.  Goldsack HHJ found that M had a thoroughly enjoyable day with the father.  However, when she got home, she burst into tears and said to her mother and her maternal grandmother that contact had been awful.  </span></p>

In my judgment, such an order would not be likely to promote the relationship between M and her father.  Indeed, it would likely to have the opposite effect.</span></p>

Their initial formation reflects her mother's influence, but it is understandable that she should have developed, in her own mind, a good rationalisation of why she does not want to see her father.  This is partly a self-protective strategy but, to refer again to Dr.&#160;Berelowitz&#8217;s evidence, it has become part of the truth of her life story.  The fact that M has enjoyed contact in the past, despite her expressed opposition, does not reflect the current position.  As Dr.&#160;Berelowitz and Ms. Whittle explained, contact has long hung by a thread which can easily be broken.  That thread has now, in my view, been irremediably broken.</span></p>

Given that M refused even to see Dr.&#160;Berelowitz, I consider it inevitable that, if I were to make an order for direct contact, she would refuse to go.  What would I then do?  </span></p>

In my judgment this would only turn her even more against him and, as described in the evidence, cause her to dig her heels in.  To quote from Dr.&#160;Berelowitz, M would see it as another &#8220;battering&#8221; from her father.  As he also said, there is no point in causing recurrent degrading experiences when contact would not take place.</span></p>

But, in my judgment, the obstacles to it taking place are insuperable.  As a result of these obstacles, M would be harmed by the only process by which this court could seek to procure contact taking place; namely, by the making of an order for direct contact and the taking of enforcement measures.  The whole court process would continue and M would continue to be at the centre of conflict.</span></p>

It would not, in my view, be in M's best interests for me to make an order for direct contact.  This would serve merely to continue the discord and conflict without any reasonable or sufficient prospect of direct contact actually taking place and would be detrimental to her welfare.</span></p>
