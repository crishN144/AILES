The mother was in the house at the time and her anguish when she came downstairs and realised that L had gone can scarcely be imagined. L has been living in the apartment in Algeria with his paternal grandmother ever since. (There is no criticism of the mother in relation to the elapse of almost a year between L&#8217;s wrongful removal from England and issue of these. proceedings. That elapse of time was caused by a delay in her receiving appropriate legal advice).</p>

The father has no intention of agreeing to or facilitating L&#8217;s removal from Algeria, a country which is not a signatory to either the Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (&#8220;the 1996 Convention&#8221;) or the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.</p>

The father was born in 1984, is Algerian by birth, became a British citizen in around 2016 and has an Algerian and a British passport. Both parents speak Arabic and the father also speaks English. L was born in England. He has an Algerian passport. The Home Office has provided a letter stating that the Secretary of State is of the opinion that L is a British citizen. That opinion is not challenged and I proceed on the basis that L has dual Algerian and British nationality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">This hearing came before me in October 2023. I adjourned it because although I had statements from each party dealing in detail with their relationship history, I lacked the information about L that the issue of jurisdiction required. I directed both parties to file further statements about L and gave a clear indication of the topics to be addressed. The statements and additional documents duly filed were an improvement but it remained the case that detail about L&#8217;s day to day life in Morocco in particular, was only forthcoming during oral evidence. This case is not exceptional in that regard.</p>

	    <p class="ParaHeading" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Jurisdiction is the first matter that I must determine. At the beginning of the final hearing in October which I adjourned, counsel for the mother informed the court that she did not, in addition to habitual residence, pursue the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> route to jurisdiction. Just before the matter came back to court in November, the mother gave notice that she did. The re-introduction of reliance on the inherent jurisdiction caused some procedural difficulty as the father had an incomplete understanding of how that case was put. I directed that there be sequential service of further written submissions after the end of the hearing.</p>

The mother makes allegations of domestic abuse including coercive and controlling behaviour which, she says, started shortly after she arrived in England in November 2019. Where relevant to the jurisdictional issues before me, I reach findings on specific events. But I make no findings about the overarching allegation of consistent frequent abusive behaviour and control. Although I have preferred the father&#8217;s evidence on a number on discrete matters that does not, and should not be taken to mean, that the allegations of abuse are unreliable.</p>

She says (and I accept) that it was the father&#8217;s idea to make the asylum application. His thinking was, she says, that if she had a German residence card she would be able to move freely between Germany and the UK, both countries then being part of the European Union. On 26 June 2018 the mother and father married according to Shariah law in Berlin.</p>

It contains a summary and a lengthy account of the mother&#8217;s interview by an immigration official in July 2018. The basis of her application was that she was the victim of violence, including serious sexual violence, at the hands of her ex-husband who was pursuing her so that it was unsafe for her to return to Morocco. Further documents provided by the father show that she appealed, this time citing medical grounds: depression and PTSD. It seems that the appeal was successful and in November 2018 she began to receive benefits. One of the mother&#8217;s current concerns is that if she were to commence proceedings in Algeria for care and custody of L, the father would use her mental history to argue that she is an unfit parent.</p>

She says that when she was about six months pregnant, the father started pushing for her to move to England and for their baby to be born there. She says he told her that they would live and settle together as a family in England, and he would help her bring O over from Morocco so that the four of them could be a family. In the same statement, the mother says that her German residence permit expired in January 2020 and she wanted to give birth there: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I knew that once I left Germany I would not be able to go back there which also made me very reluctant to come to the UK.</span>&#8221;</p>

On legal advice provided in Germany he obtained a document which would have enabled that to happen. However, the mother then withdrew her consent and said she would only agree to him being named on the certificate if he brought her to the UK to give birth. He acceded to that. The father says that they never planned to settle in England permanently. The plan was always for them to live in Algeria. I note that in her first police interview, the mother said: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">In 2019 he wanted me to go to Algeria.</span>&#8221;</p>

I think it likely that the father wanted the baby to have dual British and Algerian citizenship, as he did, and later to be raised in Algeria, as he had been. The mother had no connection to the UK or Algeria and a lot to lose by leaving Germany. I think it likely (accepting that there are other possibilities) that there was a negotiation which resulted in an agreement that the baby would be born in England, and they would cross the bridge of where to live in the longer term later.</p>

I disagree. I do not find that the fact that she and L found themselves in Morocco rather than England after 15 March 2020 to be a result of a deliberate, premeditated decision by the father.

I also accept his evidence that he left some cash with her. First, L&#8217;s current passport is dated April 2021. It is difficult to understand why he would have troubled to apply for a replacement if he was in possession of the original. Second, the mother&#8217;s evidence is that she saw L&#8217;s passport for the first time at Manchester airport on 21 February 2020, and the father kept it in his possession for the next three days and took it away with him. If that is right, there was no opportunity for her to take the picture of L&#8217;s passport on her phone which she had in July. </p>

He lives with his grandmother and other family members in the grandmother&#8217;s flat. Weekends are spent with family and he sometimes stays overnight with an aunt and plays with cousins. His uncle also takes him out: sometimes they go to the mosque on Fridays. </p>

It shows a well-dressed, well presented, healthy seeming little boy seated at a table on which are pictures and pages with large print words. He is with a nursery worker or teacher and they are the only two people in view. L is clearly relaxed and at ease, he smiles at and engages well with the teacher and makes good eye contact with her. At one point we see him taking up a pencil in his right hand and drawing on a page which he steadies with his left hand. He appears to have a good grip and appropriate fine motor skills. There is no indication of a problem with either wrist (the mother produces a photo of him in Algeria with what she says is a swollen wrist following an accident) so far as one can tell from this brief video. He is not wearing glasses and again, so far as one can tell, seems to have no difficulties with vision (the mother reports a history of eye problems). L is said to be learning Arabic and has started to learn a bit of French. He learns other subjects too at an age-appropriate level.</p>

Twice at the end of the court day, with the kind assistance of court staff, we stayed late so that contact could take place under the remote eye of the court. This was only minimally more effective. Later attempts have not born fruit with the mother and grandmother making cross allegations as to why not. That is not a matter for me but I observe that it is easy to understand why this very young boy is struggling, or not motivated, to focus on telephone calls with a person who is, now, a stranger to him.

In the former case, the other State acquires Article 5 jurisdiction. In the latter case, the other State does not. The consequence is that, in the former, the original State cannot retain jurisdiction by reference to domestic law, while in the latter case, it can. In my view, this is unlikely to cause difficulties if the child has moved from the State in which the proceedings have been taking place, because the court would be likely to have sanctioned the move and would have needed to consider the consequences of such a move, including as to jurisdiction and recognition/enforcement, before it was sanctioned. There may, of course, be more complex cases in which there has been a wrongful removal or retention but I do not propose to address what might happen in such a situation.</span>&#8221;</p>

Usually a child lose a pre-existing habitual residence at the same time as gaining a new one (Re B); (emphasis added);<br/><br/>viii)&#160;In assessing whether a child has lost a pre-existing habitual residence and gained a new one, the court must weigh up the degree of connection which the child had with the state in which he resided before the move (Re B &#8211; see in particular the guidance at para 46);<br/><br/>ix)&#160;It is the&#160;stability&#160;of a child's residence as opposed to its&#160;permanence&#160;which is relevant, though this is qualitative and not quantitative, in the sense that it is the integration of the child into the environment rather than a mere measurement of the time a child spends there (Re R and earlier in Re KL and Mercredi);<br/><br/>x)&#160;The relevant question is whether a child has achieved&#160;some degree&#160;of&#160;integration in social and family environment; it is not necessary for a child to be&#160;fully&#160;integrated before becoming habitually resident (Re R);<br/><br/>xi)&#160;The requisite degree of integration can, in certain circumstances, develop quite quickly (Art 9 of BIIR envisages within 3 months).&#160; It is possible to acquire a new habitual residence in a single day (A v A; Re B).&#160; In the latter case Lord Wilson referred (para 45) those&#160;'first roots'&#160;which represent the requisite degree of integration and which a child will&#160;'probably'&#160;put down&#160;'quite quickly'&#160;following a move;<br/><br/>xii)&#160;Habitual residence was a question of fact focused upon the situation of the child, with the purposes and intentions of the parents being merely among the relevant factors. It was the stability of the residence that was important, not whether it was of a permanent character. There was no requirement that the child should have been resident in the country in question for a particular period of time, let alone that there should be an intention on the part of one or both parents to reside there permanently or indefinitely (Re R).&#160;<br/><br/>xiii)&#160;The structure of Brussels IIa, and particularly Recital 12 to the Regulation, demonstrates that it is in a child's best interests to have an habitual residence and accordingly that it would be highly unlikely, albeit possible (or, to use the term adopted in certain parts of the judgment, exceptional), for a child to have no habitual residence; As such, "if interpretation of the concept of habitual residence can reasonably yield both a conclusion that a child has an habitual residence and, alternatively, a conclusion that he lacks any habitual residence, the court should adopt the former" (Re B&#160;supra)&#8221;.&#160;</p>

It is not a matter of intention: one does not acquire a habitual residence merely by intending to do so; nor does one fail to acquire one merely by not intending to do so. &#8230;</p>

It is the child&#8217;s integration which is under consideration. &#8230;The environment of an infant or very young child is (one hopes) a family environment and so determined by reference to the person with whom he lives. But once a child leaves the family environment and goes to school, his social world widens and there are more factors to be taken into account. &#8230;.</p>

Some habitual residences may be harder to lose than others and others may be harder to gain.&#160;If a person leaves his home country with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and acquire a new one very quickly.&#160;If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then or even later. Of course there are many permutations in between, where&#160;a person may lose one habitual residence without gaining another.&#8220;&#160;</p>

The issue of habitual residence requires consideration of all relevant factors. Further, where a child might be said to have some degree of integration into more than one State, the court must consider the factors which connect the child to each State where they are alleged to be habitually resident. </p>

By the end of the final hearing in November, the mother had modified her position. She sought a bare return order and an order that L stay with her pending a welfare hearing within 14 days of arrival in England. As counsel for the father points out, that modification does not alter the fact that the mother&#8217;s purpose in making the application is to achieve not only L&#8217;s return to England, but his return to England to her care, in the first instance at least.</p>

Additionally, it is argued that child abduction is &#8220;an evil&#8221; and a serious criminal offence, and a child who has been abducted is in need of protection in order to restore the status quo.</p>

	      <p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:0.25in">I accept the father&#8217;s submission that neither abduction nor separation from a parent mandates a summary order for return of the child. As Baroness Hale of Richmond said in <span style="font-style:italic">In re J</span> at paragraph 28: &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">&#8230;.there is always a choice to be made.

It was not a case about the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction. However, some of the principles it sets out apply here and I also agree with the father&#8217;s submission that whilst his non-consensual removal of L forms part of the background, the court&#8217;s focus is the child, not the parents and not punishment of the parent who has taken the child.

I also agree that they have been &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">his more formative years thus far</span>&#8221;.

I cannot accept that submission. The experience of contact over the last two months indicates the contrary. It was clear from his oral evidence that he does not believe that L needs a relationship with his mother or that he suffers from lack of contact with her. </p>

	      <p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:0.25in">Until the hearing in October, the mother had been eradicated from L&#8217;s life and, given his young age, likely his conscious memory. She is barely a presence in either now and after this judgment has been handed down, her calls will probably go unanswered. The loss of his mother is a present and continuing harm to L from which he requires to be protected. Concomitantly, his loss of connection with his maternal family, which includes his half-brother, and his Moroccan heritage is a lesser but still an important harm. Finally, looking to the future, damage to his relationship with his father and Algerian relatives is reasonably foreseeable. There will come a time when L seeks to know who and where his mother is. When he finds out that he has been kept away from her for years, there is a real chance of him rejecting his father at least temporarily. Protection from a future harm that has yet to eventuate is less imperative than protection from present and continuing harm but it forms part of the relevant circumstances.</p>

	      <p class="ParaHeading" style="margin-left:0.25in">An important part of the father&#8217;s submissions is that were the mother to commence proceedings for an order that she have care of L in Algeria, the courts there would favour her. That may be the case but these submissions fail to take account of two matters. The first is the reality of the situation. The mother is, so far as I am aware, dependent on benefits and has no other source of funds. She lacks the financial means to travel, pay for accommodation, or fund care proceedings in Algeria (the expert report tells me there is no legal aid available in custody cases for a non-Algerian mother). Her current immigration status may preclude her re-entry to England and Wales. There is no information about whether she would be granted permission to settle and work in Algeria. For a time, at least, she would be dependent on the father&#8217;s willingness, and ability, to pay maintenance.</p>

Mr Edge&#8217;s evidence is clear: absent the father&#8217;s consent which he will not give, the Algerian legal system lacks the power to authorise the mother, L&#8217;s primary carer between his birth and his non-consensual removal from her care, to travel with L outside Algeria.</p>

However, the effect on her of having to commence proceedings in Algeria is not irrelevant. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re JA</span>, there was psychiatric evidence about the adverse effect on the mother&#8217;s mental health of having to go back to live in the UAE, which she would do if her daughter was returned there. I remind myself of the mother&#8217;s allegations of abuse, including coercive and controlling behaviour, and her fear that she would face hostility from L&#8217;s father and his family in Algeria were she to travel there. The reality is that she will not bring proceedings in Algeria, and even if she did and it was ordered that L should live with her there, she will not put herself in the position of moving to that country and being locked in there until he reaches adulthood.</p>

These compelling circumstances necessitate an order that L be returned from Algeria to England and Wales. Despite the father&#8217;s statements in court, I do not consider that order to be unenforceable. If they cannot be agreed, I will hear submissions on the practical arrangements and required directions.</p>
