The court has a discretion to waive defects where no injustice or unfairness was caused.

The history of the case makes it clear Ms Root has repeatedly disregarded orders made by the court, Breach 3 occurred only 9 days after the last committal hearing. Breach 4 was only a short period after the hearing before Gwynneth Knowles J.

I impose a 6 month prison sentence in relation to each of Breaches 3 and 4, to run concurrently, and a 3 month prison sentence in relation to each of Breaches 5 and 8, to run concurrently. The total sentence is therefore 6 months. I have given careful consideration as to whether that sentence can be suspended. Bearing in mind the recent reduction in material on line I am persuaded by Mr Dean that it&#8217;s the right course to take, and I will therefore suspend that sentence for a period of 12 months, on condition Ms Root complies with the injunction order made today. I will discharge the suspended committal order made by HHJ Polden. </span></p>
