Over the ten years between 1975 and the passport&#8217;s expiry in 1985, it bears evidence of the respondent travelling backwards and forwards to Nigeria very frequently, particularly after 1980, but there are no visible stamps in the period between 6 June 1976 and 13 July 1978. </span></p>

I recall the day quite well although it took place so long ago. June can often be a rainy month in Nigeria but on the day of our wedding, the weather was ok; it did not rain. My uncle invited friends from Ghana but I did not know any of those who attended the wedding. The Respondent also invited friends and neighbours from my uncle&#8217;s village also came along to the ceremony. I only knew my uncle [K], his wife and my other uncle [S] who had come to the ceremony. </span></p>

It was a creamy colour on the outside and inside consisted of a long living room with 2 bedrooms off to the right hand side. A canopy had been set up outside for the day&#8217;s celebrations. When everyone arrived at my uncle&#8217;s house, I was sat in my uncle&#8217;s bedroom with the door shut as I understand is tradition. The Respondent arrived along with the others and he was dressed in his traditional Nigerian wedding clothing. We both wore the same cream coloured clothing made from the same cloth. I wore a traditional skirt, top and hair tie. </span></p>

Everyone gathered there and there were 2 seats at the end of the room. Those representing my side of the family sat on one side of the room and the Respondent&#8217;s friends were on the other side. The Respondent had brought around 10 friends with him but it&#8217;s hard to remember precisely as I did not know the majority of people there. My uncle [K] ran the ceremony. The respondent stood by the seats at the end of the room with my uncle and a girl was brought before him wearing a cloth over her head to conceal her face. The Respondent was asked &#8216;is this your woman?&#8217; and he replied &#8216;no it is not&#8217;. A second girl was brought out, again her face was covered and the same question was asked of the Respondent who gave the same reply. I was then brought out with a cloth over my face. When the Respondent was asked whether this was his woman, on this occasion he replied &#8216;Yes, this is my woman.&#8217; The cloth was then taken off my head and everyone clapped. The Respondent and I joined hands and we sat down together. </span></p>

I recall the Respondent gave money to my parents which was a sum equivalent to the custom in Ghana. I have already stated that the Respondent gave me money to buy the wedding cloth and a sewing machine. The Respondent also bought food and drink to the ceremony. I recall the drink was Schnapps. Money was also given by the Respondent to my uncle [K]. </span></p>

I recall the Respondent took me to sign papers confirming our marriage and told me that we needed to sign these forms so that we could go on and apply for a joint passport.  I recall attending an office building with the Respondent and one of his friends.  We met with an official there who was shown the photographs of our wedding and the Respondent and I confirmed we were married.  All 4 of us then signed some documents which I believe was the registration of our marriage.  My uncle [K] also swore an Affidavit with the High Court in Lagos in 1977 confirming the wedding, as did my uncle [S]&#8230; I attach as exhibit &#8216;MO3&#8217; those affidavits.   </span></p>

It was kept in a safe at No. 108 that she alleges was broken into by the respondent&#8217;s sons in 2011.  The copy exhibited had been kept by her sister in London.</span></p>

In particular, I cannot be satisfied that there has ever been an address known as 3, Koko Close, or that the applicant&#8217;s Uncle K (assuming that he lived at some stage in Lagos) returned there in 1991, when he would have been very elderly.  Moreover, the applicant has not explained why she had asked for a second document in 1991, when a copy had been kept of the original 1977 affidavit, or why she produced the 1991 version before the 1977 version in these proceedings.  I am also unable to be satisfied that original documents were taken by or on behalf of the respondent at different times in the manner suggested by the applicant. </span></p>

This bears the date 27 February 1992, so it is apparently contemporaneous with the 1991/2 possession proceedings.  The document describes the marriage as having taken place to the best of the deponent&#8217;s knowledge, information and belief, but does not imply that he was himself present; on the contrary, the account is of his brother K having received the dowry and customary gifts on behalf of the family in Ghana, including the bride&#8217;s father (now deceased) and himself.  For that reason, the document adds little or nothing to the applicant&#8217;s case that there was a marriage at which her Uncle S was present.  Nor is it clear why this uncle would have come from Ghana for a wedding, unaccompanied by any other members of the applicant&#8217;s family.  </span></p>

In particular, I cannot attach any weight to the evidence of V on this point.

Only recently, with the arrival of these proceedings, has she begun the complex process of disentanglement.  A lot of time has been spent by both parties in an effort to deny knowledge and responsibility for this sustained deception, and to blame the other for it.  It is clear to me, however, that both of them knew perfectly well what they were doing, and I impartially reject their evidence on this issue.  They settled upon the plan so that the applicant, who had no right to be in the United Kingdom, could live here in the guise of Mary.  That has led to a number of serious consequences, not least that the two children&#8217;s birth certificates contain incorrect information about their mother, and that the applicant was for years paid benefits and a pension to which she was not entitled.      </span></p>

It gives rise to numerous questions that cannot for the most part be answered.  In the first place, the original passport has been extensively damaged, according to the respondent in a flood, and some pages appear to have been torn.  The picture of Mary that must once have appeared beneath that of the respondent has disappeared, with each party blaming the other for removing it.  To further complicate the matter, the applicant produces a photocopy of two pages only, taken by her before the passport was cancelled in 1985. In the place for the spouse&#8217;s photograph, a picture of the applicant has been crudely substituted for or placed over the original photograph of Mary &#8211; the official stamp that would have covered the original photograph does not extend onto the substitute photograph.  Both parties accuse the other of adding the new photograph.  Finally, a mystery surrounds the whereabouts of the original photocopy, which was not limited to two pages and was submitted in 2012 by the applicant&#8217;s solicitors to the Home Office IND.  It is recorded by the Home Office to have been returned to the applicant&#8217;s immigration solicitors, but it has not been seen by this court.</span></p>

It is possible that some such details appeared on parts of the passport that are now missing or illegible, but it is in my view unlikely that the passport was used for travel in 1977/1978.  If the applicant is correct, there would have to have been the following stamps, none of which are seen: (i) UK exit stamp and Nigerian entry stamp for the respondent to go to Nigeria for the marriage, (ii) Nigerian exit stamp and UK entry stamp for respondent&#8217;s return to England, (iii) UK exit stamp and Nigerian entry stamp for the respondent to go back to Nigeria to collect the applicant, and (iv) Nigerian exit stamp and UK entry stamp for the couple&#8217;s final return to England.

Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the respondent had another passport in a different name, and had he used a different family name, the Nigerian High Commission would no doubt have details.

In effect, she became a wife by substitution, with a ready-made identity that served her practical purposes and those of the respondent very effectively.   Her evidence about returning to Ghana while the respondent sorted out the immigration position was unpersuasive, when in fact no effort was made by anyone to regularise her immigration status.  I also reject her evidence that she thought the joint passport details were a mistake by the respondent.</span></p>

It may be that the reason why the proceedings came to an end was because the respondent would have been equally implicated if the impersonation was exposed.  Then, he had a choice about whether to press the issue; now, he does not, though he has tried to mitigate the position by lying to protect what he repeatedly called his &#8216;credibility&#8217;. </span></p>

While the respondent is someone who might be capable of a clandestine marriage if it suited his purpose, I can see no such purpose in circumstances where the applicant had a ready-made means of remaining in the UK as Mary.  It also strains credulity that a marriage could have remained unknown to so many people for so long.  Had the respondent wanted to keep a marriage quiet from his family, it is unlikely he would have chosen Lagos as the venue.</span></p>

I accept that he resided here at that time with the intention of continuing to reside here for an indefinite time but not that he lacked a genuine intention of returning to reside permanently in Nigeria.  The respondent&#8217;s roots in Nigeria are deep, and even when he resided in London he returned there constantly.  On the evidence presented in these proceedings, I infer and conclude that he always intended to return permanently at some later stage.  His eventual return, planned in 1985, begun in 1987 and complete by 1989, speaks of the uninterrupted continuation of his Nigerian domicile. </span></p>
