	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">DD has a very significant degree of learning disability, little language, very little comprehension of anything other than simple matters, and needs assistance with almost all aspects of her daily life. Her parents are originally from Bangladesh, but have lived in this country for many years and brought up their family here. All family members are British citizens. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2003 DD was married in Bangladesh by arrangement to AA, said to be her cousin (although DD&#8217;s parents differ as to whether he is a cousin on the paternal or maternal side). After two failed attempts to gain entry in which he was &#8220;sponsored&#8221; by DD (the immigration judge noted that her capacity to do so was very much in doubt) he was finally successful in obtaining a spousal visa and entered in 2009. He moved in with DD and her parents to their home in a city in England, sharing a bedroom and a bed with DD. DD&#8217;s brother, English speaking who is in effect the head of the family, lives in the same street with his family. He attended the court hearings and although not a party has given undertakings upon which he has had the opportunity to take legal advice. </p>

	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact of DD&#8217;s marriage eventually came to the attention of the learning disabilities team, which had only recently been created, of the local authority where DD lives (XCC), and very significant concerns arose as to DD&#8217;s welfare as a result of which the Police obtained a Forced Marriage Protection order, which order continued pending an application by XCC to the Court of Protection. Within those proceedings the Official Solicitor was appointed as litigation friend for DD. Dr Milne, consultant psychiatrist in learning disabilities, was instructed to assess DD&#8217;s capacity to marry and have a sexual relationship, and her capacity generally. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AA remained in the family home, although he was made aware by the Circuit Judge at the first substantive hearing in the Court of Protection in September 2009 that to have sexual relations with DD was likely to constitute a criminal offence due to her incapacity to consent. By court order, since 2010, he is no longer permitted to live at DD&#8217;s family home and has been ordered, or has undertaken, not to have any form of contact with her. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is unfortunate that the social services department of XCC had not been previously alerted to the fact that a woman with severe learning difficulties had been married abroad, and that she had needs with which she and her family required assistance.  In a judgment given in December 2010, I explored the reason why the case had slipped through the safety net. XCC has accepted its failures. For their part, DD&#8217;s parents did not perceive that there was any problem with DD being married and neither had the family&#8217;s GP, whose advice had been sought on at least three occasions about marriage and pregnancy for DD over the years. </p>

Her parents are very largely insulated from mainstream English society and are mistrustful of non-Bengalis. They do not communicate well in English: her mother understands and speaks almost none.  They are devout Muslims. I found that DD is a loved and valued member of her family and that her parents are devoted to her. The family is bewildered and disconcerted that they are seen as having done anything wrong, and that what they have done may be seen as contrary to DD&#8217;s best interests.  In my December 2010 judgment I accepted that in DD&#8217;s parents&#8217; culture it is considered a duty of parents to arrange for their children to be married and that disabled children are found spouses so that they can be provided for when the parents are unable to do so. Whether there was some other motive for the marriage such as family or other obligations in addition I was not able to determine.</p>

Under English law, a person in the position of IC is precluded from marriage for the simple reason that he lacks capacity to marry. No English Registrar of marriages could or would have contemplated celebrating a marriage between IC and NK, for the simple reason (amongst others) that no such Registrar could have issued a certificate of satisfaction that there was no impediment to the marriage. Furthermore, as IC is incapable of giving his consent to any form of sexual activity, NK would commit a criminal offence in English law by attempting to have sexual intercourse, or indeed having any form of sexual contact with him.&#8221;</p>

Thus the marriage is valid under Islamic and Bengali law, and if it has been consummated can only be dissolved by talaq granted by the husband.  This view was accepted by the CA in <span style="font-style:italic">KC</span>. It is unlikely that the marriage could be annulled or a divorce granted in Bangladesh unless the husband consents. There would be no automatic recognition of an English decree of nullity, divorce, or judicial separation. </p>

He said that a decision that she should be divorced or her marriage annulled would have a substantially negative impact on her. Marriage breakdown and divorce has considerable stigma and negative connotations in the Muslim community. In this case it risks creating considerable tension within DD&#8217;s family. He expressed concern as to how she will react if her marriage is annulled. He expressed concern that the community would ostracise her. He said that there would be considerable stigma. </p>

He gave evidence.  As his evidence was developed through cross-examination he accepted however that this case requires closure, and that there is in fact no benefit to any of the parties from a cultural perspective in allowing the fiction to be perpetuated that this marriage was or could be regarded as valid in this jurisdiction, or in permitting any ambiguity to remain about the relationship between AA and DD. Only after having heard Professor Rehman&#8217;s evidence did DD&#8217;s parents accept that I should make such a declaration of non-recognition, and the Official Solicitor on DD&#8217;s behalf and XCC then followed suit.

I watched the wedding video, and observed from that that although DD was clearly a loved and cherished member of her family, she was able to play very little part in the first, celebratory stage of the wedding ceremonies, and that when the religious ceremony took place she was slumped in a chair almost comatose and only just able with considerable prompting to repeat the words of consent to marriage, which I found she did not understand. I found that AA and DD&#8217;s mother had given me false and misleading accounts as to the circumstances in which the marriage came about, and had made false statements about what DD had said to them in an attempt to present her as having understanding.  After my rulings in December 2010 DD&#8217;s mother was still representing DD as wanting to be married: stating that DD missed AA and &#8220;wanted him back&#8221; an assertion which cannot be true in the light of DD&#8217;s lack of communication and understanding. </p>

She has no concept of pregnancy and would not understand what was happening to her.  She would not be able to co-operate with medical intervention and would find the whole process terrifying. She would not be able to care for a child, a fact which DD&#8217;s mother recognised in her evidence, even though she and the whole family had knowingly exposed DD to the risk of pregnancy and had sought medical advice as to why DD was not pregnant when a negative pregnancy test result was obtained, this being after AA had been told by the Circuit Judge that he must not have sexual relations with DD. </p>

In my earlier judgment I remarked that this is wholly unrealistic. AA&#8217;s position is that he does not intend either to divorce DD, or to present a petition for nullity, although a letter was received from his solicitors dated July 2011 which states that AA &#8220;has not ruled out the possibility of seeking to dissolve the marriage presumably by seeking leave to petition for nullity should his circumstances change in the future&#8221;.  I was informed by Counsel for AA on 27 July that this letter was badly expressed and does not in fact reflect his present instructions. I have not heard evidence about this issue, but it is quite clear to me that this reflects the reality which is that whether he is permitted to remain in this country or not AA will inevitably want to be married to a woman with whom he can have a full marital life and a family. </p>

The Court of Appeal held that the marriage was to be regarded as valid in Bangladesh, and must be regarded in English Law as valid until set aside.</p>

So it is neither here nor there that a marriage celebrated in Pakistan might be recognised as valid in that country. The short point is that [B&#8217;s] capacity to marry in the eyes of English law means that no marriage entered into by him, either in this country or abroad, will be recognised in English law. And, if it is not recognised in English law it will not be recognised by English public authorities.&#8221; Wall LJ agreed with Munby J that the court had a protective jurisdiction to prevent an adult under a disability from being taken out of the country to be married, and also that any purported marriage whether celebrated in England or abroad would not be recognised in English law. </p>

In exercising that judgment the court will seek to exercise common sense, good manners and a reasonable tolerance. In my view it would be altogether too queasy a judicial conscience which would recoil from a marriage acceptable to many peoples of deep religious convictions, lofty ethical standards and high civilisation. On the contrary, I must have regard to this particular marriage, which, valid by the religious law of the parties&#8217; common faith and by the municipal law of their common domicile, has stood unquestioned for 35 years. I must bear in mind that I am asked to declare unmarried the parents of a child who is unquestionably legitimate in the eyes of the law.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thorpe LJ said at [31] &#8220;I would be equally supportive of the judge&#8217;s introduction of the public policy considerations.  In English jurisprudence not every marriage valid according to the law of some friendly foreign state is entitled to recognition in this jurisdiction&#8221;. At [32] he said &#8220;In the present case it is common ground that IC lacks the capacity to marry in English law. Even having regard to the relaxations that have permitted marriage to be celebrated in a variety of places and by a variety of celebrants, it is simply inconceivable that IC could be lawfully married in this jurisdiction.&#8221; Wall LJ agreed with this observation. Thorpe LJ continued &#8220;There is much expert evidence to suggest that the marriage which his parents have arranged for him is potentially highly injurious&#8221;. Thorpe LJ set out a number of considerations relevant to IC and referred also to the illegality of sexual relations: since sexual relations, including sexual touching with a person who cannot consent, constitutes a sexual offence under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sexual Offences Act 2003</ref>. He continued &#8220;It is the duty of the court to protect IC against that potential abuse. The refusal of recognition of the marriage is an essential foundation of that protection.&#8221; Wall LJ held &#8220;this marriage cannot be afforded recognition either on its own or in the context of the development of English private international law in relation to marriage. There are also strong public policy grounds for refusing recognition.&#8221; The marriage was offensive simply on the basis of IC&#8217;s inability to consent either to marriage or sexual relations. Thorpe LJ focused on the harm which was likely to be caused to IC by the marriage.</p>

The Advocate to the Court submits that the real test is not: is it in DD&#8217;s best interests for a declaration of non-recognition to be granted: but rather: is it in her best interests for it not be granted, and for her to remain married. He suggests that where an adult has &#8220;borderline&#8221; capacity, and has the capacity to consent to sexual relations (which requires a different and arguably less sophisticated understanding than marriage) and to understand and to welcome pregnancy, and for whom the marriage is benign and supportive, and where there are children being cared for in the family environment, then the picture might be very different from this case, and welfare might argue against non-recognition. Furthermore, in my view, if a marriage has been celebrated when one party lacks capacity but later regains it, and does not wish to repudiate the marriage (a consideration relevant to the characterisation of a non-consensual marriage as void rather than voidable in the 1971 legislation) then the lack of consent and even non-consensual sexual relations before capacity was regained might well not justify non-recognition. In the latter case proceedings would probably not come before the court.</p>

He points out that it is as relevant to take into account immigration considerations as it is criminality of sexual relations. I am not sure that the analogy is entirely sound: the criminality attaches to an activity with the incapacitated person. Immigration issues affect society generally. </p>

The specific public policy considered by the Court of Appeal was that such a marriage is so offensive to the conscience of the court that it should not be recognised. I have said that to force a marriage on an incapacitous person is a gross interference with his or her autonomy.  Its concomitants, sexual relations and, as a foreseeable consequence,  pregnancy, constitute  not only a breach of autonomy but also bodily integrity, perhaps one of the most severe that can be imagined, and the consequences may be lifelong. Marriage creates status from which many consequences flow which affect third parties and the public at large including the admission of persons who would not otherwise be entitled to admission. Thus questions of public policy generally as well as those that affect the individual concerned are relevant. There is also a public policy interest in the Court stating openly that such marriages should not be recognised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parties suggest that AA&#8217;s immigration status is no longer relevant: by the time of the hearing in October 2011 a letter had been received from the Home Office, which had seen my earlier judgment. AA&#8217;s leave to remain has expired. AA has not applied for further leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain as DD&#8217;s spouse: but for leave to remain outside the immigration rules. His status was likely to be reviewed regardless of the present proceedings. If he remains legally married to DD this is unlikely to benefit his immigration position given my earlier findings. The UKBA would not regard the marriage as subsisting, and it would be unlikely that he could rely on Article 8 of the ECHR: their letter made it clear that AA would not be able to rely on the marriage in support of his immigration application. The Advocate to the Court submits that even if a declaration as to the status of the marriage would have no future effect upon the immigration position of AA, public policy issues also arise from the fact that AA was able to enter to live and work in the UK by reason of DD being subjected to a marriage to which she could not consent. I accept that AA entered lawfully on a spousal visa: but it was a visa based on a false premise that this was a marriage capable of being recognised. </p>

Its creation and existence is in breach of her personal rights.  There is no positive feature of the marriage at all for DD. Indeed it is disadvantageous to her in a number of respects. It has exposed her to great risk. Hopes in respect of the marriage have given rise to great tensions, fuelled family conflict with XCC as providers of essential services and support for DD, led the family to dismiss the significance of the earlier declarations, and have led DD's mother to continue to use DD&#8217;s purported wishes and feelings to support the continuance of the marital relationship. It is obvious to me that DD&#8217;s family want to support AA&#8217;s endeavour to remain in this country and that they have perceived the marriage, and perhaps even potential children resulting from it, as supporting that aspiration. I had and have a number of anxieties as to the reliance that might be placed on the marriage in a number of contexts. I agree that this family needs closure. DD is plainly aware of tensions in this family and conflict with XCC has affected her adversely. There should not be any ambiguity as to her status.</p>

In respect of status alone, DD is undoubtedly domiciled in the jurisdiction, and England, as the proposed place of residence, and entry to which was one of the prime purposes if not the sole purpose of, the marriage, was and is the country with the most real and substantial connection with the marriage. There are overwhelmingly strong public policy grounds and welfare grounds not to recognise the marriage. I shall declare that the marriage of DD and AA, celebrated in and valid according to the law of Bangladesh, is not recognised as a valid marriage in this jurisdiction. </p>

		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">[181]Notwithstanding my criticism of XCC, effective Social Services intervention in 2003 and before by provision of support may well not have prevented the marriage since the family may not have discussed their plans for marriage. I doubt whether an effective support scheme would have led to any different approach by the family to the need to provide support for DD from a spouse. However XCC may have been in a position to bring the case before the High Court to seek an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction, although the jurisprudence was then still in its infancy. However they ought to have intervened, and quickly, when they became aware of DD&#8217;s marriage in 2008. Had they done so it is likely that an order would have been made preventing her from cohabiting with AA.  I understand the family&#8217;s bewilderment and distress and indeed sense of anger that intervention took place at a late stage when there was no previous expression of concern from any quarter.</p>

The communities where this is likely to happen also need to be told, loud and clear, that if a person, whether male or female, enters into a marriage when they do not have the capacity to understand what marriage is, its nature and duties, or its consequences, or to understand sexual relations, that that marriage may not be recognised, that sexual relations will constitute a criminal offence, and that the courts have the power to intervene. </p>
