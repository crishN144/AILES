That application is opposed by the mother, she relies on the defences of acquiescence under Article 13 (a) and grave risk of harm under Article 13 (b), including the inadequacy of the protective measures offered by the father.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother does not pursue her defence of child&#8217;s objections under Article 13, having had the opportunity to consider the Cafcass report from Ms Dunlop who had the opportunity to meet the children on 6 January 2023. Ms Dunlop concluded that whilst X expressed a preference to stay here, neither child objected to a return to Sweden.</p>

Z  would remain living here between the care of her mother and his father. On return, she would make an immediate application seeking an order to permit her to return to live in this jurisdiction with the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Contrary to PD27A paragraph 4.2 the bundle contained unsigned versions of the statements of the parties. The father&#8217;s first statement appeared to still be in draft format, with requests for more information on certain matters still left in the statement in brackets. There was no reason why statements that should have been signed sometime ago (the latest one of the father&#8217;s was dated 8 February 2023) were not in the bundle. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_6">
	  <num>6.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the start of the hearing there seemed to be an expectation on behalf of the father that the court would hear oral evidence about matters, some of which were generally referred to in the statements and some information not even mentioned in the written evidence. Paragraph 3.8 of <span style="font-style:italic">The Practice Guidance: Case Management and mediation of International Child Abduction Proceedings </span>13 March 2018 sets out the parameters regarding oral evidence in these cases and the issue was recently considered by Moylan LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B (Children) (Abduction: Consent: Oral Evidence)(Article 13(b)) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2022/1171" uk:canonical="[2022] EWCA Civ 1171" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EWCA Civ 1171</ref>. The procedure for an order under the 1980 Hague Convention is essentially a summary procedure, with oral evidence only being given in limited circumstances, not to fill in gaps that could have been provided for in the written evidence. After further consideration, no application was made for oral evidence to be given, or for any further written evidence to be submitted.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_7">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case management order of Morgan J dated 23 November 2023 provided for the filing of a composite schedule of the protective measured indicating the areas of agreement and disagreement. The father&#8217;s statement listed the protective measures he was offering but the mother failed engage in protective measures until this hearing started. Whilst I understand her overarching case to be that no package of protective measures would be sufficient to mitigate the grave risk of harm under Article 13 (b), her non-engagement has meant that a part of this hearing has been taken up exploring the protective measures, which could easily have taken place at an earlier stage.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is matter of regret that none of these matters were picked up at the pre trial review hearing on 18 January 2023 and drawn to the courts attention. If they had, focussed case management directions would have enabled this hearing to proceed more effectively. Rule 1.3 Family Procedure Rules 2010 requires the parties to help the court to further the overriding objective in rule 1.1; this includes assisting the court with case management to enable the court to deal with the matter expeditiously, fairly and proportionately. That was not done in this case.</p>

The mother denied being involved in any incident with a trampoline. No written translation was provided of the emails relied upon by the father, which are in Swedish and the attachments were not produced, despite the court giving the father additional time to be able to do that.

The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country.

These policy considerations include, not only the swift return of abducted children, but also comity between the contracting states and respect for one another&#8217;s judicial processes. Furthermore, the Convention is there, not only to secure the prompt return of abducted children, but also to deter abduction in the first place. The message should go out to potential abductors that there are no safe havens among the contracting states.</span></p>

The court is entitled to take into account the various aspects of the Convention policy, alongside the circumstances which gave the court a discretion in the first place and the wider considerations of the child&#8217;s rights and welfare. I would, therefore, respectfully agree with Thorpe LJ in the passage quoted in para [32] above, save for the word &#8216;overriding&#8217; if it suggests that the Convention objectives should always be given more weight than the other considerations. Sometimes they should and sometimes they should not.</span></p>

As is clear from the earlier discussion, the Convention was the product of prolonged discussions in which some careful balances were struck and fine distinctions drawn. The underlying purpose is to protect the interests of children by securing the swift return of those who have been wrongfully removed or retained. The Convention itself has defined when a child must be returned and when she need not be. Thereafter the weight to be given to Convention considerations and to the interests of the child will vary enormously. The extent to which it will be appropriate to investigate those welfare considerations will also vary. But the further away one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be.</span></p>

Neither X or Y speak Swedish and Y&#8217;s apparent enthusiasm for Sweden needs to be looked at in the context of his young age and limited understanding.

First, it has not been denied that the mother was in a refuge between 2014 and 2015, although the father states the mother formed another relationship at this time. Second, in his own evidence the father accepts arguments between the parties and the need, if they did argue, for him to </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#1A1A1A">&#8216;go to the garage and come back in the evenings, things would then be okay&#8217;,</span><span style="color:#1A1A1A"> although stating they only argued on limited occasions.

The father&#8217;s account of the injuries being caused by a fall from a trampoline two months previously in February 2022 lack credibility and are wholly inconsistent with the photographs, which are more likely to be consistent with the mother&#8217;s account of domestic abuse. Finally, the accounts given by the children, even taking into account their exposure to the mother&#8217;s narrative, provide support for the father behaving in a way that frightened them.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="color:#1A1A1A">Whilst it is right the protective measures proposed by the father are extensive they do not, in my judgment, manage the risk I have identified exists in this case. I agree with Mr Little, that having regard to the background there is a real risk that the father would not abide by those undertakings. Whilst making all due allowance for the difficult situation the father was in, the text he sent to the mother on 16 October 2022 was revealing, effectively threatening her with these proceedings, referring to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#1A1A1A">&#8217;bad position&#8217;</span><span style="color:#1A1A1A"> she is going to be in and if he won she would have no say about where the children live. Whilst the court can&#8217;t resolve the differences between the parties about how contact has gone since the order dated 23 November 2022, the behaviour described by the mother is not inconsistent with the way she alleges that father has behaved towards her in the past. Also, whilst some years ago, the father has a history of a general disregard for the law through his criminal convictions and the evidence demonstrates limited, if any, understanding by him of the impact on the mother of his alleged behaviour.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.75in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="color:#1A1A1A">As regards the protective measures themselves it is of note, after the father was aware of the serious allegations made by the mother regarding his behaviour, he proposes a property in close proximity to where he will be living. Whilst I acknowledge he changed his position on that issue it demonstrates no insight into the impact of his alleged behaviour on the mother, which also raises issues about his ability to abide by any undertakings.</span></p>

The actions of the mother in this case are precisely the actions the 1980 Hague Convention was designed to prevent. I agree with the characterisation by Mr Green of the mother&#8217;s actions as being deliberate and deceitful.</span></p>

However, it is right to acknowledge despite that both X and Y were able to say positive things to Ms Dunlop about Sweden, and in the case of X about the wider paternal family.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="color:#1A1A1A">On the other hand, in my judgment, there are other, more magnetic considerations. The basis upon which I have considered the Article 13 (b) defence being established and the extent of the exposure to the harmful physical, emotional and psychological impact of serious domestic abuse on the mother and the children. The children are settled here, are doing well in the care of their mother and the concerns expressed by their school need to be seen in the context of the different school age in Sweden, the mother&#8217;s accommodation difficulties and work commitments. The children have a strong sibling relationship with Z, they have shared a home with him since birth, if returned they would be separated from him which would be a significant loss for them and adversely impact on their welfare. The children&#8217;s relationship with their father can be maintained through contact being provided for in an order which, in principle, the mother does not oppose.</span></p>
