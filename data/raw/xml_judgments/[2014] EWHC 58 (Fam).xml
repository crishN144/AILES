Likewise the Judge was not required to hear oral evidence as to this.  F had revoked his agreement by email to S remaining in Gibraltar and called for her return as at 2 August 2012.  The correspondence is wholly inconsistent with an agreement for S to move to Spain.  M&#8217;s stated intention to move in with her partner does not refer to a location. </p>

This is not confined to purely procedural orders and there is no real guidance in the White Book as to the possible limits of the jurisdiction. Although this is not intended to be an exhaustive definition of the circumstances in which the power of under CPR Part 3.1(7) is exercisable, it seems to me that for the High Court to revisit one of its earlier orders, the Applicant must either show some material change in circumstances or that the judge who made the earlier order was misled in some way, whether innocently or otherwise as to the correct factual position before him.  The latter type of case would include, for example, a case of material non-disclosure on an application for an injunction.  If all that is sought is a reconsideration of the order on the basis of the same material, then that can only be done, in my judgment, in the context of an appeal. Similarly, it is not, I think open to a party to the earlier application to seek in effect to re-argue that application by relying on submissions and evidence which were available to him at the time of the earlier hearing, but which, for whatever reason, he or his legal representatives chose not to employ.</p>

		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">55 &#8230; An infant necessarily shares the social and family environment of the circle of people on whom he or she is dependent.  Consequently, where &#8230; the infant is in fact looked after by her mother, it is necessary to assess the mother&#8217;s integration in her social and family environment.  In that regard, the tests stated in the court&#8217;s case law, such as the reasons for the move by the child&#8217;s mother to another member state, the languages known to the mother or again her geographic and family origins may become relevant.&#8221;</p>

To that end, where the situation concerned is that of an infant who has been staying with her mother only a few days in a member state &#8211; other than that of her habitual residence &#8211; to which she has been removed, the factors which must be taken into consideration include, first, the duration, regularity, conditions and reasons for the stay in the territory of that member state and for the mother&#8217;s move to that state and second, with particular reference to the child&#8217;s age, the mother&#8217;s geographic and family origins and the family and social connections which the mother and child have with that member state.&#8221;</p>

I accept that if Article 11 (8) is engaged, welfare enquiries will be necessary. I shall make arrangements for the case to be relisted before me. If no response is received from Spain within four weeks I shall determine the issue on the material available.</p>
