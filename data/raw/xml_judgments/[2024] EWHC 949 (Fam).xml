The SJE accountant accepted that whilst his companies continued to support a loss-making member of their group, A Ltd, that the husband&#8217;s current level of income could not be increased. However, should that business be closed, there would be significant profits that could be distributed. Assuming a distribution of 50% of those profits, the SJE considered that the husband could achieve around &#163;300,000 pa. net, plus rental income of over &#163;100,000pa gross.</span></p>

The parties agreed that she could earn up to &#163;20,000pa gross subject to child-care costs. The judge found that the prospects of her making a significant net contribution to her budget over the next 9-10 years was low. She would have 15 years of making a small post-tax contribution to her budget thereafter.</span></p>

He disregarded an alleged loan of over &#163;1.65m from the husband&#8217;s father, and some claimed costs in respect of an access road, but did deduct another c.&#163;70,000 in other smaller liabilities. This led him to determine that the non-pension assets less liabilities could be computed as &#163;10,875,672. Of this, he found that only &#163;3,575,000 were matrimonial and so could be the subject of a sharing claim.</span></p>

This was contrary to the wife&#8217;s case, who had initially sought a lump sum of about &#163;4m on a sharing basis, to produce an income for her of &#163;150,000pa on a lifetime Duxbury basis. For the husband&#8217;s part, he had offered a needs based award based on a lifetime Duxbury of &#163;54,000pa, which would have required a sum of c.&#163;1.2m.

Mr Chamberlayne is right that the husband&#8217;s net salary was broadly agreed at a little over &#163;165,000pa, although it had been both &#163;40,000 or so higher and lower within the previous 4 years. But that does not mean that the judge was not entitled to conclude that the business as a whole was a greater potential resource for the husband going forward than the simple amount of the income that he drew; that either if he did turn A Ltd around, or if he jettisoned it, then there would be significantly greater levels of drawings available.

That he then mentioned what appears to be a gross figure for &#8216;dividends and rents&#8217; at &#163;100,000pa as additional income does not necessarily mean that the judge took that gross figure as net in his calculations.

He pointed to their widely varying historical presentations, identified the husband&#8217;s core spending from his Form E presentation of his future income needs, having stripped out non-recurring items, as being &#163;136,700pa, and then pared down the wife&#8217;s budget to a lower figure than that - &#163;8,434pcm - &#163;101,208pa. He found that that figure required significant reductions for her &#8211; including 60% off her claimed personal expenses, but also that it was affordable by the husband on the basis that he would only spend what on his case he needed &#8211; the unrealistic estimate of &#163;5,000pcm including child maintenance &#8211; but that also he was satisfied that &#8216;</span><span style="font-size:12pt">in reality there is room for a significant increase to his income</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">.&#8217; </span></p>

It is also the case that he was wrong to suggest that the wife&#8217;s salary would be taxed as a top slice because of the receipt of a Duxbury sum.

I will deal below with the overall question of the award in the context of the assets in the case, and the judge&#8217;s other findings, but here I am not satisfied that the reduction by reason of the wife&#8217;s earnings is so far short of other judge&#8217;s might consider appropriate that I should replace the judge&#8217;s discretionary determination with my own.</span></p>

This was not therefore an award made from largely non-matrimonial assets, nor one impacting disproportionately upon the husband&#8217;s own available living standards going forward. The income figure on which he based his Duxbury calculations was firmly centred mid-way between the parties&#8217; rival contentions as to income need at the outset of the trial, and at a lesser level than he found that the husband was likely to spend based on his Form E presentation going forward. He took modest account of the wife&#8217;s earning capacity, but in circumstances that whilst she was then still approaching 41, she also had up to 15 years of likely future responsibility for a child in education, notwithstanding the length of the marriage.</span></p>

The judge himself can hardly then be criticised for finding that the husband could raise the sum ordered within a reasonable period, and without expressing concern about the impact of raising such a sum on the husband&#8217;s own living standards going forward. As the authorities have made clear, an appellate court is in no position to substitute its own discretion for that of the trial judge in the absence of clearly identified errors of principle, or findings that were simply not open to the court on the basis of the evidence before it. That is a significant hurdle. </span></p>

Once an award has been calculated so that it meets the applicant&#8217;s needs, there can be no principled basis for adding to it with additional sharing, if the applicant&#8217;s sharing claim has already been determined to be of lesser value. The award then is likely to become unfair to the respondent, who is left making provision greater than the assessment on either individual basis. Once an applicant&#8217;s sharing claim has been subsumed by their needs, small bits of the former claim cannot thereafter be resurrected to supplement the needs award.</span></p>

This was especially so given his decision to calculate the lump sum payable on the basis of a lifetime Duxbury sum, so that any pension income would simply serve to augment the figures which he had calculated to meet her needs. However, notwithstanding the wife&#8217;s relatively young age, I do not agree that the value of her pension should be considered gross for the purpose of any calculation, rather, adopting Mr Chamberlayne&#8217;s alternative figures, and rounding, I will deduct the sum of &#163;60,000 from the amount of the income fund which the husband must provide, so that the figure becomes &#163;2.3m.</span></p>

Thus, the wife had security for that part of the lump sum which provided for her maintenance; indeed, as the lump sum due would not reduce with late payment, any delay in payment of that element would have provided greater than simple compensation to the wife, provided that the maintenance sums were received as ordered. This is because once received, the full sum would include provision for periods already covered by maintenance payments. In those circumstances, a court would not usually direct that, in addition to the continuing maintenance obligation until payment, interest payments on the income element of the fund would also accrue.</span></p>

Whilst Mr Chamberlayne made the point that the wife could until payment remain in the family home, and so could postpone use of her housing fund, the judge was certainly entitled to determine that interest should apply in the event of late payment of those elements of the fund. It would have been very unfair for the wife to have been left indefinitely waiting to move on because of the husband&#8217;s late payment, with no sanction as to that element of the award. And in relation to the debt, whilst a part of the husband&#8217;s obligation was to meet the interest charged up to the date of payment by the litigation funders, the judge was quite entitled to determine, especially in the absence of evidence that the husband could not make the payments in time, that late payment should attract separate interest on the balance of his obligation to the wife.</span></p>

As to that final element, however, the issue is more finely balanced. The judge was certainly entitled to determine that there was no good reason why payment should be made late, as he did. However, in circumstances where (i) the monthly sum to be produced by the fund was already separately provided for until payment, where (ii) there was no provision for reduction of that maintenance level in the event of part payment, and where (iii) the amount due was also remaining static until payment, even though if paid late the initial payments that it was calculated to cover may have already been paid as maintenance, I have to consider whether that discretionary determination exceeded even the generous bounds permitted to the trial judge. </span></p>

Even taking into account that the judge was entitled to exercise his discretion in light of his findings about the husband&#8217;s evidence so as to go as far as might be permissible in securing the wife&#8217;s award, and providing appropriate sanction in the event of late payment, I am clear that interest in addition to maintenance and an irreducible fund goes beyond what is appropriate, notwithstanding the court&#8217;s findings.
