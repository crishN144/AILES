	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">RC is aged 23. He is the child of parents who practise the faith of the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, but he was not baptised as such. At aged 4 he was taken into care. He was not brought up as a Jehovah&#8217;s Witness.  He has a long history of repeated self-harming conduct which has extended to self-strangulation and other self-injury such as burning himself, self-laceration and head-butting. He has been diagnosed as suffering from both antisocial and emotionally unstable personality disorders. He has also suffered thromboses for which he is prescribed the anti-coagulant warfarin. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">RC was first admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 2006, when aged 15. In 2012 he was convicted of a serious sexual assault and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. In August 2013, while in prison, he embraced the religion of the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, although he has not yet been baptised into that faith and the conversion procedure would be lengthy.  </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As is well-known, for doctrinal reasons Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses will refuse a blood transfusion as part of medical treatment. This is a central article of faith and will be adhered to even if death eventuates. It derives from an interpretation of Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:10, 14; Deuteronomy 12:23; and Acts 15:28, 29, all of which prohibit the eating of blood.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 1 February 2014 when in prison RC badly slashed his brachial artery (the major blood vessel of the upper arm) at the crook of his elbow. When in hospital he refused a blood transfusion although no harm resulted from that decision. On 12 March 2014 he was admitted to a secure psychiatric hospital. On a number of occasions he attempted to reopen the wound and was placed in a restraint belt to prevent him from doing so.</p>

As I explain below, this was properly witnessed. It provided that no transfusions of blood or primary blood components should be administered to him in any circumstances, even if his life was at risk. Provided that he was of capacity when he made it, this decision has the same effect as if the decision was made when the proposed treatment is to be carried out. </p>

Plainly, in any case where the protected party contests a decision to impose treatment on him he is entitled to a hearing in the Court of Protection to determine the issue.

This is surprising, especially as Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights is (as here) likely to be engaged. As is well-known this protects the right to life. It is the most fundamental of the convention rights. Countless authorities have emphasised the imperative duty on public authorities to give effect to this right where detained persons are concerned. So if the approved clinician in charge of the treatment decides not to impose potentially life-saving treatment one can see the important need for judicial scrutiny to determine whether the patient has with a full awareness of the implications elected to opt-out of the right to life granted to him by Article 2. And one would expect, as has happened here, that a second medical opinion would be commissioned concerning the approved clinician&#8217;s decision.</p>

At all events a wide (but not always consistent) interpretation has been given to section 145(4). Thus the decision to force-feed Ian Brady was held to be within section 63.

The Hippocratic duty to seek to save life, or the benign but paternalistic view that it is in someone&#8217;s best interests to remain alive must all surely be subservient to the right to sovereignty over your own body. Beyond this, considerations such as whether the treatment would be futile will no doubt be relevant; for example, if the repair of a laceration would inevitably be followed by a new one or if the patient was suffering from another unrelated terminal disease. </p>

It cannot be disputed that the act of self harming, the slashing open of the brachial artery, is a symptom or manifestation of the underlying personality disorder. Therefore to treat the wound in any way is to treat the manifestation or symptom of the underlying disorder.  So, indisputably, to suture the wound would be squarely within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref>. As would be the administration of a course of antibiotics to prevent infection. A consequence of bleeding from the wound is that haemoglobin levels are lowered. While it is strictly true, as Dr Latham says, that "low haemoglobin is not wholly a manifestation or symptom of personality disorder", it is my view that to treat the low haemoglobin by a blood transfusion is just as much a treatment of a symptom or manifestation of the disorder as is to stitch up the wound or to administer antibiotics.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The only question relates to the witnessing requirements in (g) and (h). The document has the signature of a witness on it; the question is whether RC and the witness signed it in each other&#8217;s presence. However, Dr S was able to tell me in her oral evidence that she saw them sign it in each other&#8217;s presence. Accordingly I am perfectly satisfied that all the formal requirements relating to the advance decision are satisfied. Further, I am perfectly satisfied that RC had full capacity when he executed the document on 4 April 2014. Therefore, should RC ever be in a position where for whatever reason he lacks capacity, but there is indicated a medical need for a transfusion, then the advance decision will be operative.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, conducting, as I must, a full merits review, I conclude that the decision made by Dr S is completely correct. In my judgment it would be an abuse of power in such circumstances even to think about imposing a blood transfusion on RC having regard to my findings that he presently has capacity to refuse blood products and, were such capacity to disappear for any reason, the advance decision would be operative. To impose a blood transfusion would be a denial of a most basic freedom. I therefore declare that the decision of Dr S is lawful and that it is lawful for those responsible for the medical care of RC to withhold all and any treatment which is transfusion into him of blood or primary blood components (red cells, white cells, plasma or platelets) notwithstanding the existence of powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/63" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 63</ref> MHA. </p>
