The husband was born in 1952 and the wife in 1958. They married in 1985 and separated in August 2001. They have two children, a boy A born in 1986 and a girl B born in 1988. The wife petitioned for divorce on 6 February 2003 and a decree nisi followed on 3 June 2003.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.07in">The husband and the wife are both farmers. They spent their entire married life farming a hill farm in the north of England. The farm has been in the husband&#8217;s family for some time: he is the fourth generation to have farmed it. He was working the farm when he first met the wife. She at that time was training to be a farmer. They met at the local market. It is quite clear that the farm has always been more than a mere source of the husband&#8217;s livelihood. It is his way of life, indeed it is his whole life. He was born there. He has worked on it since 1968. Now that his marriage has broken down he sees it as all that he has left. It was clear from his evidence that, whatever he may have said on occasions in the past, he cannot really contemplate retiring. He wants to die there &#8211; preferably in harness. He told me, and I accept, that he is not the kind of man who can contemplate living in a town or even in a village. His life is &#8211; always has been &#8211; bound up in the farm. His daily horizons extend little if at all further than visits to the local market and occasionally to the next town. It is this factor that has made this case so excruciatingly difficult, for the relief which the wife says she is entitled to would almost certainly necessitate a sale of the farm, something she says, and I accept, she would rather avoid.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.07in">Happily there is very little dispute between the parties on most matters. There is an agreed Schedule which shows that the family assets have an aggregate value (net of notional realisation costs and Capital Gains Tax) of &#163;2,501,356 (I take the figures in the Schedule and ignore a number of minor adjustments). They are held as to&#163;2,105,610 by the husband, &#163;70,678 by the wife and the remaining &#163;325,068 by the two of them jointly.</p>

(1) The land, which is vested in the husband, has a net value of &#163;1,746,900. This includes the farmhouse, a substantial six-bedroomed building which, together with the other non-farm buildings within its curtilage, is valued at &#163;550,000 gross, a three-bedroomed bungalow, valued at&#163;275,000 gross, occupied by the stockman, and a derelict dwelling, H, valued at&#163;45,000 gross. (2) The husband also has an interest in a mineral lease which has a net value of &#163;67,700. (3) The farm business is carried on by the husband and wife in partnership. The partnership assets are worth &#163;325,068, including some &#163;78,000 cash at the bank representing the proceeds of sale of livestock. (4) Both the husband and the wife have shares in a local farmers&#8217; co-operative, MartCo: the husband&#8217;s shares are worth &#163;250,840 net, the wife&#8217;s are worth &#163;3,675.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.08in">The other assets consist of a number of bank accounts, pension funds, and other investments. As at the date when the Schedule was prepared the husband had bank accounts totalling &#163;16,783, pension funds worth &#163;23,364 and premium bonds worth&#163;23; the wife had bank accounts totalling &#163;22,340 (&#163;11,686 of which was earmarked for paying the children&#8217;s school fees), pension funds worth &#163;12,584, premium bonds worth &#163;30 and a NFU bond worth &#163;32,049.</p>

The wife&#8217;s costs (inclusive of VAT) amount to &#163;38,035, of which she has already paid &#163;15,367; the husband&#8217;s costs amount to&#163;31,607 of which he has already paid &#163;20,516.

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.07in">The family&#8217;s income has always been modest. In recent years it has of course been drastically affected by the successive disasters of BSE and foot and mouth. The farm profits (year ending 30 November) were &#163;10,407 in 2000, &#163;1,645 in 2001, &#163;15,844 in 2002, and &#163;40,731 in 2003. The husband&#8217;s income from the MartCo shares and from his directorship in the company was &#163;6,258. The husband&#8217;s share of the annual rent and royalties under the mineral lease is &#163;25,000, though that sum is in effect charged under his father&#8217;s will with an annual payment to his mother of &#163;7,500. Developments on nearby land which it is agreed are likely to happen mean that from 2006 until 2013 no royalties will be payable so that he will receive only his share &#8211; &#163;6,000 &#8211; of the guaranteed rent. That sum, of course, is less than the amount payable to his mother, so that after 2005 his income from the mineral lease will in effect stop. I understand that it is unlikely to resume until 2013 or to return to its present level until 2016. The farm is currently participating in a study as to its suitability as a wind farm, which brings in an additional &#163;2,000 per annum. It is possible, though unlikely given its location, that a wind farm might be established, which would bring in extra income.</p>

At present she is unemployed, receiving, in addition to her share of the farming profits, child benefit for the children of &#163;1,211 per annum and child tax credit of &#163;2,172.</p>

They live in a rented property in a village. Both children have had difficulties, A as the result of a serious injury to his eye in September 2000, B as the result of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome from which she has suffered since September 2001. The consequence is that each of them is now one year behind in their schooling. A is doing his GCSEs this summer; B will be doing hers next year. A therefore has a little over two years more at school, B a little over three years. Both are at private schools. A is a day boy, B a weekly boarder. The school fees amount in all to some &#163;38,000 per annum: that sum will be required for the years 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 and&#163;19,000 for the year 2006/2007 &#8211; a grand total of some &#163;95,000. It is anticipated that both children will move on to higher education after they leave school.</p>

As she put it in her oral evidence, &#8220;[A] takes a lot of propping up &#8230; my job became [B]&#8217;s recovery.&#8221; Previously she was earning &#163;11,200 per annum as an assistant house mistress and assistant librarian at a local school, but she left that employment in February 2003. In a letter dated 19 June 2003 her GP gave it as his opinion that &#8220;it is absolutely essential that Mrs [P] is at home and able to support both children.&#8221; In a letter dated 7 July 2003 the Consultant Ophthalmologist treating A made much the same point: &#8220;I would expect that Mrs [P] will need time to continue to provide the emotional and psychological support for both [A] and his sister [B].&#8221; So too did the Community Psychiatric Nurse who had been helping. In a letter dated 8 September 2003 she recorded that, although the children&#8217;s cases had been closed at the end of August 2003, &#8220;they are still vulnerable to relapse,&#8221; adding</p>

She ran the house and looked after the children. But her contribution went further than that. There was some disagreement as to just what she did on the farm. In my judgment she played a significant part. No doubt the hard core of the work, day in and day out, was done by the husband and the stockman. But this was not a farmer&#8217;s wife who simply stayed in the kitchen. She did hard physical work in the farmyard and in the fields: she wielded a pitchfork moving silage and straw, she did much of the lambing, she went to market and to the agricultural suppliers, she kept the books and made the PAYE returns, and filled out the annual IACS forms. She was the only licensed sheep dip operator on the farm. On top of that, as I have said, she supplemented the family&#8217;s income by her work as a farming journalist.</p>

She was paid annual interest of &#163;5,000 but it is unclear &#8211; and a matter of dispute between the parties &#8211; whether any and if so how much of the capital has been repaid. The bungalow is shown as an asset of the farming partnership valued (seemingly at cost) at &#163;40,698.</p>

Thus he seems not to have even considered a sale and lease-back of the farm or the extent to which his relatives might be able to assist: one of his sisters farms an adjoining farm. On 8 December 2003 the AMC offered to lend him &#163;325,000 on the security of the farm, conditional on receiving evidence to confirm the amount of shares held by him in MartCo and evidence of &#163;80,000 savings. The annual repayments were &#163;15,762.52. That offer lapsed on 27 February 2004. An accountants report dated 7 May 2004 obtained by the wife&#8217;s solicitors points out that this offer was made before the accounts as at 30 November 2003 came to hand, showing net profits of &#163;40,731 rather than &#163;15,844 for the previous year, and that AMC might therefore be prepared to offer more than &#163;325,000. The accountant also suggested that the farmhouse could be mortgaged for 70% of its value &#8211; &#163;385,000 &#8211; at an interest- only rate of 5% costing the husband &#163;19,250 per annum. In cross-examination the husband accepted under pressure that he might be able to raise as much as &#163;500,000 on mortgage and by selling the shares &#8211; though that would leave him unable to pay the school fees &#8211; but disputed that he could possibly raise &#163;550,000 in that way.</p>

The shares are conventionally sold only rarely and then in small quantities (in the last three years only 102 shares in all have been traded), any attempted sale of his entire shareholding would either prove impossible for lack of willing purchasers or so seriously depress the market as to realise only a comparatively modest amount, and in any event he needs the shares in order to be able to meet the children&#8217;s school fees. The bungalow cannot be sold, because the stockman is entitled to occupy it as one of the terms of his employment and in any event no-one will do the job unless accommodation is provided.</p>

Typically, a husband and wife share the activities of earning money, running their home and caring for their children. Traditionally, the husband earned the money, and the wife looked after the home and the children. This traditional division of labour is no longer the order of the day. Frequently both parents work. Sometimes it is the wife who is the money- earner, and the husband runs the home and cares for the children during the day. But whatever the division of labour chosen by the husband and wife, or forced upon them by circumstances, fairness requires that this should not prejudice or advantage either party when considering para (f), relating to the parties&#8217; contributions &#8230; If, in their different spheres, each contributed equally to the family, then in principle it matters not which of them earned the money and built up the assets. There should be no bias in favour of the money-earner and against the home-maker and the child-carer.&#8221;</p>

It concerns property acquired during the marriage by one spouse by gift or succession or as a beneficiary under a trust. For convenience I will refer to such property as inherited property. Typically, in countries where a detailed statutory code is in place, the legislation distinguishes between two classes of property: inherited property, and property owned before the marriage, on the one hand, and &#8220;matrimonial property&#8221; on the other hand. A distinction along these lines exists, for example, in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/37" uk:canonical="1985 c. 37" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985</ref> and the (New Zealand) Matrimonial Property Act 1976.</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.08in;margin-right:1.08in">This distinction is a recognition of the view, widely but not universally held, that property owned by one spouse before the marriage, and inherited property whenever acquired, stand on a different footing from what may be loosely called matrimonial property. According to this view, on a breakdown of the marriage these two classes of property should not necessarily be treated in the same way. Property acquired before marriage and inherited property acquired during marriage come from a source wholly external to the marriage. In fairness, where this property still exists, the spouse to whom it was given should be allowed to keep it. Conversely, the other spouse has a weaker claim to such property than he or she may have regarding matrimonial property.</p>

However, in the ordinary course, this factor can be expected to carry little weight, if any, in a case where the claimant&#8217;s financial needs cannot be met without recourse to this property.&#8221;</p>

If I am wrong and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead did enunciate a guideline that in general inherited property ought to be excluded, then, in my judgment, he was not saying that it was an immutable or fixed principle. Whether the guideline should be applied in any particular case must depend upon the facts and upon the court&#8217;s assessment of fairness in each case. In this case, if the inherited assets of the wife are to be taken into account as part of her contribution to the marriage and the family, which, in my judgment, they must, then there is no reason to exclude them from the wife&#8217;s assets when performing the discretionary exercise. For to do so would mean the wife could have her cake and eat it. She gets credit for her contribution from the inherited assets and further credit if the value of the inherited assets are deducted from the total of her assets before division. That would be tantamount to double counting and thus unfair.&#8221;</p>

He asks rhetorically: Can the wife point to a single reported decision in which one party had inherited all the assets pre-marriage, and the other party&#8217;s award was based on anything other than reasonable needs? Praying in aid Wilson J&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">R v R </span>as an example, he submits that the underlying ethos of what he calls &#8220;farming cases&#8221; is that where all the assets are inherited, it is appropriate to &#8220;invade&#8221; them, as he puts it, to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to provide properly for the needs of what he calls the &#8220;outgoing spouse&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.58in;margin-right:0.07in">The husband accepts, on this basis, that he must find the money to provide accommodation for the wife. Taking the cost at &#163;400,000, and deducting the wife&#8217;s liquid assets of &#163;60,000, he says that he should pay &#163;340,000, a sum which he accepts he can raise by borrowing. But he disputes that the wife has any &#8220;need&#8221; for periodical payments. As Mr Chamberlayne puts it in his skeleton argument, the husband &#8220;fundamentally disagrees&#8221; with any suggestion of capitalisation of periodical payments: first, because &#8220;there is no maintenance to be capitalised&#8221; and, secondly, because there is in any event &#8220;no further free capital to pay a further lump sum in excess of the wife&#8217;s housing needs &#8211; even that sum is being raised by borrowing.&#8221; In other words, the husband is asserting, in the final analysis, that not merely is the wife&#8217;s claim capped by an assessment of her &#8220;reasonable needs&#8221; but that, even if her reasonable needs require more, she should be limited to the amount of the husband&#8217;s free capital.</p>

I agree with Mr Chamberlayne that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the proper approach is to make an award based on the wife&#8217;s reasonable needs for accommodation and income. I do that, applying the approach adopted by Bennett J in <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Norris v Norris</span>, not (pace Mr Chamberlayne) because of any principle that this is the approach to be adopted in farming cases, but because in the particular circumstances of this case that is the approach which most closely accords with the over-arching requirement of fairness, having regard to all the circumstances but in particular to:</p>

But equally I reject Mr Chamberlayne&#8217;s attempt to limit the wife&#8217;s claim to the amount of the husband&#8217;s free capital. This is a case where the wife&#8217;s reasonable needs require to be met: no more and no less. There is no justification for leaving her, after this marriage and bearing in mind everything she has done and, in relation to the children, everything she is continuing to do, with anything less than what she needs.</p>

In terms of accommodation her need is, I find, for a house of the kind she is looking for, in the area where she is looking, and which is going to cost her something of the order of &#163;400,000 (before costs, stamp duty and other expenses). In terms of income her need is, I find, for &#163;10,000 per annum, this being the difference between the income of &#163;15,000 or so which, accepting Mr Chamberlayne&#8217;s approach, I think she will be able to obtain in due course and an annual budget of &#163;25,000 (that being her figure of &#163;27,750 adjusted so as to exclude in particular those items which are referable to the children). This is not an extravagant figure by any means, but in assessing what this wife needs I am entitled to have some regard to the fact that, as she readily accepted in the witness box, the family has always lived extremely frugally.</p>

True it is that if the husband pays all the school fees she will be able to have recourse to that part of the money in the bank &#8211; &#163;11,686 &#8211; which she has hitherto earmarked for that purpose. But she has unpaid legal costs of &#163;22,668 to find, and it is going to take her a little while to get her income up to &#163;15,000, so in part she is going to have to live on her capital. She will also have to meet costs, stamp duty and other expenses amounting to &#163;20,000 or thereabouts. She needs some cushion for contingencies and emergencies. Thus my approach is to assume that the wife will pay all the incidental costs and expenses of her purchase of a new property out of her own resources, but that otherwise her resources should not be brought into account in determining the amount of the capital provision that her husband ought to make for her.</p>

The aggregate lump sum of &#163;575,000, when added to the wife&#8217;s existing assets of &#163;70,678, represents a little over 25% of the family assets, the vast bulk of which, as I have said, was brought into the marriage by the husband from his inheritance.</p>
