On 3 April 2015, Newton J, on the application of a local authority which I shall refer to as local authority B, made an order making Y1 and Y2 wards of a court and a separate order likewise warding Y3 and Y4. The three adults and the children returned to this country in the early hours of 15 April 2015. The three adults were arrested and remained in custody until 18 April 2015. In accordance with the orders made by Newton J, the children were placed in two separate foster placements.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The Scott Schedule is a long and detailed document.

(2) They made complex travel arrangements in an effort to conceal their intention to enter Syria. (3) They lied about their travel plans in order to conceal their intention to enter the ISIS controlled Syrian war zone. (4) They made practical arrangements prior to their departure demonstrating their intention to leave their homes permanently and enter / move to Syria. (5) None of them has provided a plausible explanation for their travel plans and arrangements. &#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority now seeks the following eight findings as set out in the final version of the Scott Schedule:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Finding 1: The [adults], or some of them, made plans and travelled to and across Turkey, with other adult family members, with the intention of entering an active war zone, namely Syria, with their respective children and so putting them at risk of physical and emotional harm.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Finding 2: The adults made complex travel and other arrangements in an effort to conceal their intention to enter Syria in the company of two other men.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Finding 3: The adults lied about their travel plans in order to conceal their intention to enter the Syrian active war zone.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Finding 4: The adults made practical arrangements prior to their departure &#8230; demonstrating their intention to leave their homes permanently and enter / move to Syria.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Finding 5: None of the adults has provided a plausible explanation for their travel plans and arrangements.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Finding 6: The planning and execution of the journeys of both groups involved, ie the Y and W/B groups, were undertaken in manners consistent with online guidance given to prospective migrants to Syria.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Finding 7: If Finding 1 is proved, the plan was ideologically driven. The absence of any explanation for making plans and travelling to and across Turkey, with other adult family members, with the intention of entering an active war zone, namely Syria, combined with the [adults&#8217;] untruthfulness about the true purpose of their journey through Turkey, makes it likely that there was an ideological motivation.</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">Finding 8: Whatever the parents&#8217; travel intentions, the journey undertaken by them, which resulted in their interception and detention, caused the children to experience emotional harm through fear and distress. In particular, if the journey was indeed an innocent holiday, such harm was avoidable, arising from reckless decision making which failed to prioritise the children&#8217;s wellbeing.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">The basis upon which those findings are sought is elaborated in the Scott Schedule, a document running to 65 pages. (References hereafter to the Scott Schedule are in the form S/2/e, where the number refers to the relevant finding sought and the letter to the particulars given in relation to that finding.)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In its final written submissions, the local authority makes clear that </p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;its case on radicalisation is largely dependent upon whether or not the court accepts its initial case that the family was in fact in the process of crossing, or about to cross the Turkish/Syrian border into Syria.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">Very significantly, however, as it seems to me, the local authority accepts that </p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Whether [the ideological influence motivating the family] was to join ISIS, or some other religious, political, or other organisation involved in the conflict in Syria, or indeed for another, ideologically driven purpose, [it] cannot say.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidential implications of this will become clearer in due course, but the key point is this. The local authority does not seek to establish, in truth, as we shall see, the local authority cannot establish, some pre-existing ideological mindset as the evidential foundation for its case that the family intended to go to Syria. It does not rely upon motive to establish intention; on the contrary, it relies upon intention to establish motive. How, then, does it seek to prove intention? That is the central issue in the case.</p>

The local authority was represented by Miss Jane Crowley QC and Miss Rhian Livesley, MY1 by Miss Jane Cross QC and Miss Alison J Woodward, MY2 by Mr Karl Rowley QC and Miss Elliw Roberts and the children by Miss Julia Cheetham QC and Miss Elizabeth Morton.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In major part the local authority&#8217;s evidence, both written and oral, came from the police. That evidence went to four broad topics: evidence as to what was found when various properties were searched; evidence of what was said by the various adults in interviews; evidence as to &#8216;tradecraft&#8217;; and evidence as to what was discovered from analysis of various mobile phones. In the course of this I watched the video recordings of parts of the interviews given by M. I heard oral evidence from (in this order) MY1, MY2 and FY2. None of M, W or B was present in court; none of them gave evidence. The hearing of the evidence concluded on 16 October 2015. Immediately following this hearing I commenced the finding of fact hearing in the related case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re X</span>, in which I handed down judgment on 16 December 2015: <span style="font-style:italic">Re X (Children) (No 3) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/3651" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 3651 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 3651 (Fam)</ref>. I had intended to hand down judgment in this case before the beginning of term on 11 January 2016. Unhappily that proved impossible because of the unavoidable diversion of a very large part of my time to having to attend to the extremely time-consuming Form E saga that had erupted unexpectedly on 16 December 2015. I am very sorry, and can only apologise for the consequential delay. </p>

Common sense, not law, requires that in deciding this question, regard should be had, to whatever extent appropriate, to inherent probabilities. If a child alleges sexual abuse by a parent, it is common sense to start with the assumption that most parents do not abuse their children. But this assumption may be swiftly dispelled by other compelling evidence of the relationship between parent and child or parent and other children. It would be absurd to suggest that the tribunal must in all cases assume that serious conduct is unlikely to have occurred. In many cases, the other evidence will show that it was all too likely.&#8221;</p>

It is not for the mother to disprove it. In particular it is not for the mother to disprove it by proving how the injuries were in fact sustained. Neither is it for the court to determine how the injuries were sustained. The court&#8217;s task is to determine whether the local authority has proved its case on the balance of probability. Where, as here, there is a degree of medical uncertainty and credible evidence of a possible alternative explanation to that contended for by the local authority, the question for the court is not &#8216;has that possible alternative explanation been proved&#8217; but rather it should ask itself, &#8216;in the light of that possible alternative explanation can the court be satisfied that the local authority has proved its case on the simple balance of probability&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

I cannot blind myself to the reality that not every parent is necessarily as steeped in the values and belief-systems of a post-Enlightenment Europe as we might like to imagine. People may be otherwise very good parents (in the sense in which society generally would use the phrase) while yet being driven by fanaticism, whether religious or political, to expose their children to what most would think to be plain, obvious and very great significant harm. There are, after all, well-attested cases of seemingly good parents exposing their children to ISIS-related materials or even taking their children to ISIS-controlled Syria.&#8221;</p>

Very shortly after W had arrived, and having spent only three nights there, the Y group (including M) left the hotel, together with W.

They got out of the taxis on a dirt road taking only some hand luggage. Shortly afterwards they were intercepted by the Turkish military authorities and taken to various military or police facilities, ending up (as contemporaneous news footage proves) at a police station and then at a hospital both in Reyhanli. According to the local authority, as its case is pleaded in the Scott Schedule, the place where they were first taken was Antakya, in a remote area of Hatay province which includes the Bab-al-Hawa crossing point into Syria [S/1/u,v].

In relation to MY1, it is said that her lies and inconsistencies, both as to events in this country and in Turkey, undermine her essential credibility and indicate knowledge of or collusion in the plan to go to Syria; her evidence, it is submitted, has been moulded to fit the evidence from FY2 and MY2. In relation to MY2, it is said that the evident nature of her relationship with FY2 makes it inconceivable that she did not know what he was planning. There is, as the local authority points out, no suggestion that she is dominated by her husband. It is said that she was untruthful about what the family did in Adana and in her denial of having access to Kik messenger. FY2 is said to be the head of the family, to have made all the arrangements both in this country and in Turkey and to have been aware of W&#8217;s travel plans. His denial of knowing either the name of the second hotel or where it was, simply beggars belief, submits the local authority, not least having regard to his intelligence, what it describes as his meticulous nature, and his obvious capacity to undertake research. He was, says the local authority, evasive in his responses in the Scott Schedule in relation to the telephone calls to W. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As Miss Crowley and Miss Livesley correctly acknowledge in their analysis of the mobile phone evidence, the data is voluminous and complicated. Much of the analysis was based upon the work of a civilian employee of the police, CW, who gave evidence and was cross-examined, on some points to good effect. Much of it is, in truth, of peripheral importance and limited significance in coming to any conclusions in relation to the core issues in the case. One part of this mass of information which is plainly of significance is the data relating to the calls made to W over the night of 30-31 March 2015 when, as now appears, he and B were travelling across Turkey from Dalaman to Adana. The local authority&#8217;s case was that between 22:28:56 on 30 March 2105 and 09:14:55 on 31 March 2015 fourteen attempted calls were made to W from a phone belonging to MY2, although in the event only five of these calls were actually put to her during cross-examination. Whatever its case earlier on, by the time it came to make its final submissions the local authority was not, as I understand it, seeking to establish that there had been any actual conversations (answers which CW had given during cross-examination by FY2 having undermined the assertion), nor, as Miss Crowley made clear, was it seeking to prove that there had been more than five calls. Reliance was also placed on three calls, attempted to be made (and in two cases, it is said, actually made) to B from the same phone at different times on 31 March 2015. The local authority&#8217;s case, in its closing submissions, is that the likely caller in each case, if not MY2, was FY2; indeed, that FY2 was the most likely caller, as the organiser of the journey and more likely than MY2 to be making contact with the others.</p>

It is, they submit, inherently improbable that she would imperil her sons unless there was some powerful ideological driver operating upon her. But, they say, none has been established and the local authority&#8217;s case as to her and her husband&#8217;s reasons for migrating to Syria is, they assert, &#8220;incoherent&#8221;. They submit that, taking all the evidence in the round, it is more plausible that this was a family holiday which went wrong rather than, as they put it, some inexplicable attempt to travel to a war zone by an exceptionally capable and loving mother.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the heart of their case, Mr Rowley and Miss Roberts comment critically upon how the local authority puts its case in relation to Finding 7. They submit that the likelihood of the parents intending to travel to Syria (as opposed to making idiosyncratic choices as to holiday location or being the dupes of taxi drivers or the other adults in the group &#8211; M, W and B) can only be assessed by reference to the evidence of motivation. But, by removing ISIS from the findings it seeks, the local authority, they say, has eliminated any meaningful context for the journey which it says the parents were undertaking: there is no ideological reason for it. MY2 and her husband are devout Muslims, but that is all. There is <span style="font-style:italic">no </span>evidence that they support ISIS or any of the other fundamentalist regimes in Syria, or for that matter elsewhere. Mr Rowley and Miss Roberts ask rhetorically, what is the nature of the ideology which the local authority identifies? The lack of coherence in the local authority&#8217;s case is exemplified, they suggest, by its reliance upon the materials recovered from the family&#8217;s computer. The notion that they simply wanted to relocate to a war zone is absurd. </p>

In conclusion, they submit that the local authority has failed to discharge the burden of proof resting upon it. It cannot, on the available evidence, present a coherent, plausible scenario for MY2 wanting to abandon her life in this country and live in Syria which is more probable than her account of a holiday which went badly awry through no fault of her own. The evidence against W and B is suspicious but leaves too many lacunae in respect of what their plans (possibly also involving M) actually were and does not support the local authority&#8217;s central contention.   </p>

The decision-making of the family which culminated in their detention by the Turkish authorities was, at worst, na&#239;ve, not reckless. They did not know they were travelling into a restricted zone, so what happened to them was not reasonably foreseeable. Moreover, and in any event, even if Finding 8 were to be made out, it would not, they submit, suffice to establish &#8216;threshold&#8217;. Many parents, they suggest, take holidays which involve decisions with outcomes which they subsequently regret, but these do not attract local authority involvement. Many Jewish families, as they point out, take their children to visit parts of Israel which may be subject to periodic attack by anti-Israel elements, but child protection proceedings are not instituted upon their return.</p>

Finding 7, they submit, when properly analysed, is based on circular reasoning. It involves three components, which they set out, leading to the inference that the journey was ideologically driven: deconstructed, however, ideological motivation is required to prove the second component (the intention to enter Syria) but the second component is required to prove ideological motivation. The local authority&#8217;s argument, fundamental to its case, is, they say, completely circular and inherently illogical.  </p>

She provided funding for the holiday but there is, they submit, no evidence that she was otherwise involved in its planning, let alone that she knew anything at all about whatever plans W and B may have had. There is no evidence of any intention on her part to relocate, and the local authority&#8217;s case that the family properties had been abandoned is neither made out nor, indeed, supported by the photographs I was shown. The photographs, they submit, show a property that is untidy, unkempt and in need of decoration, but not abandoned. Nor is there any evidence of any radical beliefs or other ideological driver for her behaviour. Just what ideology drove her to try to enter a war zone in Syria? Their submission is stark: none is asserted by the local authority and none is evidenced anywhere in the evidence or the papers. MY1&#8217;s admitted disillusionment with the particular place where she lives in this country provides no motivation, ideological or otherwise, to re-locate to Syria. MY1 admits that she lied about her holiday plans to her sister, but this was no more than a &#8216;white lie&#8217; to lessen the worry for her elderly mother. On the totality of the evidence, they submit, the most likely of all the suggested scenarios is of an innocent holiday that went horribly wrong.</p>

He submits that detailed examination of what was actually established in evidence demonstrates just how thin the local authority&#8217;s case based on &#8216;tradecraft&#8217; really is: in many important respects, he says, the family did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>follow the recommended tradecraft. He devotes much space to an analysis of the local authority&#8217;s witnesses which is critical in both senses of the word. By contrast, much of his response to the detail of the local authority&#8217;s case is general and does not condescend to particularity. He submits that, after rightly abandoning the ISIS allegation, what remains of the local authority&#8217;s case is very unreasonable at best and to a large extent nonsensical. He asserts emphatically that this was a family holiday. He denies any actual or attempted telephone contact with W before his arrival at the hotel in Adana and says that the first he knew of W&#8217;s presence in Turkey was when the hotel receptionist rang.</p>

Its significance in relation to MY1, FY2 and MY2 is at best tangential and its evidential weight negligible. (ii) <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Reason to re-locate</span>: There is no doubt that there were difficulties and animosities within the wider family and that the family saw themselves as the victims of harassment by various members of the wider family. Absent any cogent evidence of ideological motivation (and there is none), the idea that these concerns would have persuaded the family to re-locate to Syria is fanciful. (iii) <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Abandonment of the properties</span>: As Miss Cross and Miss Woodward said, the photographs show properties that are untidy, unkempt and in need of decoration. They do not, in my judgment, show properties that have been abandoned. Nor, on a fair reading of all the evidence, is abandonment of any of the properties established. (iv) <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">FY2&#8217;s car</span>: FY2 provided an innocent explanation for something which, at the end of the day, was little relied upon by the local authority. (v) <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">The notes found at MY1&#8217;s house</span>: On the local authority&#8217;s own case these are referable, and therefore it is reasonable to infer, attributable, to W and B. There is nothing beyond suspicion or surmise to link them to MY1, FY2 or MY2.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>The local authority submits that these notes are consistent with tradecraft and provide evidence that W is likely to have entered Turkey with a cover story to conceal his true intentions of entering Syria. But how does this link up with or make good a case against the family? The local authority seeks to make the link by submitting that the family was awaiting W&#8217;s arrival in Adana before continuing to Reyhanli. As I explain in paragraph 63(iii) below, W&#8217;s arrival in Adana cannot have been a coincidence; someone must have known that he would be arriving. However, even assuming that W&#8217;s intention was to travel to Syria, where is the evidence that this intention was known to anyone in the family? The local authority submits that this is an inference I can and should draw, and that, having got to this point in the analysis, I can and should find that the family (or at least some of its members) had the same intention. This, however, in my judgment, is to go further than either the evidence or the analysis justifies. Surmise or suspicion, even strong suspicion, is not enough.</p>

The content of this material, moreover, is not indicative of interest in the kind of ideology associated with al-Qaeda or ISIS.</p>

There is simply <span style="font-style:italic">no </span>evidence worth the name indicative of, let alone probative of, such a finding. There is, in my judgment, no evidence to support the assertion that these loving and devoted parents, as Miss Cheetham and Miss Morton rightly describe them (and the same, in my judgment goes for MY1), would be motivated to expose their children to the realities of life in Syria. Indeed, the local authority, as we have seen, hardly attempted to make good its case on this point except on the basis that <span style="font-style:italic">if </span>it was proved that the family intended to go to Syria then an extremist motivation could be inferred. The simple fact, as I find, is that the local authority is wholly unable to establish some pre-existing mindset as the evidential foundation for its case that the family intended to go to Syria.</p>

In my judgment, the local authority has established on a balance of probabilities, and essentially for the reasons given by Miss Crowley and Miss Livesley, that the second hotel was in Reyhanli. None of the family admits this, but it is noticeable that they do not proffer, even by way of submission, any suggestion of some other possible location. </p>

It is impossible to be more precise as to exactly <span style="font-style:italic">where</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">how near the border</span> they were when they were detained, though in the final analysis, little if anything turns on the precise answer to either question. The name of the unit which detained them is suggestive, but without more detailed information as to how the Turkish army deploys its troops no more than suggestive. The key point, in my judgment, is the admitted fact that they were detained by the Turkish authorities within what, given all the circumstances, must have been some kind of restricted even if not a prohibited border area. How close to the border that means they were is something on which it is impossible to be precise without more detailed information than I have as to how the Turkish authorities organise border security and as to the &#8216;depth&#8217; of the military zone.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>I have not overlooked the facts, strongly relied on by the local authority, that, according to information supplied by the Turkish to the United Kingdom authorities, the family was &#8220;deemed to be crossing the border illegally, providing the power of detention&#8221;, and that an official Turkish press release quoted a Turkish military source as saying that the family had been arrested &#8220;while trying to cross illegally directly from Turkey to Syria.&#8221; The difficulty, however, is that without more detailed information than I have as to the relevant Turkish arrangements, both military and legal, none of this provides a clear answer to the question of just how close to the border they were when detained.<span/><span/><span/></p>
