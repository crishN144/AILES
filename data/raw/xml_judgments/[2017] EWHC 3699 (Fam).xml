The applicant is J&#8217;s father JAL who is represented by counsel, Ms Renton. The respondent is J&#8217;s mother LSW who is represented by counsel; Ms McIlroy.  The father asks me to make an order that will mean J continues to live in England under a shared care arrangement; living 1 week with his father and then 1 week with his mother.  The mother asks me to make an order that permits her to take J to live permanently in Hong Kong with her. She proposes that J would spend time with his father each summer for up to 4 weeks in England and either one or two other holidays each year of up to 12 days in England. </p>

At about 3pm Recorder Allen made an order in the terms of the application having read the fathers statement and heard evidence from him.  Between 3.18-3.20pm the father&#8217;s solicitors made 3 calls to the mother&#8217;s phone and spoke to her twice. At that time the mother was at the Chinese Embassy obtaining emergency travel documents for J. The solicitor says she informed the mother of the order and the mother told her to speak to her legal representatives and rang off. The father&#8217;s solicitor was unable to make contact again and the parties returned to court Recorder Allen then amended his order to incorporate reading the handwritten statement of the father&#8217;s solicitor. The mother says she did not understand from the call that an order had been made which prevented her removing J. At 3.47pm the mother purchased flights for herself and J and they flew that evening.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother&#8217;s removal of J from England of course amounted to a wrongful removal for the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention and the father lost no time in making an application for J&#8217;s summary return.  The mother defended it on the basis that a return would expose J to a grave risk of harm and that he objected to returning. The application was heard and determined on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> August 2017 by the Honourable Madam Justice Au-Yeung who ordered that J be returned to the UK. The mother&#8217;s attempt to appeal did not get off the ground and on 1 September 2017 J and the mother returned to the UK.  By 14 September they were back in court when the mother confirmed that she wished to pursue an application for leave to remove J permanently from the jurisdiction and so DJ Hudd gave directions to timetable the competing applications to a 3 day final hearing. </p>

Given that a shared live with order had been agreed by the mother on 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2017 and DJ Hudd had not been invited to give any directions as to fact-finding this appeared a little unusual.

She observed that the mother was now seeking to draw the sting of the allegations which had been made in support of her Article 13b defence in Hong Kong because in maximising their impact there, the inevitable corollary was that they now presented an obstacle to the relocation application.</p>

Should the parent pursue them, recognising that if they are not proved to the level alleged, the other parent will inevitably say (and perhaps with justification) that the removing parent is so hostile to the left-behind parent that they cannot be trusted to promote contact. Unless the removing parent can substantiate the concerns to such a level that a no-contact or minimal contact order is appropriate then the pursuit of the allegations in itself may undermine the application to remove. On the other hand if they do not pursue them, having made them the left behind party will say that they were falsely made and either that illustrates that contact will be made difficult because of the removing parents hostility to the left-behind parent or that they may re-surface in the other jurisdiction as a reason for opposing or terminating contact. It creates a real potential difficulty for the judge hearing such applications in particular where the parties have not confronted the issue head-on at the directions stage and emphasises the need to consider the implications of PD12J for cases at the earliest stages.    </p>

To approach relocation cases in such a way is to fall into the &#8216;linear&#8217; approach trap which the authorities now clearly disapprove. The essential task is to weigh up two (or conceivably more) competing options as to the country in which the child should reside and the parental care framework in which the child will live. That requires a comparative evaluation of the options available.  Such evaluation may be assisted by a &#8216;balance sheet&#8217; but of course one has to be wary of then following a map without contours which of course can result in a misleading picture and the arrival at an unexpected and probably wrong end point. </p>

A significant deficiency in his case prior to the commencement of the hearing was how he proposed the mother should exist financially.  As a result of the mother having issued a divorce petition in Hong Kong the issue of the financial orders that might subsequently be made was uncertain and the father had, it seems, been advised by his HK lawyers to await proceedings there before committing himself to any package of support for the mother. Whilst from the financial remedy perspective and that of the HK lawyers this might be perfectly acceptable &#8211; indeed absolutely the right approach &#8211; it does not dovetail with the child-centred approach of the court considering the children. Ultimately parents have to elect whether to prioritise the welfare or their children in these situations which is best achieved by giving clarity and certainty to finances and housing options. If they elect to prioritise the finances &#8211; even under the cover of advice from their finance lawyers &#8211; this is likely to be counter-productive to the children&#8217;s welfare. This difficulty was very evident to Ms Sivill&#8217;s such that her conclusion was largely centred on whether a way could be found for the mother to remain in England.</p>

In evaluating a party's credibility I have regard to the totality of their evidence and how it fits in with other pieces of evidence, how consistent it is internally and with other items of evidence and whether they had a motive to lie and how they gave their evidence and the dynamic between them insofar as that may bear upon their credibility and the issues in the case.</p>

M said in evidence she had spoken to her family a lot (&#8216;every second&#8217;) to decide before this what to do and they were worried a court case in England would drag on and she would not be able to go to HK.  I am satisfied that in circumstances where she knew a court was involved and that she would be in breach of the law in some way she decided nonetheless that she was entitled to do what she thought best and so decided immediately to purchase tickets and remove J to HK. Because she had not been served it would not be susceptible to contempt but could have been the subject of criminal proceedings under the Child Abduction Act 1984. As her family paid for the flights it was clear &#8211; as she accepted in evidence &#8211; that she could have obtained accommodation and dealt with the case but she chose rather to flee. She may have felt in a very difficult position in terms of accommodation and finance but the bottom line is she knew she in breach of the law and was seeking to avoid the intervention of the UK courts and authorities. </p>

		  <p style="text-align:justify">In M&#8217;s oral evidence this position did not stand the test of cross-examination. M made clear she did not think F had changed, save to the extent he was under the spotlight of litigation and had to control himself, and that he presented just as much a risk to J as ever. She thought she would only think it was safe for J to have extensive contact when she saw medical evidence that F had addressed his problems. She said at present she thought J should only be having 3 hours or so with F on a few occasions a week (she initially said 2 but corrected herself) with no overnights. At times I wondered whether she really wanted supervision. She was asked what she would do if J said he didn&#8217;t want to go or do skype and was scared. She said she would talk to him about it and satisfy herself whether it was safe. She could not bring herself to say that she would make sure that it happened and I can only conclude that the contents of M&#8217;s recent statement are only a veneer over her true views and that in truth she believes J should have a far more limited relationship with F now and that she is not committed to maintaining a full relationship but is saying what she needs to on paper.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father is clearly a man who likes routines, structure, and tidiness. He was diagnosed with mild OCD and prescribed anti-depressant and anxiety medication. He is I think inflexible and reluctant to change course &#8211; that translates at times into a sense of his own rightness. Having heard him talk about the finances in the marriage he obviously was very much in control &#8211; and I think by and large the mother was content with this &#8211; perhaps because she is unused to financial responsibility and probably struggles to be sufficiently organised to budget. She probably did have debts which he paid off.  The fathers approach may come across as mean rather than frugal or careful. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At times of stress I accept he can lose his temper. Given his tendency to be controlled I doubt that &#8211; unless he was in a period of acute stress - it would happen frequently. The mother&#8217;s oral evidence at one stage which clearly was genuine was of him having panic attack and &#8216;losing it&#8217;. However from the way she described it sounded like a one-off &#8211; something so rare she felt she could jog his memory simply by saying to him across the court room &#8216;remember that time..&#8217;  If it was regular I don&#8217;t think she could have described it in this way. I conclude that it is far more likely that he would be stern or strict and tell J off that that he would lose his temper. At one point in her evidence the Mother described the father telling J off but described it as losing his temper. They are clearly not the same but the mother seemed to equate them in that way.  She also demonstrated him holding J&#8217;s arms but then described it as like two men wrestling although her demonstration appeared more like a parent restraining a child having a tantrum or similar.  Her language &#8211; and I don&#8217;t believe it is do with her use of English - is to describe things like this in extreme terms. A telling off is &#8216;losing his temper&#8217; or &#8216;rage&#8217;, the father making physical contact to make J do something or to stop him hitting out or taking him to his room becomes restraint, or pushing or wrestling. They are often over-dramatised accounts often rather than frank exaggerations. I say this because when put to the test or asked to more fully explain she sometimes demonstrates or expands in a way which gives a more accurate picture. However she clearly still views them as being of a very serious nature and worthy of serious concern on her part; whilst to any objective bystander they are well within the range or ordinary parental management of a child.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So the father I conclude is a stern and exacting father figure, not as attuned to his own emotions and therefore probably not to the mother or J&#8217;s. He is too focussed on routine, and activity &#8211; keeping busy.   His descriptions to professionals of J and what they did don&#8217;t bring their relationship to life although his familiarity with his sons Pokemon fascination was obviously real. They have less just chilling out and having fun. However his complete devotion and love for J were manifest both in his oral evidence but also in his communications; particularly in June 2017. He did though demonstrate some insight into his limitations when I asked him about that and seems to have reflected on what he has read and been told.  Overall I thought he was generally reliable in his evidence. There are some inconsistencies between his statements but not such as to call his overall credibility into question. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother is as Ms Sivills described almost the polar opposite. She is obviously more openly emotional. I can see that the mother may well have adopted relatively little routine or structure to her day or to J&#8217;s and that her approach was as Ms Sivills said very laissez-faire. Given that this is the absolute opposite of Father&#8217;s approach I can imagine that firstly it would have been a source of constant friction as the father wanted to follow his routines, do certain things on certain days, have tidiness and order and the mother did not want any of this. She would undoubtedly have experienced him as over-riding her and making her adopt an approach and structure she did not really want but she would go along with it for an easier life. The father rightly identified himself as pushy, salesman type which wants to get things done and get his &#8216;deal&#8217; and I believe that would be true in his dealings with Mother and with J. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">M&#8217;s unstructured approach also comes across in her evidence. Her answers in evidence very often quickly drifted off the point and went into some point she wanted to make.  Ms Sivills noted that she found it hard to get any real understanding of why she left J with the father for such lengthy periods &#8211; this I found also to be so when the mother was asked about a subject she felt uncomfortable with &#8211; by uncomfortable I mean she did not feel she had an acceptable answer and so she deflected. This was particularly obvious when she was asked about the impact on J or the father of her removal of J in June when time and again she changed the subject and gave answers largely unrelated to the topic. I don&#8217;t consider this was anything to do with interpretation for the interpreter was obviously highly effective. She was a less reliable witness in part because of her tendency to deflect but also as referred to above because of her over-dramatisation in her descriptions and in her reactions. The inconsistencies between her statements in respect of her views on contact and on the extent of abuse also show exaggeration and massaging of her position to create the required impression. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her interactions with J I am sure she would be very much a passive figure, letting J take the lead &#8211; given he is only just 8 she talks of him and his views as if he were much older &#8211; almost a teenager and I believe she is indeed a very laissez-faire mother. Her evidence suggests that with her J is the one in charge. He may also feel a sense of responsibility for her which is unfair to him. He said he would like to be grown up so he could look after her. To say she wants to implement his wish to live in Hong Kong is to give responsibility way beyond his years. That approach to a child&#8217;s views was reflected by the maternal uncle who also endorsed the idea of following what the child wanted. She is very open, spontaneous and no doubt warm and loving to J. I am sure he would experience her when she is there as warm and loving and supportive of him. In contrast J would experience his father as much more disciplinarian and stern &#8211; no doubt being the one who was always telling him off and making him do things he didn&#8217;t want to whereas with his mother he could do pretty much what he wanted.  That in itself would undoubtedly create problems on the home front; the mother feeling the father was too harsh and was suppressing J perhaps. The father feeling undermined and that the mother was spoiling J. In the middle would be J and who would he be likely to align himself with?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This would create an issue &#8211; indeed probably does in many families but mostly they muddle through with some compromises, some reflection that perhaps one is too strict the other too lax. But in this case there are other complexities both in terms of the parents and in terms of J.  The mother clearly has a tendency to seek to escape, to avoid problems. At the lowest level this would show as generally seeking to keep the father sweet with tidiness rather than telling him to chill out. However in this case there are far more extreme examples of it; most obviously with the mother&#8217;s absences from 2014-2017. As mentioned above Ms Sivills did not feel she could get a real understanding from the mother of what led to these very prolonged absences. Her explanations have a superficial quality (see that which she gave to Ms Chow, to Ms Sivills and in her statements) relating to having to leave in December 2014, to having to have medical treatment in 2015, 2016, to seeking work but they simply do not on closer examination explain this.  At Xmas 2014 I accept that the mother returned to pack and the father said don&#8217;t leave but she did &#8211; this was around J&#8217;s birthday and just before Xmas. I also accept that the father struggled to contact her and J did not have contact on Xmas Day. I understand the mother&#8217;s dilemma in one sense &#8211; she obviously had very limited means - but on the other hand I do not accept things were as bad as she paints in terms of father&#8217;s mood, temper or behaviour. She says he blew his top at some paint on the floor &#8211; if she thought his losing it was sufficient to scare J, or to put J at risk of physical harm it is inconceivable that a primary carer mother would leave her child in that situation.  Her account of 3-4 times a week rages with a physical and emotional dimension are wholly inconsistent with leaving J. The only conclusion I can reach is that her account is an exaggerated or over-dramatised version. She must have considered J would be sufficiently well cared for to leave him with the father and would not suffer physical or emotional harm. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What I find much harder to understand then is the length of time she spent away. The communications between the parties &#8211; do not have a flavour of coercion, anger or indeed contrition which would be the emotions most likely to be on display if the mother&#8217;s account was right. The father was looking to the future and opening a discussion which included reference to Singapore.  And so despite being on the face of it a devoted primary carer the Mother was able to keep herself away from J for several months. What J must have made of this is hard to gauge now. The father says he was very upset and didn&#8217;t really understand. I think that is likely to be true. He then saw the mother in HK/Singapore and then he flew back to UK and the mother stayed in HK &#8211; ostensibly she says to complete interviews &#8211; but she stayed 2 more months. She then returned which must have been an immense relief and joy for J but within a few months she again leaves &#8211; this time for an operation on a cyst and was gone 7 months. I do not accept either that she had to go to HK for that operation or that she needed to stay that long for medical reasons; as the evidence from the doctors shows. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So J&#8217;s mum disappeared from his life save for skype and the father became his primary carer.  The extent of her absence is reflected for instance in the documents from the after school club. What went through J&#8217;s mind can be imagined. I think J must have felt confused, upset, abandoned probably, rejected perhaps by his doting mother. I got the impression when the mother gave evidence of such things that she found it hard to contemplate those deeper emotions and consequences. Whilst she is very open emotionally &#8211; I was unsure how deep those ran and how sophisticated her understanding of the impact on J. In a sense her approach is rather unsophisticated. If J says he doesn&#8217;t want to do something or is scared we take it at its face-value rather than thinking about it any deeper or thinking whether that is best in the longer term. I don&#8217;t think the mother thought about the more deep-seated emotional impact her absences were likely to have on J. The reality was that J was left by his mother for the majority of a 2 year period. This must have had consequences for him in terms of his emotional development and the relationship with his mother and his father.  It also shows that by summer 2016 M was not so worried about the father F that she couldn&#8217;t leave J safely in his care albeit with support from her M. The GP report of two incidents of the father restraining J (which at worst I would characterise as rough handling). I also cannot understand why if M felt F was so abusive, controlling, abusive, explosively temperamental how she would have exposed her mother to that behaviour. </p>

That is why I believe he felt able to say to M in June 2017 she should leave it to him to explain to Social Services about their family life and that she helped him &#8211; not because he was controlling &#8211; but because he had had to take control . </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That history and the parties&#8217; personalities set up a combination which was likely to prove highly problematic. Like the introduction of reactive chemical elements to each other both Father and Mother were not compatible but the domestic situation after that 2 year history was highly combustible. J must have been either subconsciously or consciously very alive to the possibility that his mother would disappear again. I believe he would have very much wanted that not to happen and would &#8216;side&#8217; with his Mother and feel closer to her. So when an incident such as that of 10 June occurred and there was talk of separation he would have been terribly anxious. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When his Father told him to go to bed on June 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and he refused this was a spark about to ignite the powder. Having considered all the evidence about this incident but also all the other evidence about accounts given by the mother and J about the father I think that the incident was far closer to that described by the father than that of the mother. However I think that the father has minimised it to a degree. I conclude it more likely than not that the father got cross with J and pushed him with his foot &#8211; perhaps it was too hard &#8211; perhaps he ended up standing on his arm and bruising him. It was too forceful but I am satisfied it was not the &#8216;repeatedly and violently kicking&#8217; as the mother says.  A kick to the face would be likely to have caused serious injury. Probably as J got up there was further physical contact. Knowing his mother would support him he goes to her and cries about daddy kicking him &#8211; after all it was contact between a foot and him so it was a &#8216;kick&#8217; in a child&#8217;s mind. I don&#8217;t consider J to be lying &#8211; it is perception. How many children say things they don&#8217;t truly mean &#8216;I hate you&#8217; etc. The mother who is again by this time deeply unhappy and on the verge of separating anyway takes this as the final straw and the next day goes to social services. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am not sure what prompted her to make that approach. I wonder whether she had been discussing the situation with her family who she turns to and relies on?  She had of course undertaken a counselling course and the contents of that and her lengthy meditation studies in Hong Kong may have convinced her that the explanation for her predicament was that she was a victim of coercive control.  She is by this time deeply disenchanted with the father, she does see him as domineering, she has been side-lined in the care of J, perhaps she thought the bond of motherhood could never be replaced but F has done so in many ways. She doesn&#8217;t immediately leave but sees Social Services and Women&#8217;s Aid and returns home and it is only when F opens the letter and she then speaks to Women&#8217;s Aid that she is almost forced to leave by the discussions she has with Women&#8217;s Aid. </p>

She may not be deliberately planting poison but she is so open AND treats him as older than he is, that I am sure he has picked up not only her anger and distaste for the Father but also an element of anxiety or fear arising from her over-dramatisation. I did not detect obvious fear of the father in any of her evidence &#8211; frustration, sadness, anger but not fear in the classic sense. Certainly anxiety about his response and what would happen to her. There are examples of J saying things which it seems he could never have recalled from his own memory; the mother being strangulated by the  when he was a baby as he said to Ms Chow.  The mother had said it in DASH but put it many years ago which would be consistent with J being a baby), him being locked in the toilet when he was two, him being locked in a room with a snake when he was 3. These seem most likely to have been picked up from the mother and her family. As the mother said she was on the phone to her family &#8216;every second&#8217; and the social worker noted that J had possibly been exposed to adult conversations. I can well understand that as the mother left the father and moved into refuge, consulting by phone or skype with family and recounting what had happened the incident which in many families might be fairly innocuous has become magnified into something it wasn&#8217;t and J&#8217;s attitude to his father moved to one where when asked about his father he would describe him as his mother would; in terms of being afraid of him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That this is a construction is shown by how easily J readjusted when left with his father on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> June as observed by the social worker. That his relationship with the father was not characterised by harsh discipline, regular physical abuse, emotional abuse are I think amply demonstrated by the school report, the school discussion with the social worker, the after school club reports, the GP, Ms M. All show a child doing well, showing no signs of problems in the care of his father (and at times mother) , These are inconsistent with the mother&#8217;s account of the sort of atmosphere and behaviour she describes of Father towards her but most importantly as she says and most frequently towards J. I have little doubt that the mother and Father fell out over various issues &#8211; I believe that J was one of them.  I think the nature of how these relatively minor incidents can escalate is also well illustrated by the 6 September 2017 incident when J tells his mother his father has thrown him to the floor. The mother calls the police and tells them this and that J has scratches on his knees (plural) and elbows (plural). The police attend and examine J and find one tiny graze on a knee which they are not even sure is recent. I accept the Father&#8217;s account of J behaving in a silly or slightly naughty way &#8211; probably feeling empowered by what happened in HK &#8211; the Father having none of it, J losing his grip and falling over and then running to his mummy complaining about daddy where he knew he would have a sympathetic ear. </p>

I don&#8217;t think that she gave any thought to the medium to long term consequences for J either of her leaving or of removing him. I don&#8217;t think she planned the abduction in anything other than the day or two beforehand. She reacted to a situation but reacted extremely &#8211; perhaps another reflection of her not thinking through the consequences. The extreme reaction is a reflection of how she magnifies the problems.

As I have said before if she had thought J was seriously at risk she would not have left him. The weight of the evidence, in particular from the independent sources does not support the mother&#8217;s account. Yes there may have been a power imbalance, yes the father may have been the more dominant but I do not accept that coercive control was present in this relationship which the mother was able to leave and stay away for the best part of 2 years, returning on several occasions, in which she signed up (with the father&#8217;s encouragement) for a counselling course and where she present in court both generally and in her interaction and approach to the father as the mother did.  </p>

His educational needs are those to be expected save that he will no doubt benefit from ensuring his English or his Cantonese are maintained even if he is living in a country where they are not the first language. It is emotional needs which are at the forefront of this issue. As Ms Sivills says he needs to have a continuing meaningful relationship with them in order to grow up in psychological or emotional good health.  He has suffered emotionally through the absence of his mother and from his belief that his father was a figure to be feared. The separation and events in Hong Kong have added considerably to his emotional burden. As Ms Sivills identifies he doesn&#8217;t have a sibling group to share this with. His statement that he didn&#8217;t like anything about himself is worrying. If he fears his mother leaves because she doesn&#8217;t love him and his father tells him off because he is not good enough his self-esteem will suffer accordingly. Both parents need to nurture him. The difference in the parent&#8217;s styles of parenting creates a real issue. As J grows older a situation where one household and parent offers freedom and power and the other imposes strict boundaries and discipline is problematic. He is bound to come into conflict with the father who seeks to control him. Equally he is likely to walk all over his mother. Neither are good for him. Both will need to amend their styles and both may benefit from guidance. J needs to  have as much that each parent can offer him  in terms of emotional support to ensure as he grows from child to adolescent to man that his emotional development is as healthy as his physical. His emotional need to know his wider family will inevitably be limited by his location. One or other will play a role, one will not. In Hong Kong his maternal family will clearly offer more than the paternal family in England who are more remote. </p>

This possibility arises from her actions over the last 2 years. Her explanations simply don&#8217;t persuade me that her absences from J&#8217;s life were necessary.

Both parents have obviously contributed to this but in the last 2 years it is his father who has been the principal carer. J has experienced significant periods of time without his mother but less without his father. It is clear that the father has much to offer J &#8211; although that could be improved upon.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A move to Hong Kong will inevitably mean a profound change in the relationship with the father. I accept that it is now impractical to expect the father to return to Hong Kong and to seek to establish a new business there. From his description of his client base and the work involved it is clearly London and US centred and would involve giving up an established income and business to start afresh. At his age starting up afresh would not be easy. In other respects I think he could probably make a transition to life back there &#8211; he lived there for many years. There is a risk to his health though. He seems to be stable health wise since 2013 but a significant increase in stress which would accompany a return to Hong Kong and to seeking employment there might lead to a deterioration in his condition of the sort that occurred in 2013. So I don&#8217;t think that the father either could or should relocate to Hong Kong. That means if J moves to Hong Kong his relationship with his father will be one of international contact for 4 weeks in the summer and 1 or 2 x12 days at Christmas, Chinese New Year or Easter. That is a holiday relationship &#8211; which is what the mother thinks is the best relationship for J and the father to have. J would not grow up with them being part of each others lives, experiencing the daily ups and downs, developing and growing together as individuals. He will be a remote presence. Skype, whilst far better than the telephone is no substitute for presence waking up and preparing for school, at the school run, doing homework, participating in weekly activities, being a part of a community together. A remote and holiday presence is the best that can be achieved.  That will be the case if the contact proposal is realistic and can be put in place. I consider that on a practical and financial level it can be. The father&#8217;s devotion to J is such that I am sure he will move heaven and earth to maintain the relationship. He might even consider moving to Hong Kong. Flights are expensive at holidays but I think he could manage the cost or a fund could be created from the equity to enable it. The issue in this case is whether contact would endure for other reasons; I will explore that under the risks.  J will lose his relationships with his extended family although it seems they are nowhere near as deep-rooted as those with his maternal family. </p>

The absence of friendships is in part a function of her physical absence and in part a function of the rather insular style of relationship the parent had. Neither seems to draw great support from a close network of friends but rather rely on their partners.  With some attention to her English through courses or otherwise I consider she would be able to obtain employment within her field. She is intelligent and bright. She will be unhappy though and inevitably that might have some impact on J. However I believe that the risks are limited in level and consequences. Involvement in the school during her week, securing work, accessing the Chinese church and community can all help in minimising any impact.  She can gain some degree of support by her family visiting and by her returning to Hong Kong alone or with J.</p>

No order of a court can prevent or ameliorate this. I have doubts as to whether the mother would abide by an order of this court. Her track record suggests she will do what she considers best. Her oral evidence was that she would decide in the situation she then faced. Maintaining contact in the face of parental resistance is hard enough when the parents live in the same country; our own experience in these courts tells us this.

I believe the mother can co-parent with the father. Strangely they still seem at times to be capable of working together on practical issues to do with J in England. The very significant limit in the capability of the mother is her ability to truly understand the importance of J&#8217;s father to J and to meet his need to have a relationship with his father. Whilst in England that incapability is of limited impact because J will be having that relationship by order and will be thriving. The issue arises in the context of Hong Kong where that lack of capability becomes hugely significant. A return to Hong Kong will I am satisfied lead to a resurrection in full force of the mother&#8217;s concerns about the father. Whilst the mothers desire to move to Hong Kong is not motivated by a desire to end the father-son relationship a component in it is to keep J safe and to introduce a relationship that is far more limited with the express rationale that J needs to see less of his dad to be safe. That will mutate into J becoming fearful and he will not want contact and the mother will be incapable of promoting it. History will repeat itself only this time it would probably be irreversible given the father would be in England and J permanently in Hong Kong.   </p>

His texts in June, his organising Mandarin lessons and a birthday party without reference to the mother do not in my view justify the conclusion that he will marginalise the mother and impose his will.  Both parents have acted unilaterally at times. The father sometimes had to in the absence of the mother and he cannot be blamed for this. He may need to re-learn the skill of compromise and negotiation with the mother. In any event a co-parenting agreement and orders as to time would assist in ensuring co-parenting meant what it said.

I do not think the paternal aunt could provide the level of support she said but then she probably does not need to with the school wrap around care and both parents being present if J is in England.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Taking into all of those factors and trying to discern which route will best promote J&#8217;s welfare has ultimately become clear. I take into account all the undulations, valleys, and peaks from the route map. If the mother had been able to promote J&#8217;s relationship with his father the balance to be struck would be much more finely balanced. I accept she would be much happier in Hong Kong and that would have benefits for J.  She does not need to prove she will collapse for me to accept that remaining in England will have an adverse impact on J. She will be less happy certainly ion the short term and that will have consequences for J. However the weight that I must give to the probable loss of the father-son relationship is very considerable. That is a relationship of real value now and it can be improved on further. In England J can live a life with both parents and continue the stability he has recently found and as Ms Sivills has said from which he is benefiting. A way has been found to make it practical for the mother to remain and so Ms Sivills caveat has been filled. </p>

Holidays should be shared equally. The mother should be able to take J to visit Hong Kong next summer provided there have been no intervening issues over compliance with the orders. It will be a condition of the order that the father puts into effect his financial offer. </p>
