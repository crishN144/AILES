The father and H are citizens of Hong Kong. The mother is a British citizen who was born in Hong Kong. She is of Pakistani origin.

The mother does not dispute the Article 15 declaration of wrongful removal made in Hong Kong on 8 September 2021. The application for return is resisted by the mother (who is currently resident with H in England and Wales) on the grounds that a return order would expose H to physical or psychological harm or would otherwise place H in an intolerable situation (Hague Convention 1980, Article 13 (b)).</span></p>

No contact took place; the mother did not take H to the arranged sessions. The father was also ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of HK$4,500 per month. A further order for contact between the father and H was made on 24 November 2020. However, before that contact could take place, the father was informed by the mother&#8217;s solicitor in Hong Kong on 5 November 2020 that the mother had, on 26 October 2020, taken H out of the jurisdiction and travelled to the United Kingdom together with her new partner, Z. The father was told by the solicitors that the mother needed to travel urgently to the United Kingdom to visit her father who was unwell. A letter written to the father by the mother&#8217;s solicitors at this time stated that, &#8220;our client will return to Hong Kong when [the mother&#8217;s] father&#8217;s health becomes stable&#8221;.</span></p>

Rather, the court should assume the risk of harm at its highest and then, if that risk meets the test in Art13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate harm can be identified.</span></p>

She was said wrongly to have rejected it without adequate explanation and to have failed to follow the test set out in &#167;36 of Re E in her treatment of the mother's allegations. In summary, the argument was that she should have adopted the "sensible and pragmatic solution" referred to in &#167;36 of Re E and asked herself whether, if the allegations were true, there would be a grave risk within Article 13b and then, whether appropriate protective measures could be put in place to obviate this risk. That would have required evidence as to what protective steps would be possible in Lithuania, the submission went.</span></p>

That is what the judge did here. It was for the mother, who opposed the return, to substantiate the Article 13b exception (see Re E supra &#167;32) and for the court to evaluate the evidence within the confines of the summary process. Hogg J found the mother's evidence about what had happened to be inconsistent with her actions in that she had continued her relationship with the father and allowed him to have the care of E, see for example what she said in &#167;37 about the mother not having done anything to corroborate her evidence. She also put the allegations in context, bearing in mind what Mr Power had said about something good having happened in E's parenting, which she took as a demonstration that E would not be at risk if returned to Lithuania (&#167;36). The Article 13b argument had therefore not got off the ground in the judge's view. The judgment about the level of risk was a judgment which fell to be made by Hogg J and we should not overturn her judgment on it unless it was not open to her (see the important observations of the Supreme Court on this subject at &#167;35 of Re S, supra). Nothing has been said in argument to demonstrate that the view Hogg J took was not open to her; in the light of it, it was unnecessary for her to look further at the question of protective measures. She would have taken the same view even if the child had been going back to the father's care, but the Article 13b case was weakened further by the fact that the mother had ultimately agreed to return with E.</span></p>

She opposes a return order on the basis that her depression may, when aggravated by other factors, render her incapable of caring for H in Hong Kong, thereby exposing H to grave risk and/or an intolerable situation. Those other factors are detailed by Ms Renton as (i) Inadequate funds for a suitable home or living costs; (ii) The lack of family support; (iii) the need for her current partner to work long hours (iv) The likely lack of ongoing mental health support; (v) Fear of the father. In the course of the hearing, a further possible aggravating factor emerged, that is the difficulty which the mother would face in finding the funds to pay for her family, now consisting of three children including H and her partner (who is unskilled and not working in the United Kingdom) to travel to Hong Kong. The mother argues that, if these practical problems over the ability of the family to travel are not overcome, then H will be at grave risk in Hong Kong both by reason of the separation from her siblings and as a consequence of a worsening of the mother&#8217;s mental health as a result of that separation.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> Dr Ratnam gave the only live evidence at the hearing. She was extensively questioned by both counsel. She discussed the findings of her report, namely that the mother  fulfils the criteria for a diagnosis of depression and that she was depressed at the time of assessment. Dr Ratnam said that the mother reported to her that she had experienced depression first at five months gestation with H in 2018 following an incident with the father. The mother had been depressed one month postnatally but did not have access to treatment. Symptoms of depression during the pregnancy with H and postnatally had included low mood, reduced appetite and poor sleep. The mother had reported that her symptoms had improved when she established the relationship with Z in May 2020 and particularly when she came to the United Kingdom in October 2020 but had deteriorated again in September 2021 when she received court papers regarding the Hague Convention proceedings. Dr Ratnam said that the mother&#8217;s GP notes refer to the mother being low in mood in July 2021 due to her psychosocial circumstances but she was not at that time diagnosed with depression. Symptoms of depression since September 2021 had included low mood, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, reduced energy, reduced concentration, lack of enjoyment, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. Dr Ratnam considered that the mother had also fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of generalised anxiety and that the course of the anxiety appears to have followed that of her depression. Symptoms had included rumination, sweating, palpitations and shortness of breath. The mother had reported traits of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with nightmares and flashbacks of her experiences with the father but she did not report other symptoms of PTSD so did not fulfil criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. The mother also did not fulfil criteria for a diagnosis of a personality disorder.</span></p>

Whilst she gave detailed evidence about the mother&#8217;s interaction with her during the preparation of her report and its addendum, she candidly told the court that there were lacunae in the information which she had been given by and regarding the mother. In particular, she had not received the mother&#8217;s medical notes from Hong Kong despite having requested these to be sent. She could not, therefore, assess the mother&#8217;s recent depressive episode in the context of her longer-term mental health. Moreover, Dr Ratnam had not been given details by the mother or her representative about the most recent treatment which the mother has been receiving. In particular, Dr Ratnam was unaware of whether the mother had been prescribed an increased dose of the anti-depressant medication which she had been receiving (the lowest dose of Sertraline - 50mg) and whether the therapy referred to in the mother&#8217;s evidence and the skeleton argument of Mr Renton had been counselling or a therapeutic treatment such as CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy). Dr Ratnam said that, had CBT taken place, it would by now have ceased as it would have been a 6&#8211;8-week course only. Dr Ratnam said that CBT was likely to provide considerable benefit for the mother&#8217;s mental health, whether she receives the treatment in the United Kingdom or in Hong Kong, where it is available.</span></p>

However, she does not have on-going suicidal ideation&#8217;; (iv) the stress of returning to Hong Kong may make the mother&#8217;s mental health worse. However, an email from a Hong Kong lawyer which Dr Ratnam had been shown when preparing her addendum report stated that the mother will be able to access CBT through the public health system and the cost of medication will be free or nominal. There is therefore adequate care available in Hong Kong.&#8217; On the basis of that email, Dr Ratnam said that she believed that the mother would have access to appropriate treatment in Hong Kong; (vi) the mother has recently experienced instances of  suicidal ideation. However, Dr Ratnam considered that the presence of one or more of her children would act as a stabilising or restraining factor which would prevent the mother acting on any suicidal thoughts. </span></p>

Having examined all the material before the court very carefully, I consider that, if required to return H to Hong Kong, the mother will endeavour to return together not only with H but also with Z and her younger children.  The physical presence of the children in the mother&#8217;s life, as Dr Ratnam was very clear, will act as an effective break on any suicidal thoughts. Increased drug therapy and CBT (which it seems the mother has not yet undertaken) will be available in Hong Kong and are likely significantly to lessen the impact and duration of any depression although the material circumstances of her family on return may increase her stress. I shall go on to examine the aggravating factors associated with those material circumstances going forward but, as I shall explain, I am unable to conclude that the mother&#8217;s mental health on return to Hong Kong, whether aggravated or not by her material circumstances, will become so bad that H will, in turn, experience grave physical or psychological harm or will be placed in an intolerable situation.

I note that the father is in arrears of child maintenance ordered by the court in Hong Kong but the mother does not cite that as a reason for not relying on his undertakings. Other than the somewhat obscure claim that &#8216;money is a weapon that [the father] is ready to use&#8217; (see Ms Renton&#8217;s skeleton argument at [26]) the mother gives no other reason to support her claim that the father will not abide by undertakings.  I fully acknowledge that it is problematic to place reliance on undertakings which the court will have no power directly to enforce and which, indeed, have not yet been given to a court in another jurisdiction. However, in the particular circumstances of this application, I am satisfied that undertakings offered by the father may be trusted for the purposes of considering the efficacy of the protective measures. First, I consider that the father, as an officer in the Hong Kong Police, is likely to have a good understanding of the legal status of an undertaking and the consequences of breach. It is likely also that the father will be aware that his own position as a police officer may be at risk should he breach any undertaking he gives to a court. Secondly, I note that there was little, if any, emphasis in Ms Renton&#8217;s oral submissions on the unreliability of the father. Instead, her focus was very much on what the mother considers the insufficient quantum of the financial package offered by the father. I consider that the court can proceed to consider the protective measures on the basis that the father is likely to abide by any undertaking he may give both in respect of his own future conduct and by way of financial support for H and the mother.</span></p>

First, the mother argues that Z, her partner, is unskilled and would enter a difficult work environment on return to Hong Kong. The issue of Z working &#8216;long hours&#8217;, raised in Ms Renton&#8217;s skeleton argument, was not discussed in oral submissions. Consequently, the mother says that Z could not be relied upon to provide a contribution to the family income. Secondly, the father and mother do not agree as regards the mother&#8217;s entitlement to state benefits in Hong Kong. The mother says that she would not be entitled to benefits or that they would be very difficult for her to access and would be meagre. The father points out that the mother previously received comprehensive social security assistance funding amounting to HKD $9,833 per month [&#163;1,027.27]. During the course of the two-day hearing, additional documents were provided by both parties addressing this issue.</span></p>

In this application, the evidence of the parties themselves has not been tested by cross examination. However, on my evaluation of all the material before the court, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the financial package offered by the father, together with other relevant considerations which I address below, is sufficient to ensure that H would not be exposed to Article 13 (b) harm. I make that assessment for the following reasons.</span></p>

She has applied for and obtained benefits when living there in the past and there was no evidence to show that her absence from Hong Kong has led to disentitlement. Indeed, material provided by Ms Best appeared clearly to show that, as the wife of the father (which she continues to be until the divorce is finalised) she would be fully entitled to benefits. Moreover, I accept Ms Best&#8217;s submission that H is likely to have her own entitlement to benefits. Whether Z may also be entitled was not considered at the hearing.</span></p>

I fully accept that Z cannot be compelled to return to Hong Kong but I stress again the need for the court to proceed on the basis of what is likely to happen  (the &#8216;real world&#8217; scenario) and Z&#8217;s role in the life of the family going forward cannot be ignored. As I have said, it is clear that if H returns, then the mother will go with her and also that Z and the younger children will return. It has not been suggested that Z or the mother will face any immigration obstacles on return to Hong Kong or that Z or the mother (who is qualified as a teacher) cannot work legally there. I am satisfied that either the mother or Z will find work relatively easily; the assertions of the mother that Z would struggle to find unskilled work as a waiter in a city recovering from the pandemic were not supported by evidence and given the extent of the hospitality industry in Hong Kong, arguably contrary to common sense. Further, if either the mother or Z found work, the other parent would be able to remain at home to care for the children. I make that observation aware that the mother&#8217;s parents, with whom she and H used to live and who had provided informal childcare, have now settled in the United Kingdom. </span></p>

I am aware that the father is seeking to provide for H and the mother only; he is not responsible for Z and the two other children. However, I refer to my remarks above concerning the ability of Z to work and of the mother to work and/or obtain benefits. On my evaluation of the evidence, it is clear that, faced with returning to Hong Kong, the mother, Z and their advisers will work to overcome any administrative obstacles so that benefit payments can commence on or soon after the family&#8217;s arrival whilst either the mother or Z will also find work. </span></p>

The parties correctly acknowledge that such comparisons of living standards should be avoided and will rarely succeed in defeating a return order (see Hague Conference on Private International Law (HHCH) Guide to Article 13 (b) and as both counsel observe in their agreed note of the law at [8]). I have no doubt that, in the short term, for a family of five to occupy the sort of accommodation for which the father&#8217;s offer will enable them to rent will be difficult but I was not directed to any evidence to indicate that such accommodation (which, in any event, is likely soon to be superseded when benefits and work income become available) will be so poor as to expose H to an Article 13 (b) risk.</span></p>

Dr Ratnam was asked briefly about the transcript and understandably was reluctant to offer any view. There has been no cross examination of either parent regarding the conversation.

I say that for the following reasons. First, the mother&#8217;s claimed fear of the father sits uneasily with her own unambiguous evidence that, but for the pandemic, she would have returned to Hong Kong voluntarily. If she had reason to fear the father on account of his past behaviour towards her, she has not explained why she did not take steps immediately on arrival in the United Kingdom to remain here. Secondly, I am satisfied that the likelihood of domestic violence occurring in the future is significantly reduced by reason of the fact that the father and mother will be living separately, the mother in a household with her new partner, Z. I regard the incident involving drunkenness in 2019 as an isolated loss of control by the father which has not been and is, in my opinion, unlikely to be repeated. Dr Ratnam said that the mother had not discussed any allegations of domestic violence involving the father; indeed, she commented that the mother may have &#8216;exaggerated her experiences in her relationship&#8217; with the father. </span></p>

The same is the case with the mother&#8217;s claim that the father&#8217;s colleagues in the Hong Kong Police would &#8216;sneer&#8217; at her should she report to them any incident involving the father. There is nothing in the material before the court to indicate that the mother and H would be unable to access sufficient protection from the appropriate authorities or agencies in Hong Kong, including the police, should they ever need to seek it let alone evidence  that the mother faces the prospect of false arrest, as she claims, at the instigation of the father. I agree with Ms Best that the fact that the mother&#8217;s own sister in Hong Kong is a police officer will mean that the mother will be able to access police help if necessary. If the mother continues to have a subjective fear of the father, I do not consider that such fear is likely to continue in the long term or that it will significantly affect the mother&#8217;s mental health. Moreover, there is a danger in the mother&#8217;s submissions regarding the father&#8217;s conduct of moving away from the child-centred focus which should properly inform any evaluation of the evidence; whilst I have no doubt that the mother&#8217;s relationship with the father is poor there is nothing to suggest that the father presents or has ever presented any threat to H&#8217;s welfare.</span></p>

The court is not applying Article 13(b) to a purely hypothetical set of circumstances, for example H returning alone to her father in Hong Kong or the mother and H being separated forever from the other two children. In the &#8216;real world&#8217;, there may be some brief separation of the mother and H from the other family members whilst the mother complies with any return order and finds a new home in Hong Kong but I consider that the mother and Z will endeavour to make any separation as brief as possible; in the &#8216;real world&#8217; scenario, it is likely that the family will be living together within the short term.

The essence of its conclusion, as set out below, is that the wording of Article 13(b) itself restricts its scope. I would add that, sometimes, as in the Guide to Good Practice, at [25], it is suggested that this Article, as an exception to the obligation to order a child's return, is to be "applied restrictively". Sometimes, as in in re E, it is suggested that the Article is "of restricted application". These are nuanced not substantive differences because the underlying principle is the same, namely the Article has a high threshold for its application and, as a result, the scope for its application is limited. </span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">74.&#160;The approach set out in in re E, was explained as follows, at [31], in the judgment of the court delivered by Lady Hale and Lord Wilson. There is "no need" for Article 13(b) to be "narrowly construed" because, "By its very terms, it is of restricted application. The words of article 13 are quite plain and need no further elaboration or 'gloss'". </span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">75.&#160;After dealing with the burden of proof, this is further explained as follows: </span></p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be "real". It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as "grave". Although "grave" characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus, a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as "grave" while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">34 Third, the words "physical or psychological harm" are not qualified. However, they do gain colour from the alternative "or otherwise" placed "in an intolerable situation" (emphasis supplied). As was said in </span><a href="https://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed2261" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0563C1">In re D <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 AC 619" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 AC 619</ref></a><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">, at para 52, "'Intolerable' is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean 'a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate'". Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: e g, where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child."</span></p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although of course it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home. Mr Turner accepts that if the risk is serious enough to fall within article 13(b) the court is not only concerned with the child's immediate future, because the need for effective protection may persist."</span></p>

No doubt a court will look very critically at an assertion of intense anxieties not based upon objective risk; and will, among other things, ask itself whether they can be dispelled. But in in re E, it was this court's clear view that such anxieties could in principle found the defence. Thus, at para 34, it recorded, with approval, a concession by Mr Turner QC, who was counsel for the father in that case, that, if there was a grave risk that the child would be placed in an intolerable situation, "the source of it is irrelevant: e.g., where a mother's subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child".

The critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned. If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned. It matters not whether the mother's anxieties will be reasonable or unreasonable. The extent to which there will, objectively, be good cause for the mother to be anxious on return will nevertheless be relevant to the court's assessment of the mother's mental state if the child is returned</span></p>
