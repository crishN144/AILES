Mrs H was also sent a link to join the hearing remotely but did not attend. Given her clearly expressed views via the Official Solicitor, which supported the Trust&#8217;s application, it was not necessary for her to do so, and no party required her attendance.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The case was considered on the papers the following day and transferred to the Royal Courts of Justice for urgent consideration by a Tier 3 Judge. On 18 December 2023, Mrs Justice Theis made a Transparency Order (which prevents naming of the parties and individuals), a Third Party Disclosure Order and a Case Management Order directing the Trust to file and serve factual evidence by 11am on 19 December, including a detailed Care Plan and an explanation as to why the application dated 8 December had not been filed sooner. The timetable was tight because of the urgency asserted by the Trust, and a hearing was listed on 20 December 2023. </p>

An attendance note was duly filed on 19 December 2023. A statement dated 19 December 2023 from the Trust&#8217;s solicitor stated that the delay in issuing and filing the application was due to the need for input from and liaison between the psychiatric and medical teams in order to finalise the Care Plan which was approved by them on 14 December 2023 (as it transpires this was not the final approved Care Plan which was not forthcoming until 22 December 2023 and which was subsequently revised and filed as an agreed Care Plan on 3 January 2024).</p>

In the early hours of 20 December 2023, I received a position statement from leading counsel Mr Vikram Sachdeva KC, representing the Trust, which was closely followed by two further statements from Mr S, RH&#8217;s treating Consultant Urological Surgeon, and Dr L, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist and RH&#8217;s Responsible Clinician.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Shortly before the hearing, I received the Official Solicitor&#8217;s position statement which had been prepared by counsel, Mr James Berry, in which he stated that due to the Trust&#8217;s position statement having been served so late, there had been limited opportunity to consider it, and furthermore the medical records appeared incomplete with significant gaps in the medical history. There was also a further statement from Dr A, Consultant Anaesthetist, which was outstanding from the Trust.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On 20 December 2023, the Trust requested further time to file a final Care Plan. I delayed the start of the hearing to allow Dr A&#8217;s statement to be filed along with what I had hoped would be a final Care Plan, to enable both the Official Solicitor and the court to consider all the material before any oral evidence was heard. A flurry of emails ensued with various versions of a Care Plan and Dr A&#8217;s second statement. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the start of the delayed hearing, Mr Sachdeva KC apologised for the manner in which the application had been brought, the delay in filing the evidence and for what still appeared to be an inchoate Care Plan. At this point, and with the agreement of the parties, I proceeded to hear oral evidence from Dr L and Mr S, who were attending remotely and had been waiting patiently on the video platform, with the reassurance that a final Care Plan would be served imminently and before Dr A (who would speak to the Care Plan) gave oral evidence. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Sachdeva then sought permission to call a new witness, Ms C (who was a registered mental health nurse with experience of caring for RH) to speak to the anticipated Care Plan (which had still not been finalised or filed). This announcement came as a surprise to the Official Solicitor and the court, particularly as no witness statement from Ms C had been filed. With some reluctance and given what I perceived to be the urgency of the matter, I granted permission to call this witness on the basis that she was said to have had input into the Care Plan particularly around the use of physical and chemical restraint at P Hospital and in the transfer of RH to W Hospital. </p>

At this stage, I decided to adjourn the proceedings. As I have already said, the manner in which the case was presented was haphazard, if not chaotic. Whilst I accept Mr Sachdeva&#8217;s gracious and well-meaning apologies, the delay in finalising the Care Plan and producing a witness at the 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> hour resulted in me having to adjourn the hearing, direct that a complete and final Care Plan be filed and re-list the matter with the attendance of Ms C and Dr A, for a further half day to conclude the evidence. </p>

This was difficult to reconcile with the fact that the application had been clearly marked as urgent and a hearing date within 2-5 days was requested where it was said that there was a &#8216;risk of death&#8217; if the surgery was not performed urgently. </p>

The GP noted that RH had previously been under the urology team, but it had not been possible to undertake a cytoscopy due to his non compliance due to his mental health. RH missed two appointments for repeat ultrasound scans but did attend on 11 July 2022. That ultrasound scan showed severe bilateral hydronephrosis and significant post-void residual volume consistent with chronic urinary retention. </p>

He did not engage but his mother was present and was told that it was possible that there was an obstruction to the flow of urine through RH&#8217;s urinary tract and that his bladder was unable to empty which was putting pressure on his kidneys. If RH&#8217;s bladder was not decompressed or unobstructed then his kidney function would gradually decline over time and this could ultimately result in kidney failure leading to death. It was said that RH was unlikely to be a suitable candidate for dialysis given his mental health. </p>

This is not the surgery that is now proposed by the Trust, but it was scheduled to take place on 24 January 2023. It did not go ahead and there then seems to have been a very long gap (some 9 &#189; months) before RH&#8217;s case was discussed again on 13 November 2023 at a multidisciplinary team (&#8216;MDT&#8217;) meeting. In attendance were the surgical, psychiatric and anaesthetic consultants, Mr S, Dr L, and Dr A respectively. The outcome of the MDT meeting was that RH should be admitted as a day case on 5 December 2023 to W Hospital for urological surgery, specifically a cystoscopy +/- bladder neck incision and urethral dilatation +/- insertion of a long-term in-dwelling catheter. The minutes of that meeting record that all in attendance were in agreement and that an application to court was not necessary.</p>

The procedure now proposed includes the insertion of a telescopic camera to examine the bladder under GA and X-ray examination of the kidneys with contrast. If RH is found to have a bladder neck stricture or a urethral stricture, this will be treated by way of a minimally invasive procedure (an incision). There may need to be a catheter inserted but this would be for about 24 hours and sedation would be administered if necessary to prevent RH from forcibly removing it. If there is no clear and treatable cause for the urinary retention, the MDT will discuss the findings and reconsider what options for treatment can be offered and what is in RH&#8217;s best interests.</p>

RH had suffered a traumatic experience at W Hospital some years ago having been admitted there for a procedure; he was kept waiting for many hours which resulted in him becoming distressed, aggressive and non compliant. Dr L stated that RH&#8217;s schizophrenia was treatment resistant then, making it difficult for him to cope, whereas now his mental health has significantly improved due to a new medication regime and as such, he is likely to cope better.</p>

Dr L and the psychiatric team agree with the Trust&#8217;s plan and that the treatment is in RH&#8217;s best interests.</p>

There is a &lt;5 % risk of infection and bleeding, &lt;1% risk of thromboembolism, 70% risk of retrograde ejaculation and subsequent inability to conceive through sexual intercourse. Longer term risks include the need to pass larger amounts of urine so RH will have to increase his oral intake of fluids to prevent dehydration. A temporary catheter may be needed for 24 hours but this will be avoided if possible due to the possibility of RH pulling out the catheter which could lead to further complications and injury. Mr S said this treatment, even with these risks, would be in RH&#8217;s best interests since it would prevent kidney failure and reduced life expectancy. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although RH has repeatedly expressed a firm wish not to undergo any procedure, this wish can only be given limited weight in light of Dr L&#8217;s evidence that it is underpinned by a delusional belief. The option of &#8216;no treatment&#8217; which accords with RH&#8217;s wishes, would mean losing an opportunity to undertake a simple procedure to relieve the blockage, or at the very least, provide diagnostic information. Worse still, on the evidence currently available, &#8216;no treatment&#8217; would mean that RH&#8217;s kidney function would deteriorate, and his life expectancy would be significantly reduced.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I have taken into account the risks, pros and cons of the treatment proposed, including pain, bleeding and discomfort, and the possibility of a catheter being required for a short time post-operatively, which may necessitate the use of additional sedative medication or restraint to prevent RH from removing it. The benefits are clear in that if there is an obvious blockage which can be relieved by a small incision, this will prevent urinary retention and kidney function will improve, avoiding kidney failure and premature death; this is overwhelmingly in RH&#8217;s best interests. If the cause of the blockage is not readily apparent, the procedure will have nonetheless been diagnostically beneficial and will allow the clinical teams at both hospitals to reconsider the available options.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I accept that some degree of restraint is likely to be required in circumstances where RH is refusing the procedure and has paranoid delusions that his kidneys are going to be removed against his wishes. However, it is in RH&#8217;s best interests to use restraint if necessary and as a last resort, to ensure that he arrives at the hospital, undergoes the procedure, and complies with the post-operative recovery requirements for the same reason that the procedure itself is in his best interests.</p>

These are undoubtedly very significant interferences in RH&#8217;s rights but are entirely necessary and proportionate because without the option of using restraint, RH is likely to be non-compliant and the treatment could not not be safely delivered. The orders I shall make in this regard are permissive and it is clear that the Trust&#8217;s approach, endorsed by the Official Solicitor, is to use the least restrictive measures in a stepped manner, as set out in the Care Plan.</p>

He has been enjoying more frequent visits outside of the hospital including overnight stays with his mother, permissible under s17 of the MHA. It was clear from their oral evidence that the psychiatric team consider that RH has now achieved a better of quality of life, is likely to cope better and that the outcome of the proposed treatment will allow RH to resume a quality of life which he would consider worthwhile: <span style="font-style:italic">Aintree </span>at [44].</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I am grateful to both counsel for their assistance and focussed submissions. I recognise the considerable efforts made by the Official Solicitor in conducting her investigations and making arrangements to meet with RH at very short notice. I am grateful to Mr Sachdeva for his unreserved apology to the court for the failure of the Trust to comply with the directions and order of Theis J. However, as I observed above, the Trust brought this application in a frenzied and unhelpful manner. This impacted on the court&#8217;s ability to determine the case and the Official Solicitor&#8217;s ability to present her position as litigation friend to RH, which ultimately necessitated an adjournment. The parties have agreed an order for consequential directions which I have approved in the expectation that those will be complied with.</p>
