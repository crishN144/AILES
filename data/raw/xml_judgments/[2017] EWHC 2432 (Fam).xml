JP is currently the subject of a full care order in favour of Northumberland County Council and his placement (pursuant to that order) has been the subject of three hearings in the course of the last 10 days prior to today: one hearing before the Justices, and two before Her Honour Judge&#160;Moir.</span></p>

JP has lived for most of his life in Blyth.  He has had a disrupted childhood, experiencing trauma and adversity, and for many years was placed away from his parents but with family members.  He had a disrupted education and his family were unable to manage his disruptive behaviours and keep him safe.  He was ultimately placed in foster care in December 2013, but that placement broke down in September 2014 due to his absconding.  Care proceedings were issued and JP and his siblings were made the subject of interim care orders in May 2016; that was converted into a full care order in respect of JP.  </span></p>

The only offer of a placement came from Bracken School (pseudonym), a residential school in Scotland, which specialises in the care and education of children with challenging behaviour.  </span></p>

That application came before Her Honour Judge Moir on 16 June and, at that point, JP was clear that he did </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">not</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> consent to moving to Scotland, a prerequisite of the Court&#8217;s ability to make an order under that statutory provision.  The judge adjourned the case to Monday of this week, by which time JP had indicated that he would after all agree to the placement, and in the circumstances an order was made on 19 June authorising the authority to place JP at Bracken School in Scotland.  It was recorded on the face of the order (so far as I can tell &#8211; I have only a draft in front of me), that JP consented to being in Scotland for a period of two months only; the Guardian herself supported the placement at Bracken School, and although the mother, who had not attended the hearing, did not agree to the making of that order, Judge Moir dispensed with her agreement.  Judge Moir had concluded that it was in JP&#8217;s best interests that he be in residential care in Scotland.  </span></p>

Bracken School is not secure accommodation in that it is not &#8216;accommodation&#8230;provided for the purpose of restricting liberty&#8217;.  It is, as I have earlier described it, a residential school for children who present with challenging behaviour, and it follows, argues Ms Wood, that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Section 25</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> does not apply, even though it is fair to observe, that JP&#8217;s behaviours over many years, and particularly latterly, appear to me on the material that I have seen to fall within the category of behaviours contemplated by </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Section 25(1)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.

He very quickly expressed his wish to return to live back again in his home area, and has texted and telephoned Mr Kincaid, indicating he wants to be away from Scotland.  He has broken property there.  He has run away.  He told Mr Kincaid he needed to get out, he did not want to be there, and that he was very upset by being there.  Mr Kincaid alerted the Local&#160;Authority to this position on Wednesday evening, and when the matter was brought to my attention yesterday (Thursday), I called the case to be immediately listed before me this morning (Friday).</span></p>

Inevitably, it seems to me that JP will take time to settle wherever he is.  The critical question in this case at this time is whether he will in fact, in time, settle at Bracken School.</span></p>

Judge Moir thought it was.  I, for my part, raise a question over whether or not a placement such as this represents an arrangement for a child &#8216;to live&#8217; outside England and Wales, as when one looks more carefully in the language of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Schedule&#160;2 paragraph 19</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, there is a clear inference to be drawn that the giving of consent is a once and for all event.  &#8216;Has consented&#8217; is the phrase used, not &#8216;does consent&#8217;, an enduring state of affairs; the phrase used is more pertinent to a permanent arrangement &#8216;to live&#8217; outside England than a temporary one for interim placement, in this particular instance, in a school for children with challenging behaviours.  </span></p>

She seeks leave to invoke the jurisdiction because the result which she wishes to achieve for her Authority (placement in a residential school out of the jurisdiction, involving some deprivation of liberty) cannot be achieved through the making of any order other than by the Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction, and there is reasonable cause to believe that if the inherent jurisdiction is not exercised, the child is likely to suffer significant harm.

In that decision, Keehan J exercised the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction in respect of a child who was the subject of an interim care order, which will have the effect of authorising the deprivation of that child&#8217;s liberty.  I am satisfied that subject to the provisions of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Section 100(4)(b)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, I have jurisdiction to make the order sought, but the question is: should I do so?</span></p>

He does not wish to be so far from home.  He </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">wishes</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and, it may well reasonably be concluded, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">needs</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> to have a&#160;regular relationship with his mother and members of his family, which is not altogether easy if he is placed in a unit remote from public transport, three and a half hours&#8217; drive from Blyth.  I record the mother&#8217;s opposition to a placement so far away.  She wishes the facility for regular visits to JP, for reasons I well understand, and she aspires ultimately to his rehabilitation to her care.  </span></p>

As I earlier indicated, in my judgment, he appears to satisfy the criteria in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Section 25</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, though the Authority does not seek at this stage an order permitting the placement of JP in a unit which is designed for the purposes of restricting liberty.  I bear very much in mind that the sort of unit in which JP is currently placed is a rare one, and placements in such units are extraordinarily difficult to come by, as the history of this particular case bears out.</span></p>

I accept the assurance of the Authority that it will facilitate contact between JP and his mother daily by phone and monthly, at least, by direct contact, though I for my part would hope, or may I even say expect, that this should be more regular in order to give due reassurance to JP that his family continue to support him, and that he has not been moved out of the jurisdiction and away from his home area and forgotten.  This approach has been key to the success of placement in the past.</span></p>

Much depends on JP&#8217;s willingness and ability to cooperate with the regime which is imposed for him at Bracken School.  I am satisfied that the result which this Authority wishes to achieve cannot be achieved other than by the making of an order under the Court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction, authorising the placement of JP out of this jurisdiction in a residential unit at Bracken School, with deprivation of his liberty, and there is, in the material which I have rehearsed and reviewed, and in the documents which have been presented to me, ample course to believe that if this jurisdiction is not exercised with respect to JP, he is likely to suffer significant harm.</span></p>
