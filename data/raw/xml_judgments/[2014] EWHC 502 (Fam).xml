	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a claim by a husband for financial provision upon divorce.   Shortly before the marriage, the parties entered into a &#8220;Pre-marital agreement&#8221;. The husband agreed that he would not make any claim either during or after the marriage in relation to the wife&#8217;s separate property or to gifts made or to be made to her by her &#8220;wealthy family&#8221;.   That agreement was effectively repeated and reinforced by two &#8220;Supplemental agreements&#8221; made during the course of the marriage on the occasions of the wife&#8217;s parents or father making substantial further gifts to her.   If the pre-marital agreement had not been made, the marriage would not have taken place.   If the supplemental agreements had not been made, the parents/father would not have made the further gifts to the wife.   There is no doubt that by making his present claim the husband is acting in breach of what he had earlier agreed to, upon which not only the wife but each of her parents had relied.   The core issue in this case is how much weight should now be accorded to those agreements, and whether they should have the effect that the husband&#8217;s claims should be dismissed.   The law on this topic is not difficult to state.   But it requires a discretionary decision by the court which is, in my view, and on the facts on this case, an exceptionally difficult one.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Subparagraph (a) of that rule does not apply.   In my view the effect of rule 27.10(1), read with subparagraph with (b), is as follows.   It provides a starting point, or default position, that in the absence of the court directing otherwise, proceedings for a financial remedy after divorce will be held in private, with &#8220;duly accredited representatives of news gathering and reporting organisations&#8221; normally being permitted to be present pursuant to rule 27.11, but not ordinary members of the public.   In my view rule 27.10 does not contain any presumption that financial remedy proceedings should be heard in private &#8211; it is no more than a starting point &#8211; and the question whether a given case should or should not be is entirely in the discretion of the court.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case began in court at 2.00 pm.   At 10.49 am that day my clerk had sent to all counsels&#8217; clerks an email message which said &#8220;Mr Justice Holman may order that all or part of the hearing in this case will be heard in public pursuant to FPR rule 27.10(1)(b) and all counsel are accordingly requested to attend in robes.&#8221;   The effect of that message was to give to all counsel over three hours&#8217; notice that I may make such a direction.   They clearly had ample opportunity to consider the position and take instructions from their respective clients and instructing solicitors, and to prepare any submissions to the effect that I should or should not give a direction under subparagraph (b).   At the outset of the hearing itself I indicated that it was my provisional position that I should give such a direction.  I enquired whether either party opposed that course and invited the two leading counsel to make any submissions they wished.   Neither of them stated that there was any resistance to a hearing in public or that they wished to make any submissions.   Further, at no stage at the outset of, nor during the course of, the hearing has there been any application for a reporting restriction order, subject only to not naming the three children as I have directed.   As a result, the entire hearing has indeed taken place in public (as is the handing down of this judgment).   Some journalists have been present intermittently during the hearing and a very small number of people have sat at the back of the court room from time to time, whom I believe to have been members of the public.   I am aware that the case has received publicity in the national press in print and on line.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reasons why I formed that provisional view, and later (without opposition) directed that I would sit in public were, briefly, as follows.   The principle that courts normally sit in public underpins the rule of law in a free and democratic society.   Historically, courts sitting at first instance to hear financial cases after divorce have almost always sat in private.   But there has recently been a strong shift towards greater transparency.   That is evidenced by, amongst other sources, FPR rule 27.11 to which I have referred, and by the very recent Practice Guidance on Transparency in the family courts; Publication of Judgments, issued by the President of the Family Division on 16 January 2014 and coming into effect on 3 February 2014 (before the start of the hearing in this case).   At paragraph 2 of his Practice Guidance the President states &#8220;&#8230; there is a need for greater transparency in order to improve public understanding of the court process and confidence in the court system &#8230;&#8221;   Whilst greater publication of judgments will make for greater transparency, publication of the judgment alone suffers from the limitation, or even defect, that the public can only read what the judge chooses to say.   It is only if the public are able to see and hear for themselves how the proceedings unfold in the court room, what the oral evidence and arguments actually are, and indeed how the judge comports himself, that there is true transparency, open justice and public accountability.   Jeremy Bentham famously said &#8220;Publicity is the very soul of justice.   It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity.   It keeps the judge himself, while trying, under trial.&#8221;   Mere publication of a judgment does not achieve that.   It is curious, to say the least, that precisely the same financial case may be conducted under full public gaze on appeal and yet in private at first instance.   It is true that it is normally only at first instance that witnesses have to give oral evidence, but as witnesses have to give evidence publicly in most other situations, including often in intimate detail as to their sexual lives or their financial affairs, it is not obvious why they should be treated with greater protection in a financial remedy case.   Those are general considerations.   (Protection of commercially sensitive or other confidential information of third parties is another consideration which, however, does not arise in this case.)   In the present case there was the particular consideration that the core issue which I have already identified is one of considerable and legitimate current public interest.   The Law Commission was, as I understood, about to publish its report on the topic of prenuptial agreements, and in order that the public can have an informed debate on a topic of considerable public interest they need to be able to see how, under the present law, courts resolve these cases on a case specific basis. [I here interpose that the Law Commission did in fact publish their report on 27 February 2014, the day before this judgment is handed down. I had already fully prepared this judgment by then. I have not seen the report, and its contents do not impact in any way whatsoever upon the judgment or my decisions, which are based upon the law as it currently is.]   For those reasons, and taking into account the lack of any opposition by either party or their advocates, I directed the public hearing.   I am glad that I did so, and there was not one moment during the hearing when I regretted having done so, despite what I am about to say in paragraph 6 below.   The outcome of this case is likely to be controversial with some polarised public reactions to it.   Everything has been done openly.   Nothing has been done secretly. </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The evidence and argument in this case lasted 6&#189; long days in the court room.   Although there were some flashes of humour it has been an exceptionally bitter hearing which was very painful to behold.   The two sides are now very entrenched indeed.   Many hurtful things have been said.   Caught in the cross fire are three adored, innocent but vulnerable children.   Further, the financial remedy proceedings have already cost some &#163;550,000 and rising, and other aspects of the overall litigation have cost a further &#163;107,000 with more to come.   It did not have to be like this.   The husband now has no assets at all, and net debts, including all he owes in costs, of about &#163;226,000.   The wife is property rich.   She owns unencumbered the house where she lives which is worth, net of costs of sale, about &#163;6,740,000.   But she now has no free assets, and her debts, inclusive of costs, will now also begin to exceed her only other assets apart from her home.   Neither spouse has any significant income.   But the wife has, as described in the pre-marital agreement, &#8220;wealthy&#8221; parents.   Although certain figures were bandied about as to the wealth of the wife&#8217;s father in particular, I have no idea at all of the scale of the wealth of either of them and it is none of my business.   But between them her parents currently voluntarily fund allowances for the wife and children totalling about &#163;80,000 per annum and all the school fees.   There is not the slightest suggestion that they, and in particular her father, cannot afford to do so.   By an open letter dated 29 May 2013 the wife&#8217;s solicitors made an open offer that included raising a mortgage of &#163;850,000 upon her current home, to be guaranteed and funded by her father.     With this she offered to purchase a home for the husband until the children had all left school or, if earlier, attained the age of 18.   That proposal was rejected, apparently out of hand, when the husband, by his solicitors&#8217; open letter of 21 June 2013, asked for almost double that amount and for a significant part of it to be paid outright.   Now the primary open position of the wife is not to offer a penny.   There is not the slightest suggestion that her father could not easily have afforded the proposal that was made on 29 May 2013 or, indeed, more.   I wish to stress with the utmost clarity that neither the wife&#8217;s father nor her mother are under the slightest legal obligation whatsoever to pay a single penny to, or for, their daughter, nor their grandchildren, nor, still less, their son-in-law.   It was, in my view, very unwise and misjudged that the husband&#8217;s solicitors wrote on 21 June 2013, presumably on their client&#8217;s instructions, that &#8220;&#8230;. her parents will, inevitably, be prepared to assist her to meet her obligations to my client&#8221; and then asked for considerably more than her father had already, voluntarily and with some generosity, effectively offered to fund.   (It was, of course, irrelevant to the husband whether the offered &#163;850,000 was funded by a mortgage paid by the father or a cheque written by the father.)   But the tragic fact is that there was scope for a negotiated settlement last summer, assisted by the generosity of the father, and that has now all been lost.   At the outset of, and repeatedly during, the hearing I urged settlement and provided a number of breaks and adjournments for the purpose.   I do not know what may have been discussed outside the court room.   But alas there has been no settlement and the wife&#8217;s primary open position remains that there is not a penny on the table.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Family Procedure Rules 2010 provide for a family dispute resolution hearing or FDR.   During April 2013 the solicitors agreed that a one hour hearing that had been fixed before a district judge on 1 May 2013 for another purpose should be rescheduled and utilised as that FDR.   That seems to me to have been a tragic mistake.   In my experience an FDR can be highly effective at promoting settlement and avoiding much costs and bitterness.   But a case like this, which was obviously going to be heard at the level of the High Court, requires much longer than one hour and, with no disrespect to the district judge, requires to be listed before a High Court judge.   No one can ever know, but I venture to speculate that if there had been an FDR with a full clear day allowed, before one of the High Court judges experienced in financial cases, and with the wife&#8217;s father present and made welcome, the framework for a settlement which was later suggested in the letter of 29 May 2013 could have been discussed and refined, the figures and terms adjusted, and a settlement could have resulted.   This is a case which never needed to come to court and  which was eminently capable of settlement.   I stress that apart from the two open letters I have no idea what the respective negotiating positions may have been or may indeed still be.   But, objectively, this terrible conflict was as avoidable as it has been destructive.</p>

Their son, Adam Luckwell, is now aged nearly 40.   He is not married and has no children although he is currently engaged.   Victoria was born in July 1976 and is now aged 37.   Sadly, the marriage between Mike and Mary had ended in divorce in 1997 when Victoria was about 20.   Although they sat next to each other throughout the hearing, I understand that Mike and Mary normally rarely meet or communicate and that when they do have to communicate their relationship is more one of civility than of friendship.   I understand that the wealth of Mary, who now has property developments, derived originally from Mike.   It is clear that Mike, whom Victoria described as a self-made man, has been, and remains, a successful business man in the film, advertising or media and now other fields.   As already stated, I have no idea as to the scale of his wealth, but there has been no attempt to disguise that he is a wealthy man.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Frankie was born in February 1969 and is now aged 45.   He was long ago briefly married and divorced, with no children from that union.   In 2004 Frankie was working in the post production and visual effects industry.   Coincidentally, he was employed by a company, MPC, which had originally been established by Mike although, as I understand, Mike had sold it before Frankie began working for it.   Frankie owned a flat in Eastlake House, London NW8.   It had a mortgage and the equity was later stated in the  pre-marital agreement to be about &#163;50,000, before costs of sale, although in the event it later only yielded &#163;30,000 net on sale.   In summer 2004 Victoria and Frankie began to live together.   Over the next few months they actually lived or stayed at Eastlake House, then in the basement flat of Mike&#8217;s then home, then at a flat owned by Mary in Abercorn Place.   Elm Row and Eastlake House were both rented out.   In February 2005 Victoria and Frankie became engaged, and in March 2005 Victoria became pregnant.   In April 2005 Victoria ceased work and she has never since been in paid employment.   The wedding date was advanced due to the pregnancy and set for 23 July 2005.</p>

Recital L to the PMA states as follows: &#8220;Victoria and Francesco each specifically acknowledges and agrees that the marriage would not be taking place without this Agreement having been negotiated and signed by each of them.&#8221;   Each of Victoria and Frankie expressly agreed during their evidence that that was a true and accurate proposition.

At the time he had every intention of abiding by the agreement, although he did not imagine that they would ever actually separate or divorce.   During the course of his oral evidence Mike said that even when Frankie signed the PMA (and the later Supplemental Agreements) he was &#8220;lying&#8221; because he did not intend, even at the time, to be bound by them.

The agreement accordingly expressly contemplated that there would be at least one child.   The agreement clearly referred to, and identified, &#8220;Victoria&#8217;s separate property&#8221; and &#8220;Francesco&#8217;s separate property&#8221; and recorded, correctly, that each had acquired all his/her separate property independently of, and without contribution from, the other (recital C).   Victoria&#8217;s separate property included Elm Row, stated to be worth about &#163;750,000 and mortgage free.   Frankie&#8217;s separate property was the equity in  Eastlake House, stated to be &#163;50,000 before costs of sale.   He had &#8220;no significant cash or other assets or debts.&#8221;   It was stated that Victoria has &#8220;substantial inheritance prospects from parents&#8221; and that Francesco has &#8220;some inheritance prospects on the death of his parents.&#8221;   Francesco had &#8220;just joined the pension of MPC but only two months ago.&#8221;</p>

Although Frankie did not believe that would occur, he can have been under no doubt or illusion that in the event of separation and divorce the agreement was still intended to govern.   The agreement was patently targeted at least as much upon possible separation or divorce as upon regulating affairs during the subsistence of cohabitation and the marriage.   Victoria knew from recital K that the agreement could be &#8220;overridden&#8221; by the court in certain jurisdictions and will unquestionably have been advised that England and Wales is one of them.</p>

This carries no weight with me.   First, there is no indication in the agreement as to how a &#8220;review&#8221; would be conducted or by what principles it would be guided.   Second, by July 2010 (when 5 years had elapsed) there had been many stresses in the marriage and it is fanciful to suppose that around that time Victoria would have countenanced any relaxing of the terms.   Third, the fact of the first and second Supplemental Agreements in 2006 and 2008, to which I refer below, effectively superseded some separate &#8220;review&#8221;, at any rate for five years from the date of the second Supplemental Agreement.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The PMA having been signed, the marriage duly took place on 23 July 2005.   At that time Frankie was working for MPC and earning just under &#163;50,000 gross per annum.   The day before the marriage the purchase of the flat at Westbourne Terrace was completed.   Victoria, assisted by her father, provided all the down payment.   During August 2005 Mike made a further payment to Frankie of &#163;18,624.   The circumstances in which that payment was requested (or Mike would say, demanded) and precisely what it was intended for, and how it was spent, are much disputed, although the email from Mike to Frankie dated 22 August 2005, now at bundle B/F3, seems to give a very clear contemporary account of how it was calculated.   (It was a balancing figure so that the amounts paid by Victoria or her family and the final amount of the mortgage (&#163;190,000) upon which Frankie was to pay the interest were equal).   I do not intend to go further into this issue.   Over eight years later it is, frankly, a footnote to the case, and the sum in question is now insignificant in the context of this case.   In any event, the agreed revised asset schedule dated &#8220;18.02.14&#8221; clearly credits that sum back to Victoria out of the net proceeds of sale of Westbourne Terrace which is currently on the market.   Whether she accounts for it to her father is between the two of them.</p>

By June 2006 Mike and Mary generously agreed to provide more money for the purchase of a house at Avonmore Road, London W14.   The entire purchase cost of about &#163;1 million (with associated legal costs) was paid as to &#163;750,000 by Mike and &#163;250,000 by Mary.   I am sure that Mike, if not Mary, would not have agreed to fund the purchase unless the parties had already agreed to sign the first of two &#8220;Supplemental Agreements&#8221; (the FSA).

Recital B refers to the PMA and continues &#8220;&#8230; this agreement is intended to be read in conjunction with and be supplemental to that agreement.&#8221;   Clause 1 makes reference to the expressions &#8220;Victoria&#8217;s separate property&#8221; and &#8220;Victoria&#8217;s family gifts&#8221; which had been defined in the PMA.   That is why, in paragraph 1 above, I have described the FSA as effectively repeating and reinforcing the PMA.   Recital D refers to the intended purchase of Avonmore Road and that &#8220;the entire purchase price and related costs have been met by Victoria using monies gifted to her by her parents.&#8221;   There are similar recitals with regard to legal advice, capacity and understanding as in the PMA, and a repetition at recital J of recital K to the PMA.   Clause 1 of the agreement states that &#8220;Avonmore Road shall be treated as Victoria&#8217;s separate property and shall be treated in the same way as Victoria&#8217;s separate property and Victoria&#8217;s family gifts as provided for by clauses 3 &#8211; 5 of the pre-marital agreement.&#8221;</p>

Soon afterwards Mike offered to Victoria (not to Frankie) that he would give the house to Victoria.   But unquestionably this was a gift on terms and conditions.   I am quite clear that by now Mike had low regard for Frankie and did not trust him an inch.   He clearly regarded him as lazy and workshy.   Even before the marriage, he had been told (whether or not accurately) that Frankie had had a number of girlfriends who were rich or were the daughters of very rich parents.   He had always regarded Frankie as a gold-digger who had married for money and from whom Victoria&#8217;s money and the assets he now proposed to give Victoria had to be utterly protected.

He said it was not recorded in writing but she made the promise and he trusted her.   The reason why he required the promise is clear.   He wrote, and his oral evidence was to the same effect:   &#8220;I knew that the Pre-Marital agreement and the Supplemental Agreements were not absolutely binding but I trusted that Victoria would stick to her promise not to sell or charge the property without my agreement.&#8221;   Mike was afraid that, even without divorce or separation, Frankie might pressurise Victoria into raising a mortgage on Connaught Square, or even into selling it, so as to generate cash which he, or they, might fritter, thereby debasing the patrimony.   He considered that a promise given by Victoria to him would ring fence (my phrase, not his) Connaught Square and strengthen and protect her from any pressures from Frankie.</p>

During his oral evidence, however, Frankie himself admitted that Victoria had told him about the promise.   Further, it is quite clear from the informal notes that the father&#8217;s property solicitor, Mr Simon Mapstone of Goodman Derrick, made on a file, and from the oral evidence of Mr Mapstone, that conditions to this effect were under very active consideration before the transfer.   His notes record a telephone conversation between himself, Nik Gollings (Mike&#8217;s accountant) and Mike Luckwell on 25 March 2008.   Mike [had] agreed with Victoria no sale, no mortgage, no collateral.   However, as the notes evidence, there would be no charge or restriction  recorded on the Land Register because this would amount to a &#8220;gift with reservation&#8221; and make the whole of Connaught Square vulnerable to Inheritance Tax on the death of Mr Luckwell.   As a result it was decided that Mike would require and rely upon an oral promise alone from Victoria.   Mr Mapstone said in his oral evidence that a week or so <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">before</span> the actual transfer Victoria told him &#8220;I assume you know my father has made me promise not to mortgage it, or sell it or use it as collateral for any form of debt.&#8221; </p>

Further, that if it was legally binding it would have just the same effect upon IHT as if it had been a written promise or entered as a charge upon the Land Register.   However the legal status of the promise is irrelevant, as is the correct application of tax law to these events.   The promise most certainly does not in any way bind this court or fetter my powers.   The relevance of the promise is that it is part of the context of Mike&#8217;s threat to stop all allowances and school fees to which I refer later.</p>

She did not know (and I understand still does not know) the extent of provision that her father had made to Adam, nor the value of any assets he had given to Adam.   Mike did his own calculations as to levelling up and made his own decision as to the value of the assets he had transferred, which ranged from cash, forgiveness of a loan to Adam, shares to Adam and the property purchases or transfer made for or to Victoria.   It is clear that in financial matters such as this Victoria just did as she was told, and that she accepted, with little or no question, figures proffered by her father.   There was much cross examination of both Victoria and Mike about levelling up and the figures, and, most particularly, whether the &#163;2 million had anything to do with levelling up at all.   Victoria was very unclear whether the &#163;2 million was anything to do with levelling up.   She thought she had just decided to give it to her father.   Mike was adamant that it was calculated as part of levelling up.</p>

On his return he made a statement dated 17 February 2014 and gave oral evidence the next day.   As a result of that statement and evidence, and the attached contemporary email dated 21 January 2008 and the spreadsheet that was attached to the email, I am quite satisfied that the figure of &#163;2 million did indeed emerge as part of the calculation of levelling up.   The email (to Mike) said &#8220;&#8230; we factored in Avonmore being worth circa &#163;1.5 net of sale costs.   These funds would be paid over to you along with the Elm Row proceeds and after off setting your other gifts would equate to you giving approx &#163;1 million to both AL and VL.&#8221;   The spreadsheet clearly shows those sums being payable by Victoria to Mike to create levelling up between herself and Adam and each having then received about &#163;1 million net from him.   It is important to note that that email and the spreadsheet date from 21 January 2008.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Of course in relation to the &#163;2 million, levelling up could have been achieved by Victoria paying a further &#163;1 million to Adam rather than &#163;2 million to her father.  If, therefore, it was merely levelling up, why was &#163;2 million paid to her father rather than &#163;1 million to Adam?   Both Victoria and Mike were pressed very strongly about this.   Mr Marks stressed that in the summary of Victoria&#8217;s assets in the appendix to the SSA the words are that Victoria <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">intends to make</span> a gift of approximately &#163;600,000 to Adam, but only that she <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">may</span> make a further gift of &#163;2 million to her father.   Victoria&#8217;s own evidence under cross examination (in the absence of her father, whom I directed temporarily to leave the court) was that the payment of the &#163;2 million &#8220;was completely voluntary&#8221;.   &#8220;I decided to make the gifts because why would I not?&#8221;   &#8220;It was not a condition.   It was a discussion.&#8221;   Mr Marks submits that in a context in which Mike was attentive to minimising inheritance tax (see Mr Mapstone&#8217;s notes and the decision for IHT reasons not to enter a charge or restriction on the Land register) it is odd that Mike himself decided to receive back &#163;2 million from Victoria which, unless he later spent it, merely added &#163;2 million back to his wealth and estate.</p>

She paid it to her father and cannot now recover it from him.   I am quite clear that it was not a mere gift by Victoria and, notwithstanding the use of the word &#8220;may&#8221; in the asset summary, was a payment which Mike wished her to make, although he did not go so far as to require her to make it.   As he put it, they talked about it and she agreed without demur.   His reasons were three fold.   First, he wished there to be levelling up, but he did not wish to be generous to the point of providing a further &#163;1 million (still less, &#163;2 million) to Adam.   He said in oral evidence that if Victoria had not given him that money he might have felt obliged to give a further &#163;2 million to Adam and he did not think that was appropriate.   He thought that net gifts to each of them of about &#163;1 million were enough.   Second, he did not wish either of his children to have a substantial fund of cash.   Third, in the case of Victoria he was undoubtedly keen to avoid money being available &#8220;for the predator&#8221; (this being the context in which he used that description).</p>

Mike himself said during cross examination about the &#163;2 million that &#8220;I was willing to give her the allowance so it was a monthly allowance which could not be got at by Frankie.   I thought a monthly allowance was better to avoid more money [being available] for the predator.&#8221;   Mr Marks and Miss Faggionato accordingly submit that, having received the &#163;2 million, Mike is at least morally, if not legally enforceably, now obliged to continue to pay the allowance and the school fees, a point to which I return in paragraphs 90-100 below. </p>

Mike said he was in the United States (where he has a home) when he discovered that Frankie was working for UNIT and he was displeased.   Apart from his low regard for Frankie, whom he considers to be lazy, his main reason was that he knew that it was his intention to make Adam the CEO, as he later did, and he did not think it a good idea to have his son-in-law as an employee of his son.

It was not a success.   Both Adam and, later, Mike, left before the end of it and before they had planned to leave.

Quite who said what to whom about this is, frankly, irrelevant.   Victoria supported her husband.   In the aftermath of the holiday (i) in February 2009 Victoria became for a period seriously psychiatrically unwell; (ii) in March 2009 Frankie was indeed fired or sacked by Adam; (iii) very sadly indeed, Victoria has never since seen or communicated with Adam for, now, over 5 years, with the exception of three hours that he spent with her at Christmas 2009; and (iv) Mary told me that since the holiday she and Mike barely communicate at all.</p>

I explained that I did not feel comfortable with his proposal.   It does not seem sensible to put a virtually unlimited sum into an account to be administered by two people, one of whom is unwell and the other with no basic maths &#8211; nor do I have the money to do that.&#8221;</p>

In August 2009, after about four months of being unemployed, Frankie began a job, at a slightly lower salary, at Rushes Post Production.   In December 2009 Victoria completed the sale of Avonmore Road and paid the balance of the &#163;2 million to her father.   At the same time he increased her allowance to the current rate of &#163;51,000 per annum (plus school fees) and in January 2010 Mary increased her allowance to the current rate of &#163;30,000 per annum.</p>

It is not necessary to quote extensively from the intimate report.   In its conclusion Dr Craig wrote:</p>

This has been associated with recurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression.   It is also probable that these symptoms have had a significant negative effect of his ability to focus and concentrate throughout much of his education and occupational life.   On balance, I am of the opinion that a diagnosis at Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is improbable.&#8221;</p>

In an irrational gesture of self harm Frankie deliberately broke a glass against his head, which required considerable stitches.   It was then agreed that he would temporarily leave Connaught Square.   The marriage was by now clearly at a nadir and, in the event, he never returned to live at Connaught Square.   He did, however, continue to visit frequently to see the children, including bathing them and putting them to bed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">During February 2013 there was heightened tension between Victoria and Frankie as Victoria believed that Frankie had deliberately removed and secreted her keys to the house.   Although there is considerable warmth in some of the texts between Victoria and Frankie during February 2013, it is, to my mind, quite clear that around 27 and 28 February 2013 Victoria was concerned about the keys and was making plain that she would prefer that Frankie kept away from the house for a short period.   On 28 February 2013 at 15.24 she texted &#8220;Please do not come over today.   I can&#8217;t deal with any more.   If you would like to see the children, Grandma Mary is very happy to make arrangements [to take them] wherever suits [you].&#8221;   He replied at 17.43 that he intended to come round &#8220;unless you say otherwise&#8221;.   She did say otherwise, for she replied at once: &#8220;why don&#8217;t you see them tomorrow.   Tensions are running high today &#8230;&#8221;   As Frankie knew, Victoria herself was then on her way to the airport to fly, briefly, to Monaco.   Despite that clearly expressed wish by Victoria that he did not go to the house that night, Frankie did do so.   When he arrived, the front door was open because a locksmith was changing the locks.   He walked straight in, and altercations then ensued involving Mary, who was present, Mike, who was summoned, and eventually the police, which Frankie found deeply humiliating and &#8220;a horrible experience like having a gun poked at me in my own house.&#8221;   The following day, Friday 1 March 2013, Victoria&#8217;s solicitors applied without notice to a district judge and obtained non-molestation injunctions and an order prohibiting him from going to the house, or into Connaught Square, save for contact expressly agreed in writing.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have read the statement of Victoria (prepared on her instructions while she herself was in Monaco) which was placed before the district judge.   On the basis of that evidence I do not consider that the district judge could fairly be criticised for making <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">some</span> injunction of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">very short</span> duration on the without notice application.   But the non-molestation order, particularly in relation to the children, was very hurtful and was unnecessary if he was not to go at all to the house or even into Connaught Square for a limited period.   The order was made on a Friday.   It should have provided a return date in the following week.   It was wrong that the return date given on a without notice injunction, which included a prohibition on visiting what was still his home, and where he regularly saw his children, was two months later, namely 1 May 2013. I understand that this came about because the district judge left it to a court official to identify and insert a date convenient to the court after the judge had made the order.   That should not have happened and should not happen again. It did not, in my view, comply with the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/45/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 45(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27" uk:canonical="1996 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Family Law Act 1996</ref>. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/45/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 45(3)</ref> requires the court to fix a return date which is not only &#8220;convenient&#8221; but &#8220;just&#8221;. It was the responsibility both of the solicitors who made the application, and of the district judge who made the order, to ensure that on a without notice order of this kind a rapid return date was given.</p>

I understand that after I transferred Connaught Square to Victoria she and Francesco had several arguments about the promises Victoria had made to me.   Francesco had asked Victoria on numerous occasions to sell the property in order to release capital so that they could enjoy a higher standard of living when he was unemployed.   Victoria insisted that she could not sell the property because she was under a moral obligation to me not to sell or mortgage the property and that if she did, I would stop paying the children&#8217;s school fees and her allowance.   She knew that I meant it which is why she did not agree to sell, or even charge, the property.   It remains in her sole name and unencumbered.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mike disagreed that the &#163;2 million and the allowances were &#8220;directly linked&#8221; such that he was now morally, if not legally, obliged to maintain the allowances.   When Mr Marks suggested that he would be exacting &#8220;penalties&#8221; upon his daughter and grandchildren, he said that he would not call them penalties.   He would call them consequences.   He said that he had made very clear to both Victoria and Frankie during the marriage that if she sold or mortgaged Connaught Square in breach of her promise he would cut off the allowances and that remained his position.</p>

He is merely threatening, bluffing, and, as Mr Marks orally put it, holding a pistol to the head of the court.   I should call his bluff and conclude that he will not in fact cut off the allowances even if Connaught Square has to be sold.   Both in their written submissions and in Mr Marks&#8217; closing oral submissions they submit that the threat is inherently implausible, lacks logic, and is irrational, but that Mike is a rational man.   Mr Marks pointed out that Mike also pays an allowance to Adam and that if he cuts off the allowance to Victoria he would have, consistent with equal treatment, to cut off that to Adam as well.   Mike&#8217;s answer to that would, I suspect, be that Adam has not broken any promise to him.   Mr Marks submitted that the threat is so deeply improbable and so irrational that, even if he means it now, when it came to it, Mike would not do it.   It would be so damaging to Victoria, so damaging to Adam (if his allowance was cut too) and so damaging to the grandchildren.</p>

In their open offer letter of 29 May 2013, Hughes Fowler Carruthers wrote &#8220;My client&#8217;s father is extremely cross about these proceedings.&#8221;   That was nine months ago.   Although his behaviour in the courtroom is of course controlled, restrained and very courteous, I am in no doubt that he is now little short of seething with anger about the proceedings.   He knows the enormous cost.   He regards Frankie&#8217;s claim as &#8220;disgusting&#8221;.   He said that he considered it would be &#8220;outrageous&#8221; if the court makes any award.   He has clearly always attached enormous significance to the promise.   So far as he is concerned, Victoria will break it if she sells, although he was earlier willing to permit her to raise a mortgage as in the open offer.   Being so determined, hard and inflexible a man (not my words, but those variously of his family) he has the will power to carry his threat out.   Since he has repeated it so resolutely for so long, including publicly upon oath in the witness box, I must conclude on a balance of probability that he will do so.</p>

Victoria insisted that she could not do so because she had made a promise to her father, which she felt morally obliged to stick to.   Francesco became increasingly resentful and angry about Victoria&#8217;s promise to Mike and tried to persuade her to beak it.   Victoria, of course, was adamant that she could not.

He would not have transferred Connaught Square to her if he did not trust Victoria to stick to her promise and he will be very cross if she breaches, whether or not out of choice, the promise she made.   I have no doubt that in that scenario he will stop the allowance and the payment of school fees.   I am obviously worried about the effect that would have on Victoria and the children.

I do not question the sincerity of her oral evidence at the time she gave it.   But there are many points of difference between her and Mike.   Her position was very recent, formed only during the hearing and expressed after just listening to the trenchant evidence of Mike.   She is a less hard and determined person than Mike.   Her attitude is concerned less with patrimony and more with helping her children when they need it.   The promise was not given to her but to him, and she was not the donor of Connaught Square.   She is much more involved than Mike in the daily life of Victoria and the children.   Finally, it is obviously significant that Victoria performs many services for Mary.   If Mary stopped the allowance she would inevitably have to pay Victoria for the services.</p>

He believes, therefore, that there is no longer a future for him in that industry and that he must branch out into a different field.   He believes that he has a flair for art and has embarked on a modular degree course with the Open University.   He hopes to complete this in the spring of 2017 at which point (but apparently not before) he would look for employment with an art gallery or auction house, or perhaps &#8220;doing fraud work with the police&#8221;, or marketing art as an offshoot of a luxury brand such as Hermes or Louis Vuitton.</p>

I am myself sceptical about the wisdom of spending three years on the art course and in the process accumulating yet further debts with a student loan.   But he said in his Form E at paragraph 4.5(a) that if he did so &#8220;I anticipate that I will earn similar amounts to that earned in the media (perhaps &#163;40,000 to &#163;60,000 pa. gross) in other fields.

If, alternatively, he is able to improve his prospects to at least &#163;50,000 per annum starting in 3&#189; years time, then he would gross over &#163;800,000 by the age of 65.   That being so, I will treat him as a man who could earn &#163;30,000 relatively soon; or whose current earning capacity is low (a maximum of &#163;10,000 per annum), whilst he also pursues his course, but who can gross at least &#163;50,000 per annum from September 2017.</p>

She currently receives the allowances totalling &#163;81,000 per annum and payment of all school fees.   If an order is made which forces her to sell Connaught Square (as <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">any</span> order inevitably will do) her allowances will reduce at once to &#163;30,000 per annum, and payment of the school fees will cease.   Victoria has no earning capacity.   Since I have concluded that her mother will continue to pay her allowance, she must, of course, continue to perform unpaid service for her mother and could not work for anyone else.   Frankie could earn a maximum of about &#163;30,000 per annum relatively soon; or about &#163;10,000 per annum gross at the moment and &#163;50,000 per annum from September 2017.   Once Westbourne Terrace is sold, they will both have no other income.   Frankie will have net debts of &#163;226,000.   Victoria will have the equity in Connaught Square of &#163;6,740,000 and net debts of currently around zero.   In each case their debts are rising fast with high rates of interest.   Whilst the summaries of Victoria&#8217;s assets in each of the agreements all refer to her having &#8220;substantial inheritance prospects from parents&#8221;, I cannot take those into account as resources which she is &#8220;likely to have in the foreseeable future.&#8221;   Her father&#8217;s current actuarial life expectancy is about a further 16 years.   Her mother&#8217;s is over 20.   I do not know their current testamentary intentions and they may change.   Mike said that his will has been changed since 2009.   I leave possible future inheritance entirely out of account, and patently it could do nothing to meet the needs of either Victoria or Frankie now.</p>

Since the injunction in March 2013 Frankie has, to his great regret, been restricted in the amount of time he can spend with the children and, because of his lack of accommodation, can only have them to stay for short periods.   In their closing documents Mr Marks and Miss Faggionato produced a schedule headed &#8220;Limata &#8211; Revenue Contributions (approx).&#8221;   This was designed to show that from his earnings when working, and an inheritance from his grandfather (&#163;160,000) and other sources, the total financial contribution of Frankie was similar to the &#8220;non-property&#8221; contribution of Victoria, crediting to her the value of the allowances paid by her parents, plus the school fees and many of the holidays for which they paid.   Mr Marks said in his closing oral submissions &#8220;the non-property contributions are pretty well the same.&#8221;   Although it is the view of Victoria and Mike that actually Frankie frittered much of his money on himself or wasteful luxuries such as the Porsche, I am prepared to accept that overall submission of Mr Marks.   What it leaves out of account, of course, is the property contribution of Victoria.   The lifestyle could never have been funded by Frankie and, viewing the marriage as a whole, the total financial contribution made by Victoria dwarfed that made by Frankie.   It has been calculated that the net value of all the capital gifts made by her parents was of the order of &#163;3.7 million, now of course worth almost double that.   Further, the entire future financial contribution to the needs and welfare of the children will inevitably be made by Victoria.</p>

The court must be scrupulous to avoid gender discrimination or gender bias.   Of course gender may, and often does, impact heavily on outcome.   If in fact a wife, in her role as mother, is the primary carer for the children, then her need for secure and suitable accommodation may outweigh that of the husband.   If a wife, due to her commitments to caring for the children, is less able to work than is the husband, than that is likely to impact upon maintenance needs.   So, too, if it is a fact of a case that a wife has lower earning capacity because of gender discrimination in the relevant employment markets.   But there must be no discrimination or bias based on gender alone, nor on any stereo&#8211;typical view that a wife may be dependent upon her husband but not vice versa.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no doubt that very great weight indeed should be given to the agreements in this case.   There are no vitiating factors such as duress or non-disclosure.   They were entered into freely by a mature man after expert legal advice.   The agreements each contemplated that there would be one or more children (Victoria was pregnant with their first child at the time of the PMA, and with their second at the time of the SSA).   By the time of the gift of Connaught Square, the valuable asset now in point, there had been not just one but three agreements, each reinforcing the first.   Mike would never have given Connaught Square to Victoria but for the agreements, and Frankie knew it.   In this regard I reject Mr Marks&#8217; closing submission that three signatures and three agreements &#8220;are only the same as one&#8221;.   That might be true about three documents all signed at the same time.   But it is, in my view, highly significant that Frankie repeatedly signed three agreements spaced out over 2&#189; years, and well aware how much fresh reliance was being placed upon each.   Frankie was not &#8220;lying&#8221; (as Mike would have it) when he signed each of the agreements.   He absolutely intended to be bound by them.  If I make any award at all, that will inevitably trigger a sale of Connaught Square, for Victoria now has no means at all except for Connaught Square (unless Mike and/or Mary very fundamentally change their present positions, which I do not expect, and make more capital available).  A sale and trade down to a smaller home, in a less expensive and less central area of London, and probably at a much further distance from the children&#8217;s schools, would inevitably be de-stabilising for the children (whose welfare is the first consideration) and mean an overall reduction in the living standards to which they are accustomed, living with their mother.  There is the additional and very cogent fact in this case that if I make any award at all, thereby triggering sale, there will be an immediate and dramatic reduction in Victoria&#8217;s income stream of &#163;51,000 per annum plus all the school fees.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Frankie has no claim at all based on contributions, compensation or sharing.  Victoria has already made by far the greater contribution, when the gifted properties are taken into account (exceeding that of Frankie by about &#163;3.7 million).  At the time of the marriage Frankie&#8217;s only asset was the equity in Eastlake House, believed in the PMA to be &#163;50,000 less costs of sale, and in the event &#163;30,000 when it was sold.  On the date of final breakdown, in early March 2013, he had a share in Westbourne Terrace, then estimated by him in his Form E to be worth about &#163;277,000 less CGT.  His debts then, other than costs, were about &#163;50,000.  So he was in surplus by at least &#163;200,000.   That he now has a net debt of &#163;226,000 is almost entirely attributable to the costs of these proceedings.  There is nothing to compensate.  There is nothing to share, for there is now no remaining matrimonial acquest apart from Westbourne Terrace.  So Mr Howard asks rhetorically, and with considerable force, if the agreements do not prevail in this case, when could agreements of this kind ever prevail, notwithstanding all that was said in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Granatino v Radmacher</span> with regard, in particular, to autonomy and reliance?</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The plain fact is that over the period since 2006, when the parties moved from the jointly owned Westbourne Terrace to Avonmore Road, solely owned by Victoria, a situation developed in which Frankie became completely dependent upon Victoria for provision of his home.   He is now, on any view, and in the context of this case, in a &#8220;predicament of real need&#8221;.   He has no home, no current income, no capital, considerable debts, and absolutely no further borrowing capacity.   Although he is temporarily housed in Leinster Square, he currently has no prospect of paying the rent again when his up-front payment (all borrowed) for six months ends in May.   Victoria, by contrast, does have &#8220;a sufficiency&#8221;, if not more.   All her capital is, of course, currently tied up in her home, but the contrast between a wife on the one hand with net worth of &#163;6.7 million, and a husband on the other with net debts of &#163;226,000 is striking and bleak.   This is a situation in which, in the words of the Supreme Court at paragraph 75: &#8220;&#8230; the agreement makes provisions that conflict with what the court would otherwise consider to be the requirements of  fairness.&#8221;   In the absence of the agreements it is inconceivable that any court would not make a substantial award to the husband.   Further, if all the facts were the same but the genders reversed, it is, in my view, inconceivable that the agreements would outweigh making a substantial award to the wife, even if the children were primarily living with the husband and only intermittently staying with her.</p>

But if there is no provision for Frankie at all, then the damaging situation will persist, almost certainly throughout their childhoods, that they live with their mother in relative luxury and see and stay (if at all) with their father in relative penury.   Even if not in his capacity as a former husband, then certainly in his role as a loving and committed father, Frankie has a very pressing need for secure accommodation in which he can accommodate all three children together and which does not demean him too much relative to their mother.</p>

Nevertheless I have concluded that the need to provide an adequate home in which the children can visit and stay with their father is very important and, insofar as the balance of welfare considerations is concerned, does outweigh the upheaval.

If any provision is made at all, then, if the purpose of adequate housing is to be achieved, that provision will necessarily have to be measured in many hundreds of thousand pounds.   There is no room and no purpose in this case for an award merely of a low number of hundreds of thousands.   That much is clearly recognised by and on behalf of Victoria.   In her open proposal dated 4 February 2014, immediately before the hearing, now at bundle A/C 36, her primary position was, as it remains, to offer nothing.   But her fall-back position, in the &#8220;scenario&#8221; that the court does make any capital provision, is to propose up to &#163;850,000 being used to purchase a property for the use of Frankie until the later of the youngest child attaining 18 or completing a university first degree.</p>

The majority upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal that the housing element of the award should end and revert to the wife when the younger child (they had two) attained the age of 22.

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The issue is whether this should all come to an abrupt end when the youngest child grows up &#8230;   Married parents are different, in that the court has power to make provision, not only for the child, but also for the parent.   There is no reason in principle why the court should limit its support in the same way that it has to limit its support for the unmarried parent.   Quite the reverse: this is what distinguishes marriage from cohabitation in our law.   Where parents are married, the court can look beyond the needs of the child while growing up and look independently at the needs of the parent, and in particular those generated as a result of parenthood.   Not only this, these days parents often expect to be a resource for their grown-up children, a base to which they can return and a source of the unconditional love and support which is what parenthood is all about.&#8221;</p>

In that case, when the younger child attains 22 the husband will be aged about 54 or 55.   In the present case, the husband will be a decade older.   When their younger son attains 22 Frankie will be one month short of 65.   In that case, the husband is &#8220;extremely able and has added to his qualifications by pursuing a D Phil in biotechnology&#8221; (paragraph 119).   In the present case, Frankie is much less able and his capacity to make any provision at all for his older age and retirement is highly speculative and, frankly, very doubtful.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For these reasons, but still affording as much weight as possible to the fact and contents of the agreements, I have concluded that there must be a stepped approach to provision of a housing fund.   A larger fund is required until the youngest surviving child attains the age of 22, during a period when the children may be expected to stay frequently, and together, with their father.   At that point capital must be released back to Victoria (or her nominee).   But it could not be right or fair on the facts of this case to leave Frankie homeless and possibly a burden on the state at the age of 65.   Further, although the rest of the Supreme Court did not agree with Baroness Hale on the facts of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Granatino v Radmacher</span>, her words in paragraph 191, quoted above, still resonate with force.   Parenthood does not end when a child attains 18 or even 22.   Frankie will still need some home at which the children can visit him and which they can view as a base with their father.   But it can be a smaller and perhaps less well located one.   It could indeed be highly damaging to the children, on the threshold of adult independence, to see their father effectively &#8220;evicted&#8221; (to borrow Mary&#8217;s phrase) and homeless just as he himself reaches retirement and older age.   Further, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 25(2)</ref>(f) expressly refers to &#8220;the contributions which each of the parents &#8230; is likely in the foreseeable future to make to the welfare of the family &#8230;&#8221;   It is likely that Frankie, as father, no less than Victoria, as mother, will make a very significant contribution to the welfare, though not the finances, of the children for many years to come.</p>

I have given careful consideration to all these particulars but, in the end, outcome is driven by available resources more than by either side&#8217;s wish list.   I am satisfied that an adequate 3 bedroomed house can be bought for a gross price of &#163;900,000, and, as will be seen, that no more than that can fairly and sensibly be made available.    Compromises will have to be made between size and location, and the essential choice will be with Frankie.

There is simply no point in providing a home for Frankie but leaving him with enormous debts which he has no prospect at all of servicing or repaying.   If his debts are not paid there is a real risk of bankruptcy, and he has to be enabled to start with a clean sheet.   I appreciate, of course, that the bulk of his debts are costs.   His most pressing need at the moment, apart from a home, is to have those debts paid. In a needs based exercise such as this, costs are a debt which simply have to be paid. The CGT must be paid, but instead of making some estimated provision for it, it is more sensible and fair that Victoria should simply pay the assessed amount whatever that may be.   Frankie has no furniture and will inevitably need to furnish a new home adequately to accommodate the children.   He does not have a car but reasonably needs one for contact.   The decision whether to continue in very low paid, part-time employment while he completes his course at the Open University, or to seek better employment now, is one for Frankie to make.   The fact is that at the moment he has no real job.   He will now be busy for a period finding and moving into a new home.   He pressingly needs to be able to fund rent from May until a new home has been purchased.   He needs the sum of &#163;25,000 to tide him over.   The escalating interest on the Novitas loan will have to be paid. He must of course credit the whole of the amount actually receivable by him when Westbourne Terrace is sold.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The two elder children are at private schools and clearly both parents expected that all three would attend private schools throughout.   Indeed Frankie hoped that his sons would go to Eton.   It has been established that funding for the future education of all three children at good London private day schools will require a capital sum to be reserved now (and suitably invested) of about &#163;1,100,000.   Victoria will need to set that aside, thereby reducing her capital for other purposes to &#163;4,400,000.   </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Various calculations have been produced as to the capital that Victoria will need to set aside in order to provide for the needs of all the children during their childhoods and of herself for the remainder of her life expectancy of a little over 50 years.   Mr Howard produced some calculations based on &#163;50,000 a year for herself (indexed) for the rest of her life and &#163;10,000 a year for each of the children (indexed) to the age of 23.   The starting annual figures total &#163;80,000 and obviously reflect the current level of the allowances.   Mr Howard&#8217;s figures were &#163;1,250,000 for Victoria, &#163;118,000 for the eldest child, &#163;133,000 for the second, and &#163;147,000 for the third, or &#163;1,648,000 in total.   Mr Marks and Miss Faggionato produced some calculations which assume that the needs of the children end at the age of 18 (after which student loans would be available to them) and that Mary will in fact, as I have held, continue to contribute &#163;30,000 per annum for at least the next 10 years.   On those assumptions Mr Marks&#8217; and Miss Faggionato&#8217;s figure is &#163;1,300,000.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All these figures of course include huge elements of speculation.   Further, the current allowances of &#163;81,000 are being paid to meet the high costs of Connaught Square.   It will be recalled that in the SSA there is express reference to Mike increasing his allowance &#8220;to cover the costs of Connaught Square.&#8221;   If Victoria has to trade down to a smaller house in a less expensive area her outgoings should reduce. Her reserves will in fact augment when she receives back 45 per cent of the net proceeds of sale when Frankie has to trade down. But on any view she would need to set aside at least &#163;1,400,000 for future expenditure.   That further reduces her capital to &#163;3,000,000.   Whilst it will obviously involve a considerable fall in her living standards, property particulars produced by Victoria herself, now at bundle G, do indicate that comfortable family houses in West London or South Hampstead can be bought for around that sum.   I am therefore satisfied that if provision is made for Frankie as indicated above, sufficient will be left to Victoria to enable her to house and support herself and the children, and to educate the children, all still to a high and comfortable standard.   It will be noted that the value of the housing contemplated for Frankie is about one third of that contemplated for Victoria.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a decision and judgment based entirely upon the needs of Frankie, considered in conjunction with his role as father.   Whilst not  implementing the agreements, it still affords great weight to them.   But for the agreements, I would have awarded a larger housing fund and the whole of it outright.   As it is, all of it is provided only for a term, and much of it only during the dependency of the children.   He only ever gets the use of it in the form of housing.   He can never touch the capital.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is one qualification upon the figure of &#163;900,000 for the purchase cost of a house.   That is based upon current estimated net proceeds of Connaught Square.   We are, however, in a period of apparently rapidly increasing house prices.   If the &#163;900,000 is provided before 30 June 2014, then it will remain as that fixed figure.   If it is provided after that date, then the sum to be provided must be &#163;900,000 plus X % x &#163;900,000, where X % is the percentage increase between &#163;6,950,000 (being the current estimated gross selling price of Connaught Square) and the actual gross selling price of Connaught Square.   If Connaught Square sells for <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">less</span> than &#163;6,950,000 there will be no reduction in the &#163;900,000.</p>

In view of the distinguished legal representation, and with the assistance of Mr Gollings, I am expecting that this will be done cooperatively and by agreement.   If not, I will rule at a later hearing.</p>
