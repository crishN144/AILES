C&#8217;s father is H (&#8216;the father&#8217;). He and the mother have been in a relationship since late 2019.</p>

The local authority issued care proceedings in respect of him the day after his birth and made an application for his removal from his mother and father. The care plan was for him to be placed in foster care. I refused this application and approved his placement with his parents in a residential assessment unit. Since the conclusion of this placement in November 2023, C has lived with his parents at their home but under the 24 hour supervision of professional support workers.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that there may occasionally be cases where, at the conclusion of the evidence and submissions, the court will ultimately say that the local authority has not discharged the burden of proof to the requisite standard and thus decline to make the findings. That this is the case goes hand in hand with the well-established law that suspicion, or even strong suspicion, is not enough to discharge the burden of proof. The court must look at each possibility, both individually and together, factoring in all the evidence available including the medical evidence before deciding whether the "fact in issue more probably occurred than not"&#160;<span style="font-style:italic">(Re B: Lord Hoffman).</span></p>

Much of my time over the last four weeks in preparing this judgment has been spent not in writing or organising but in careful reflection on that big picture. In the end, I have come to a conclusion that the Local Authority has failed to prove its case to the requisite standard. In reaching that position, I also have to recognise that I have no clear answer to give as to how S died, since, and this is really common ground, none of the canvassed alternative suggestions could be clearly established.</p>

I ask that question not just because it occurred to me but also because I recognise that decisions in cases like this are not driven exclusively by the process of reasoning.</p>

As Professor Mangham accepted, the presence of a haemorrhage is or maybe a feature which indicates the fracture could be acute rather than chronic. Therefore, whilst some of the observed features may have caused Professor Mangham to conclude that the fractures were chronic (in this case 3 to 7 days before death), I do not understand and I do not accept his omission of referring to the presence of haemorrhage in his report in respect of the fractures which he opined were chronic. The presence of haemorrhage is a highly material feature of the slide which might lead the court to reach the conclusion that the fracture was acute and not chronic, and very importantly, whether there was really a fracture at all. Professor McCarthy did not identify any haemorrhage in those said by Professor Mangham to be &#8216;old fractures&#8217;.</p>

He said that the identification of osteocyte necrosis was subjective and needed careful evaluation. He recognised that it was a controversial issue, not as to whether it occurs but as to when it occurs and can be recognised whether osteocyte necrosis was present. Professor Mangham then said that the prolonged use of CPR would negate reliance on the presence and significance of osteocyte necrosis as a means of timing a fracture. It is of considerable weight that this important feature of Professor Mangham&#8217;s oral evidence, i.e. that the use of osteocyte necrosis in timing is controversial, does not appear in any of his reports. </p>

If the cases in all those papers were examined as thoroughly as Prof Mangham has in this case, I am certain that the presence of rib fractures found to be sustained during CPR would drastically increase.

This was not what was being suggested &#8211; the potential blow was to the sixth rib but lateral to the fracture site, which is why both Dr Fitzpatrick and Professor McCarthy agreed on blunt force trauma as being a potential mechanism for that green stick fracture.  </p>

It is acknowledged that experts are human and will of course make mistakes.  However the continued failure to identify the mistake when the obvious discrepancy had been pointed out by so many other professionals suggests that something more than simple error was in operation;  rather it suggests an expert who on this occasion had a very fixed view that clouded his subsequent review to the extent that he continued to miss what was obvious in slide 49 and had even been obvious to him previously in slide 37.

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is essential for the fair and effective operation of the family justice system and of the criminal justice system that there is open, regular and effective dialogue and co-operation between the parties to the care proceedings, most obviously with the local authority, and the police and/or the CPS. Plainly there will be exceptions where a particular course of action might imperil the integrity of the family or of the criminal proceedings. In which case it is likely that orders will have been made by the court to require a party not to disclose information or documents to the police or the CPS or to permit the police to withhold evidence from a party or all parties to the care proceedings as a result of the making of a Public Interest Immunity order. The recently launched The Disclosure of Information between Family and Criminal Agencies and Jurisdictions: 2024 Protocol is an essential starting point.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In many cases where there are concurrent family proceedings and criminal investigations into the death of or alleged serious injuries caused to a child, the medical experts instructed by the police will be, or are very likely to become experts instructed in the family proceedings or will be called to give evidence at a fact finding hearing. There are differences in the duties and responsibilities of a medial expert when they are instructed by the police in a criminal investigation and when they are instructed to prepare a report in family proceedings. Nevertheless, if and when the police and/or the CPS decide to convene a meeting with one or more of their instructed medical experts it would be advisable, as a matter of good practice, for a minute or note of the meeting to be taken so that it may be disclosed in due course to the parties in the family proceedings. Moreover, and where practicable, it would be advisable for the parties to the family proceedings to be given advance notice of the proposal to convene such a meeting.</p>

The parents had denied inflicting any of these injuries and put forward a fall that A had suffered from the top of his bunk bed.

The parents were now living in the area of a different London Borough and sought support from that local authority in accordance with the provisions of s17 of the 1989 Act.

Accordingly, the supervision of the parents&#8217; care of C was immediately withdrawn, A and B returned to the care of their mother and father and the interim care orders were discharged. It had been intended that after being told of the outcome of these proceedings in child appropriate forms, that A and B would return home after a short but phased period. However, such was the strength of A&#8217;s wish and desire to return home immediately that he and B returned without further delay in the care of the parents. All has gone well.</p>
