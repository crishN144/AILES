The preliminary issue is whether the court has jurisdiction to entertain the application.  Given the notice of application was filed on 29th February 2000, over 11 years ago, it may be thought unusual, to say the least, that the issue of jurisdiction is only now being considered.  Furthermore,  if the court determines that it does have jurisdiction, a supplementary issue will arise as to whether the application can, as a matter of law and, if so, should in all the circumstances, be stayed on grounds of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">forum non conveniens</span><span style="font-size:14pt">.  That issue has not been argued before me so far and could not be determined without a further hearing. </span></p>

The parties met in 1984 at a time when both were married to other people.  The father was then living in Kent, and the mother in Glasgow.  The father suggested a relationship with the mother, but she apparently declined.  The following year the mother separated from her husband and moved to live in Andorra for three years.  Then in 1988 she travelled to Australia where she stayed for nine months, during which time she met another man called X.  In 1989 she returned to Scotland and her marriage was dissolved.  Later that year the parties met again in Scotland and shortly afterwards started a relationship.  At that stage the father was the owner of substantial property in Kent, Z House, and an island in Scotland.  He had recently separated from his wife by whom he had two daughters.  Thereafter the parties lived at Z House and spent every other weekend on the Scottish island.  However, in January 1992 the father experienced financial difficulties and the island was sold.  Thereafter the parties continued to live together at Z House in Kent.  </span></p>

The mother alleged that she was the victim of domestic violence. In August 1999 the mother and S left Z House with the assistance of the police and flew to Scotland where they stayed with the maternal grandparents in Aberdeenshire.  The mother then decided to fly to Australia and travel there with S on a return ticket on 13th August 1999.  On the same day the father issued an application for parental responsibility, residence and contact in the Tunbridge Wells County Court.    On 27th August that court made an order for the disclosure of information as to the whereabouts of the child and the delivery of S for staying contact with the father.   Meanwhile, the mother had engaged solicitors in Australia who made an application on 1st September for a protection order in the court in Townsville, Queensland.</span></p>

The proceedings in the Tunbridge Wells County Court were subsequently transferred to the Principal Registry of the High Court.   On 6th September, the father made an application in the Queensland Court for the equivalent of a prohibited steps and residence orders pending the return of the child to the United Kingdom.  The mother filed affidavits in the Australian proceedings expressing a wish to remain in Australia.  In reply, the father filed an affidavit stating that he would support S on her return to the United Kingdom and would assist the mother financially.   On 16th September, the judge in the Queensland Court ruled that the best place for "the complicated issues" to be determined was in the English court.   The mother undertook to return S to the United Kingdom within two weeks and, on the basis of that undertaking, was granted residence of S pending their return.  Thereafter, orders were made in the English court prohibiting the mother from removing S from England and Wales upon return to the jurisdiction, and directing her to hand over her passport to her solicitor on arrival at Heathrow.  </span></p>

By a further order dated 4th October, the mother was given temporary relief until the final hearing of the father's application for a residence order to remove S from England and Wales on the basis that they live at the maternal grandparent's home in Aberdeenshire.  The order further provided, however, that there should be regular contact between the father and S for periods of ten days every three weeks. Thereafter, the parties filed affidavits in the English proceedings - the father seeking a residence order whereunder he and S would live together in Z House in Kent, the mother expressing a wish that she and S should remain in Scotland with the maternal grandparents.  </span></p>

Seven days later, however, the father and S left England on the Eurostar bound for Paris under the false passports and from there flew to Australia later that day.  Thus, when the mother arrived at Gatwick a few days later to collect S in accordance with the agreement between the parties, there was no sign of S or the father.   The police were alerted and  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">ex parte</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> location and freezing orders were made in the High Court.

On 23rd December, the mother applied to the Child Abduction Central Authority to invoke the Hague Convention to secure the return of S to this country. On 30th December, the mother's passport was released by the court to enable her to fly to Australia to assist in the location and/or recovery of the child.  The mother duly flew to Australia on 1st January 2000.  On 4th January, the Family Court in Australia made seek and find orders, and a further order preventing the removal of S from Australia.  Six weeks later, on 16th February, S was recovered by the Australian police in Melbourne and reunited with the mother.  The father was arrested and detained as an illegal immigrant into the country.  On the following day, however, he made an application claiming refugee status in Australia.</span></p>

However, the court must make its own mind up on the basis of the evidence before it ... On balance, although I do not regard this as a very easy matter, I conclude that the mother had established habitual residence in Scotland by the time the father left for Australia.  I find, therefore, that the mother and therefore the child was habitually resident in the United Kingdom and, if relevant, in Scotland rather than England at the time of the wrongful removal."</p>

The judge rejected this argument holding that "it would be a clear violation of the spirit of the Convention if what I see as a technical argument were to succeed and thereby to prevent the court from returning the child to the United Kingdom if the circumstances for doing so are otherwise established."  The father duly filed a notice of appeal against the order for return, and pending determination of the appeal the mother and S remained in Australia.</span></p>

On 16th October 2001, the father was convicted of two counts of incitement to solicit the murder of the mother and X in Australia and on 7th May 2002 was sentenced to terms of 6 years and 18 month imprisonment in respect of those charges.  Further police investigations in Australia led to a new charge being made on fresh allegations of incitement to solicit the mother's murder.   Meanwhile, on 15th February 2002, Mr. Justice Kirkwood had granted the mother permission to remove S from the jurisdiction "temporarily for at least 18 months".  On 27th August 2004, on the hearing of the father's appeal against his conviction and sentence in 2002, the term of imprisonment was increased by a further two years. Subsequently, the father was convicted in respect of the second and separate offence of soliciting the mother's murder and received a further term of imprisonment of 12 years, with a minimum term expressed to be seven and a half years.   The father remains in custody in Australia.  He continues to deny the offences in respect of which he has been convicted.</span></p>

On 5th May 2006, a District Judge in ancillary proceedings between the father and his former wife directed that the sum of &#163;302,619 should be paid to the wife and the balance to the father.  By a subsequent order of Singer J. the father's share was held pursuant to the 1999 freezing order.</span></p>

Subsequently there were further hearings at which the application was adjourned further for various reasons, including to enable the father's solicitors to obtain instructions from their client in Australia and to explore the possibility of arranging a video link with the Australian prison for the purposes of any hearing of the application.  On 22nd June 2009 Singer J. made further directions in the proceedings, together with an order for interim periodical payments in respect of S in the sum of &#163;1,500 per month, such sums to be paid out of the frozen funds. </span></p>

The matter was originally listed for final determination by Singer J. on 1st November, but in the event it was adjourned on that occasion.

First, it was submitted that the English court has jurisdiction under Schedule 1 because it has taken concurrent Children Act jurisdiction in respect of other issues relating to the child.  Secondly, it was submitted that the finding that the child was habitually resident in England and Wales at the date when the application was made, i.e. 29th February 2000, would provide a separate ground for jurisdiction.   Thirdly, it was contended that the English court has jurisdiction to make an order under Schedule 1 if the father had been served with the process.  Fourthly, it was argued that the English court has jurisdiction if the father is domiciled in England and Wales for the purposes of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27" uk:canonical="1982 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982</ref> ("the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27" uk:canonical="1982 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CJJA 1982</ref>").  In supplemental submissions, two further grounds were advanced on behalf of the mother, namely that the jurisdiction had been prorogued because the father had unequivocally accepted jurisdiction at the time of service of the application and thereafter and, further, that the court retained the power to make an order for financial provision under its inherent jurisdiction. </span></p>

She acknowledged that where a parent lives in a member state of the European Union, jurisdiction is governed by EU law, but asserted that the question of the impact of EU law on jurisdictional disputes in cases involving an EU country and a non-EU country -</span></p>

Counsel for the father challenged the proposition that there was a jurisdiction to make Schedule 1 orders either arising from a concurrent welfare jurisdiction or as a result of service being effected on the respondent.  In supplemental submissions, it was agreed on behalf of the father that, whilst the court may have the power to order financial provision for a ward in appropriate circumstances, those circumstances did not arise in this case. In oral submission and in further written submissions that were filed with my permission after the conclusion of the hearing, the father contended that on the facts he had not filed any acknowledgement of service in a fashion that led to the prorogation of jurisdiction.  </span></p>

On this latter point, after some discussion during the hearing before me, it was agreed that the question whether the court (1) had the power to stay proceedings and, if so, (2) should exercise such power in the circumstances of this case, should be adjourned for a further hearing. Consideration of whether another country provided a more convenient forum would require not only extensive further legal argument but also further evidence, and would involve certain practical difficulties.  The legal argument would centre on the legal decision of the European Court of Justice in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Owusu v Jackson</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> (Case no.

The factual evidence would centre on the fact that the mother is not currently in this country, but rather in a location which she wishes to conceal from the father.   The fact that her whereabouts are unknown gives rise to practical difficulties. How can the father argue for a stay unless he or at least his representatives know the country in which she is living so that the comparative convenience of the two jurisdictions can be assessed?  In view of these difficulties that would inevitably arise on considering an application for a stay, it was agreed between the parties to postpone the issue until the court had ruled on the issue whether it has jurisdiction at all.   The question of whether the court has the power to stay proceedings, and if so whether it should exercise that power in this case, only arises if there is jurisdiction to entertain the application under Schedule 1.</span></p>

That regulation re-enacted and replaced the Brussels Convention on the Jurisdiction and Enforcement in Civil and Commercial Matters 1968 ("the 1968 Convention") which had been incorporated into English law by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27" uk:canonical="1982 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CJJA 1982</ref>.

The definition of "a Part I order" in s.1(1) of the 1986 Act includes inter alia orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.8</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> but not orders under Schedule 1.  Furthermore, under s.2 of the 1986 Act (as amended), the primary jurisdictional basis for making Part I orders is now Council Regulation EC No. 2201 of 2203 of 27th November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition of enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility ("Brussels II Revised").  Article 1.3(e) of that Regulation provides that it "shall not apply to maintenance obligations".  Thus, it is submitted for the father, there is no identified source for a concurrent jurisdiction.  </span></p>

Article 14 of the Regulation and the terms of Part I of the 1986 Act (as amended) make clear that there is a residual jurisdiction under domestic law.  Prior to the implementation of Brussels II Revised, the jurisdiction to make Part I orders in non-matrimonial cases arose where the child was habitually resident in England and Wales or was present in England and Wales and not habitually resident elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt">On this point I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Stocker and the editors of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:14pt">Rayden &amp; Jackson</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> are right.  The fact that the power to order financial provision is located in a Schedule to the Children Act suggests that it is intended to be ancillary to the court's overall welfare jurisdiction.   Although maintenance is excluded from the definition of "upbringing" by s.105(1) with the result that the paramountcy principle does not apply to applications under Schedule 1, paragraph 1(6) of the Schedule vests the court with the power to make orders under the Schedule of its own volition whenever it makes or varies a residence or special guardianship order.   To my mind this establishes a close link between the welfare and financial provision jurisdictions and, in all the circumstances, I conclude that the court has the power to make an order under Schedule 1 whenever it has the jurisdiction to make welfare orders under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27" uk:canonical="1982 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.   Such interpretation is consistent with the policy and principles underpinning <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27" uk:canonical="1982 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. Whether or not it should exercise those powers is of course entirely a matter for the court's discretion, depending on all the circumstances of the case. Furthermore, as the primary source of jurisdiction is now the European instruments &#8211; formerly the 1968 Convention and now Brussels I &#8211; the concurrent jurisdiction under the residual domestic law only arises where the respondent is not domiciled in a contracting state (now, under Brussels I, a &#8220;Member State&#8221;).  </span></p>

In that case two parents, both Sudanese who had married in the Sudan, moved to England, where the father was already resident, and had a child.   After the breakdown of the marriage, the parties were divorced in the Sudan. Subsequently, the father unlawfully retained the child in Sudan following a contact visit, and the mother started proceedings in England for the child to be returned to this jurisdiction.  The court granted the mother a declaration that the child was and remained habitually resident in England, but refused the application for summary return.  The mother then obtained, under Schedule 1, a sequestration order over the former matrimonial home which was the father's only accountable asset.  The father argued that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain such an application because (a) the order sought was for the mother's rather than the child's benefit;  and (b) under Schedule I, para.14, an order cannot be made against a parent resident abroad where the child is also living abroad.  The Court of Appeal rejected the father's submissions.   The term "for the benefit of the child" in Schedule 1 was to be given a wide construction.  Furthermore, para.14 of Schedule 1 could not sensibly be construed to prevent an application by a parent left within the jurisdiction after the wrongful departure of the other parent and child.  </span></p>

This demonstrates that the power to order financial provision for children under the inherent jurisdiction is of long-standing.  Furthermore, the fact that Denning LJ linked the court's power to order custody to the mother and maintenance against the father demonstrates that the concurrence of the welfare and maintenance jurisdictions is equally of long standing.  By insisting on the requirement that the respondent be served, he was not conferring jurisdiction in cases where service was effected, but rather indicating that, unless service was effected, the jurisdiction would not, in practice, be exercised. </span></p>

This assertion is not supported by the evidence filed on his behalf.  In particular, in an affidavit sworn by the father for this hearing on 22nd December 2010 specifically to address the issue of domicile, he stated (a) that he was born in London and lived in England for all of his life, apart from the time when he owned property in Scotland, and since August 1999 when he has been in Australia;  (b) up to the time that he took S to Australia in 1999 he was domiciled in England and Wales;  (c) when he went to Australia with S in December 1999 "this was not with the exclusive intention of permanently living there";  (d) he and S went to Australia on return tickets and under three month visas;  and (e) at the time when he applied for refugee status, which was 12 days before the application under Schedule 1 was filed, he had not made any decision that Australia would be his domicile, as his main concern was to be close to S should she need him wherever she may have been.  It is therefore manifestly clear on the father's own evidence that at the date on which the application under Schedule 1 was filed he was still domiciled in England and Wales.  Accordingly this court has jurisdiction to entertain the application by virtue of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/27" uk:canonical="1982 c. 27" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CJJA 1982</ref> and Article 2 of the 1968 Convention.</span></p>

In that month, following the final breakdown of the parents&#8217; relationship, her mother took her to Scotland.  A few days later, the mother took her to Australia without the consent of the father.  In her affidavit filed for this hearing on 23rd September 2010 specifically to address the issue of domicile and habitual residence, the mother accepts that, up to that point, she (i.e the mother) was habitually resident in England and Wales.  On 16th September 1999, in the Hague proceedings in Queensland, she undertook to return S to the United Kingdom. At about the same time an order was made in the English court preventing her removing S from England and Wales on her return.  On 4th October, at a further hearing in the English court after her return from Australia, she was given permission to remove S temporarily to her parents home in Scotland on terms that every three weeks she would bring S down to England for 10 days staying contact with the father.  Shortly afterwards, the parties filed statements in the Children Act proceedings, each seeking residence orders - the mother on the basis that she would take S to live in Scotland, the father on the basis that S would live in England.  In oral evidence before me the mother said that although at that stage she wished to remain in Scotland she "had no idea where she would be living in the future".  At that stage she was "living out of a suitcase".  In December 1999, the father abducted S to Australia.  On 16th February 2000, S was reunited with the mother in Australia.  Thereafter they remained there for several weeks during which time the application under Schedule 1 was filed in the Principal Registry in these proceedings.  In the Australian proceedings, the mother was seeking an order for the return of S to England and Wales whereas the father was arguing inter alia that the court had no power to order such a return because she was habitually resident in Scotland. </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-size:14pt"> To my mind this history demonstrates that up to August 1999 S was habitually resident in England and Wales and that nothing occurred in the various moves thereafter to alter that status. Whilst the mother may at one stage have harboured hopes of moving permanently to Scotland, those hopes were never realised. The permission granted to the mother on 4</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> October 1999 to remove S to Scotland was on a temporary basis and on terms that S would be brought down to England for 10 days every three weeks. In my judgment, that did not alter the child&#8217;s habitual residence in England.  Furthermore, neither the mother&#8217;s abduction of the child to Australia in August 1999, nor the father's abduction of the child to Australia in December 1999, altered S's habitual residence. I therefore conclude that S was habitually resident in England and Wales on 29</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:14pt">th</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> February 2000.</span></p>

However, as the learned judge himself observed, the court must make its own mind up on the basis of the evidence before it, and he did not have before him the oral evidence that I heard from the mother. </span></p>

If, contrary to my finding, he was at that date domiciled not in England and Wales but rather in Australia, then pursuant to Article 4 of that Convention and the domestic law of England and Wales, as S was at all material times habitually resident in England and Wales, this court has jurisdiction to entertain the application, either concurrently with its welfare jurisdiction under the Children Act or simply by reason of S's habitual residence at the date the Schedule 1 application was filed.</span></p>
