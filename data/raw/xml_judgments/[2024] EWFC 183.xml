	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this matter I am concerned with the welfare of E, a girl, born in December 2021.  E has a diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia. E is represented by Ms Jane Rayson of counsel through her Children&#8217;s Guardian, Amy Watkins. Ms Watkins was not the original Children&#8217;s Guardian in these proceedings, having been allocated on 4 April 2023. The proceedings are brought by the London Borough of Enfield, represented by Ms Tabitha Barran of counsel.  The final care plan of the local authority is for E to be placed in the care of her paternal aunt, TD, in the jurisdiction of Ghana under the auspices of a Special Guardianship Order (SGO).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As I set out in detail below, these proceedings have been the subject of very concerning delay.   The case had already been ongoing for 2 years when it was re-allocated to me in April 2024. It is currently in week 131 as against the statutory time limit of 26 weeks stipulated by s.32(1)(a)(ii) of the Children Act 1989.  Prior to the matter being reallocated to this court, the case had been dealt with by no less than nine<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>judges across seventeen hearings.  There have been seven Issues Resolution Hearing listings and an adjourned final hearing.   Prior to it being re-allocated, the case had passed through the hands of a total of thirty-three different advocates.  Having been the subject of proceedings and placed in foster care since shortly after her birth, E is now aged 2 years and 4 months old.  The observation of the Children&#8217;s Guardian in her final report that the proceedings are &#8220;significantly beyond the target timeframe for reaching decisions regarding [E&#8217;s] permanency&#8221; is the very definition of an understatement.  Whilst this judgment must and will concentrate on the decision that falls to be made for E, I am obligated to deal also in this judgment with the manifest and wholly unacceptable delay for E.</p>

The mother has been assessed as being in the extremely low range of intellectual functioning with an IQ score of 67 on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> percentile. Her capacity to comprehend language is assessed as extremely low, with a VCI of 68 on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> percentile.  The mother&#8217;s reading ability is good enough for single words, with a reading age of 11 years old, but her ability to make sense of what she reads is lower.  Whilst the mother does not strictly speaking fulfil the criteria of learning disability, the psychological report before the court concludes that she presents with a number of clear impairments in adaptive functioning consistent with such a diagnosis.  In these circumstances, the mother has the benefit of an intermediary.  The court has been careful to have regard to the recommendations of the intermediary to ensure the mother can participate effectively.  The court also implemented special measures pursuant to FPR 2010 Part 3A by way of a screen in court having regard to the allegations domestic abuse made by the mother against the father.  The mother has filed and served four statements and the court heard short oral evidence from the mother.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 14 October 2021, a referral was made to the local authority by the hospital after the mother made allegations of domestic abuse against the father.  Whilst a more expansive schedule of findings has been provided by the mother, in circumstances where it is for the local authority to prove the threshold criteria pursuant to s.31(2) of the Children Act 1989 I am satisfied that the court should determine those findings sought by the local authority.  Those findings are set out in the final statement of threshold criteria:</p>

Both the mother and the father address the allegations of domestic abuse in their statements and I heard oral evidence from both the mother and the father with respect to the allegations.  The court also heard evidence from PC Bonnington, who attended the father&#8217;s property on 14 October 2021.  I deal with my findings in respect of the allegations below.  The mother has also reported domestic abuse in previous relationships. Information from the police contains nine entries relating to historical allegations of domestic abuse of the mother and include allegations of stalking, harassment, threats to kill, rape, assault and malicious communication.  The mother has stated to assessors that these entries are &#8220;false statements&#8221;.</p>

She had not met him in person but stated an intention to marry him.  The local authority contend that the mother refused to provide to the social worker the surname of this man, his address or his date of birth.  It seeks a finding to that effect.  The court heard oral evidence from the social worker in post at the time, Ms O. She reiterated that whilst the details had ultimately been provided by the mother&#8217;s solicitor after proceedings had commenced, the mother had been asked by the social worker on a number of occasions to provide them but refused.  Ms O stated that she had made attempts to ascertain this information when she visited the mother in hospital, the mother having refused to engage with home visits or local authority meetings. The social worker endeavoured to provide the mother with information about grooming behaviour and advised the mother that, if she intended to meet him, she meet the man in a public place.  The social worker states that the mother resisted this advice on the grounds that it would be disrespectful.  </p>

E was born prematurely on 4 December 2021 after the mother was admitted with pre-eclampsia, her estimated delivery date having been 2 February 2022.  The mother met K for the first time at hospital and confirmed to staff her plans to marry him.  A referral was made by the hospital for an adult safeguarding assessment but the mother did not engage.  On 8 and 9 December 2024, the midwifery service raised issues regarding the state of the mother&#8217;s accommodation, asserting that it was dirty and that no preparations had been made for E&#8217;s arrival.  </p>

She was asked to leave the hospital.  On 14 December 2021, whilst visiting E on hospital, the mother accused staff of switching her baby.  The mother then soiled herself in the visiting bay as a result of taking too much laxative to relieve constipation.  Staff were concerned that the mother had bought trainers for E that were appropriate for a toddler and was using a dirty breast pump to express milk.  The mother refused to engage with social services and again refused support from the adult safeguarding team.  Staff were further concerned as to the time the mother spent away from the ward and her refusal to consent to a scan of E recommended due to a reduction in her growth rate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Proceedings were issued on 4 January 2022.  Following the making of directions on issue and allocation, the matter came before the court on 7 January 2022.  By the order of that date, the case was not allocated to an identified judge but rather was adjourned to a floating list.  The position as to interim placement appears, at best, to have been confused.  DNA testing of the father was directed.  A further hearing took place on 11 January 2022 before a different judge that resulted in a further adjournment to a hearing on 12 January 2022.  This adjournment appears to have been the result of the local authority seeking still further time to locate a residential placement.   At the hearing on 12 January 2022 before the same judge an interim care order was made on the basis that E would be removed and placed in foster care &#8220;as a holding position&#8221;.  The matter returned to court again on 14 January 2022.  The order of that date (which does not carry the name of the judge) gave permission pursuant to s.38(6) of the Children Act 1989 for a residential assessment of the mother.  Permission was given for a cognitive assessment of the mother to be undertaken by a jointly instructed expert.  The order also contained a generic direction that any applications for permission to instruct an expert under FPR Part 25 should be made 48 hours prior to the next hearing.  It is not clear on the face of the order what further Part 25 applications were contemplated.  A fifth case management hearing was listed to take place 26 January 2022.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter came before a third judge on 26 January 2022.  The order from the case management hearing of 26 January 2022 recites that on that date the residential assessment unit had given notice on the placement of the mother and E due to concerns that the mother required prompting with respect to each and every parenting task, including a requirement to prompt her to feed E at the necessary intervals.  Notwithstanding this, the local authority is recorded in the order of 26 January 2022 as searching for an alternative residential assessment unit to undertake a PAMS assessment of the mother.  It is unclear why a further residential assessment placement was being sought in circumstances where the residential assessment approved at the hearing on 14 January 2022 had broken down as described, although it would appear that the Children&#8217;s Guardian was also advocating a further residential placement at an organisation called Symbol.  The order of 26 January 2022 further records that the court and the parties were &#8220;in agreement that there needs to be an urgent assessment of the <span style="font-style:italic">potential</span> deterioration in the Mother&#8217;s mental health&#8221; (emphasis added).  No directions were made, however, towards any assessment of this issue.  Rather, the time for filing &#8220;any&#8221; Part 25 application was extended again to 31 January 2022.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The order of 1 February 2022, which was made by the fourth judge before whom the proceedings had come, directed a PAMS parenting assessment of the mother.  The order of 1 February 2022 further records that Symbol had indicated that it would not accept the mother for a residential assessment without a psychiatric assessment.  The court directed such an assessment.  The assessment was directed even though (a) the court had made no decision on whether a residential assessment at Symbol should be granted pursuant to s.38(6) of the Children Act 1989, (b) the court had <span style="font-style:italic">in any event</span> and by the same order directed a PAMS assessment of the mother to be filed and served by 29 April 2022, (c) aside from generalised concerns expressed by the hospital and residential placement there was no cogent evidence of the mother suffering from a significant mental health condition such as to justify assessment by a psychiatrist (it is not clear whether the mother&#8217;s medical records, which evidence no significant mental health issues, had been obtained prior to the parties seeking permission to instruct an expert psychiatrist) and (d) the court already had a comprehensive expert psychological assessment from Dr Braier.  Permission for a psychiatric assessment of the mother appears to have been given simply on the basis that Symbol had indicated it would not agree to assess the mother without such an assessment and that the parties agreed to an assessment, rather than on the basis of any reasoned decision that such an assessment was considered by the court to be necessary to determine the proceedings justly pursuant to s.13(6) of the Children and Families Act 2014.  It was only at this sixth case management hearing that an assessment by Communicourt was directed to determine whether the mother needed the services of an intermediary during proceedings.  The order of 1 February 2022 again contains a generic direction that &#8220;Any further Part 25 application&#8221; be filed and served &#8220;no later than at least 48 hours before the next court hearing&#8221;.

Ms V noted that the PAMS assessment model had been designed some years ago for assessments in a community setting, a situation different to that being assessed in this case and not one for which the PAMS assessment had been designed. Ms V was also concerned that the data entry requirements of the PAMS software militated against nuance.  In the circumstance, Ms V stated that she utilised the PAMS tools, together with other tools, to tailor the assessment in a bespoke fashion to the mother&#8217;s needs.   Ms V makes clear in her report that she was mindful of the advice given by Dr Braier with respect to the mother&#8217;s cognitive needs.  Ms V further conceded that she had not made any suggestions within her assessment for a programme to assist the mother to make improvements.  Ms V was clear, however, that given the fundamental deficits identified in the assessment to have done so would have set up the mother to fail.

Ms Tucker considered that the main issue was that the mother was unable to read E&#8217;s cues or anticipate her needs and would have to learn or relearn a new skill every time E&#8217;s needs changed as she grew and developed.  In Ms Tucker&#8217;s view, and in line with the conclusions of Ms V, safe parenting by the mother could only be achieved if the mother were to parent E with another adult who could constantly supervise her care and that this would have to be an ongoing situation throughout E&#8217;s minority.  Ms Tucker concluded that (emphasis added):</p>

I do not believe that [the mother] would intentionally harm E in any way, but by not understanding her emotional needs could result in unintentional emotional harm that would impact E&#8217;s emotional development, confidence and self-esteem.  If [the mother] does not understand E&#8217;s health needs, such as sickle cell, any unmet need in this regard would be unsafe.&#8221;</p>

However, Ms Tucker was also clear that the initial parenting assessment of the mother was robust in that the PAMS tools were utilised.   Whilst Ms Tucker conceded to Mr Hall that she would have ideally wanted more time to be allocated to her addendum assessment, and that her addendum assessment ideally should have followed the parenting course completed by the mother in the summer of 2023, having regard to the information gleaned during her addendum assessment, and in particular contained in the contact notes, Ms Tucker considered that the mother remains unable to meet E&#8217;s needs.  In particular, Ms Tucker was clear that the mother remains unable to read cues from E, even though this has been repeatedly modelled in contact.

Finally, he noted that the paternal aunt committed to bringing E back to England for contact with her mother even before the local authority had agreed to fund travel for the first three years for that purpose. Mr D expressed himself to have a &#8220;high degree of confidence&#8221; in the paternal aunt&#8217;s ability to meet E&#8217;s needs.</p>

She has been referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for a splenectomy.  That operation is now scheduled to take place in mid-August at GOSH.  In the Special Guardianship report, Ms Coker raised a concern that sickle cell disease remains one of the top five causes of infant death in West Africa and a concern as to the availability and affordability of drugs and medical screening in Ghana to ensure that E&#8217;s Sickle cell is well managed. Ms Coker recommended that consultation take place with clinicians managing E in this jurisdiction and the hospital in Accra to obtain advice on how well E&#8217;s condition can be managed in Ghana.  In the circumstances, the court has sought to confirm the extent to which E&#8217;s ongoing medical needs arising from her sickle cell disease can be met were she to move to live with her paternal aunt in that jurisdiction.</p>

In her final analysis and recommendations, the Children&#8217;s Guardian notes the mother&#8217;s &#8220;unwavering desire to care for her daughter [E]&#8221; but is clear in her assessment that the mother does not have the capacity to care for E.  During her oral evidence, Children&#8217;s Guardian confirmed that she considered Ms V&#8217;s assessment to have been robust in using the PAMS tools to underpin a more holistic approach to assessment.  Whilst the Children&#8217;s Guardian conceded that it was &#8220;quite unusual&#8221; for a parenting assessment of a parent with learning difficulties not to contain proposals for work, that situation emphasises the size of the gap that would have to be bridged in order for the mother to be in a position safely to parent E, with no foundation to build on to seek to achieve that end.  Cross examined by Mr Hall on behalf of the mother, the Children&#8217;s Guardian conceded that the addendum parenting assessment had been completed before the mother undertook a parenting course, but considered the practical modelling done with the mother in contact to be far more valuable.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian was clear that that contact continued to demonstrate that the mother does not possess even the basic skills to recognise E&#8217;s needs in the moment and meet those needs.</p>

In the circumstances, the Children&#8217;s Guardian continues to recommend that E be made the subject to an SGO in favour of the paternal aunt.  Whilst the Children&#8217;s Guardian acknowledged when pressed by Mr Hall that there is a degree of risk inherent in a transition plan that contemplates E&#8217;s move to the care of her paternal aunt in Ghana immediately after recovering from surgery, she considered that a swift transition plan is, in fact, preferable for E to a drawn out process given E&#8217;s age.</p>

The father accepts that he drinks on occasion, although he denied getting drunk.  The father conceded in evidence that he had been notified on that day that he was being made redundant, consistent with the mother&#8217;s account that the father was not happy when he came home from work and started drinking before re-directing his anger and frustration towards her. As with the later incident on 14 October 2021, the flash point was the mother seeking to leave the property.  As with 14 October 2021, the alleged abuse involved the mother&#8217;s neck.  Whilst completing the subsequent DASH questionnaire on 3 September 2021 the mother answered no when asked about strangulation, I do not consider that answer to be inconsistent with her allegation that the father had attempted to grab her neck having regard to the mother&#8217;s cognitive limitations.  The mother was prepared to concede that the father poking her in the eye may have been accidental in the ensuring struggle. In concluding that on 1 September 2021 the father was drunk and poked the mother in the eye and grabbed her neck, I have borne in mind my findings with respect to the incident on 14 October 2021.</p>

The father does not dispute that an argument occurred between the parents on 14 October 2021.  As with the earlier incident on 1 September 2021, the flash point was the mother seeking to leave the property.   Whilst the father denied being drunk, he sought in evidence to change his story with respect to drinking on this occasion, asserting before the court that he had not been drinking on 14 October 2021 when he had told the police that he had drunk a can of Heineken.  Both police officers who encountered the father on 14 October 2021 considered him to be highly intoxicated and I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he was.   I also have regard to the fact that the first statement made by the mother to the police officers from the window of the property was &#8220;He pushed my head against the floor just now&#8221;.  It is further significant that the first statement made by the father to the officers was &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about what she has to say&#8221;.  The mother repeated her allegation of being strangled and choked by the father when the DASH questionnaire was undertaken later, stating &#8220;He choked me earlier as I wanted to go home&#8221;.

The mother was bringing K to the hospital to see E.  The mother&#8217;s refusal to provide details of K to the local authority deprived it of any opportunity to undertake safeguarding checks on that individual.

At the age of two years old, E is not able to articulate her wishes and feelings.  It is reasonable to assume, however, that she would wish to be cared for within her family, ideally by one or both of her parents.   In terms of her physical needs, E has the same needs as any child her age but beyond that, and in particular, she requires care that recognises her serious medical condition and provides a level of parenting commensurate with the need to monitor and manage that medical condition.  E&#8217;s primary carer must be aware of and respond quickly to any signs that she is experiencing a sickle cell crisis.  E&#8217;s emotional and educational needs are the same as for any child her age.   In the context of this case, it is important to note that, like all children, as E grows and develops her physical, emotional and educational needs will change over time and become more complex. Within this context, E will require a primary carer who is able to understand, acknowledge and adapt to her changing needs over the course of her minority.  E is a child of Nigerian and Sierra-Leonian heritage and it is important that this is recognised in meeting her needs.  A family placement would provide the optimum means of ensuring this need is met.</p>

In particular, the evidence before the court demonstrates that, over the extended period of these proceedings, the mother has been highly focussed on, and clearly wants to do her best for, E.  Her attendance has been punctual at her supervised contact sessions with E which have been taking place three times per week over an extended period.  Despite her limitations the mother took the assessment process very seriously and her telephone communication was good during the assessments.  The mother has managed to establish and maintain positive relationships with the Contact Supervisors.  She has been consistently polite in her interactions and does not generally become defensive when advice or feedback is given.  She has been able to manage her own basic needs sufficiently.  She has demonstrated an ability to sustain employment, manage her finances and manage her tenancy.   The mother was in mainstream education.  Notwithstanding these matters however, I am satisfied that the assessments of the mother, and the course of contact to date, demonstrate beyond peradventure that the mother does not have the capacity to meet the welfare needs of E.  </p>

However, whilst some of Mr Hall&#8217;s criticisms have a degree of force when they are considered in isolation and applied at the time the relevant assessment was completed, looked at as a whole I am satisfied that the assessments of the mother carried out over the long course of these proceedings, and the extensive contact notes chronicling the extensive support and modelling work that has been undertaken with the mother in those contact sessions, provides a solid forensic foundation for the court to determine how capable the mother is of meeting E&#8217;s needs.  I do not consider that Ms V assessment was deficient by reason of her not having utilised the PAMS software.  Ms V undertook a comprehensive assessment utilising the PAMS tools.  Whilst both Ms Tucker and the Children&#8217;s Guardian pointed out some difficulties with the absence of empirical figures when it came to considering progress, both were satisfied that Ms V&#8217;s assessment was robust and that longitudinal information on the mother&#8217;s progress on the issues of concern is provided, and in the view of the Children&#8217;s Guardian was better provided, by the notes of the contacts in which the mother has been supported and assisted with continued modelling and reinforcement.</p>

This notwithstanding that, during the course of contact sessions spanning many months, advice and modelling of parenting tasks has been consistently repeated.  These difficulties are further exacerbated by the fact that the mother, as she recently informed the Children&#8217;s Guardian, does not feel she needs any support or help to care for E.  </p>

In this regard, Mr Hall pointed to the requirement articulated by the Court of Appeal for the court to identify and describe the support required, ascertain what can and should be done under the local authority&#8217;s obligations and determine whether, with the support in place, the child&#8217;s welfare needs will be met.</p>

However, adopting the discipline articulated in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Parents with Learning Difficulties: Risk of Harm)</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>the level of support identified by Ms V, Ms Tucker and the Children&#8217;s Guardian that the mother would need in order to parent E is variously formulated as constant, such that the mother would need another suitable adult to take on the role of primary carer, as requiring the mother to parent E with another adult who can constantly supervise her care and, in the words of the Children&#8217;s Guardian, as requiring &#8220;24/7 moment to moment support&#8221;.   Such twenty four hour support plainly extends beyond that which the local authority is obligated to provide pursuant to s.17 of the Children Act 1989.  It is further difficult to see how E&#8217;s welfare needs would be met by a placement where her mother is only a parent in name, with her primary care being met by professionals all day, every day for the remainder of her minority.  Sadly, there are no family members who would be able to provide the mother with that level of support.  </p>

The care plan advanced by the local authority falls to be considered on its merits in determining which course before the court best discharges the duty to afford paramount consideration to E&#8217;s welfare, having regard to the principle of proportionality under Art 8(2) of the ECHR.  Applying those principles, I am satisfied that it is E&#8217;s best interests to be placed with her paternal aunt under an SGO order and for permission to be given for the paternal aunt to remove E from the jurisdiction.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The contents of the Special Guardianship report have not been challenged.  The report demonstrates that the paternal aunt is a very experienced parent who has successfully raised three children of her own, two of whom are now in tertiary education.  Whilst parenting E&#8217;s medical needs will bring with it challenges that were not present for the paternal aunt when bringing up her own children, the evidence before the court demonstrates that the paternal aunt has engaged proactively and in detail with the arrangements for the care and management of E&#8217;s sickle cell disease in Ghana, which jurisdiciton is evidently well equipped to deal with E&#8217;s medical condition.  Whilst I further accept that a placement with the paternal aunt in Ghana will represent a very significant change of circumstances for E, in particular in that it will represent a wholly new environment and a radical reduction in the level of contact between E and her mother and father with whom she will not be living, I am satisfied that those disadvantages are outweighed by the welfare benefits of E being cared for within her family by a primary carer who is able to meet her needs, including her needs arising out of her heritage.  The willingness of the paternal aunt to travel regularly to England to facilitate direct contact will further mitigate the impact on the significant change of circumstances inherent in the care plan advanced by the local authority.</p>

As the Children&#8217;s Guardian made clear, the fact that the proposed plan involves E moving to the care of the paternal aunt immediately following her recovery from surgery must be a matter that gives the court pause.  As made clear by Sir James Munby in <span style="font-style:italic">Re P-S (Children) </span>[2018] 4 WLR 99 at [68], if the child has never lived with the proposed Special Guardian the court will need to consider what steps need to be taken and over what period to test the proposed placement, in respect of which question the opinion of professionals will be of crucial importance.   Having regard to the evidence of the professionals in this case, I am satisfied that the transition plan across two months by which E&#8217;s will move into the care of the paternal aunt is appropriate, subject always to the need for flexibility having regard to any change of circumstances consequent on E&#8217;s forthcoming surgery.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">E was introduced to her paternal aunt in September 2023.  The Children&#8217;s Guardian observed paternal aunt with E on 29 September 2023. E had already spent the majority of the week with her as part of the planned introductions. They were seen to be developing a familiar and trusting relationship with E seeking comfort and reassurance from her aunt.  The paternal aunt appeared calm, patient and unphased in her care of E.  The paternal aunt has continued to have indirect and direct contact with E since that time, including extensive unsupervised contact with her during December 2023.   She will be present in the jurisdiciton and having contact with E during E&#8217;s medical treatment and thereafter in order to increase E&#8217;s feelings of stability and security in her new carer. The professionals consider that the paternal aunt presents as experienced, confident and committed to care for E.  As I have noted, she is an extremely experienced parent in her own right.  Once again, the paternal aunt has been proactive in preparing to manage E&#8217;s medical needs, having already established contact with the clinical team in Accra and having used that team to gain knowledge of E&#8217;s condition and its management.  In these circumstances, and again subject to the flexibility required in the context of E&#8217;s recovery from surgery, I am satisfied that the two month transition period is appropriate.</p>

That these matters of poor practice are still occurring demonstrates that the provisions of the PD12A are still not being applied consistently and with sufficient rigour by the courts, legal practitioners and welfare professionals.</p>

It is what the <span style="font-style:italic">law</span> requires.  Section 1(2) of the Children Act 1989 commands the court, as a matter of law, to have regard to the general principle that delay in determining any question with respect to the upbringing of a child is likely to prejudice the welfare of that child.  Section 32(1)(a) of the 1989 Act requires, again as a matter of law, the court to draw up a timetable with a view to determining public law proceedings without delay and, in any event, within 26 weeks.  As Sir James Munby P observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Parenting Assessment)</span> [2014] 2 FLR 575:</p>

A balance must be struck between the need for information and the presumptive prejudice to the child of delay as enshrined in s.1(2) of the Act (see <span style="font-style:italic">S-L (Children)(Care Orders: Adjournment)</span> [2019] EWCA Civ 1571).  However, the extent to which the 26 week period can be extended is strictly circumscribed by reference to the child&#8217;s welfare and the impact on the duration and conduct of the proceedings.   Pursuant to s.32(5) of the Act, the court may only extend the 26 week period if it considers an extension necessary to enable the court to resolve the proceedings justly.  In considering the justice of the case, the legal requirement in s.1(2) of the 1989 Act to have regard to the prejudicial effect on the child of delay will weigh heavily in the balance.  To repeat, s.32(7) provides that such extensions are not to be granted routinely and require <span style="font-style:italic">specific</span> justification.</p>

The failure in this case to comply with law governing delay and the case management of proceedings under Part IV of the Children Act 1989 has led to a new-born child remaining in foster care for over two years whilst the errors and omissions summarised above played out before nine different judges over seventeen hearings involving thirty-three different advocates.  The adverse impact on E cannot and should not be underestimated.  As the Children&#8217;s Guardian rightly observes:</p>

Her life is regularly interrupted by professional visits and meetings concerning her welfare. Coupled with her significant health needs, her lived experience to date is marked by considerable ambiguity but also the emotional and physical strain of being a very young child in care. The longer this has continued, the more likely E will be affected by the changes in her circumstance when the time comes to move on to her permanent placement.&#8221;</p>

However, to continue to pursue assessments in the face of clear forensic evidence that a parent does not have the capacity to parent their child not only causes prejudicial delay for the child.  It also amounts, ultimately, to cruelty masquerading as hope for the parent.</p>
