The question arises specifically in relation to an award made under the Family Law Arbitration Financial Scheme.  This scheme was started by the Institute of Family Law Arbitrators (&#8220;ILFA&#8221;) and I refer to it as the ILFA Financial Scheme as this is a common abbreviation.  ILFA has a separate scheme for disputes involving children and this judgment does not touch upon that scheme. </p>

W is not currently working and clearly found the financial relief proceedings extremely stressful.

On 10/11 July 2018 the parties signed an arbitration application form on the ARB1 FS form agreeing on arbitration under the Family Law Arbitration Financial Scheme.   For both court hearings the parties had instructed counsel. The parties agreed to appoint Mr Gavin Smith who is a very experienced and respected family arbitrator.

Originally a single ILFA scheme was launched in 2012.  The current rules for the ILFA Financial scheme are dated 1 January 2018. Parties agree to arbitrate in accordance with the rules by means of signing the ARBFS1 form. A primary purpose of the scheme is for the parties to achieve finality in their dispute.  As Sir Peter Singer wrote in an article following the scheme&#8217;s launch (reported at [2012] Fam Law 1496), its purpose is to meet the needs of people experiencing relationship breakdown who &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">wish their financial dispute to be dealt with as swiftly, cheaply, privately and with as little acrimony as is possible</span>&#8221;.   </p>

Sir James Munby&#8217;s comment that there was no conceptual difference between an arbitration agreement and a pre-nuptial agreement (or a settlement agreement as was in issue in <span style="font-style:italic">L v L</span>) perhaps requires further consideration.  To equate the legal effect of an arbitration agreement with that of a pre-nuptial agreement probably fails sufficiently to recognise that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> has given very specific consequences to an arbitration agreement, the commencement of arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement and the arbitration award made in the arbitration.

The grounds for the application were supervening circumstances and a mistake.  Mostyn J concluded that it would be impossible to raise these grounds of challenge in an ordinary arbitration (see paragraph 15).  Mostyn J gave a masterful and useful account of arbitration which is a helpful resource for all family practitioners.  His starting point was the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Arbitration Act 1996</ref> and the limited means of recourse under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>, commenting as follows: </p>

I would not go that far, as this would appear to rule out a challenge on the ground of a vitiating mistake or a supervening event. If a challenge were to be made out on one or other such ground it would in my judgment be a plainly wrong exercise of discretion for the court to incorporate an award nonetheless. I agree with Mr Chamberlayne QC in this regard.  However I do agree with Mr Pointer QC that when exercising its discretion following an arbitral award the court should adopt an approach of great stringency, even more so than it would in an agreement case. In opting for arbitration the parties have agreed a specific form of alternative dispute resolution and it is important that they understand that in the overwhelming majority of cases the dispute will end with the arbitral award. It would be the worst of all worlds if parties thought that the arbitral process was to be no more than a dry run and that a rehearing in court was readily available. </span></p>

If following an arbitral award evidence emerges which would, if the award had been in an order of the court entitle the court to set aside its order on the grounds of mistake or supervening event, then the court is entitled to refuse to incorporate the arbitral award in its order and instead to make a different order reflecting the new evidence. Outside the heads of correction, challenge or appeal within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> these are, in my judgment, the only realistically available grounds of resistance to an incorporating order. An assertion that the award was "wrong" or "unjust" will almost never get off the ground: in such a case the error must be so blatant and extreme that it leaps off the page.&#8221; </span></p>

So, the question is usually confined to an analysis of (un)foreseeability. I agree with Hale J that the new or later event must have been unforeseeable. If relief were granted on the basis of the arrival of a foreseeable event then that would amount to exercising a disguised power of variation on proof of a mere change of circumstances, where Parliament has specifically declined to enact such a power.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.73in;margin-right:0.04in">In drawing these conclusions I recognise that the court retains discretion over any order made and the parties cannot by agreement oust the court&#8217;s jurisdiction under Part II of the MCA 1925. This is expressly recognised in the wording of ARB1FS. However, it is not necessary or appropriate to imply from these words an agreement that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> restrictions do not apply generally, or that the court&#8217;s jurisdiction shall be extended in two limited respects, namely to allow intervention for supervening events and mistake.  Much clearer wording would be needed to achieve this, especially where the parties expressly agreed that the arbitration would be governed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>. In this respect I do not share Mostyn J&#8217;s view of the construction of ARBFS1 in <span style="font-style:italic">DB v DLJ.</span>  In any event, it is doubtful that an agreement would be effective to enlarge the court&#8217;s jurisdiction where there are mandatory statutory provisions limiting the court&#8217;s jurisdiction (for example <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/68" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 68</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>).   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.73in;margin-right:0.04in">The wording of ARBFS1 recognises the fact that ordinarily parties will seek to obtain a consent order when they have obtained an award. It requires the parties to apply to court &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">if and so far as the subject matter of the award makes it necessary&#8221;.  </span>This does not make a court application necessary in every case and Sir James Munby P&#8217;s Practice Guidance also supports this view.  The wording is directed at situations where a family court order is necessary, typically for the purpose of a pension sharing order or achieving a clean break.  It is difficult to infer from the ARBFS1 wording that the parties have agreed that an arbitration award will have no binding effect unless and until a court order was granted. This would also run contrary to the guidance given by Sir James Munby P and mean that an award is merely a precursor to a judicial investigation.  This would undermine the purpose of ILFA financial arbitration in achieving a final resolution of disputes. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> does not require such a conclusion.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 25</ref> imposes a duty on the court to investigate matters if asked to make an order.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.73in;margin-right:0.04in">As explained, an award is binding on the parties without need for a court order. Where a party who has taken part in the arbitration wishes to challenge an award under the ILFA scheme the onus lies on that party to seek an order varying the award, setting it aside, remitting it or declaring it has no effect.  The primary remedies are laid down in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>.

The notice to show cause procedure (or an application that the award not be made an order of the court under <span style="font-style:italic">DB v DLJ</span>)<span style="font-style:italic"/>does not enable a party to avoid or circumvent <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>.  The 28 day time limit means that any attempt to resile from an arbitration award should ordinarily first be made in an arbitration claim.  The court deciding that application may be asked to decide any separate point (for instance supervening circumstances) and the proceedings will result in a court order, typically confirming the award, varying it, remitting it back to the arbitrator or setting it aside.  The arbitration claim will be transferred to the Family Division of the High Court (not the Family Court) and the court will take full account of the matters set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>. </p>

However, Sir James Munby P recognised the availability of arbitration claims under Part 62 of the Civil Procedure Rules.  To regard the &#8220;notice to show cause&#8221; procedure as the primary means of challenging an award runs counter to this.

Even though W had the benefit of very experienced counsel (and solicitors&#8217; assisting her in part) there was confusion as to what regime applied and what rules she needed to comply with. She had to obtain an allocation within the Family Court to High Court Judge level and tailored directions were required. The process cannot be regarded as an easier or more efficient alternative to an arbitration claim. The procedures applicable to arbitration claims under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> were not drawn up solely for dealing with civil and commercial claims.  Arbitration is used in much wider fields including employment, partnership and consumer claims.

For example, under the Arbitration Act the arbitrator is given notice of any challenge so there is an opportunity to answer allegations of misconduct, irregularity or mistake.  In addition, challenge under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> confers a right of re-hearing in disputes as to whether the tribunal has jurisdiction under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/67" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 67</ref>.  This statutory right to challenge the award confers a firmer and more predictable framework than the <span style="font-style:italic">ad hoc </span>and abbreviated &#8220;notice to show cause&#8221; procedure applicable in this case.  <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 1996 Act</ref> enables challenges based on irregularities in the procedure (e.g. bias and unfair procedures) to be dealt with before an award is made as well as afterwards.  Family Court procedures do not appear to provide effective safeguards to remedy such irregularities until an award is made.  A further point is that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref> enables the court to order that the matter be immediately remitted back to the arbitrator.  The &#8220;notice to show cause&#8221; procedure means that if W&#8217;s case had merit the parties would be faced with going back to an unknown judge in the Family Court and losing much of the benefit of having their chosen arbitrator who had investigated their case fully and acted promptly throughout.  In addition, the &#8220;notice to show cause&#8221; procedure does not entail the variation of an award or it being set aside (since such orders are governed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23" uk:canonical="1996 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1996 Act</ref>) so it leaves uncertainty as to the status of an award.   </p>

I accept that the arbitrator did not have evidence as to how borrowers would respond to a staged maintenance payment and that the staged maintenance will make it more difficult for her to obtain a mortgage as she has not yet reached the predicted earning capacity and is selfemployed. However, Mr Gooderham&#8217;s advice does not invalidate the prospects of W obtaining a mortgage as envisaged by the arbitrator.  Mr Gooderham&#8217;s advice did not give account for the fact that W will have a 58% share of the equity in the matrimonial home and that she will have the benefit of a civil service pension (or equivalent) and a lump sum in that pension aged 60. The arbitrator was correct to regard these factors as helpful in obtaining a mortgage. Mr Gooderham also did not give account to W&#8217;s earning capacity as found by the arbitrator, and which was not challenged. Accordingly, Mr Gooderham&#8217;s opinion cannot be regarded as an absolute bar to the obtaining of a mortgage as envisaged by the arbitrator. </p>

In particular, it was said to be relevant that the parties&#8217; hands had been forced because they had been let down by the court service.   It was submitted that this diluted the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">magnetic factor&#8221; </span>that would be attached to an arbitration agreement.  I accept H&#8217;s argument that the parties had freely entered into arbitration with the benefit of legal advice.  I do not consider that the parties&#8217; concern regarding delay in court hearings dilutes the significance to be attached to the arbitration agreement. I cannot usefully investigate the parties&#8217; subjective motives in arbitrating but I can take into account that a prompt conclusion to the dispute was chosen in favour of waiting several months for a court hearing.   </p>

I consider that the arbitrator correctly took the view that these debts did not represent wanton and reckless dissipation (indeed that point had sensibly not featured in W&#8217;s case because the debts were mainly legal costs of similar magnitude to W&#8217;s costs).  He was entitled to conclude that where there were limited resources to meet the parties&#8217; housing needs, H&#8217;s debts should not preclude him finding a home that would accommodate the children.  I can understand that W feels aggrieved that she paid her legal costs out of her own funds whereas parts of H&#8217;s costs have been shared.  However, as a matter of fairness and recognising the needs of the children, the arbitrator was entitled to place a priority on enabling H to buy a home where the children could stay. </p>

At very highest it would amount to a mixed question of fact and law as to the correct exercise of discretion in deciding on the allocation of debts under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref> and would not justify re-opening an award under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/23/section/69" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s69</ref>.  The decision would also not justify an appeal against a judgment of the Family Court so W has been placed in no worse a position by reason of the decision being made in arbitration. </p>

W sought an order for costs in the event of succeeding and suggested that although the court had a broad discretion the application did not fall within rule 28(3) of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 and that one party winning should weigh heavily in the court&#8217;s discretion.  In this respect I was also asked to take into account the affordability of costs in a case where finances were tight.  </p>
