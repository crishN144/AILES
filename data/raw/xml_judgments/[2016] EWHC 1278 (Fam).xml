She moved from the care of her mother to live with her father in March 2015. It is now agreed by the mother and EH, supported by the Local Authority and the Children&#8217;s Guardian, that A should continue to live with her father and spend time, as agreed, with her mother under the auspices of a Child Arrangements Order. I agree. </p>

It applied for placements in respect of each of them on 6 October 2015 (T) and 2 November 2015 (W and H). The local authority&#8217;s care plans provide for the children to be placed in an adoptive home together. If, however, after twelve months it has not proved possible to do so, the local authority will reassess the care plan and consider placing the children separately for adoption. </p>

She concedes she cannot care for the children but opposes the plan for the children to be adopted. She supports the children being placed in the care of her brother, G, who is 25 years old, and his partner, K, who is 24 years old, under whatever legal framework the court considers most appropriate. If the court does not approve the children being placed with them, the mother would invite the court to approve the children being placed in long term foster care. </p>

Like the mother they oppose the children being placed for adoption and if their application is not successful, they support the children being placed in long term foster care. They acknowledge that the children could not safely return to live with their mother. </p>

I wish to pay tribute to them, as did Ms Walker, counsel for the children&#8217;s guardian, in the course of her closing submissions. They conducted themselves with great dignity and co-operated with the legal teams for the other parties. They were polite to all involved. K, who acted as spokesperson for himself and his partner, presented their case eloquently and economically. They suffered no disadvantage as result of, perforce, their circumstances, being litigants in person. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority have been closely involved with the mother and the children for many years. The theme of neglect has been virtually constant. The school attendance of the older three children was very poor, medical appointments were regularly missed, the children were seen in dirty ill fitting clothes, they were often dirty and hungry and the home conditions were invariably exceedingly poor. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">G and K were regular visitors to the mother&#8217;s home. They have been in a stable relationship since 2012. During that time, however, they have had no stable home life and have vacillated between living, for short periods, in rented accommodation or with family members. There is an issue about the period of time they lived at the mother&#8217;s home. I shall consider that issue later in this judgment. Suffice to say that between February and June 2015 they were, at the very least, very regular visitors to the mother&#8217;s home. </p>

Shortly prior thereto the mother was arrested for threatening to kill the current social worker. Ultimately the police did not proceed to charge her with any offence. At the hearing on 13 January the mother was extremely volatile and making threats of harm to the extent that the social workers and the advocates felt very vulnerable. The District Judge made contact with me and she allocated the case to me. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A placement for adoption has the singular disadvantages of causing the children to cease to be members of their birth family and of terminating the relationship between them and their sister, their mother, their father, G and K and other family members. I do not underestimate these disadvantages. </p>

Simply put, I am completely satisfied that nothing else will do in the welfare best interests of these children. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When I granted permission for Mr Eyles to undertake an independent assessment of G and K as carers for the three younger children, I had very much hoped the assessment would be positive and support them as long term carers for T, W and H. It did not do so. I have accepted the opinions and conclusions of Mr Eyles and of the social worker and the children&#8217;s guardian. The consequence of the same is that placing those three younger children with G and K is not, in any sense, a realistic option. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">G and K both have very positive qualities. I echo what Mr Eyles said about his report, namely that I would not wish this judgment to be used to prevent either G or K to care for other children in the future. They have a mutually supportive and strong relationship. Many of the factors which have militated against them caring for the children are beyond their control, most principally, the irrational, unpredictable and impulsive behaviour of the mother. Sadly when they sought to assist and support the mother in her care of the children, despite doing the best they could, it was found to be wanting, as they themselves in large measure accept. </p>
