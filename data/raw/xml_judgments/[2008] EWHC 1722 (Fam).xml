	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case raises points that have been the subject of earlier decisions of the courts relating to the adoption of a child by a member of his or her family who live abroad.  The earlier cases demonstrate that problems arise from the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> (the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>).

This is why I joined the Department to these proceedings.  I am grateful to its representatives for providing helpful submissions at short notice.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The child was born in August 2006 and is therefore approaching her second birthday. When the care order was made in January 2007 the plan was for adoption.  The family put forward several family members as potential adopters and the only ones considered viable are a paternal uncle and aunt who live in the USA (Mr and Mrs N) with their five children.  If the child is not adopted by them she would have to be placed outside the family.  It is thought that it would be relatively easy to find appropriate non-family adopters for her in this country.  A tension therefore arises between the potential advantages of a family placement and the time table for the child.</p>

However the local authority is of the opinion, in my view correctly, that at present it does not have sufficient information to reach a properly informed view on this.</p>

But as yet they have not given permission to the child&#8217;s placement for adoption with Mr and Mrs N (or generally) and no placement order has been made.  If, but only if and after, the assessment process is positive, the plan envisages parental support for a placement for adoption with Mr and Mrs N.  In my view it follows that if a placement order was sought now, or after the child had been living with Mr and Mrs N, it could well be successfully resisted on the basis that the parents favour (and after proper investigation would agree to) an adoption by Mr and Mrs N.  To my knowledge it has not yet been decided whether a placement order, in respect of a child whose welfare will be best promoted by adoption, and who is ready for adoption, can be resisted on the basis that the parents indicate that they will (or may when proper investigations have been completed) consent to a placement for adoption with named people.  The issue relates to the ability of birth parents to give permission for a placement with named prospective adopters (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/19/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 19(1)</ref>(a) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>) and the power given to a local authority by a placement order to place with any prospective adopters of its choice (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/21/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 21(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>).</p>

I am of this view because if there was such an impediment, or if the uncertainties of law or fact relating to the making of such an order were significant this would, or could, render the overall plan one that the court should not support by giving permission under paragraph 19 of Schedule 2 to the Children Act or by making the declaration sought.  </p>

In this context a point also arises under Article 17 of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Convention).</p>

But in others they may not feel able to do this.

To my mind this is so in the case of a Convention Adoption Order as well as a foreign adoption in a non-Convention country notwithstanding the detailed provisions (along the lines no doubt of those in Regulations 12 to 34 of AFER 2005) in a Convention country relating to the making of the adoption order and the return of the child if it is not made. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the risk of a child being abducted, or left adrift in a foreign country if a placement for assessment (or after a parental responsibility order was made) was to break down in my view there is force in the points that (a) the court is familiar with the assessment of similar risks when giving permission for children to be taken abroad in other contexts, and (b) under the proposals of the local authority the risks consequent on a breakdown (both before and after the making of a parental responsibility order) are greatly ameliorated by the active participation of the relevant public body in the USA.  In my judgment those risks would not found a refusal to give approval under paragraph 19 of Schedule 2 to the Children Act.</p>

Indeed if this plan is prohibited in line with the views expressed by Black J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">EEC v M</span> it seems to me that on the particular facts of this case that would be a triumph for state control (and in particular a rigid adherence to an approach that encompassed both local authority and other placements) over the promotion of the welfare of the individual child in this case.</p>

In my view this view is reinforced by the power to make regulations under s. 86.  So in my view the facts that (a) the underlying purpose of the plan is to assess and if appropriate promote an adoption abroad, and thus (b) it would not be embarked upon if it was not thought that there was a good prospect that it could be established that the making of a parental responsibility order and a foreign adoption order would best promote the welfare of the child, means that at Step 1 it is within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 85(1)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>.</p>

The existence of paragraph 19(6), which  disapplies <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 85</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> where a child is to live outside England and Wales with paragraph 19 approval of the court tells us that after you have excluded all those children whom the local authority it is &#8220;placing ---- for adoption&#8221; and to whom, by virtue of paragraph 19(9), paragraph 19 does not apply, there remains a category of children to whom paragraph 19 <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> apply who might come within the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 85</ref> i.e. children who are being removed from the country &#8220;for the purpose of adoption&#8221;.  If it were not so, there would be no need of paragraph 19(6).  It follows that being removed from the country &#8220;for the purpose of adoption&#8221; and being placed for adoption are not precisely the same thing.  Given that there can be little doubt that placing abroad for adoption is a species of removal for the purpose of adoption, placement for adoption must therefore necessarily be a narrower concept than removal for the purpose of adoption.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst I agree that often under the domestic regime a child does not live with prospective adopters until he or she has been placed for adoption with them as prospective adopters, this is not always the case both before and after the care plan becomes one for adoption (with or without a back up).  So, for example, a foster placement can change to one for adoption.  Indeed this is expressly contemplated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/18/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 18 (1)</ref>(b) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> and in my view when a child is so left he or she is placed for adoption as that concept is used elsewhere in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> (e.g. in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/42/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 42(7)</ref>) and the status of the carers changes to one of prospective adopters.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Department argues that paragraph 92 of the judgment of Neuberger LJ (as he then was) in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re A (Adoption: Placement Outside the Jurisdiction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 2 FLR 337" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 2 FLR 337</ref> supports its contention that &#8220;placing a child for adoption&#8221; should be construed in paragraph 19(9) as, or as referring to the same concept as removing a child from the jurisdiction for the purpose of adoption.  I do not agree.   This case was dealing with paragraph 19 of Schedule 2 to the Children Act and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref> and thus with the situation before the addition of sub-paragraph 19(9), and when the offence was defined by the phrase &#8220;with a view to the adoption of the child&#8221;.  Part of the background was that as a freeing order had been made the children were not in the care of the local authority but were looked after children (see paragraph 25 of the judgments) and therefore sub-paragraph paragraph 19(1) did not apply and so neither did sub-paragraph 19(6) (which then referred to the offence under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/56" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 56</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref> rather than <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/85" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 85</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> but otherwise was in the same terms) on its language.  This is because paragraph 19(6) refers to a child living outside England and Wales with the approval of the court, and that approval can only be given if the child is in the care of the local authority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The passage relied on by the Department is directed to the argument whether the children had been &#8220;placed for adoption&#8221; within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/20/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 20(1)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36" uk:canonical="1976 c. 36" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption Act 1976</ref> (a trigger provision to an application to setting aside a freeing order).  It was therefore dealing with a different type of issue and the conclusion was that the children had been so placed notwithstanding that the placement had been unlawful.  To my mind the passage relied on that the phrases &#8220;has been placed for adoption&#8221; and to a child having been taken out of the jurisdiction &#8220;with a view to [his] adoption&#8221; being concerned with the same concept is not a necessary part of the reasoning. Although I would not in that context dispute that conclusion, the same result (namely that for <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/36/section/20/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 20 (1)</ref>(b) (and other sections) an unlawful placement for adoption was a placement for adoption) could have been founded on (a) the assertion that the wider phrase included the narrower one and rendered the placement in that case unlawful, or (b) as it was at the beginning of paragraph 92, and in paragraph 93, of the judgment without any reference to the consistency or overlap of the concepts derived from the two phrases.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The combined effect of paras 19(1) and (6) is that where a child is in the care of a local authority, then the child may be sent abroad, for instance for the purpose of living with prospective adoptive parents, without the serious impediment of those prospective adopters having to come to the UK for 26 weeks.&#8221;</p>

On the Department&#8217;s argument this distinction does not include any of the steps proposed by the local authority in this case.  It goes back to its acceptance of the conclusion reached by Coleridge J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Plymouth CC v CR and others</span> and is based on the definition or explanation of what is included in the concept of &#8220;removing a child from the UK&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 85(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref>.</p>

I agree that this can be said to be a pointer that until such regulations are made prospective adopters who are members of the child&#8217;s family are in the same position as those who are not.  The Department says that, although there is no equivalent power to disapply <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/84/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 84(4)</ref>, no such power is required because, if the power to disapply or modify <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/85/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 85(1)</ref> was exercised, the prohibition on a relative taking a child out of the country for the purpose of adoption without a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/84" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 84</ref> order would no longer apply.

They are very detailed and in effect they require the adoption agency to conduct a thorough investigation of the case themselves and produce reports which are in all particulars effectively the same reports that would be provided in an adoption case. Regulation 10 also makes express reference to the Adoption Agencies Regulations 2005 and, and the requirements in Regulations 17 and 18 in particular. Those in turn are very detailed, and again really require the agency, in this case the local authority, as it were a domestic adoption application and undertake the detailed duties that they will have under those regulations in full in a case such as this.</p>

In my view adoption is for good reasons an area that is governed by detailed regulations and there would be advantage in avoiding a piecemeal development through case law of the steps to be taken in respect of  foreign adoptions (see further below under the heading &#8220;Regulations&#8221;).</p>

Regulations 10 and 48 AFER 2005 also introduce other provisions of the AAR 2005.  To my mind by both routes the duties referred to in Parts 4 and 5 of AAR 2005, and the provisions of Schedules 1 and 4 thereof are indirectly imported because these underpin what has to be included in relevant reports and what has to be done in taking relevant steps.  I agree that the Family Procedure (Adoption) Rules 2005 (FP(A)R 2005) and Practice Directions supporting them are imported and relevant (I was in particular referred to Part D of the PD supporting Rule 29(3) which like other parts of the PD has an overlap with duties imposed by the AAR 2005 and the provisions of the Schedules 1 and 4 thereof).  Part 3 AAR 2005 and Regulation 36 (reviews) in Part 6 AAR 2005 are expressly imported.</p>

This general qualification is not expressed elsewhere in the AFER 2005 but in my view it, and in particular the reference to the nature of the provision, reflects the purposive and sensible approach that the cases have shown has to be taken  to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ACA 2002</ref> and thus also in my view to the relevant Regulations.  </p>

To my mind the general answer to these arguments is that they are not determinative of these issues and whether they point in one direction or the other it is likely that on a purposive and sensible approach they can be complied with.  </p>

But none of the arguments advanced before me in respect of such detail has caused me to conclude that if the local authority&#8217;s plan is implemented and results in it placing the child for adoption with Mr and Mrs N and supporting the making of a parental responsibility order in their favour, the court would not make, or would be likely not to make, that order because relevant regulations etc. have not been or will not be complied with.</p>

It was contended that a child was so entrusted if his or her day to day care was handed over.  This is a wider approach than the Department&#8217;s argument that at Step 1 the child was being &#8220;placed for adoption with prospective adopters&#8221; and therefore potentially encroaches on its argument that there are circumstances in which a court can approve a child being placed abroad when adoption is but one of several options.</p>
