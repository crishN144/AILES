	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">These proceedings concern X, now age 4 &#189; years. He is currently here with mother, G, having travelled here with her from their home in Australia for a three-month trip to visit the maternal family, with the father&#8217;s consent. They were due to return on 4 November 2019. When they did not X&#8217;s father, M, made an application under the Hague Convention of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (hereafter </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This hearing has been heard remotely, via Skype for Business, due to the current Covid-19 health crisis. Both parents have been able to attend, together with their solicitors and counsel. No evidence has been called and the case has been dealt on consideration of the papers and submissions. There is an extensive electronic bundle, which includes all the relevant material. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The parties have been able to agree a number of key issues in the case. It is agreed that the mother retained X here at a time when he was habitually resident in Australia and the mother&#8217;s retention was in breach of the father&#8217;s rights of custody in respect of him. It is therefore agreed that the mother&#8217;s retention of X here was wrongful for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The focus of this hearing has been on the Article 13 (b) defence, whether the mother has established that to order the summary return of X to Australia would expose him to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or would otherwise place him in an intolerable situation. If I do, Ms Renton, on behalf of the mother submits the protection measures are not sufficient to mitigate that risk and I should exercise the court&#8217;s discretion to refuse a return. Ms Chokowry, on behalf of the father, submits the Article 13 (b) test is not met, if it does get over the threshold the protection measure proposed mitigate that risk and the court should exercise its discretion to order a return. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Before turning to the detail, I recognise for each of these parents this decision is important for them. For the father who has not seen his son for over 8 months and for the mother who has become settled here and wishes to remain. They should both know that this decision is being made on a summary basis, in accordance with the principles set out in the Convention. The outcome in these proceedings will not determine the future arrangements for X&#8217;s care, they are focussed on whether, in accordance with the terms of the Convention, X should be returned to Australia or not. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">There was an issue raised at the start of this hearing as to whether the mother would accompany X, if this court ordered his return to Australia. I was able to give Ms Renton, the mother&#8217;s counsel, and her solicitor an opportunity to discuss that with the mother. Following those discussions Ms Renton confirmed to the court that her instructions were that in the event the court ordered X&#8217;s return, his mother would accompany him. That had been her position in her detailed statement and in her discussions with Dr Farhy, the jointly instructed expert. The court recognises and acknowledges that that is not what she wants but as Ms Renton said yesterday the mother recognises that would meet X&#8217;s best interests in the event of a return order being made.   </p>

There was a criminal prosecution and the father was acquitted in November 2017, the mother says that was due to pressure from the father and/or his legal team for her not to give evidence. That is denied by the father and his solicitor who represented him at the time. It is noted that the mother repeated at the time of the alleged assault what she alleged had been the father&#8217;s violent behaviour towards her to her doctor and therapist, who she was seeing at the time. </p>

Whilst some of her messages set out how settled she felt here and wished to stay longer it didn&#8217;t go further than that. The father began to be concerned about whether they would return and contacted a friend of the mother&#8217;s, who lives in Australia. The messages in the papers make it clear she felt awkward finding herself in the middle. When requested the mother failed to confirm the arrangements for her return and on 9 November suggested the parties agreed to mediation.  </p>

These were referred to a child protection agency, who X did not repeat the matters to and there is no evidence of any other occasions when X has said such things. The agency took no further action.

There is a letter from Ms Y who she saw in 2016 and from Dr Z who she saw between 2014 and 2018. This was to deal with issues relating to anxiety, insomnia and relationship difficulties. During this period there were times when the mother was prescribed anti-depressants.  </p>

Following a 2 hour video appointment with the mother on 20 April, Dr Farhy filed his report before Dr Z&#8217;s records were available. As there was some delay in getting the records from the latter, due to the Covid-19 restrictions, I directed that her letter, which had been before the court in April, to be redacted as to its recommendation and sent to Dr Farhy. Dr Z confirmed it was a summary of her appointments with the mother, as required by Judd J&#8217;s order, in the absence of the original records. Dr Farhy considered this report and filed an addendum report. On the first day of the hearing, the records from Dr Z arrived. Dr Farhy considered helpfully those and filed a further report during the first day of this hearing. All parties had an opportunity to consider this additional material. </p>

It is for them to produce evidence to substantiate one of the exceptions. There is nothing to indicate that the standard of proof is other than the ordinary balance of probabilities. But in evaluating the evidence the court will, of course, be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague Convention process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under Art 13(b) and so neither those allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination. </span></p>

It is not enough, as it is in other contexts such as asylum, that the risk be &#8216;real&#8217;. It must have reached such a level of seriousness as to be characterised as &#8216;grave&#8217;. Although &#8216;grave&#8217; characterises the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two. Thus a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as &#8216;grave&#8217; while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm.</span></p>

However, they do gain colour from the alternative &#8216;or otherwise&#8217; placed &#8216;in an intolerable situation&#8217; (emphasis supplied). As was said in Re D, at para [52], &#8216;&#8220;Intolerable&#8221; is a strong word, but when applied to a child must mean &#8220;a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate&#8221;&#8217;. Those words were carefully considered and can be applied just as sensibly to physical or psychological harm as to any other situation. Every child has to put up with a certain amount of rough and tumble, discomfort and distress. It is part of growing up. But there are some things which it is not reasonable to expect a child to tolerate. Among these, of course, are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child herself. Among these also, we now understand, can be exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent. Mr Turner accepts that, if there is such a risk, the source of it is irrelevant: eg, where a mother&#8217;s subjective perception of events leads to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child. </span></p>

As has often been pointed out, this is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person, institution or other body who has requested her return, although, of course, it may be so if that person has the right so to demand. More importantly, the situation which the child will face on return depends crucially on the protective measures which can be put in place to secure that the child will not be called upon to face an intolerable situation when she gets home. Mr Turner accepts that if the risk is serious enough to fall within Art 13(b) the court is not only concerned with the child&#8217;s immediate future, because the need for effective protection may persist. </span></p>

She had made plans consistent with that taking place, such as the steps taken in relation to securing X a school place and as late as 3 October stating in a message that she hadn&#8217;t said she wouldn&#8217;t return. There is some evidence to suggest that what may have, in part, changed the mother&#8217;s position is a new relationship that she has formed here and did not want to lose. </p>

This includes the availability of counselling or therapy, recognising of course, the chronic nature of the mother&#8217;s psychological difficulties. There are ongoing proceedings in Australia, a hearing is listed on 1 June. That court can be informed of the timetable in these proceedings and they can make directions accordingly. It is that court that is best placed to determine what the future care arrangements are for X and where the mother can issue an application for permission to bring X to live with her here, if that remains her plan. </p>
