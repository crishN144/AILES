Until recently she had been detained under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> and was discharged under a Guardianship Order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 7</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> to a supported living placement. As will appear, the question that I have to determine is whether the arrangements under which this placement operates amount to a deprivation of liberty pursuant to Article 5 of the ECHR. </p>

In November 2016 she was placed at WC but on 12th July 2019 she was subject to detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 2</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, which on 7th August 2019 was converted into a Section 3 detention. On 27th January 2020 she was made subject to a further Guardianship Order and transferred to her present placement, where she seems to have settled satisfactory. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">of residence therein, the protected person is not free to leave the accommodation. The contentious issue in this case is whether or not she is subject to continuous supervision and control. Clearly the fact that she is not free to leave is a material consideration but, as Baroness Hale observed - </p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in"><span style="font-style:italic">"&#8230; It is possible to imagine certain situations in which a person is not free to leave but is not under such continuous supervision and control as to lead to the conclusion that he was deprived of his liberty." </span></p>
	    <p style="margin-left:-0in">Thus it is necessary to consider the precise arrangements under which AB is required to live in order to determine whether or not she is subject to such supervision and control as will amount in law to a deprivation of liberty. </p>

In re RD (Deprivation or Restriction of Liberty) [2018] EW FC 47, Cobb J gave detailed consideration to the arrangements under which a 14-year-old was required to live and he concluded that there was in that case no deprivation of liberty. In Re HC (a Minor Deprivation of Liberty) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2018/2961" uk:canonical="[2018] EWHC 2961 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] EWHC 2961 (Fam)</ref> Bodey J gave similar consideration in a separate case. Whilst both cases are helpful, it is vital to bear in mind that they relate to young people who would in any event have been under the watchful eye and authority of concerned parents had they not been in public care. The case of an adult is very different, for part of the rights of an adult are to behave in ways which others might regard as foolish without those others having the right of interference. Thus what may only be a restriction of liberty in a young person may yet be a deprivation of liberty in an adult. </p>

She is broadly at liberty to do as she pleases within her own flat. She is free to leave the accommodation but her leaving and returning will always be seen by a member of the supervisory staff simply because of the geography of the property. She is required to reside at that property and thus if she fails to return the police would ordinarily be notified. There is extensive support available to her but it is support for her to take up or not as she pleases. She has a long record of being unable to look after her own accommodation and accordingly staff will enter her flat for the purposes of inspecting, cleaning or repairing. Indeed they will often wait for her to leave in order to do that so as to cause the least possible distress to her. It follows that they have access to her property whenever they think fit. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.17in;text-indent:0.08in">The Official Solicitor contends that these arrangements when all taken together amount to a deprivation of liberty. She contends through Leading Counsel that the requirement to return to the property, the amount of support that is made available, the monitoring of her coming and going and the access to her property when seen in the context of the Guardianship Order amount to a deprivation of liberty. The Local Authority contend through Counsel that the voluntary nature of the support, the freedom to come and go as she pleases and her freedom of action once she has left the accommodation speak more powerfully of a lack of continuous control and supervision. What makes this case difficult is that both approaches are inherently reasonable. This is a case at the borderline and is, as the law of the European Court recognises,<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;one of degree or intensity, and not one of substance or nature."</span> There is a judicial judgment required. </p>

That much appears from the passage cited from Baroness Hale's judgment above. There must be something more. In my view supervision and control should be viewed as separate requirements in considering this test and the word &#8220;continuous&#8221; applied to both. At the end of the day, however, the court is also constrained to follow the policy of caution set out by the Supreme Court. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.17in;text-indent:0.08in">In the end, and only after very careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that these arrangements do indeed amount to a deprivation of liberty. It seems to me that the question of supervision and control must be viewed in the context of the prescribed condition of residence. Thus whilst she may be free to leave the property as she chooses, she is always subject to state control requiring her return should she be otherwise unwilling to do so. The fact that she generally willingly returns does not of itself negate this point. Again whilst the supervision of her coming and going is not intrusive, it is the fact that all her movements are known and noted. Moreover, while she is free to do as she pleases in the community, there will inevitably be some obligation to restrain or control those movements should they become seriously detrimental to her welfare. That control could lawfully be implemented without recourse to the Court.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;text-indent:0.24in">When considering a deprivation of liberty it is not sufficient just to see what actually happens in practice but to consider what the true powers of control actually are. Again the power to enter someone's private residence is a major intrusion on liberty however much, as it is here, it is to the benefit of the protected person for it to happen. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;text-indent:0.24in">When looking at all these matters it is essential to consider them in the round and to ask whether in all the circumstances that actually prevail, or might reasonably come about, the arrangements amount to a deprivation of liberty. In my view they do here. In reaching that conclusion I have drawn upon the policy set out by Baroness Hale and that has, I should acknowledge, been a critical factor in my conclusion. However much these arrangements may be to the benefit of AB, and undoubtedly they are, one has to reflect on how they would be observed by an ordinary member of the public who, I strongly suspect, would regard them as a real deprivation of liberty. The policy that everyone should be treated the same leads me to the conclusion that I have set out. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.01in;text-indent:0.24in">Although I have concluded that the AB is deprived of her liberty in the present circumstances, however much they may be to her benefit, this does not seem to me a case in which any complicated arrangements for review are required other than the basics that are provided for in the Court of Protection by way of annual review. The parties informed me, and I fully accept, that they will be able to agree an order to implement this judgment. </p>
