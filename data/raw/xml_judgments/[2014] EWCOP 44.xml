I have also read the further reports of Dr F and also of EF, a community midwife.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The history since the matter was last before me shows a mixed picture which includes periods of co-operation and of a lack of co-operation on DD&#8217;s part with the relevant authority&#8217;s representatives. There have been some positive developments, including her constructive discussions at times with Mrs C (the safeguarding midwife), her visit to the general practitioner&#8217;s, Dr E&#8217;s, surgery and her registration with the surgery. There appears to have been a constructive meeting with general practitioner Dr. K on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August, in which, although he allowed her to do much of the talking, it appears he felt that DD had begun to form a helpful professional relationship with him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Notwithstanding that setback, during the period since the matter was last before me, DD has, perhaps unexpectedly, engaged in meaningful discussion with the professionals about contraception and sterilisation. Although she has not maintained a consistent position on her future childbearing intentions, it is a source of some reassurance to me, and no doubt a source of some optimism on the part of the professionals, that she is at least able to and willing to have that sort of discussion about contraception and sterilisation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A large number of the professional witnesses who have been working on this case have attended at court today for the purposes of giving evidence at this hearing, which, as I say, was originally listed for four days. To some extent, I regret that their journeys have been wasted because the parties have, more or less, come to an agreement about the way forward. However, their presence in court does give me the opportunity to pay the highest tribute to them for the very considerable care and sensitivity which they have, each in their own respects, exercised in managing what has been an extraordinarily difficult case. Therefore, whilst they have been relieved of the responsibility or obligation to give evidence before me, and will return to their ordinary clinical duties tomorrow without having done so, I hope that by being able to receive my credit to them directly their journey has not been entirely wasted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Without elaborating further or at length about the events which have occurred since the matter was last before me on 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, two particular points deserve mention. The first is that my anxiety, which I expressed in my first judgment, about the effect on DD of repeated forced entries to DD&#8217;s home, have, to some extent, been realised; the removal of DD from her home on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August was considerably more difficult than that on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July. It was precisely the repetition of that sort of incident which had caused me to refuse the Applicant&#8217;s application for the earlier proposed forced removal from the home on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July, prior to the caesarean section. As Mr McKendrick has pointed out, and Mr Horne agrees (and I concur), the scope for repeating this sort of procedure hereafter is now very considerably limited.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second point which justifies comment at this point is to be drawn from the evidence of Mr A (consultant gynaecologist), who, in his third witness statement, draws together a number of the key developments in the case, but specifically (and uniquely from his position) describes the caesarean section which he performed on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July. He describes the lower segment of the uterus being very thin like tissue paper, with the baby being visible through it (before he performed the incision), which is highly unusual. With such a thin lower segment being present, it would suggest that future pregnancies would be at particular risk of uterine rupture, especially if DD went into natural labour.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr A&#8217;s evidence goes on to highlight the very precarious medical situation which would have arisen had the baby not been delivered by caesarean section on the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, with possibly fatal consequences for both mother and child. That, in its own way, provides for us all - lawyers and medics, Judge and parties - a valuable insight into the outcomes of the processes in which we have been engaged and which have caused us all much anxious consideration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those general comments are made simply to bring matters up to date. There has been presented to me this afternoon a proposed draft order, which is, albeit not by consent, not materially opposed by the Official Solicitor as litigation friend for DD.  The Second Respondent, BC, who is aware of the hearing today, I am satisfied is neither here nor represented and is not making any representations about the proposed terms of the order.</p>

I do not in any sense consider that the evidence which I have now received casts any doubt upon those earlier comments. I restate them for present purposes and I am content to make the declaration set out at paragraph 1 of the proposed draft.</p>

As I say, adhering to the principles of the <span style="font-style:italic">Mental Capacity Act</span>, I consider it entirely right that DD should be given the opportunity voluntarily to attend her general practice on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September in fulfilment of the appointment which she herself has made to receive the Depo-Provera injection. However, I recognise that it is in her best interests that a contingency plan is put in place by my order, in the event (a) that she does not, without good reason, attend on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September and consequently (b) more coercive steps need to be taken to administer that vital contraception injection.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue of forced entry to her home and restrictions on her freedom of movement arise again today as they have arisen on previous occasions. Again, not without considerable reservation, I do nonetheless consider it in DD&#8217;s best interests that I give authorisation to the Applicant to exercise physical restraint for the purposes of giving DD the relevant contraception injection, by professionals who have received training in the relevant techniques and only as a last resort, where less restrictive alternatives have failed; it is important that at all times the professionals should maintain DD&#8217;s dignity.</p>

In the first instance, I give the Applicant and the Official Solicitor permission to disclose documents produced within these proceedings (and to discuss issues arising within the proceedings) with the health professionals at DD&#8217;s general practice. The concern I have expressed in court, about limiting the extent of disclosure of documents, I believe has been taken on board by both the Applicant and the Official Solicitor.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I take Mr Horne&#8217;s point that one important way of limiting the extent of disclosure is to incorporate some test of relevance, and I agree with that approach in relation to disclosure to third parties. However, it may be difficult to isolate out at this stage that which is closely associated with the specific questions relevant to DD&#8217;s capacity to consent to contraception from the wider evidence about the implications for her of a repeat pregnancy. Therefore, I leave it to the judgment of those who are on the ground to decide what is and what is not relevant and necessary for disclosure to the professionals at DD&#8217;s general practice. However, I repeat my exhortation to them, please, not to overburden the practice with more documentation than is necessary.</p>

Paragraph 8 has been refined through discussion and is a paragraph which is now agreed between all parties, or at least not opposed. In its revised form, I myself approve it. The care plan, which I have seen in draft, is to be disclosed to the Official Solicitor by 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September and a copy should be lodged with the court on or about the same day.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Horne has floated for my consideration whether or not this order, which is in its own way to be redacted in any event, should not at this stage be served on BC, for fear that it may alert BC to the coercive nature of the steps which are proposed in the event that DD does not co-operate; service of the order on BC may have a counterproductive effect on what is at the moment a fragile level of co-operation between DD and her new GP. I consider that the alternative possibility if BC is shown the order (to the effect that BC sees that unless DD co-operates then that is the outcome and thus it is better for her to co-operate), may indeed be just as likely. In those circumstances, I do not feel that the extraordinary step of not serving BC with this order until after 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September is justified. Therefore, I do not propose to make any direction about delay in service on him.</p>
