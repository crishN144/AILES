Following the arrest of the father, in the knowledge that he was still alive, the grandmother became less stressed and, after assessment by social workers of her and Mr D, G (who was keen to be with her grandmother) was placed in their care in August 2004, where she has remained ever since under a series of interim care orders.</span></p>

The father has made it clear in his statement that he has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, but guilty to the charge of preventing the burial of a body. It is the second event, which includes the purchase of a chest freezer and dismemberment of her mother&#8217;s body, which G has been shielded from so far but may become known to her through other sources in July unless great care is taken to protect her at this stage.

Unfortunately Mr D was made redundant at the beginning of this year, but this has given him the opportunity to become more involved with the caring task and he takes G to school and collects her. [The grandmother] has preferred to keep a low profile in relation to the school and hasn&#8217;t got to know other parents as an attempt to avoid recognition or confrontation should the media coverage of the trial enable other parents to identify her and G. Fortunately, G will be changing schools this summer as the junior school is on a separate site, but many of those families will also transfer and they live in a small community.&#8221;</p>

Judge Pearlman on 20 May 2005 for an order in accordance with that recommendation, the parties were ad idem in supporting it. However, Judge Pearlman made clear that she was not willing to make a final Residence Order and Supervision Order at that stage as the criminal proceedings were in prospect and their outcome uncertain. It was not known what sentence the father would receive for his guilty plea, or what would happen if he were acquitted or convicted of murder or manslaughter. Furthermore, until the criminal proceedings were concluded, according to Dr T, life story work could not commence with G. The judge indicated that the Local Authority should make it clear to the grandmother why she was not making a final Residence Order; it was not because her ability to care for G was doubted in any way, but simply in order to ensure that G and the grandmother should have as much help as was necessary once the criminal proceedings had finished. The judge accordingly simply made a renewed interim care order in favour of the Local Authority. She also directed that within 21 days of the conclusion of the criminal trial (then scheduled to start on 11 July 2005) the solicitors for the father should file and serve a memorandum of acquittal/conviction together with copies of the indictment, the basis of plea and the pre-sentence report. Also that the solicitor for the Guardian should by 30 September 2005 file an updating report from Dr T setting out her preliminary advice as to what G should be told about the circumstances of her mother&#8217;s death, by whom she should told and when she should be told. It was ordered that the final hearing should be listed for 18 October 2005.</span></p>

In the light of its terms, and in particular paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order on the one hand and paragraph 8(a) and (b) on the other, the view was taken that the order rendered uncertain whether the applicants were forbidden in connection with the criminal proceedings, (i) to name, (ii) to publish photographs of the father. Upon querying the matter with the Local Authority the applicants were informed of the Local Authority&#8217;s view that the order did indeed have that effect. Consequently, the applicants wrote a letter bringing the urgent attention of the applications judge to the terms of the order, in order to seek clarification. Baron J directed that the matter return before the court on Tuesday 19 July 2005 &#8220;for consideration of the interpretation and appropriateness of the current injunctive order&#8221;.</span></p>

Nor, on consideration of the evidence placed before her, was there any reason for her to suppose that the Local Authority were seeking such an order.

First, it was a case where, on the evidence, there had been no, or minimal, previous publicity in respect of the case concerned (c.f. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42/section/12/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12(4)</ref> (a)(i) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>). Second, it was a case where the identification of the defendant was potentially likely to have a seriously prejudicial effect upon the placement of the children in the care proceedings to which they were subject. Third, the harm from which the children were sought to be protected was the likelihood of their short and long term stigmatisation as suffering from AIDS when such was not the case.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">By way of contrast, the evidence relied on in this case in respect of the potential harm to G is no more than that set out in the extracts from the guardian&#8217;s report I have quoted at paragraphs 8-14 above. It is said that identifying the father is liable to result in the child being identified within the locality almost immediately, with adverse consequences on the ability of the Local Authority to provide her with effective counselling.</span></p>

It appears that the grandmother is already herself nervous of taking the child to school, which she leaves to her partner.</span></p>

While every case must be examined according to its particular facts in order to carry out the balancing exercise involved, it is difficult to see any exceptional or compelling circumstances in this case which call for treatment different from the result in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRoman,Italic">Re: S</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">The need to counsel the child in relation to her &#8220;life story&#8221; and the position of her father is a process which will be necessary quite apart from the question of publicity for the proceedings. It is something which the Local Authority planned to carry out in any event and was only seeking to defer until the result of the trial was known. There is no intention to conceal the sad fact that the mother met her end at the hands of the father in the somewhat gruesome circumstances which existed regardless of the level of criminal responsibility for which he may be sentenced. It may well be that the task will be more difficult if publicity is given to the identity of the father. However, that eventuality appears to have been anticipated and is not said to present an insuperable obstacle to the proper handling of G&#8217;s emotional and psychological care.</span></p>

She is fortunate to be being cared for and educated in a reasonably affluent and well-informed milieu where, whatever the level of curiosity she may experience, sympathy rather than hostility may be expected. Further, as in the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRoman,Italic">Re: S </span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">(though unlike the case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRoman,Italic">Re: W</span><span style="font-family:TimesNewRoman">) there has already been widespread publicity in relation to the identity of the father, the circumstances of the mother&#8217;s death and the existence of a child (see paragraph 5 above). Thus the granting of the injunction sought will to a considerable extent be an attempt to close the door of the stable after the horse has bolted.</span></p>

However, it is not suggested, let alone established as a probability, that the effect will be such that they may refuse or feel unable to care for G, or that she may otherwise be deprived of a home in which the judge has already indicated it is appropriate for her to be (c.f the position in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:TimesNewRoman,Italic">Re: W)</span></p>

It is certainly far from sufficient to outweigh the plain and substantial interference with the right of the press to identify the father and otherwise to report the criminal proceedings in which she is being tried.</span></p>
