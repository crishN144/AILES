	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">The court is concerned with the arrangements for two small children in relation the time they will spend between their two parents&#8217; homes in circumstances where those parents are now living separately and apart following the breakdown of their marriage in March last year.  On 16 March 2020 the mother, XM, issued an application seeking a number of private law orders.  The focus of this hearing has been on the children&#8217;s living arrangements going forwards.  XF, the children&#8217;s father, is fully engaged in those arrangements.  He, too, accepts that court intervention is now necessary because of their inability to agree how to chart an independent way forward.  At the centre of the current dispute are two delightful children, L and S, who are now respectively 6 and 3 years old.  They are much-loved children and, in turn, it is clear to me that each of the girls has a close and loving relationship with each of their mother and father.  The last twelve months have presented particular challenges for each of these parents. The children&#8217;s passage into their new experience of their parents&#8217; separation has undoubtedly impacted upon their emotional wellbeing and sense of security. </p>

At the end of 2013, they moved to Dubai where the father had found employment in the field of private security services.  L was born in 2015 and S three years later in 2018.  The mother works in an important role locally as an operations manager.  Whilst she took some maternity leave around the births of the children, she is now working full-time.  The family is fortunate to have retained their live-out nanny who has been a constant presence in the children&#8217;s lives.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">Difficulties surfaced in the marriage at the end of 2019.  It was a difficult time for each of them.  The mother suffered a miscarriage in October that year.  I accept that was a traumatic loss for both of them.  Shortly thereafter, the father became aware of matters which caused him to believe, rightly or wrongly, that she may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with another man.  The first few weeks of 2020 were a significant challenge in terms of the developing dynamic between them as they contemplated a formal separation.  In March 2020 the mother issued a petition seeking the dissolution of their marriage.  The father accepts that he behaved badly during much of this period and indeed beyond and threatened to expose what he believed to be her infidelity to the local authorities in Dubai.  I am satisfied both that he used these implied threats to hurt her and that she was genuinely afraid that any such action on his part might result in the fracture of her relationship with, and ability to care for, their children.  The father now admits that his distress at the breakdown of his marriage and its impact on their family life had taken him to a very dark place.  He accepts, and I find, that many of his actions were inappropriate at the time.  In circumstances where Dubai was also in a state of lockdown, he required the mother to stay overnight in a local hotel.  She left the family home after the children had been put to bed and returned in the morning before they awoke.  Whether or not they believed that this fa&#231;ade would somehow protect their children from the consequences of what was going on in the home, I accept that </p>

The order which was produced at the conclusion of the second day of that hearing recorded the fact that further discussion between the parties had served to narrow the issues, including the joint appointment of an independent social worker who was to be instructed to assist with the ongoing living arrangements for the children.  By that stage, it had been agreed that the mother would move to her own rented property.  Recorded on the face of the order is the court&#8217;s indication that, following that move, it would be beneficial for the children to spend more frequent time with each parent for at least the first month after the move.

By this stage, the father had instructed Ms Katherine Kelsey of counsel.  She has appeared on his behalf for the purposes of this hearing.  Mrs Debbie Gaskin, the jointly appointed ISW, was also present.  As the order records, the father had already engaged various counselling services in order to address his emotional reaction to the breakdown of the marriage.

The &#8220;school week&#8221; in Dubai runs from Sunday to Thursday.  The children&#8217;s &#8220;weekend&#8221; started on Thursday afternoon and ended on Saturday evening.  The court order provided that in week one, they were to spend three nights on Thursday, Friday and Saturday with their father.  </p>

Indirect contact through FaceTime or similar was to take place daily between the children and whichever parent they were not with at the time. </p>

Once again, Mrs Gaskin made herself available for that hearing although the court heard no oral evidence.  The order records the father&#8217;s ongoing commitment to therapeutic support.  Both parents agreed to engaged in work designed to assist separating parents.  The children&#8217;s passports were, by agreement, to be held for the time being by the mother&#8217;s London solicitors.  As Cohen J had done at the earlier hearing in May last year, Francis J urged the parties to reach agreement through some form of mediation. </p>

Instead of spending three nights with their father on week one of the fortnightly cycle, the children&#8217;s time was reduced to two nights on a Thursday and Friday with a return to their mother by 5pm on the Saturday evening.  On week 2, they were to spend Monday and Thursday afternoons with him from 5.30pm until 7pm.  The court directed that, if the father was able to leave work earlier, he should be able to have the children for longer.  As in all these arrangements, the court stressed to the parties the need for an element of flexibility.  Indirect contact with the other parent whilst the children were with the other parent was continued on the basis of daily FaceTime calls at a time convenient for the children. </p>

They had to cope with a return to school in late August/early September 2020 having spent several weeks at home with their nanny and their parents.

Notwithstanding this I am of the view that she is acutely aware of the tension in adult relationships and continues to carry [a] significant emotional burden in relation to then parents and her relationship with each of them.  She has managed to negotiate and accommodate the changes to her living circumstances over the last year.  She is in my view increasingly contained regarding the many changes of the last 15 months.  This containment is beneficial in that she is able to regulate her emotions, but can create difficulties for children, and can be the trigger for further emotional distress or turmoil, and expression of trauma in a different manner. </p>

The precise allocation of time as between their two homes was yet to be determined but the mother&#8217;s proposals were based upon him having at least three days during a seven-day rota together with alternating weekends.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">One of the unfortunate aspects to emerge in recent weeks has been the father&#8217;s apparent loss of confidence in the work and support which Mrs Gaskin&#8217;s role has brought to this family.  He perceives her as having supported the mother&#8217;s case in preference to his own.  He has been concerned about the fact that he has been criticised for undertaking the work he has done in relation to his parenting skills with third party professionals.  He told me that he had not realised that it was her understanding that he was to carry out this work with her, as the mother has done.  Mrs Gaskin has been critical of some of the father&#8217;s behaviour towards the mother, and properly so in my judgment.  But it would be unfair to characterise her input or her recommendations as &#8216;antagonistic&#8217; or biased in some way against the father.  I am entirely satisfied that, as an experienced professional social worker, she has properly evaluated the situation in which these children find themselves.  She has carried out an appropriate analysis of why they are exhibiting the behaviours which the parents have described and she has approached the case and her evidence to this court from the foot of what she believes to be in the best interests of the children&#8217;s physical and emotional welfare.  That her involvement has not been conventional in terms of the current lockdown restrictions is unfortunate.  She has not been able to meet the parents or the children in person.  She has not had the ability to observe any of the handovers or time spent by the children in each household.  She has had to engage with the parents via a video platform which is no substitute for direct face to face engagement in a situation such as this.  Given the fact that the parents live outside the jurisdiction which they engaged for the resolution of </p>

She continues to harbour concerns about the father&#8217;s true insight into the children&#8217;s emotional needs and the extent to which he can put into practice what he has learnt from the work he has undertaken over recent months. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.53in">So where does this evidence lead the court in terms of the best outcome for these children.  In terms of a time frame for the development of contact, and at my request, Mrs Gaskin has prepared a &#8216;road map&#8217; which sets out her views on what the future might look like for the children.  She told me that currently neither child would cope with increased stays overnight away from their mother.  Any increase in her view should begin incrementally and within the structure of a clear routine. </p>

There is no doubt whatsoever that each loves the children and each recognises the value which the other parent brings to the lives of their daughters.  There remains a high level of distrust between the parties and this continues to provide a platform for ongoing conflict over the arrangements for the future.  I suspect that time will prove to be a healer for each of them but they must continue to work towards a resolution of that conflict rather than using it as a means of exploiting their differences to the detriment of the children.  L, in particular, is agreed to be a perceptive child who is attuned to what goes on around her.  I suspect that she has been only too well aware of the anxieties felt by her mother just as she has been exposed to the hostility which her father has felt towards her mother.  My focus remains, as it must be, the welfare of these children.  I agree with Mrs </p>

I am equally satisfied that they love their father and need to spend time in his care when he can provide much-needed reassurance that they are loved and remain part of his family albeit in its reconstituted form in separate households.  That is the best outcome for these children in circumstances where their parents are no longer able to share a common home. </p>

Each can provide for their physical and financial needs going forwards and each has the ability to provide emotional warmth and empathetic parenting.  The father accepts that the court should make an order that the children should live with their mother and spend time with him.  On his behalf, Ms Kelsey submits that there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that a reduction in the time he presently spends with the children will address the children&#8217;s difficulties within their mother&#8217;s home.  She further submits that to reduce his contact to once every three weeks in line with the mother&#8217;s proposal might well impact adversely on them.  She points to the fact that, as recently as 16 March 2021 in her responses to specific questions put to her, Mrs Gaskin was supporting alternating weekends with the father despite S's recent presentation.  Her recommendation was made in the contact of L having made &#8220;significant progress&#8221; in terms of regulating her emotions.  She said this: </p>

She has been very unwell and has undergone fairly major surgery as well as a course of chemotherapy.  The children will undoubtedly have picked up on the fact that their mother was unwell in addition to the ongoing conflict between their parents and the distress of each of them.  She seeks a finding that the children have suffered emotional harm through this period.  As set out earlier in this judgment, it is a finding I have no hesitation in making.  I am also satisfied that the children&#8217;s attachment to their mother at the present time is not as secure as it should be, or once was, </p>

The behaviour which M has described in S (who has only just celebrated her third birthday) is a matter of concern.

For the first stage, which would last for 8 weeks, there would be a reduction in the level of staying contact with the father (once every three weeks for two nights) on the basis that he continued to see the children for tea after school twice a week on the intervening weeks.  During school holidays, he should spend full days with the children rather than tea-time visits after school.  Stage 2 would reflect the current arrangements (two overnight stays on alternate weekends.  With provision made for additional time during the school summer holidays, Stage 3 would commence at the beginning of the Autumn term at the end of August 2021. By this stage, the father will be having the children for three overnight stays on alternate weekends with a single overnight stay during every other week.  The mother does not wish to move to Stage 3 until after Christmas / the New Year in 2022. </p>

I appreciate that her health has been adversely affected by illness over the course of the last year and I regard it as essential that she has a full week to spend with the children away from the demands of her job.  It may be premature to think of a return back to the UK this year but I propose that the contact schedule during the school Summer holidays can properly be interrupted to allow for this holiday.  Subject to those dates being agreed, I propose to continue the two-weekly cycle of arrangements which I have set out above in paragraph 47 above save that on weeks 1 and 3, the children will spend full days with their father on Mondays and Thursdays provided that he is available to care for them.  I would hope that the parents will be able to agree additional days during the summer holidays when the children can spend time with the father but I am not going to be prescriptive about specific dates.  The mother will presumably be working throughout most of the summer holidays and the father should be in a position to engage the nanny to assist with these arrangements given that it is she who will otherwise be looking after the children. </p>

It is not possible for this court to provide further definition in respect of precise dates or handover arrangements.  By this time the parties will have been operating these contact arrangements for over a year and I would expect them to agree the dates between them.  I was told on more than one occasion how important routine and forward-planning is for L, as for all young children.  Predictability and consistency are key to the success of these arrangements.  As a general principle, important days or celebrations (such as Mother&#8217;s Day, Father&#8217;s Day and the parents&#8217; birthdays) should be spent with the parent concerned.  Christmas this year (2021) will be divided on the basis that the children are with the mother until 5pm on 24 December 2021.  They will then spend the rest of that day, Christmas day itself and the morning of 26 December with their father returning to the mother at 12 noon on Boxing Day.

Whereas I might normally take the view that these might be intrusive in terms of the mother&#8217;s routine with the children, I bear in mind in this case that the father&#8217;s point of contact with the children is the nanny rather than the mother who is at work.  There is no evidence that the children are not coping with these regular calls and they may provide them with ongoing reassurance that their father remains a presence in their day to day lives even when they are not with him.  He appears to have a good relationship with the nanny and she has raised no objection to facilitating these calls.  Provided that the father exercises common sense in relation to how long children of this age can expect to be engaged on daily calls, I see no reason to limit this form of contact.  He, in turn, must facilitate the children&#8217;s indirect contact with their mother whilst they are with him. </p>

For so long as the litigation continues, there is the subliminal traction on evidence-gathering as well as the ongoing emotional and financial pressure on the family.  Whilst there is no basis upon which I can prevent either party from making further applications in relation to the children, I would encourage them both to see the court as a remedy of last resort.  If Mrs Gaskin&#8217;s involvement ends with the conclusion of these proceedings, both parents appear keen to engage the services of someone who might act as a &#8216;parental co-ordinator&#8217;.

Clearly each must be entitled to make immediate decisions in the event of a medical or other emergency.  They must also notify the other immediately in that event.  The mother is concerned that she cannot trust the father in matters which concern S&#8217;s health.  Whilst I consider that his actions at the end of December last year were a matter of concern for the mother, I do not believe that he would put either of his children at risk in terms of health issues.  What was singularly lacking over that period was any attempt at effective communication between these parents.  The father took no steps to reassure the mother that their child was safe and well.  Instead, as I have found, he took the wholly inappropriate step of allowing his family to become involved in the dispute.  That was unwise but it was not sufficient in my judgment to provide an evidential basis for the sort of restriction on his parental responsibility which the mother seeks.  Each of these parents has the very considerable joy of raising these two lovely children.  Each bears the responsibility for ensuring that the children receive the love, nurture and support which they will need if they are to develop into the happy, confident children they have the potential to become. </p>
