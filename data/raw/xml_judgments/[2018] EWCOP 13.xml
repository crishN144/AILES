There can be no doubt that TH has provided a high standard of care to his father and that providing this has been a considerable commitment on his part.  He says frankly in his witness statements that he did not anticipate his father would live for as long as he has; he thought he would be coming over to England to care for him for a few weeks or possibly months, but it has turned out to be years.  At various times he has been assisted by other paid carers, but for substantial periods of time he has been at his father&#8217;s side round the clock, seven days a week, with little or no respite.  There can be no doubt that his efforts in providing care in the home have been of great benefit to his father, but at the cost of a limitation on all aspects of his own life.   It is understandable that the responsibility of caring for his father for many years has caused stress and strain on him and members of his immediate family.  </span></p>

I accept that the OPG guidelines suggest the Court may take note that care provided is better value than commercial care, but I do not accept that on the face of it amounts paid out to an attorney up to a limit of a percentage of the cost of commercial care should be ratified without further consideration.  The starting point is not to find a figure for commercial care after the event, and then award to the Applicant a percentage of that figure, but to scrutinise the payments made in all the circumstances and to determine whether or not it could be said that they were made, or the Applicant reasonably believed they were made, in the best interests of HH.</span></p>

It is hard to see that TH conducted a very thorough exercise to establish what was needed, what the reasonable cost was and whether it was practicable to provide it.  His witness statement was predicated on the basis that his father needed three carers to be employed in his care, but that seems only to be for the occasions when he was staying at the house as well as MS and PR.  In fact for substantial periods they provided care without him and he provided care on his own with daily assistance from PR. I accept that the two carers would need respite, provided by a third, but there is no evidence that HH was assessed as needing three carers at any one time, or even two carers for most of the time.  TH did not provide the financial information required to the local authority and so contributions were reassessed as needing to come wholly from his father.  </span></p>

The strength of feeling towards his brother in respect of a number of matters was clear; the main source of his anger and distress is of being excluded from his parent&#8217;s home by his carer MS, or on the instructions of his brother - having accepted MS&#8217;s allegations against him as true without further enquiry.  JPH considers his brother&#8217;s choice of carer for his father was a mistake and considers her hostility to him to be an aggravating feature of what was clearly already a very strained relationship between the two brothers.  </span></p>

He alleges that his brother has deprived him of free access to his mother in her dying days and more recently to his father when he was living at home.

The statements are not challenged.  In 2008 EH and HH set out in a letter of wishes that they wished to equalise the gifts they had given to their sons during their lives.  The estate is not yet distributed because there are insufficient liquid funds to do so.  The intention is that &#163;6,000 shall be paid to PR, the solicitors will be paid for their work, and the remaining funds shall be divided equally between TH and JPH, once an account has been taken of the gifts they have each received from their mother during the seven years before her death.  This exercise has been difficult to achieve because TH and JPH do not agree about these gifts and because TH was also his mother&#8217;s attorney before her death and used a &#8216;buddy card&#8217; for her bank account.  In his witness statement, MH says that TH received considerably more than his brother JPH.  The main asset of the estate is EH&#8217;s half share in the property in which they lived, and which agreement has now been reached that it should be sold.  The property is now in HH&#8217;s sole name, but the trustees have taken out a charge on the property so as to ensure that there are sufficient funds upon sale to enable them to discharge their obligations in distributing the estate.  </span></p>

So far as HH&#8217;s past wishes and feelings are concerned, the letter of wishes signed with his wife in 2008 is a very strong indication that they both wished for their two sons to be given the same amounts, and for the gifts they had given to their sons to be equalised.  </span></p>

He and his wife were generous to their children and the clear sense I get is that money that came into the household was to be regarded as for the benefit of all members of the family.  The intention that there should be an account of what had been given to each son so that contributions could be equalised in due course does not appear to have been backed up by any sort of record keeping, by any member of the family.  This has led unfortunately to further disputes between the brothers in respect of HH&#8217;s finances but also, as reported by MH, in respect of EH&#8217;s legacy.  </span></p>

Further, at times when TH was living in the property and providing or paying for his father&#8217;s care, and purchasing food and household items for the benefit of himself as a member of the household as well as HH and any live-in carer, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that it is consistent with the evidence of EH and HH&#8217;s approach to family money in the past; such payments could be regarded as having been made in HH&#8217;s best interests in principle.  The question remains as to whether the level of payments made could be regarded as being in HH&#8217;s best interests. </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">So far as the claims for care are concerned, the Applicant says that many of the items on which he spent money were in effect in lieu of a salary, and it was only later in an attempt to formalise matters that he paid himself regularly from his father&#8217;s account.  I would accept that payments in kind could be ratified in principle, but again the Applicant has not helped himself by the haphazard way in which he has managed things.  Essentially his position is that he has not spent all that much, and if one did a proper accounting it would probably all work out in the end and show that on balance the amounts that he used from his father&#8217;s accounts were justified as recompense for his efforts.  That he had no regard to whether or not his father had sufficient funds to meet his needs and those of his family does not seem to have troubled him very greatly.  I accept that this attitude towards money may well have been inherited from his father, and therefore it is arguable that he has acted in a way which is consistent with what his father&#8217;s wishes would have been, namely, to simply not trouble himself about money.  However, in signing the declarations he did when he became his father&#8217;s attorney, he took on a much stricter duty.  He had a responsibility to ensure that his father had sufficient funds to meet all his needs then and into the future, that he was not paying himself in excess of what the guidelines would suggest is reasonable for an attorney and/or carer to be paid, that he was keeping a careful account of all expenditure, and that he was mindful of his parents&#8217; wishes that gifts to one brother should be equalised by a gift to the other.</span></p>

There were opportunities for the dispute to be resolved in discussion, which following the investigation all the other parties did so.  There were also a number of other issues in the case that were raised by the First Respondent which required the Applicant to respond in detail and some of these issues were only conceded at or shortly before the final hearing</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
