The mother told various professionals that Sasha had diagnoses for PTSD, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, selective mutism, eating disorder, learning disabilities, lactose intolerance, food allergies, dyslexia/dyspraxia/dyscalculia, autism, OCD, allergies, and an undiagnosed syndrome.

I found that the mother has often regarded Tara, even at a very young age, as a confidante, and had shared information about Sasha with her that both invaded Sasha&#8217;s privacy and undermined her confidence, and perpetuated an understanding of Sasha being &#8216;the problem&#8217; child.  This caused emotional harm to Sasha, but also created a risk of emotional harm to Tara.  She has experienced a pressure upon her to &#8216;perform&#8217; as the child who does not present problems, to be self-reliant, and not demand anything from her mother.  </span></p>

There had been a significant number of sudden and unplanned school moves over the years.  When enrolled at school the girls had consistently low attendance.

She continues to present with complex needs.  There remains a risk of serious injury or death through self-harming, particularly overdoses of paracetamol.  She is not going to school or taking part in tutoring sessions at this time.  She is however beginning to build up trusting relationships with her carers.  She is making progress in being able to express herself, reflect on her experiences in her mother&#8217;s care, and start to process them.</span></p>

At the fact-finding hearing I found that the mother had made secret contact with the girls, providing them with UV pens so that they could write down a phone number for her.  I found that she had been in touch with Tara through Roblox, an online gaming site.  In supervised contact, there had been incidents when the mother had found a way to speak to one or other of the girls out of earshot of the supervisor.  There have been concerns about the girls&#8217; presentation following contact sessions with their mother.</span></p>

There are also some concerning reports of Sasha directly asking her mother for care and being ignored, for example a report that describes Sasha asking her mother to brush her hair, repeating the request another two times, but her mother not picking up on this opportunity to show care and tenderness to her daughter.</span></p>

The reports of the contacts describe a positive experience for Tara and her mother.  The notes describe loving and warm interactions, with the mother bringing fun and interesting activities for them to do together.  However, there have been some occasions when the mother has made comments which have directly, or more subtly, undermined the girls&#8217; father.  Those subtle comments include gently questioning rules or boundaries that have been put in place around use of electronic devices.  Another time she seemed to question whether something of Tara&#8217;s that the father had said was lost, really had been lost.  The implication is that the father may have taken it away.  </span></p>

[the father] and [the father&#8217;s partner] have, however, demonstrated that they are responding to the presenting emotional needs of both of the children in an informed, considered way ... They recognise the need for the children to experience consistent, predictable care in a safe environment and they are skilfully providing this. They individually demonstrate a sensitively acquired recognition of the children's presenting needs. Jointly, they demonstrate an impressive ability to work as a team, managing complex issues in a gentle yet effective way.

[the father] was considerate of the impact of this behaviour on Tara, and when he felt he could no longer keep Sasha safe, he openly communicated this with professionals. [the father] and [the father&#8217;s partner] have remained committed to Sasha despite her placement away from home and visit her regularly, which Sasha enjoys. I consider that [the father] has a sound understanding of his own parenting capacity, and the issues which surpass this, showing an ability to take guidance and advice from professionals where needed.</span></p>

The mother was the subject of a psychiatric assessment by Dr McClintock and a parenting assessment by an independent social worker Lisa Greaves.

However, on a more fundamental level, she does not accept the facts as they have been found.  Ms B told me in evidence that in conversations she has had with the mother, she has not seen any insight or capacity to accept the findings or to accept that [the father] is going to be the girls&#8217; long-term carer. Ms B acknowledged that there have been fewer overtly problematic statements in contact, and that contact has largely been very positive for Tara, but she said that the mother has continued to be very negative of [the father] in conversations with her, and to direct blame towards him.  </span></p>

She has attributed blame to social services, repeating on various occasions to Tara that it is social services and the Court who are deciding about whether they can see each other in a contact centre, that social services decide the length of time they may spend together, and that it will be social workers who decide if or when it is safe for Tara to come home to her.  On one level, it is right that the decision making has been out of the mother&#8217;s hands, but this narrative is one which casts Tara and her mother together as victims at the hands of an arbitrary system, and ignores the facts as found by the Court.  Tara has been separated from her mother as a result of the abuse that she and her sister suffered in their mother&#8217;s care, and due to the risk of continued harm if they were to return to her care.</span></p>

It is incredibly difficult in the confines of a contact centre to find activities to do.  Of course I understand that the time together is precious and would want to be marked out as special and to be treasured.  I do not criticise the mother for telling her daughter she loves her and that she is proud of her in as many different ways as she can.  I also understand that it is not easy for her to have a conversation that would explore the reasons they are separated in any depth.  The mother has been told not to discuss the proceedings with Tara and would not want her to be distressed.  Nonetheless, in the context of a relationship where Tara has been under pressure to perform I am concerned that being constantly told that she is perfect and amazing could increase that pressure.  If it is constantly reinforced that she is the person who makes her mother feel better, she may well experience that as a pressure to continue to always be amazing and perfect for her mother, to bear the responsibility for cheering her up when she is down, to buy her gifts to make her feel better. </span></p>

In my view it would be better to restrict indirect contact to birthdays and Christmas for now, with staff keeping letters safe for Sasha, and to keep this under review, in accordance with Sasha&#8217;s wishes and feelings about indirect contact.

I appreciate that this limits the activities that Sasha and her mother can do.  However, when contact was in the community there were incidents of secret conversations.  Even when contact has been closely supervised there have continued to be concerns about secret communications between the mother and her children.  The mother has not acknowledged the harm from this.  There is no evidence of a change in thinking that reassures me the risk has lessened.  In the professionals&#8217; meeting, Alice Rogers described the risk as follows: </span></p>

We were really worried about the razorblade but also the strange conversation about 'show me your self-harm cuts, let me see the other leg'. It's just very worrying and what we were thinking about is if she does that with Sasha, what is the potential for her to do that with Tara as Tara gets older. It's the secretness of it that's so worrying because it's just so hard to manage. And the same applies to making comments during contacts that undermine dad, that undermines Tara, that means that mum just cannot seem to get her head around Tara's needs to have stability and mum's need to be wanted overrides in that moment and she just can't stop herself.</span></p>

Tara is a bright and articulate girl who loves her mother and cherishes the time they have together.  Of course I have regard to her wishes and feelings.  However, against that must be balanced the risk of harm to her from spending too much time with her mother.  Because of her mother&#8217;s actions, the time she spends with her mother risks undermining and de-stabilising her placement with her father, and her relationship with him.  If that placement were to break down, it would not be safe for her to live with her mother.  Tara risks further disruption and the possibility of further public law proceedings in that event.</span></p>

However, on balance I have come to the conclusion that the risk of harm of reducing contact is less than the risk of harm to her in maintaining it at its current level.  Further, I have confidence that her father will be able to support Tara emotionally with a further reduction, as he did previously when it was reduced from twice a week to once a week.  </span></p>

I do not consider that there needs to be a review to reconsider frequency of contact at the end of October.   In the future (and after the [London Borough name redacted]&#8217;s involvement with the family ends), I envisage that the level of contact will remain as set out in the order, and the mother will pay the costs of a supervisor.  However, the final order will provide that there may be &#8216;such additional or alternative contact as the parents may agree&#8217;, so of course if both parents agree to a change in the arrangements, that may happen.  </span></p>
