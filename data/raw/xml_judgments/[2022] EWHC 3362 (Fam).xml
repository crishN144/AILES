She is not herself registered on the children&#8217;s birth certificates but her surname appears among their registered names. For several years following the breakdown of her civil partnership with the respondent she spent a lot of time with the children in England. All contact has now ceased. She has made applications under the Children Act and under the Inherent Jurisdiction with the underlying aim of obtaining orders for the children to spend time with her.</span></p>

Nor do I read Moylan LJ's use of the word &#8220;because&#8221; as importing a requirement of a causal link. To do so would be contrary to the &#8220;broad view&#8221; approach he advocated. For the reasons given by Bodey J in J v U, it will almost always be difficult to find a causal link between divorce proceedings and a later s.8 application &#8211; they are applications for different forms of relief. In my judgment, Moylan LJ was simply highlighting that there must be some form of connection: the term &#8220;because of&#8221; merely highlights the need for there to be a reason for the application that is connected with the matrimonial proceedings. The object of the statutory provisions, enacting the recommendations of the report of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, was to preserve the jurisdiction of the courts to make &#8220;custody orders&#8221; (welfare orders) in proceedings for divorce, including until the child is 18, and even if the parents or child become habitually resident outside the jurisdiction.

The mere fact that jurisdiction as to welfare issues is preserved in proceedings for divorce, and that welfare issues concerning a child are the basis for the s.8 application, does not mean that the reason for the s.8 application can be found in the divorce. In particular, if, during a period of years since a decree absolute, child arrangements have been settled by consent or court order, then the connection between the divorce proceedings and the s.8 application is likely to have been broken. In such circumstances, the reason for any welfare application is not connected to the matrimonial proceedings: the s.8 application has not been made &#8220;because of&#8221; those proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>

There must be one or more factors that establish a sufficient link between the divorce and the s.8 application, be they temporal, factual, causal, or something else. The reason for the application should be connected to the matrimonial proceedings. The implications of there being no requirement for a link between the welfare application and the matrimonial proceedings was discussed by Mostyn J at first instance in Lachaux, by Bodey J in J v U, and by Parker J in AP v TD </span><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23EWHCFAM%23sel1%252010%25year%252010%25page%252040%25&amp;A=0.3895841237216563&amp;backKey=20_T509198284&amp;service=citation&amp;ersKey=23_T509198246&amp;langcountry=GB" style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">[2010] EWHC 2040 </a><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23EWHCFAM%23sel1%252010%25year%252010%25page%252040%25&amp;A=0.3895841237216563&amp;backKey=20_T509198284&amp;service=citation&amp;ersKey=23_T509198246&amp;langcountry=GB" style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">(Fam)</a><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">.&#8221;</span></p>

She appeared to me have a relaxed and laid back personality, but is clearly articulate and intelligent. She spoke well and her answers were clear and generally supportive of her case. However, she was keen to impress on me that she considered herself the children&#8217;s mother and that they were her sons. Understandably she wanted to accentuate her involvement with the children&#8217;s conception and birth but she had to candidly admit that a lot of the available documentation did not assist her case. In places her answers were significantly lacking in detail. It became clear to me that she was not the organiser and even the decision- maker in the children&#8217;s lives. She was not able to provide a lot of detail about either the fertility treatment the respondent undertook or the management of the children&#8217;s lives. This ranged from day to day organisation to major decisions about whether they would live or be educated. I appreciate that often she was being asked questions about events some 8 years or even 14 years ago, but I was left with the impression that she was not as heavily involved as she would have me believe. I suspect that was because she is now desperate to resume a relationship with the children and understandably wanted me to know how important her role in their conception and lives had been. I accept in part the criticism made of her by Ms Renton that when she explained matters which didn&#8217;t quite fit with her narrative, she tended to fall back on reliance on latent homophobia and racism which did not really ring true. That said, I do not think that in cross examination she knowingly told me anything that she knew was false.</span></p>

She too was clearly intelligent and articulate but appeared to be more driven than the applicant. I think that she was the more powerful personality of the couple and was the one likely to make the major decisions both about their relationship and the children&#8217;s upbringing. Her evidence to me was generally more precise and factually detailed than that of the applicant&#8217;s. However, mirroring the applicant, she was keen to downplay and understate the involvement of the applicant in the children&#8217;s lives in a way which did not always ring true. I suspect she is very keen to ensure that the applicant is not able now to interfere with her own care of the children and the management of their lives. To adopt the phrase used by Mr Tyler, I think she did at times indulge in &#8216;case-building&#8217; in the way she pushed her own narrative to enlist the support of others, including Witness 6 who gave evidence to me and the lawyer presently attached to the fertility clinic.

When fertility records were first disclosed they were duly exhibited to the respondent&#8217;s statement dated 18 May 2022, helpfully prefaced by an index prepared by her own solicitors. The records disclosed barely mentioned the applicant, save for a couple of references to her as a partner of the respondent. The documents strongly supported the respondent&#8217;s case that she had been a single parent seeking fertility treatment to assist in the conception of children.</span></p>

They all described the parties as normal civil partners whose outward appearance was that of a normal couple with children. However, I accept that they made assumptions about the couple which, when scrutinised, were based on impressions and what they understood to be the nature of their relationship and the parenting of the children. They barely have any relationship any more with the respondent but, in varying degrees are friends, even close friends now with the applicant.

I have no doubt that he was telling me the truth as he recollected it; but I also agree with Mr Tyler&#8217;s point that his written evidence very closely resembles the language used by the respondent in her emails to him when she was attempting to solicit his assistance as a witness in this dispute. This cannot be mere coincidence and must have informed his recollection. I am therefore not entirely convinced that his recollection, although honest, is reliable. In particular, he very honestly accepted that his church did not accept same-sex relationships and, I infer, same-sex parenting.</span></p>

She specifically wanted children who were all genetically full siblings and who therefore had the same sperm donor. A&#8217;s sperm donor was no longer donating by the time of the miscarriage which I accept worried the respondent, as IUI uses far more vials of sperm than IVF and generally is accepted to have a lower success rate than IVF.

Given that the pre-condition of the fact of the parties&#8217; civil partnership at the relevant time is fulfilled, there is  a statutory presumption which can only be displaced by the proof of a negative: that there was no consent to the conception. Although in this case the burden of displacing the presumption rests on the respondent, in other cases it could be on &#8216;W&#8217; to displace the burden if, for example, she did not want to be a parent.

It would in my view wrong to take such a narrow temporal approach. I respectfully follow the reasoning of Poole J as to why a strictly temporal approach should not be adopted. Ms Renton submits that whichever approach of Poole J, I take, there is an insufficient connection between the children applications and the earlier civil partnership proceedings. She further contends that the applicant&#8217;s recent application to set aside the consent order was a device which was ultimately dismissed summarily with costs.

He justified his ruling on two bases: firstly on a common law rule allowing the court to look purposively at a statutory procedural requirement where the reading in of proposed words was compatible with the underlying thrust of the legislation and did not go against the grain of the legislation; and secondly the Art 8 rights of the child&#8217;s right to family life and private life throughout his life.</span></p>

Applying this approach, I do not find any &#8216;matter&#8217; which connects the applications before me and the civil partnership proceedings other than the fact that they both involve the same parties, the same children of the family and are before the courts of the same jurisdiction. There was no application or even a dispute over the children in or at the time of those proceedings. There is no temporal connection. These proceedings are brought because after 3 years of agreed child arrangements, the parties have, for whatever reason, fallen out and can no longer agree as to what arrangements for contact should now be made. I have not speculated as to those reasons but they were not present at the time of the dissolution. In other words, I am satisfied the applications now before the court have not been made because the civil partnership has been dissolved.</span></p>

	    <p class="BodyText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.61in;margin-right:0.75in">The fundamental peg for the acquisition of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">FLA 1986</ref> is the child&#8217;s habitual residence at the relevant time, in line with Art 5 of the 1996 Hague Convention. There is also jurisdiction based on a child&#8217;s presence at the relevant time or under the matrimonial jurisdiction as outlined above. Parliament has not introduced into the matrimonial jurisdiction scope for consideration of wider welfare interests of the children concerned or a factor about the availability of another suitable jurisdiction in another state or the lack of it. I accept that I have a general duty when making any decision about children, including their jurisdiction, to consider their best interests as a primary consideration &#8211; see Art 3.1 UNCRC and <span style="font-style:italic">ZH v (Tanzania) (FC) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/4" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 4</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 2 AC 166" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 2 AC 166</ref>. The difficulty here is that these are highly contentious proceedings and for the reasons outlined above, I am lacking the relevant information to form a view on best interests. Given the contents of Ms Coyle&#8217;s statement about A and my doubts about whether this a case involving the &#8216;alienation&#8217; of the children, it is not immediately obvious to me that their best interests require me to &#8216;read down&#8217; the FLA so as to make this country&#8217;s courts the appropriate forum, where a plain construction seemingly suggests otherwise.</p>

There is material in Ms Coyle&#8217;s statement which suggests that A would not wish the court to exercise its jurisdiction by making any order about him in favour of the applicant. He is now in his early teens. However, I have not received submissions from the parties on A&#8217;s welfare and by a fine balance I do not think it would be fair to dismiss the application in respect of him without doing so. Without giving either party any encouragement, if either of them wishes me to consider what directions are required in respect of A&#8217;s welfare, I will direct that party to make written submissions and for the other to reply. In those circumstances, I will need to consider what, if any, role A himself should play in any welfare consideration of his best interests, in accordance with the earlier direction of the court.</span></p>
