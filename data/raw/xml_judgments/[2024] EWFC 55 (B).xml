However, no application was made by F either to take A abroad or to vary the previous order so I directed that the Prohibited Steps Order should continue. Time for A with F was amended to take place every Sunday from 2pm to 4pm, with a plan to increase this after 4 sessions to 2pm to 5pm. I also reconsidered Fact-Finding and directed that a separate Fact-Finding hearing was required given the serious nature of some of the allegations, and that F continued to seek a shared care arrangement and would not accept any restrictions about the time that A should spend with him or his interactions w M in relation to those arrangements for A.  The parties were directed to file and serve responses to each other&#8217;s allegations. A direction was also made for HMCTS to fund a Qualified Legal Representative (QLR) to cross examine M since F was a litigant in person who indicated that he could not afford to fund a legal representative and was not eligible for public funding.</span></p>

The QLR attended this hearing and assisted with identifying the scope and likely length of cross examination that would be conducted to put F&#8217;s case. By this point F had not seen A since August, despite unsupervised contact still being permitted by court order. He made it clear that it was not the practicalities of when A would see him under the interim arrangements that were the issue, but rather that F would not agree with any arrangement that imposed limitations on how and when A spent time with him. In fact, he persisted in viewing it as &#8216;his&#8217; time with A despite being told that the perspective of the Family Court was about A&#8217;s time with each parent. In the end, despite trying to persuade F of the merits for A of him spending time with her, and despite M being in complete agreement with the continuation of similar arrangements to those that had been in place before, I suspended the order for A to spend time with F because of F&#8217;s refusal to participate in those arrangements.

The court office was able to contact F by phone and F initially seemed to say that he had not received the order refusing the adjournment but had had an email from the court office sent to him on Friday.

They also contained two letters from other individuals, potentially as character evidence, though again neither were in the required format and F did not have permission to file additional witness evidence.

I note that F was told by me in the two previous hearings, and it is clearly stated on each court order, that no party may file evidence unless permitted by court direction. The last court order (and at least one of the previous court orders) also made it clear that a written statement had to contain a declaration of truth and must be signed and dated by the maker of the statement. F&#8217;s last-minute attempt to produce written evidence is clearly in breach of the court direction setting a deadline for him to comply and seems to be a blatant disregard of the Family Procedure Rules. Even if F had produced documents in an admissible format and produced a reasonable explanation for their late production, producing them so late in the hearing after closing submissions had been heard risked preventing the other party from being able to fairly respond. However, since F did not attend the earlier part of the hearing and has not provided any explanation for the late production of these documents (which in any event are not admissible), the issue of whether this might have prevented an effective hearing did not arise. The documents were not admitted given the absence of explanation for their late production, and the absence of any attempt to comply with the procedural formalities of written evidence, and I have therefore completely disregarded their contents in considering the issues in this Fact-Finding Hearing.</span></p>

In her written evidence she has produced texts which demonstrate that she would be trying to resolve issues with him and he would refuse to do so until she had sex with him (using, as she explained, a personal code between them which meant that when he said &#8220;no 5 min no talk&#8221;(C105) that was about sex).  Her oral evidence about this was also clear, consistent, and compelling.

It was this incident that ended up with F grabbing M by the back of her neck and forcing her face down onto the bed which I have noted earlier in this judgment. The maternal grandmother also gave clear and credible evidence about F ringing her and her husband to complain about M on occasions, and specifically about a second incident to the one on 4</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:initial">th</span><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial"> December 2021.

M&#8217;s written statement at C75 sets out her detail about the aftermath which shows that F became &#8220;uncontrollably angry&#8221;, and she ended up having to ring her parents. The maternal grandmother and grandfather were so concerned by F&#8217;s behaviour and clear anger that they took the decision to ring the police, something that F clearly does not dispute happened because he refers to the police arriving that night in his first document and provides a photograph of them on the doorstep (C120-C121, and C123).  As M told me in her evidence, the police disclosure is woefully lacking since it does not confirm that the police were called and attended on this date, but F is the one who produces the photographic evidence of this, in fact. The maternal grandmother was also very clear in her evidence to me that F had made it clear to M that she and her husband were no longer welcome at the family home after this incident.</span></p>

She gave clear and credible evidence, consistent with that of M and the maternal grandmother, that M was unable to get her car out because of F&#8217;s actions, that F was listening in on the phone call at the time, and that they arranged to meet at a different location which did not require M to drive.</span></p>

In addition to M&#8217;s own evidence about this, and particularly the incidents noted above when A was present and exposed to F preventing M from leaving the house or physically assaulting her, M has also produced evidence from A&#8217;s nursery (C91-93). These records show the impact on A of F&#8217;s leaving without telling M or A where he was going, of his preventing M and A from leaving the house and F making comments to A about taking her abroad. I have also been concerned to note that F, both in his document at C166 and in the last hearing before me, has raised doubts about A&#8217;s paternity. He told me in the November 2023 hearing that he wanted a DNA test because of his allegations that M had been unfaithful to him (even though he had no evidence of this), but also that the result would not affect his relationship with A. When he was asked about how A when she is older may view his doubts about paternity and his need to have proof that he was her father, he seemed totally unable to see that this may have any impact on A. I have noted that, as Mr Erhabor elicited in cross examination from M and both of her witnesses, there was also evidence of how much A clearly loved F and his demonstrating that at times despite their evidence about his abusive behaviour. </span></p>

It is striking how little of F&#8217;s written &#8216;evidence&#8217; actually addresses any of the allegations, in fact. Instead, he has focused on what can only be described as a wholly irrelevant and deeply concerning character assassination of M. At one point, without the permission of the court, he sought to adduce evidence about M&#8217;s behaviour many years before they met, including photographs clearly taken whilst she was at university. I determined that this was not relevant or admissible and the photographs in question have been removed from the bundle at my direction.</span></p>

As Ms Adams submitted in closing, there is also ample evidence from M in the bundle which shows that she tried time and again to resolve the issues in her relationship with F, trying to get him to spend time with A (C115), and to engage with counselling and seeking the assistance of his church pastor (C154; C156).  She also sought assistance on her own, which resulted in her being referred to specialist domestic abuse support (C89). All of this conveys someone who has been subjected to a pattern of abusive behaviour by F and yet who, as she told me, still loved him, and wanted him to have a relationship with his daughter who also clearly misses her daddy. All of this is also relevant when I turn to consider F&#8217;s evidence and his allegation about M&#8217;s behaviour.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">F&#8217;s allegation against M is that she has sought to prevent A spending time with him and has engaged in alienating behaviours. It is difficult to work out what precisely he relies upon to prove this, though. From the outset of the proceedings, it has been clear that M is willing for A to spend time with F and for that time to be unsupervised. Her only caveats have been around handovers being safe so as to protect her and A from the sort of abusive behaviour that forms part of her allegations against F. This is not necessarily the case in all cases where domestic abuse is alleged, and M is to be commended for such a child-focused approach. However, despite this, F has not seen A since last August and it appears that the only reason he has not seen A is his unwillingness to participate in spending time with A that is in any way curtailed by either court order or, perhaps more significantly, by the practicalities and needs of a child of A&#8217;s age.  I have already noted that M has produced compelling evidence to show the efforts that she has gone to both during the relationship and afterwards to try to ensure that A spent time with F. In addition, contrary to F's allegations about M trying to interfere with his visa application, M has produced evidence at C157-C164 to show that she tried time and again to help him with his visa application.  Considering the guidance in Re S which I have noted above, F has failed to produce any evidence to show that A doesn&#8217;t want to spend time with him either. In fact, in the documents he has submitted there is absolutely no mention of A not wanting to spend time with him. Instead, he focusses on largely incoherent and irrelevant allegations about M&#8217;s character and behaviour both before, during and after their marriage. It is a bit difficult to work out from his documents because they are so incoherent, but it seems at C123 as if he is alleging that M tried to prevent him from knowing about a medical appointment for A in February 2023. His account is a bit difficult to follow, but it seems he was working away and thought that M was reluctant to tell him whilst he was away that A was ill. When he came home, he alleges that she did not want to tell him which GP&#8217;s surgery she was taking A to. What M said about this was that A was ill, she did tell F (and even on his own account at C123 it seems he did know she was ill before he came home), but that only one parent was allowed to accompany A to what was an out of hours emergency GP appointment because of lack of capacity at the surgery and residual Covid restrictions.  F, of course, has chosen not to attend this hearing so has not given me any oral evidence about this or any of the disputed aspects. He has also, as I have noted, failed to produce written statements verified by a statement of truth signed and dated by him, so the evidential value of his documents is therefore limited.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:11pt;color:initial">Practice Direction 12J remains relevant now that I have dealt with the fact-finding element of these proceedings. Para 21 of PD12J makes it clear that the court needs to think carefully about whether CAFCASS should be directed to prepare a report under section 7 of the Children Act 1989. PD12Q is also relevant since PD12J makes it clear that a court may need to consider an order under section 91(14) preventing further applications to the Family Court under the Children Act 1989 in relation to A without leave of the Court. I am concerned that F has subjected both M and A to significant domestic abuse and is still behaving in a way that is abusive and there is evidence of an inability to put A&#8217;s needs above his own. Balanced against that is A&#8217;s statutory right to a relationship with both of her parents if it is safe and CAFCASS may need to explore with both parties what safeguarding steps may be necessary and practicable. Whether F is able to accept the outcome of this fact finding and take steps to address his perpetration of domestic abuse may well be relevant to any welfare outcome of this case. It is also concerning that F has not so far shown that he really accepts the authority of the court and has not complied with previous court orders.</span></p>
