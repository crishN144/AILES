One of issues in the care proceedings is whether the Second Respondent, HD, can be permitted to spend time unsupervised with X and the terms of HD&#8217;s bail conditions set by Nottinghamshire Police.  The care proceedings are before HHJ Reece to consider the welfare of X and are listed for a final hearing in the week of 4 March. I am only considering the interface between the bail conditions and the orders as to unsupervised contact that HHJ Reece can make. </p>

HD and TL were also approved as foster carers and had a child, Y, placed in their care in August 2022.  Until September 2022 HD was also employed as a social worker.</p>

The perpetration of these injuries, and injuries sustained in August 2022, was the subject of a 5 day fact-finding hearing in September 2023 when HHJ Reece made findings. The injuries were found to have been caused by TL, but additional findings were made against HD regarding his non-disclosure of previous injuries observed to Y in August 2022 and his failure to protect Y.</p>

The final evidence of the LA dated 10 January 2024 proposed that X remain cared for by BL (TL&#8217;s mother) under a Special Guardianship Order with HD to have supervised time only with X.  This position was opposed by HD who sought a return of X to his sole care.  The Guardian proposed that X remain with BL but under a Care Order.  She supported there being no unsupervised contact for X with HD.</p>

Ms Claxton explained that the LA were proposing a very careful and highly contingent plan, with assessment at each stage. There was therefore no certainty that X would necessarily end up in HD&#8217;s full time care. In the LA plan X would commence with unsupervised contact on Saturday mornings, when HD would take him to his kick boxing class, and on Sundays. Unsupervised overnight contact would not commence until August. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This matter was referred to me because HHJ Reece informed me, and the parties agree that this is the position within their knowledge, that Nottinghamshire Police are now routinely imposing bail conditions requiring no unsupervised contact with a child, in cases where there are Family Court proceedings, without including a caveat that there can be unsupervised contact if the Family Court, and/or the LA agree. This stance of the Nottinghamshire Police is, to my knowledge, different from that usually adopted by other Police Forces across the Midlands where, if a bail condition prohibits unsupervised contact, or indeed any contact, with children then that is subject to the LA or Family Court allowing such contact. </p>

This principle supports both good administration but also the interests to be protected. The reality of the Police and the Family Court (and LA) taking a potentially different approach to HD&#8217;s contact in this case has been a great deal of wasted public expense, which could have been much better used. </p>

If the ground for refusing to countenance unsupervised contact was that of potential interference with a witness, then that is an issue where I would expect the Police to have an entirely separate area of expertise. The assessment of that risk would generally be a matter for the Police, but would necessarily have to be reconsidered on a regular basis. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the facts of this case, I have no doubt that HHJ Reece is in a much better position to determine any risks to X from HD, and whether unsupervised contact can be appropriately managed, than are the Police. HHJ Reece has conducted a 5 day fact finding hearing, including having heard oral evidence from HD. He also has the benefit of recommendations from the Guardian employed by Cafcass, who is a senior social worker with enormous experience of assessing risk to children. The task of the Family Court Judge in a case such as this, is largely to assess and balance risk to children in a timely and proportionate manner. The Family Court Judge has to undertake their task taking into account their statutory duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  It is no disrespect to the Police to say that they will have neither the detailed knowledge of the child&#8217;s best interests in the case nor the same expert advice as will HHJ Reece. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note that during the hearing Mr Posner made clear that if I considered that HHJ Reece should be able to order unsupervised contact, then the Police would agree to vary bail conditions. On the facts of this case this was a helpful change of position. However, I note that it only came after a High Court judge had to intervene in the case. I would very much hope that in the future the Police will carefully consider the position and role of the Family Court when they come to determining bail conditions in cases such as this. </p>
