The Clinic is in this jurisdiction, where RO has been since 2021. As RO remains habitually resident in Ireland, she is the responsibility of the Applicant Health Service Executive of Ireland (&#8216;the HSE&#8217;). The issue before this court is the HSE&#8217;s application for recognition and enforcement of an order of the Irish High Court dated 5 October 2023. Holman J had previously recognised an earlier order in March 2021.</p>

That order was recognised and enforced by this Court by order of Holman J on 31 March 2021. RO was admitted to the Clinic in early April 2021. Since then there have been regular updates provided by the Clinic. Those updates were all before the President of the Irish High Court at the hearing on 5 October 2023.</p>

The protective measures contained in the order dated 5 October 2023 come within the provisions of Paragraph 5. RO was habitually resident in Ireland at the time the protective measures were taken and she had a proper opportunity to be heard before the High Court of Ireland in accordance with Paragraph 19(3)(b). The protective measures satisfy the criteria for detention under Article 5(1) ( e) of the EHCR and she continues to be afforded a regular and effective right of review of her detention in the Irish High Court, which complies with the requirements of Article 5(4) EHCR. There is nothing to indicate that the recognition and enforcement of these protective measures is contrary to public policy for the purposes of Paragraph 19(4)(a) and/or would be inconsistent with a mandatory provision of the law of England and Wales for the purposes of Paragraph 19 (4)(b).</p>

There is no requirement in Schedule 3 that any protective measure put forward for recognition and enforcement should be based on a legislative statute, rather than having a common-law or inherent jurisdiction basis. The important consideration, they submit, is that the order is valid in the domestic law of the state in which it is made. Prior to the Irish High Court making orders under its adult Wardship jurisdiction, orders made in respect of protected persons under the inherent jurisdiction in Ireland were approved for recognition and enforcement by the Court of Protection (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re PA &amp; Ors</span> [46] and [103]).</p>

On the information the court has seen this matter was given careful consideration by the President prior to the order being made on 5 October 2023, he considered the checklist and gave a reasoned judgment. The fact that the order was made under the inherent jurisdiction rather than the adult Wardship jurisdiction makes no material difference. It was in accordance with the domestic law in Ireland at the relevant time. As the President observed during the hearing on 5 October 2023 <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;there&#8217;s no doubt that the inherent jurisdiction exists, and there is no doubt that it can be &#8211; there&#8217;s no doubt that it can be exercised on the appropriate facts in a case such as this.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Practice Directions provides that Schedule 3 applications that involve authorisation of a deprivation of liberty will <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;usually&#8217;</span> be determined after holding a hearing.

In view of the seriousness of such a decision, as well as the international aspects, I agree with Mr Setright that such orders should be only be made by a Court of Protection Tier-3 judge (i e a permanent or deputy High Court judge), following an attended hearing in court. If the application is definitely proceeding by consent I would have thought that a listing of one hour would be appropriate. But if the application is not proceeding by consent, or there is doubt as to whether it is or is not contentious, then in my opinion the application should be listed for a day with an interim hearing of one hour being urgently fixed to consider making an interim order permitting the implementation of the foreign measure pro tem&#8230;</span></p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">What Mr Setright submits is that there may be certain categories of these Schedule 3 applications that could be considered without an attended hearing. He bases this submission on the recent jurisdiction changes in Ireland which means that a number of orders may in the future be made which, apart from the change to the use of the inherent (Irish) jurisdiction instead of the adult (Irish) wardship jurisdiction, replicate in every material respect the provisions of the orders that they replace. If that is the only material change which underpins the application under Schedule 3, Mr Setright submits a more proportionate way of managing the application in that situation could be by the matter being dealt with without the need for an oral hearing. He submits this procedure would only apply in cases where certain conditions are met, namely:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"> However, as Mr Setright realistically recognises in his written submissions on this issue, there may be real limitations in such clear demarcation lines being drawn. It may be there are not extant and unequivocal written consents to the application, in which case an oral hearing will be required. Also, in circumstances where there is a time lapse between the order to be replaced and the fresh order this Court will still need to be satisfied that the relevant core criteria under Schedule 3 are established at the date of the making of the new Irish order, by reference to the supporting material, as well as considering whether any matters of public policy arise. Whilst a skeleton argument, cross referencing the supporting material to the core criteria may help, it may in reality reduce delay if this was undertaken at an oral hearing, even if a relatively short one.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Mr Setright sets out, the inherent urgency of these cases often means they come before the court within 48 hours of the sealed Irish order becoming available. The transcript of the judgment sometimes comes later and the consents even later. In this case, the final order of the Irish High Court was provided on 16 October 2023 and this hearing took place two days later on 18 October 2023. This had consequent delays in the preparation of the bundle, which was not available until 11am the day before the hearing.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Now having had the opportunity to consider the further written submissions from Mr Setright, I do not consider there should be any change in the arrangements for considering these applications. In accordance with paragraph 17 of Practice Direction 23A the presumption is that these applications will be determined at an oral hearing if they involve authorising deprivation of liberty. There should always be a skeleton argument filed in support, that takes the court through the relevant criteria and directs the court to how the criteria are satisfied by the supporting material lodged. There remains the option for this Court to consider whether a hearing is necessary but due to the urgency with which these applications have to be dealt with and the inherent lateness of all the supporting material being available there are only likely to be limited circumstances when such a course is appropriate, even when, at the very least, the requirements outlined in paragraph 22 above are met.  I agree with the observations made by Mostyn J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re SV </span>that due to the seriousness of the consequences of the reciprocal order being sought, as well as the international aspects, such orders should only be made by a Court of Protection Tier 3 judge following an attended hearing in court, unless the Tier 3 judge otherwise directs.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, turning to the material that should be filed in support of a Schedule 3 application. I agree with the suggestion made by Mr Setright that there should be a core bundle filed which contains the relevant documents in support of the application.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_27">

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The core bundle should contain the following: (i) the application; (ii) the skeleton argument; (iii) the draft order; (iv) the consents (if applicable); (v) the order of the Irish High Court; (vi) the transcript of the judgment and, in cases where this is necessary, the transcript of the hearing. This is to cover situations, such as here, where the ex-tempore judgment refers to exchanges during the hearing. Where the transcript is lengthy relevant passages should be marked up and linked to the skeleton argument.</p>
