Ms Kirby submits PQ knew as long ago as late 2014 that the Clinic would pay for legal advice about this issue and he delayed nearly four years before making this application. Ms Gartland points to the fact that in 2014 it was a joint decision of the parties not to take the matter any further and they relied on what the Clinic had said that his status as a parent would not be affected unless a challenge was subsequently made. Additionally, it was not until January 2019 that the Clinic confirmed it would pay for PQ&#8217;s legal costs in making an application for a declaration. </p>

Ms Gartland submits in his written evidence PQ has explained the reasons for the steps he took. It was a joint decision in 2014 to take no further steps, and since their separation both parties have sought to question PQ&#8217;s status regarding the children and his actions with the CMS was in the context of the difficult financial situation between the parties and his wish to maintain the mortgage on the family home. </p>

The position of status crystallises then.

In those circumstances the fact that Form PP was completed incorrectly by them was clearly an error.
