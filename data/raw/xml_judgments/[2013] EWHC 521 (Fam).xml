	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am concerned with a 10 month old boy called T, who was born in this country on 22 April 2012. His mother was born on 15 September 1995, and is therefore only 17. His father was born on 16 June 1992 and is therefore only 20. The mother and father are both Slovakian citizens. T was conceived in Slovakia when the father was just 19 and the mother not yet 16. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother and father come from the ethnic or racial group known by the exonym Romani. In the English-speaking world the Romani were known for generations as gypsies - a disparaging corruption of the word Egyptian. Fortunately that appellation has fallen into disuse. The Romani people migrated from the Indian subcontinent into Europe about 1500 years ago and for most of their history have been subjected to persecution and forced assimilation at the hands of, among others, the Byzantines, the Ottomans and ethnic Slavs. More recently they were subjected to the bestial genocidal practices of Nazi Germany and its vassal states. There are presently about 100,000 to 200,000 Romanis in Slovakia, about 2% to 4% of the population. Even following the war of 1939 &#8211; 1945 they were subjected to discrimination and forced assimilation by the communist regime, and it has only been since the fall of communism that they have been treated more equally. But deprivation and acute social problems for the community have endured and this has led to the migration of many Romani people to this country and elsewhere. Thus in July 2008 the mother's mother left Slovakia with the mother's siblings to join her husband, her children's stepfather, in Rotherham.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Shortly beforehand on 19 May 2008 a court in Michalovce, Slovakia ordered that the mother be placed in a crisis centre following certain allegations by her against her stepfather and mother. In July 2008 the relationship between the mother and father began. The mother was then aged 13, the father 16. On 14 January 2009 the Michalovce District Court made an order placing the mother in the children's home in that city. In July 2011 the mother fell pregnant and on 30 November 2011 the Michalovce District Court ordered that the mother be transferred to the children's home in Kosice which had a special unit for underage mothers. It was from there on 29 February 2012 that the mother ran away with the father and travelled to this country which she entered on false papers. The mother and father went to the town where her family were living, and it was there on 22 April 2012 that T was born. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was not only on account of the mother's young age that the local authority was concerned for the newly born infant. Almost from the moment of their arrival here in 2008 protective measures had been taken in relation to the mother's siblings and this led to all or some of them being made the subject of care orders in 2010. I have not been given the details. At all events the local authority undertook a core assessment immediately following T&#8217;s birth and only allowed the mother to take him to her own mother's home on discharge from hospital on 4 May 2012 on the basis that the mother signed a "contract of expectations". Unfortunately as a result of various intra-familial disputes the placement broke down and ultimately on 18 May 2012 the mother and T moved to a Mother and Baby Unit for a 12 week period of assessment pursuant to an agreement made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>. However, on 23 May 2012 the mother left the unit leaving the baby behind, and although she returned the following day she left again finally on 27 May 2012, complaining that the place was like a prison. </p>

That application has since been augmented by an application for a placement (for adoption) order. There have since been 12 interlocutory orders made by the court including a final directions order by me on 5 March 2013 when I directed that the first day of the final hearing fixed for four days commencing on 11 March 2013 should be used to determine the question of which is the most convenient forum in which all issues concerning T&#8217;s future should be adjudicated, for the reasons which I will explain below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 19 July 2012 the Director of the children's home in Kosice wrote to the local authority stating "our interest is that the mother be returned to the children's home, as she is entrusted to our care by the courts". Later the authorities in Slovakia expanded this to seek the return of T also. On  27 September 2012 the children's home informed the Slovakian Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family (which I take to be the relevant government Ministry) of the circumstances of the case and on 3 October 2012 the Slovakian Central Authority received a report from the Ministry about the mother and T. The Slovakian Central Authority contacted the Central Authority (ICACU) here on 5 October 2012. On 18 January 2013 a lengthy letter entitled &#8220;Intervention of the Slovak Central Authority&#8221; was received by the court authored by Andrea Cisarova. This has been supplemented by two further detailed submissions dated 21 February 2013 and 8 March 2013. In these documents the Slovakian Central Authority forcefully argues that under EU law, equally applicable in Slovakia and this country, the mother and T are both habitually resident in Slovakia; the mother is the subject of an order which is entitled to recognition and enforcement here; and that this is a case where a request should be made by this court under article 15 of Regulation Brussels II Revised<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

The question was whether the English court should invite the Dutch court to reconsider that refusal. Munby J considered that a stringent test should be applied in those circumstances and that the applicant did not meet it. It can be seen therefore that this decision is not directly in point. However, Munby J made some helpful observations about article 15 in general. In paragraph 34 he made the obvious point that the only court which can make a substantive decision under article 15 is the court "having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter". In this case that is this court. Secondly, there were three questions under article 15 (1) to be considered:</p>

Given the various matters set out in Article 15(3) as bearing on this question, this is, in essence, a simple question of fact.

In particular it is significant that the concept of paramountcy did not find expression in the Regulation, and this of course is concordant with principle (e) above. Accordingly I do not derive any assistance in seeking to explicate article 15 from the decision of the House of Lords in<span style="font-style:italic"> Re J (A Child) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 AC 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 AC 80</ref>. This set out the principles to be applied on an application for a summary return of a child to a non-Hague country, in that case Saudi Arabia.

This argument was not supported by Leading Counsel for the local authority, and rightly so, as in my opinion it constitutes a remarkably counter-intuitive Catch-22. In essence it says that this court having jurisdiction over the substance of the case should hear the case to its conclusion in order to decide whether to transfer it to be heard to its conclusion in Slovakia. I simply do not accept this argument. And in any event it is contrary to authority which is to be applied by analogy.</p>

Nothing turns, in my view, on the difference between "the best interests of the child" in article 12.3, "the superior interests of the child" in article 12.1 and "the child's interest" in article 12.4. They must mean the same thing, which is that it is in the child's interests for the case to be determined in the courts of this country rather than elsewhere. This question is quite different from the substantive question in the proceedings, which is "what outcome to these proceedings will be in the best interests of the child?" It will not depend upon a profound investigation of the child's situation and upbringing but upon the sort of considerations which come into play when deciding upon the most appropriate <span style="font-style:italic">forum</span>.

It is a terrible thing to say to any parent &#8211; particularly, perhaps, to a mother &#8211; that he or she is to lose their child for ever. When a family judge makes a freeing or an adoption order in relation to a twenty-year old mother's baby, the mother will have to live with the consequences of that decision for what may be upwards of 60 years, and the baby for what may be upwards of 80 years. We must be vigilant to guard against the risks.&#8221;</p>

Traumatic stress makes for increased levels of cortisol; baby is prepared for a fight/flight response, the heart rate speeds up, there is a lack of oxygen, and the baby jumps to every stimulus, however neutral. There is a numbing of social responsiveness. Babies are described as having a fixed gaze which is disconcertingly empty. "The lights may be on, but there is no one at home". Contact notes describe T in these terms on more than one occasion. Babies become hyper vigilant and hard to settle, they are often surrounded by heightened anxiety and anger in the adults around them. The baby's muscle tone is perpetually rigid, something I have experienced in holding T attempting to sooth him. There is a sharp contrast to T&#8217;s presentation when in the care of his foster carer, with whom he has formed an attachment.&#8221;</p>

He is at the age when he has the opportunity to transfer that attachment to another care-giver. If he is enabled to transfer this attachment to his new permanent carer, the prospects for his emotional wellbeing are good. If he is not able to do this successfully, the risk is that he will shut down emotionally and permanent damage will be done to the future prospects of any successful attachment to any carer.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">The Slovakian plan involves the Child being placed with his Mother as his primary carer, albeit with professional supervision. The observations of contact between the Child and his Mother show that he will be seriously distressed if he is placed in his Mother&#8217;s full-time care. Despite her best efforts, she is unable to soothe and calm him. He will often not accept care, such as feeding, from her. If the Mother and the Child are put in this position full-time, the distress caused to the Mother is likely to make her chances of caring successfully for the Child even less. The Mother herself believes that the best way forward would be for Child to be in foster care initially in Slovakia in order to build up contact with her. </p>

In so holding they overruled a decision to the contrary by one of our more experienced family judges, Charles J, and disagreed with the dissenting judgment in the case before them by Thorpe LJ. That decision is of course binding on me even if I respectfully disagree with it. Certainly the reading by the Slovakian Central Authority of the most recent decisions of the ECJ is not in accordance with the reasoning of the majority and I have to say that it is a strained interpretation of <span style="font-style:italic">Mercredi v Chaffe</span> that an infant who is born away from his homeland cannot be said to be habitually resident there until he returns.
