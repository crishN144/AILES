	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is some confusion about the identification of the grounds of appeal in that the appellant&#8217;s skeleton argument sets out grounds which are not the same as the formal Grounds of Appeal. Further, one of the headings for the grounds in the skeleton (ground 3) is in rather more limited form than the accompanying narrative. However, I am satisfied that Judd J gave permission to appeal in respect of the grounds numbered and identified in the skeleton argument, and on the basis of the narrative for each ground. I approach this appeal accordingly. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The appeal is not opposed by the Local Authority or the ICB. It is opposed by the Health Trust (save in respect of Ground 6, on which it is neutral) which holds responsibility for the area where RB is currently hospitalised. It is common ground that the hospital ward is not an appropriate environment for RB, and her presence allocates resources away from other requirements. The Hospital Trust is in the uncomfortable position of effectively housing RB until these proceedings resolve her future. It does strike me that the Trust&#8217;s position in the litigation is somewhat peripheral. Its interest at a practical level is to secure the departure of RB from the hospital. The outcome of capacity and best interests assessments is only of relevance to the Trust in terms of potential delay. In saying this, I am not in any way downplaying the Trusts&#8217; commitment to the wellbeing of RB.</p>

She has been in a number of placements which have been unsuccessful. In June 2020, she was found to have capacity to decide where to live after leaving a community placement. In August 2020, she was detained in a psychiatric hospital for over 2 years. On 3 January 2023, she was discharged to a bungalow with a 24/7 package of 2:1 care. She was clearly deeply unhappy there, partly as a result of being transported against her will and subject to physical restraint.  Over two days, she undertook several acts of deliberate self harm including attempts to strangle herself. The judge below received evidence from the expert consultant psychiatrist that &#8220;&#8230;.. <span style="font-style:italic">a return would be likely to cause her real physical, emotional and psychological injury that has the potential to be lifelong&#8221;</span>.</p>

She is medically fit for discharge but has consistently said that she does not want to return to the bungalow, nor does she agree to return there.

Dr Camden-Smith initially emailed to say that RB would not engage with her, and accordingly suggested there was no point in reporting further. The parties nevertheless framed a series of questions for Dr Camden-Smith to answer. She encompassed her replies within a report of 3 May 2023. Because of RB&#8217;s lack of engagement, the report was mainly based on written material and conversations she had with others who had worked with her.</p>

To put it another way, discharge from hospital was predicated on the basis that the only possible outcome was a return to the bungalow, and the capacity decision was therefore made on the basis.

That evaluation depended upon, inter alia, the information recorded in the order of 21 February 2023. Inevitably, that includes a possible return to the bungalow (it would be unrealistic to separate this out) but that was not the only possible option, nor the only factor to be taken into account. Others included the Local Authority continuing searches for alternative placements, or RB simply refusing to leave hospital and accepting the potential consequence of a forced departure which might include living in a hotel or living rough (as she has done before). The latter might be deemed an unwise decision, but by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(4)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> that is not of itself indicative of lack of capacity.

She would likely be able to choose between A or B if the bungalow were not included as an option, but if unable to separate hospital discharge from the bungalow then she is unable to weigh and use the relevant information to make a decision.  The judge recognised that this is a difficult concept, since it is the second decision (the bungalow) which impacts the first decision (the discharge). In my judgment, this evidence of Dr Camden-Smith, and the conceptual difficulties flowing therefrom as identified by the judge, demonstrates that eliding two capacity decision issues into one led to error. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not for RB to establish capacity or justify her autonomous wishes; she is presumed to be capacitous. To interpret a refusal to contemplate returning to the bungalow as indicative of lack of capacity, or causative of lack of capacity, as the expert seems to do, should be weighed against an alternative explanation that she was simply expressing a capacitous wish not to go there again after her prior experiences. In my judgment, the judge did not adequately weigh up these competing factors in circumstances where by any measure a strongly held wish not to return to the bungalow, with clearly stated reasons, was understandable.  This ground of appeal is allowed.</p>

Further, I observe that in my view the judge approached the case with great care and sensitivity. Nevertheless, for the reasons given, I will allow the appeal and remit for a rehearing.</p>

I appreciate the complexities of this case which is challenging to all involved. I appreciate also the immense pressure on resources. Nevertheless, from what I have seen and heard, for RB to return to the bungalow risks causing her profound harm.  What happened during her time there is shocking. The expert&#8217;s view about the potential impact on her physically, emotionally and psychologically is compelling. Transportation would almost certainly take place against her will, and require physical restraint. It seems to me that alternative options simply have to be sourced. The expert says that RB should be given a viable alternative that is not the bungalow, and I agree. If the bungalow is removed from the equation, it is possible (indeed, I suspect, likely), that capacity and best interests issues may well resolve themselves. </p>
