The wife sold her London property and gave the entire net proceeds (some &#163;156,000) to the husband which he used to pay off the mortgage on the London property which had by then become their first matrimonial home.  That transfer of equity represented the entirety of the wife&#8217;s independent financial resources at the time.  As a result the London property was transferred into their joint names.</span></p>

By this stage the wife was working part-time as a lawyer and had started to work on her first project as a writer.  The husband had been offered the opportunity to leave England and work in the United Arab Emirates where his employers maintained an office for their corporate and other clients.  Each of the parties saw the potential move from London as a rewarding opportunity both in terms of the financial benefits which such a move would bring and also in terms of the lifestyle which they would enjoy with the prospect of a child or children on the horizon.</span></p>

He was then three years old and the wife brought him to England to seek specialist care at a central London hospital.  He became a patient of Professor H and remains so to this day.  Whilst the family continued to live in Dubai for the next two or three years, the wife, with the three children, made repeated trips back to London during the school holidays in order that T&#8217;s condition could be properly monitored and controlled.  By the summer of 2012, the wife had started house-hunting in Kent.  The parties chose that particular area because of the availability locally of excellent education for the children.  Their final matrimonial home, TW, was purchased in August 2012 for &#163;1.385 million.  It was a substantial property and this couple spent a further &#163;400,000 odd renovating and refurbishing that home.</span></p>

On appeal, a circuit judge confirmed that the wife had no more than a nominal entitlement to support in her own right but increased the element of the children&#8217;s support to &#163;1,000 per month reducing, as before, on a pound for pound basis to reflect future decisions made by the Agency.  The Court of Appeal set aside the order on the basis that there was no jurisdiction to make provision for the children through an order for spousal support where the spouse (or former spouse) in question had no substantive entitlement in his or her own right to receive financial support from the other spouse.</span></p>

A practice has grown up, finding its origins before District Judge Segal in the Principal Registry, to make an order for spousal maintenance under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/23/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 23(1)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref> that incorporates some of the costs of supporting the children as part of a global order.  When a &#8216;Segal order&#8217; is made an important ingredient is that the overall sum will reduce pro tanto from the date upon which the Child Support Agency brings in an assessment.  The utility of the &#8216;Segal order&#8217; is obvious, since in many cases the determination of the ancillary relief claims will come at a time when the Child Support Agency has yet to complete its assessment of liability.  It is therefore very convenient for a district judge to have a form of order which will carry the parent with primary care over that interim pending the Agency&#8217;s determination.</span></p>

There was no application then pending to the CMS, far less an assessment; as the terms of the judgment which I have quoted above make clear, the judge had clearly catered for a situation where it was possible that no such assessment would be carried out during the life of the order.  Of course, the court does not trigger the assessment process or have any part to play in the referral process.

He appointed Mr Justice Mostyn as chair of a small but highly experienced drafting group.  That group produced the comprehensive set of orders contained in the omnibus.  It was the clear intention of the President at the time that the use of such orders would in due course become mandatory in the Family Court and the Family Division.  In the normal course of events, counsel for the parties would have agreed the terms of the order under appeal following delivery of judgment.  In this case, as the parties were litigants in person, albeit with a legal background, it may well be that the judge himself drew the order.  I know not and it makes no difference to the issues which I have to determine on this appeal.  I merely make the point that paragraph 20 of the judge&#8217;s order was framed in entirely conventional terms which appear to be an amalgam of  Mostyn J&#8217;s draft precedents 62(d) and 68 in the omnibus.</span></p>

That case concerned a mother&#8217;s financial claims for a child under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 15</ref> and Schedule 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  The unmarried father was resident outside the jurisdiction in Jersey.  His financial obligations towards the child, as assessed by the court in 2007, included an order for periodical payments at the rate of &#163;41,200 per annum, index-linked.  The court&#8217;s jurisdiction to make such an order was expressly agreed and recorded as a recital on the face of the order.  After several years of paying under the order, the father made an application to the CMS for a maintenance assessment.  On the basis that his income for these purposes was assessed to be just over &#163;20,000 per annum, the maintenance calculation was fixed in the sum of &#163;26.43 per week or about &#163;1,375 per annum.  The mother applied for what was, in effect, the reinstatement of the 2007 periodical payments order.  There was a very significant dispute between the parties as to the true level of the father&#8217;s income.  Whilst expressing his sympathy for the mother&#8217;s plight, Holman J dismissed her application.   Because at the time of her application there was a maintenance assessment in place which fell far short of a maximum assessment, the jurisdiction of the court to &#8220;top up&#8221; that order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/8/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8(6)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1991 Act</ref> was not engaged.   For so long as the asserted jurisdiction of the CMS remained in force, it was not open to the mother to seek a full restoration of the 2007 order through the jurisdictional gateway of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/8/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 8(6)</ref>.  The court could not interfere with the manner or approach in which the CMS had made its assessment of the father&#8217;s income (that approach having been mandated by regulations).  Although it was open to the mother to appeal the maintenance calculation via the First-tier Tribunal, the court could not assist her.</span></p>

Having made that assumption (quite properly in my view), the judge was entitled to fold it into his overall consideration of what the wife needed in terms of an income to sustain her own and the children&#8217;s domestic economy in the new home they would purchase when the former matrimonial home was sold.  He assessed that figure against the background of what she had coming into the household in the form of benefits and tax credits.

That agreement was recorded in a separation agreement made independently of any court proceedings.  When the husband was subsequently made redundant, he applied within divorce proceedings for property adjustment and lump sum orders.  The district judge at first instance ordered that he should retain a 35% interest in the former matrimonial home which had been transferred into the sole name of the wife following the separation agreement.  By the time of the appeal there was no child support assessment in force although it appears that one was imminent in respect of the youngest child of the family.  Thorpe J (as he then was) allowed the wife&#8217;s appeal holding that it would have been manifestly unfair to sanction a situation where such an assessment might result in the husband being deprived of part of the benefit for which he originally contracted (i.e. the indemnity in respect of child maintenance) when he parted with his share of the equity in the property.   In terms of outcome, the husband&#8217;s charge on the property was set aside on the basis that his claim for a property adjustment order was adjourned for the single purpose of providing him with an indemnity if, but only if, the Child Support Agency extracted from him substantive periodical payments in respect of the child.</span></p>

Indeed, it recognises that right and the supremacy of a child support maintenance assessment.  However, it goes on to do what the child support scheme does not cover.  It adjusts the absent parent&#8217;s overall financial obligations in the light of the child support maintenance assessment.  This is a power that is left to the courts.  The court order anticipates that a child support maintenance assessment may be made and makes provision to avoid the need for the parties to return to court in order to vary the order for spousal maintenance.  This is achieved by tying the payments of maintenance to the parent with care to the absent parent&#8217;s liability in respect of their children, so that if the latter increased the former reduced.

The judge had jurisdiction to make the order set out in paragraph 20 in relation not only to the wife and T but also in relation to S and C insofar as payments to the wife conferred a financial benefit on each of them.  The judge&#8217;s failure to apportion the order is not reason to set it aside because of  the assumption he plainly made that the husband&#8217;s income crossed the threshold for a maximum assessment both at the time of the final hearing and in all likelihood into the future.  He declared on more than one occasion that he did not have jurisdiction to make an order which was exclusively for the benefit of one or more of the children.  That was not an order which he made or one which he intended to make.  The door was left open for a CMS assessment which is precisely what has happened in this case.</span></p>

Both parties had agreed that the children would transfer from the private sector to state education for their secondary education.  S had already secured a place at a local grammar school and the expectation was that his siblings would follow him.

This finding was made after a careful survey of the evidence which both parties submitted at the final hearing.  The judge spent some time considering the property particulars which were put before the court and he heard oral evidence from the parties about their future housing needs.  Those property particulars showed a range of houses costing between &#163;900,000 and &#163;1.2 million.  Mr Chandler submits that the judge should have found that the wife could rehouse herself in suitable accommodation at the lower end of the spectrum for &#163;900,000.  With costs, this would have allowed a modest departure from equality in her favour instead of the more pronounced disparity produced by the judge&#8217;s order.  Had he taken this course, submits Mr Chandler, it would have eliminated the need for the husband to take on any mortgage at all and he could have discharged the outstanding term&#8217;s school fees of c. &#163;12,000 from capital.</span></p>

At the final hearing, she was seeking a pension sharing order to remove the disparity in the parties&#8217; pension positions (the husband&#8217;s funds being worth some &#163;282,800 more than the wife&#8217;s funds).  The judge declined to make any adjustment to pensions with the result that his order reflected a 53% : 47% division of the non-pension assets in the wife&#8217;s favour.  He took that course because he assessed her housing need at c.&#163;1 million plus costs.  He found that it would be difficult for the wife to make provision from any future earnings for her retirement and one of the reasons which justified a small departure from equality in respect of the non-pension assets was explained by him as a &#8216;step down&#8217; in housing in due course.  By building in an assumption as to her ability to downsize, the judge provided a mechanism for the release on retirement of some further equity which the wife would need when she was no longer generating any earned income (paragraph 150).  It was his solution to the pensions imbalance and an order which catered for her future as well as her present income needs.</span></p>

His submissions were made in the context of the wider point about the impact of an unequal division of capital in terms of his client&#8217;s own housing needs.

For the foreseeable future, she has no independent income.  She is, and will be, entirely dependent upon the support provided by the husband and state benefits.  As matters currently stand, everything which she owns is tied up in her present home.  There is no prospect of further slack in relation to her income unless and until she is able to find work.  The judge found that this measure of independence will not be available to her until January 2020.  Whilst I accept that the husband&#8217;s income resources will also be under pressure whilst he re-establishes a client base in London, his &#8216;financial shoulders&#8217; are nevertheless broader than the wife&#8217;s in this context.  He does have limited ability to borrow in the event of emergency and co-owns a Ferrari motor car with his father.  That vehicle, as I understand it, is stored securely and appears to be treated more as an investment than as a means of transport.  Even without recourse to that potential asset in an emergency, I am satisfied, as was the judge, that it was not unfair to leave the wife with the small measure of financial &#8216;head room&#8217;.</span></p>

Apart from depriving her of further equity to provide for her retirement as the judge had intended by his order, such a charge would cause her significant hardship and prejudice.  She develops her submissions in this way.</span></p>

In contrast, as the husband approaches retirement he can look to the return of the capital he has invested in his partnership (over half of which was matrimonial property); he has a valuable final salary scheme from a previous period of employment with a city law firm; and he will have had between twelve and sixteen years of generating what is likely to be a substantial income with diminishing financial responsibilities for the family.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">In my judgment these are sound reasons for rejecting the solution of a <span style="font-style:italic">Mesher</span> order at this stage.  It is not without significance that the husband&#8217;s appeal is being dealt with more than 12 months after the conclusion of the final hearing.  The wife has reorganised her domestic and family living arrangements relying on the decisions which the judge made.  She has invested her share of the capital she was awarded in a home to which she has had to make a number of repairs or improvements.  She has made this investment in the knowledge and belief that, unlike their former matrimonial home, this was to be <span style="font-style:italic">her </span>home and the husband would have no interest in it now or in the future.  When seen in the light of the judge&#8217;s treatment of the pension funds, and notwithstanding the current illiquidity of the pension assets, the small uplift of capital in the wife&#8217;s favour appears to be wholly reasonable, entirely justified on a needs footing, and well within the band of outcomes which the judge could have settled upon in the exercise of the wide discretion which was entrusted to him pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1973 Act</ref>.   He was entitled to find that the wife&#8217;s housing needs went beyond buying the cheapest available property which met the minimum requirements for bedrooms and the like.  He was entitled, having heard her oral evidence, to factor in the importance to these children of having a garden.  It was essentially a value judgment and not one with which this court is entitled to interfere unless his decision can be shown to be &#8216;wrong&#8217;.   In my judgment, the husband has failed to persuade me that the judge&#8217;s approach can be described thus.  Indeed, in all but the form of the order, I consider the judge&#8217;s approach to be unimpeachable.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Having reached these conclusions in respect of all three grounds of appeal, I formally dismiss the husband&#8217;s appeal.  The consequence for the parties is that the order made by His Honour Judge Everall QC remains in full force and effect.  I know not whether the husband is now making payments via the CMS on the basis of a pro rata reduction in the sums he is paying to the wife.  The parties may think it appropriate to recognise the new status quo by submitting a fresh consent order to the Central Family Court reflecting a variation to paragraph 20 of the original order.  There is no requirement on them to do so but it may focus minds for the future in the event of an application by either party to vary the spousal element of the periodical payments order and/or in the event of an application by the wife to extend the term of the order beyond October 2026.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">By way of postscript, I note that on the day I have completed my judgment, the President of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, has issued formal Guidance by way of an update to his 2013 update.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Guidance: Standard Financial and Enforcement Orders</span>, 30 November 2017, the President remains convinced that the arguments in favour of standardising financial order are &#8220;clear and compelling&#8221;.  He points to the assistance which judges will derive from the existence of &#8220;a body of standardised and judicially approved forms of order&#8221;.  I see that included within the new omnibus of orders as example 79 is a precedent for a Global order framed in very similar terms to the order which has been the subject of this appeal.  I have already rejected the jurisdictional challenge to such orders for the reasons set out in my judgment.  It is worth repeating at its conclusion the very important guidance from the President in these terms:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;These orders do not have the strict status of forms within Part 5 of the FPR 2010 and their use, although strongly to be encouraged, is not mandatory.  Moreover, a standard order may be varied by the court or a party if the variation is required by the circumstances of a particular case.  There will be many circumstances when a variation is required and departure from the standard form will not, of course, prevent an order being valid and binding.  The standard orders should however represent the starting point and, I would hope and expect, usually the finishing point, of the drafting exercise.&#8221;</p>
