If he had done so I would nonetheless <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>have directed a hearing.

He is seeking an order, albeit in declaratory form, to prevent HMRC exercising its powers &#8220;without permission from the Court of Protection.&#8221; The appropriate remedy, if one is needed, is by application to the criminal court, in a case such as this, or to the Administrative Court. I make clear that I am <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>to be understood as suggesting that, in the circumstances, any application the son might make to either court stands the slightest prospect of success; my view, for what it is worth, is that it would not.</p>

The son has placed before the court a number of witness statements prepared for the purpose of the criminal proceedings by officers of HMRC. He has not sought to challenge any of the facts asserted by those officers &#8211; indeed, he seeks to rely upon parts of their witness statements. And since, as I have said, he was not present, he is in any event hardly in a position to gainsay what they assert. The simple fact is that there is nothing in any of this material which even begins to suggest that what the son is asserting is even arguably right. On the contrary, what the material demonstrates is the seeming propriety with which HMRC obtained and executed the search warrants, the very proper concern which the HMRC officers involved had for the potential impact on SW of what was going on around her while the relevant search warrant was being executed, and the very proper steps which they appropriately took to protect and safeguard her welfare.  </p>

His application under Rule 89 is equally devoid of merit. It must be dismissed, with the consequence that the District Judge&#8217;s order striking out the original application remains in place.</p>
