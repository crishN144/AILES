I declined to grant an anti-suit injunction sought by the mother which would have prevented the father continuing litigation in India concerning the child because I concluded that the Indian courts should themselves consider my judgment, and the reasons for my decision, so that the Indian courts could consider whether they also agreed that the child&#8217;s future was properly to be determined by this court. The child had been made a Ward of the English High Court on 25 October 2018.   </p>

DHCJ Gupta QC had heard oral evidence from the parties about the circumstances in which the child came to be in in India. He concluded that the father had intentionally deprived the mother and child of their passports, had intentionally stranded the child in India, and that these were premeditated acts which followed on from similar behaviour a year earlier. Those findings amount to findings of domestic abuse within the meaning of Family Procedure Rules 2010 Practice Direction 12J amounting to transnational marriage abandonment, controlling behaviour, and emotional abuse.  </p>

I adjourned the applications until 16 April 2019 for the mother to provide further evidence about the arrangements for a return in particular what therapy might be available to the child on an interim return.

Unfortunately, the father dialled into the hearing after it had been completed and so he was unable to participate. I directed that he should attend the next hearing in person but he has communicated with the court saying that he could not attend and so he has participated by telephone link. The hearing today was listed because it was anticipated that there would be a final hearing of the petition in the High Court in India on 3 June. That would have dealt with the injunction. Unfortunately, that hearing had to be adjourned and was re-listed for the 10 June. I was told this morning that the hearing has been further adjourned until the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"/>June. The mother tells me that she intends to travel to India from the 19 June to 17 July 2019 and she hopes that her attendance will progress the 5 cases that are currently extant in India.  </p>

That would enable her to have the child assessed by the NHS and/or Private teams and to start implementing any recommendations, would allow her to make applications to enter the child in nursery or primary school, and would allow the local authority to assess what resource best met the child&#8217;s needs and would allow the Guardian to meet the child with the mother and with the father and to make recommendations as to the child&#8217;s medium to long-term future. She has made considerable efforts to obtain information to evidence the arrangements that she could put in place and which she says would meet the child&#8217;s welfare needs. She has filed a statement in support of that position accompanied by numerous exhibits which support the arrangements she has put in place. She filed a position statement in support of her application for today&#8217;s hearing. In that position statement she also exhibited confirmation from her parents that they will travel to England to accompany the child and to assist in the care of the child and to support the mother. The letter is not entirely clear how long they will stay but the indication in respect of the maternal grandmother was that it would be not less than 6 months. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The father has renewed his application for a stay and invites me to stay these proceedings pending substantive decision-making in the Indian courts. Alternatively (albeit in reality it is an application for a stay in a different guise) he invites me to adjourn this hearing for 3 to 4 months for the same purpose. If unsuccessful, he opposes the return of the child to this jurisdiction. He has not put forward an alternative welfare proposal; his position is that the Indian court should determine such matters. The father filed a statement in response to the mother&#8217;s evidence. He takes issue with the provenance of one of the documents that the mother relies on from the dietician in India. He also challenges the timescales for assessment and implementation of treatment were the child to be returned to England and the availability of Private health provision. He questions the mother&#8217;s commitment to the child&#8217;s welfare accusing her of having abused the child in the past, having failed to travel to India to see him since June of last year, despite having a Visa that would have enabled her to do so, and having failed to make appropriate arrangements for his entry into playgroups, for his OCI documents and others. He suggests that she terminated his treatment at the AIISH without consulting him and is perhaps using him as a tool for personal gain. He also filed a position statement for this hearing. In that he emphasises that in his view it would take between 1 and 2 years for the child to be assessed by the NHS given the pressure on resources in the UK and his previous experience of the NHS. He also accuses the maternal grandparents of abusing the child and that in India the child welfare committee said he should have custody of the child. Given it was intended that the child should return to live in India by the time he was 5, he says they should not now be a return to India. In particular he relies on the assertion that the child communicates only in Tamil and that were he to be treated in English this would be detrimental. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The Guardian has filed a very careful and comprehensive interim report. She emphasises that given that K remains in India that her enquiries have been limited but she has clearly dedicated considerable time and effort to speaking to the parents, considering the documents and carefully evaluating this child&#8217;s welfare. Her report was supplemented by a position statement prepared by Mr Osborne on her behalf. Her finely balanced conclusion was that it would be in the child&#8217;s welfare interests to return with the maternal grandparents to this jurisdiction to resume living with the mother and to embark upon the process of assessing his needs either through the NHS or through private health facilities. The Guardian emphasised the importance of the continuity of the care being given by the maternal grandmother in particular. She noted that for a child, who may have an autistic spectrum disorder and delayed speech and language, that the therapy that has been provided by the AIISH and more recently by the S team has been implemented in practice by the maternal grandmother, who described the child as requiring 24/7 care. She considered that for any child of 3 to 4 years of age that the attachments made in the last year would be of great significance to the child. She thought tentatively that this may be even more important for a child with the conditions that are involved here. However, she also considered it very important that if possible and safe he should be cared for by his parents. He is not cared for by his father in India and there is limited contact.  He could be cared for by his mother in England supported by the maternal grandmother (and perhaps maternal grandfather). On balance the Guardian thought that the child&#8217;s welfare would best be promoted by a summary return to England to be cared for by his mother and grandparents at the mother&#8217;s home. The process of assessment could then be undertaken over a period of about 6 months and the Guardian would then be in a position to advise this court as to the child&#8217;s medium to long term welfare interests. She retains an open mind at this stage about whether that future lies in England or in India. During any such period of return she would expect the father to return to England for some part of that time in order to enable her to assess his relationship with the child. As an aside I note that of course if he were to do so I could consider what time he should spend with his son and take steps to implement that. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The father casts doubt in particular on the availability of health care from the NHS. In particular he says that experience shows that securing treatment for the child will be a minimum of 10 months and up to 2 years. He refers to the delay that the family experienced in 2018 and their travel to India to plug that gap. However, I note that although the family travelled to India in February 2018, the child had a paediatric appointment on 21 May 2018 and so well within the 18 weeks which the health visitor advises. In his submissions the father suggested that it could in fact take up to 3 years and referred to information available on social media sites and the BBC along these lines. He says that the private health insurance the mother has does not cover existing conditions and thus it is unlikely that it will assist in the costs of the child&#8217;s treatment. In comparison in India, &#163;5 pays for thrice weekly therapy for one month. The father doubts the provenance of the support letter that the mother has produced from the dietician which says that advice can continue to be given remotely. He identifies the absence of a date and the difference in the letterhead between that produced by the mother and a previous letterhead of January 2019. He says he has spoken with the dietician and that she has not issued any document for court purposes. He says that currently the child is only communicated with in Tamil and that the use of English would worsen his condition. He also expands upon his doubts about the mother&#8217;s commitment to the child pointing out that she has been able to return to India at any stage and has not done so and in particular since she had a Visa in March she could have travelled to India to see her son. He poses the rhetorical question &#8216;is there an emotional connect towards the child?&#8217; He also criticises the fact that he has not been consulted over the child&#8217;s discharge from the AIISH and refers to the allegations of abuse against the mother. He referred me to a statement which was filed in the earlier proceedings which purports to be from a friend of the mother&#8217;s which says that she has hit and shouted at the child. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">The Guardian&#8217;s analysis of the case is as I have already said a measured and careful assessment of this child&#8217;s welfare. She records her conversations with each of the parents and her evaluation of the evidence that has been compiled by the mother and the father. In submissions Mr Osborne emphasised that the Guardian gave credit to the mother for the extensive efforts that she has obviously undertaken in order to put together the evidence of the arrangements; in particular noting that she has persisted even though it has been difficult given the child&#8217;s absence from this jurisdiction. She considered that to be a positive marker of the mother&#8217;s commitment to the child. She also observed that the conclusions reached by DHCJ Gupta QC amounted to abusive behaviour on the part of the father. She noted that although the father now makes allegations of abuse against the mother and the grandparents, the father himself left the child in the care of the mother when he returned to England in 2018 and that the Madras High Court stayed the S welfare committee&#8217;s direction that custody be given to the father. She inferred from both of these events that the concerns about abusive behaviour by the mother and grandparents might be less concerning. Although she was cautious because she did not have all the evidence that she would ideally like to see in a case such as this she did reach a clear &#8216;on balance&#8217; conclusion that the child welfare would best be promoted by his summary return to this jurisdiction and to the care of his mother provided that the maternal grandmother in particular was able to accompany him. She considered that the continuity of care was particularly important given the attachment that the child will have developed to his maternal grandmother and the very important role that the maternal grandmother has in implementing the intensive home training. She identified a number of tasks that the mother would need to undertake in order to support the child&#8217;s welfare in the event of his return and thought that an interim return of 6 months would be required to allow the process of assessment to be completed by the health professionals and to allow her to undertake a full welfare assessment. </p>

In this case this vulnerable child has not been cared for by either of his parents over the last year as a result of the situation that the father created. His mother was forced to return to this country without him. His father has left this country to return to India but has not become his primary carer. The multiplicity of proceedings that the father has commenced in the Indian courts do not appear to me to be likely to promote an early resolution of his claim for custody of the child in India. As a result, this child has been cared for by his maternal grandparents over the last 11 months and has had almost no direct physical relationship with either his mother or father. His mother has maintained their relationship to a degree by Skype or FaceTime contact. His father has had limited contact it seems through the child welfare committee processes. For any child this would be a significant loss. Prior to July 2018 the mother was the child&#8217;s primary carer from birth until he was nearly 3. He lived with his father also albeit it is reasonably clear that the father worked and the mother undertook more of the childcare. Hence when the father left India in 2018 he left the child in the care of the mother and her parents. For any child the resumption of the provision of care by their parent would be a priority. It seems to me that for a child with the vulnerabilities that it appears this child has the resumption of care by his parents, but particularly by his mother his previous primary carer, is critical. </p>

If payment were required for the Indian dietician to advise by phone or over the internet I see no reason why that would not be possible.

That task has fallen upon the maternal grandmother and will continue to be implemented by her, albeit the mother will also be able to directly support this. I am also impressed by the mother&#8217;s commitment to seeking support and maintaining pressure in order to obtain relevant information. I&#8217;m satisfied that between her and the maternal grandparents, they will do their utmost to ensure that any delay is minimised and that they will seek Private therapeutic support to supplement what they do at home. Thus the effect of moving out of the therapeutic work of the S professionals will be reduced to a minimum. The fact that they have only just begun to do their work and that the AIISH felt it was appropriate to discharge the child satisfy me that the effect of a change of this sort can be managed. </p>

Although I have read the statement of the mother&#8217;s friend, it has not been tested in evidence and that sort of behaviour seems both inconsistent with the mother&#8217;s apparent dedication to her son but also with the father&#8217;s own behaviour in leaving his son in her care. </p>

There is nothing that emerges from the AIISH or the Guardian that supports the contention that this child is at risk from his grandparents. That they made the 18-hour round trip to the AIISH 24 times seems a testament to their commitment to this little boy and the Guardian&#8217;s conversation with the maternal grandmother would appear to support this. </p>

However there seems to be a significant flaw in his capability, namely the emotional risk that he exposes his son to as a result of his attitude to the mother. That was most plainly evidenced by his stranding her and his son in India last year but continues to be evident in his extensive criticisms of her. This would create a significant risk of emotional harm to his son were he exposed to the sorts of criticism that the father makes of the mother. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">I have reached the clear conclusion that an order for this child&#8217;s interim return to this jurisdiction should be made. I do not consider that these proceedings should be stayed or adjourned any longer. I concluded in February that a stay was not appropriate and I see no reason to alter that decision. The progress in the Indian proceedings that had been anticipated has not come to pass in any event. I suspect that the multiplicity of proceedings must be contributing to this.  I&#8217;m not sure to what extent any other litigation strategising is also contributing to the delay in the Indian court progressing matters. It would seem to be in the mother&#8217;s interests to make rapid progress in the Indian proceedings whereas it would be in the father&#8217;s interests to delay. I have no doubt that my brother and sister judges in India will be doing their utmost to progress matters but ultimately the approach that the parties&#8217; have taken is bound to have an impact on the progress that the judges can make. I do not consider that there is any benefit at all to adjourning these proceedings still less staying them. If anything that seems more likely to promote further delay within the Indian proceedings. I hope that by this court reaching an interim welfare decision that it will assist my brother and sister judges in India in progressing decision-making in their courts. </p>

Most importantly I consider that the arrangements in relation to K&#8217;s health needs can be managed and that any loss in that regard will be more than offset by being reunited with his mother. Counterintuitively were his father to return to England (and I see no reason why he shouldn&#8217;t at least for short periods of time) it may be more possible for arrangements to be made for him to spend time with his son than has proved possible in India. </p>

I very much hope that they will agree with the conclusions that I have reached having regard to the evidence that has been before me, and that this method will best promote this little boy&#8217;s welfare in the interim. The medium to long term future requires further assessment following his return.</p>
