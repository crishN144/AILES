The Judicial Committee overturned the decision of the Court of Appeal, and in the judgment of Baroness Hale of Richmond DBE, with whom the other members of the committee agreed, there are a number of observations made about the nature of the tests propounded by Munby J. (as he then was) in particular when he was considering, under the inherent jurisdiction, cases of capacity to consent to sexual relations and capacity to marry (see below).  As a result of the observations made by Baroness Hale (see below) DCC and the Official Solicitor very properly sought some clarification from me as to what impact, if any, the decision in R v C has had in relation to the law relating to capacity in civil proceedings, and thus, in the event that the law had changed to some degree, whether those changes should lead to a re-consideration, or variation, or discharge of one or both of the declarations I made in January 2009 on the subject of the last two capacities identified in paragraph 3 above. </span></p>

Having read the documents, and considered the law as I now find it to be, I agree with their conclusions on this subject and thus make no order, for the application of the relevant legal test in both instances leads to no different conclusion now as to the two capacities under consideration in the case of LS. </span></p>

In my judgment, the same goes, and for much the same reasons, in relation to capacity to consent to sexual relations. The question is issue specific, both in the general sense and, as I have already pointed out, in the sense that capacity has to be assessed in relation to the particular kind of sexual activity in question. But capacity to consent to sexual relations is, in my judgment, a question directed to the nature of the activity rather than to the identity of the sexual partner. </span></p>

It is difficult to see how it can sensibly be said that she has capacity to consent to a particular sexual act with Y whilst at the same time lacking capacity to consent to precisely the same sexual act with Z.

Mr Sachdeva correctly pointed out that there is no necessary requirement that the civil (family) law and criminal law should adopt the same test for capacity to consent to sexual relations, though plainly the civil law's test of consent cannot derogate from the protections afforded to the vulnerable by the criminal law. So it is at least possible to contemplate the civil law imposing a different and more demanding test of capacity. But, as Mr Sachdeva says, it adds clarity if the civil law and the criminal law do share the same test.&#8221; </span></p>

In this context both the criminal law and the civil law serve the same important function: to protect the vulnerable from abuse and exploitation (see further below). Viewed from this perspective, X either has capacity to consent to sexual intercourse or she does not. It cannot depend upon the forensic context in which the question arises, for otherwise, it might be thought, the law would be brought into disrepute.&#8221; [Emphasis supplied]. </span></p>

The Court of Appeal acknowledged that this was a difficult area and they were, in my view, unduly influenced by the views of Munby J in another context. I am far from persuaded that those views were correct, because the case law on capacity has for some time recognised that, to be able to make a decision, the person concerned must not only be able to understand the information relevant to making it but also be able to &#8220;weigh [that information] in the balance to arrive at [a] choice": see Re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 1 WLR 290" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 1 WLR 290</ref>, 295, approved in Re MB (Medical Treatment) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 2 FLR 426" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 2 FLR 426</ref>. In Re C, the patient&#8217;s persecutory delusions might have prevented him from weighing the information relevant to having his leg amputated because of gangrene, which he was perfectly capable of understanding, but they did not. But in NHS Trust v T (adult patient: refusal of medical treatment) <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/1279" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 1279 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 1279 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 All ER 387" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 All ER 387</ref>, the patient had a history of self harming leading to dangerously low haemoglobin levels. She knew that if she refused a blood transfusion she might die; nevertheless she believed that her blood was evil and that the healthy blood given her in a transfusion became contaminated and thus increased the volume of evil blood in her body and &#8220;likewise the danger of my committing acts of evil". Charles J concluded that she was unable to use and weigh the relevant information, and thus the competing factors, in the process of arriving at her decision to refuse a transfusion (para 63). In the same way, a person&#8217;s delusions that she was being commanded by God to have sexual intercourse, an act which she was perfectly capable of understanding, might make her incapable of exercising an autonomous choice in the matter. </span></p>

Provided that the inability to refuse is &#8220;because of or for a reason related to a mental disorder&#8221; (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/30/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 30(1)</ref>(c)), and the other ingredients of the offence are made out, the perpetrator is guilty. The words &#8220;for any other reason&#8221; are clearly capable of encompassing a wide range of circumstances in which a person&#8217;s mental disorder may rob them of the ability to make an autonomous choice, even though they may have sufficient understanding of the information relevant to making it. These could include the kind of compulsion which drives a person with anorexia to refuse food, the delusions which drive a person with schizophrenia to believe that she must do something, or the phobia (or irrational fear) which drives a person to refuse a life-saving injection (as in Re MB) or a blood transfusion (as in NHS Trust v T). </span></p>

It is, perhaps, easier to understand how the test of capacity might be &#8220;act specific&#8221; but not &#8220;person specific&#8221; or &#8220;situation specific&#8221; if intellectual understanding were all that was required. The complainant here did know what a &#8220;blow job&#8221; was. Even then, it is well accepted that capacity can fluctuate, so that a person may have the required degree of understanding one day but not another. But that is because of a fluctuation in the mental disorder rather than a fluctuation in the circumstances. Once it is accepted that choice is an exercise of free will, and that mental disorder may rob a person of free will in a number of different ways and in a number of different situations, then a mentally disordered person may be quite capable of exercising choice in one situation but not in another. The complainant here, even in her agitated and aroused state, might have been quite capable of deciding whether or not to have sexual intercourse with a person who had not put her in the vulnerable and terrifying situation in which she found herself on 27 June 2007. The question is whether, in the state that she was in that day, she was capable of choosing whether to agree to the touching demanded of her by the defendant. </span></p>

One does not consent to sex in general. One consents to this act of sex with this person at this time and in this place. Autonomy entails the freedom and the capacity to make a choice of whether or not to do so. This is entirely consistent with the respect for autonomy in matters of private life which is guaranteed by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The object of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2003 Act</ref> was to get away from the previous &#8220;status&#8221; based approach which assumed that all &#8220;defectives&#8221; lacked capacity, and thus denied them the possibility of making autonomous choices, while failing to protect those whose mental disorder deprived them of autonomy in other ways. </span></p>

Mr Richard Wormald, for the defendant, has not seriously tried to uphold their reasoning on the questions which we have been asked. He accepts that an irrational fear plainly is capable of depriving a person of capacity. The question is whether it does. He has, understandably, pointed to all the features in the evidence which suggest that the complainant was indeed exercising a choice, a choice reluctantly to go along with what was being asked of her because of her fear of the consequences if she did not. But if the judge&#8217;s direction on lack of capacity is upheld, as I consider it should be, it is difficult to suggest that the jury were not entitled to reach the verdict they did on the evidence they heard.&#8221; </span></p>

In January 2009 I had a number of reports, going back over several months, from two doctors (Dr. Halstead and Dr. Milne). The necessary material was set out in the January 2009 judgment in paragraphs 67 to 84 (capacity to consent to sexual relations) and paragraphs 91 to 95 (capacity to consent to marriage).  I am told that the psychiatric state of LS has not observably altered since January 2009, save for the overall improvement in her wellbeing noted above.

In reality, both were simply highlighting that at the time they examined her (in the case of Dr. Halstead on the second occasion) they were satisfied that she did indeed have capacity to consent to sexual relations (and to marriage - see below).  Their worry was whether or not that capacity would diminish if removed from the nurturing environment of LN.  That of course is a quite different point.</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:11pt"> It may well be that her capacity changes according to the prevailing circumstances of her physical care and any personal relationships she forms or has already formed. </span><span style="font-size:11pt">Overall, however, Dr. Milne was clear that [in the context of her learning disability] it is unlikely that her basic knowledge of the essential information required to form capacitous decisions on sexual intercourse and marriage was likely to change unless she becomes subject to some further mental illness. Whilst those with learning disabilities of her type are more prone to other mental illnesses, there is no indication in her case happily, that there is anything currently requiring consideration.   </span></p>

What is necessary is that the particular sexual partner (to continue this illustration) impedes or undermines or has the effect of impeding or undermining the mental functioning of a person when that person makes their decisions, so as to render them incapacitous.  See, for example, the plight of the victim in R v C. </span></p>

Another person&#8217;s view of the suitability of a particular sexual partner for the person whose capacity is being considered is irrelevant to the determination of whether or not that person has capacity.  To take account of such a feature in determining capacity would be risking the importation of &#8220;best interests,&#8221; and runs directly counter to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1 (4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref> [&#8220;a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision&#8221;].  Furthermore, as Baroness Hale pointed out in R v C, to apply such a consideration to the determination of capacity would be, as Miss Greaney also observed in her submissions to me, a gross failure to respect a person&#8217;s autonomy, protected by Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 in relation to one of the most intimate and personal aspects of their private life. </span></p>

Overall, however, Dr. Milne was clear that [in the context of her learning disability] it is unlikely that her basic knowledge of the essential information required to form capacitous decisions on sexual intercourse and marriage was likely to change unless she becomes subject to some further mental illness.  Whilst those with learning disabilities of her type are more prone to other mental illnesses, there is no indication in her case happily, that there is anything currently requiring consideration.&#8221; </span></p>
