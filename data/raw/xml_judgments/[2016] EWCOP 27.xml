	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This case concerns an individual SRK who was severely injured in a road traffic accident.  The effects of those injuries are that (a) he lacks capacity to make decisions on the regime of care, treatment and support that he should receive (SRK&#8217;s care regime), and (b) applying the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Cheshire West </span>(see <span style="font-style:italic">Surrey County Council v P and others; Cheshire West and Chester Council v P and another </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2014/19" uk:canonical="[2014] UKSC 19" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] UKSC 19</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] AC 896" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] AC 896</ref>), SRK&#8217;s care regime creates, on an objective assessment, a deprivation of liberty.  SRK was awarded substantial damages that were paid to his property and affairs deputy (the third Respondent IMTC).  He lives at a property that has been bought and adapted for him. His regime of care and support there is provided by private sector providers.  The damages funded that purchase and adaptation and fund that regime of care.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue is whether this situation on the ground is a deprivation of liberty that has to be authorised by the Court of Protection (the COP) by it making a welfare order.  The test that the COP would apply in making such an order is whether SRK&#8217;s care regime is the least restrictive available option to best promote his best interests.  The same test applies to the decision makers on the ground.  It is common ground that at present SRK&#8217;s care regime satisfies that test.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">If the COP makes such a welfare order it will include provisions concerning when and how it is to be reviewed.  It is likely that SRK&#8217;s regime of care and support will always create an objective deprivation of liberty and that he will never have capacity to make decisions about it.  However, from time to time issue are likely to arise on what changes should be made to that regime to ensure that it remains the least restrictive available option.</p>

This is because the court that awards the damages, the COP when appointing a property and affairs deputy and the deputy or the trustees or attorney or other person to whom the damages are paid should take steps to ensure (a) that the relevant local authority with duties to safeguard adults knows of the regime of care, and (b) that if, as here, the least restrictive available care regime to best promote P&#8217;s best interests creates a situation on the ground that satisfies the objective and subjective components of a deprivation of liberty (and so a derivation of liberty within Article 5) a welfare order based on that regime of care is made by the COP.</p>

In doing so, it recalled that the question whether a deprivation of liberty is imputable to the State relates to the interpretation and application of Article 5(1) and that it raises issues that go to the merits of the case, which cannot be regarded merely as preliminary issues.

There is no requirement to fix the exact purpose of admission (for example, for assessment or for treatment) and, consistently, no limits in terms of time, treatment or care attach to that admission. Nor is there any specific provision requiring a continuing clinical assessment of the persistence of a disorder warranting detention. The appointment of a representative of a patient who could make certain objections and applications on his or her behalf is a procedural protection accorded to those committed involuntarily under the 1983 Act and which would be of equal importance for patients who are legally incapacitated and have, as in the present case, extremely limited communication abilities.</span></p>

While the Court does not question the good faith of those professionals or that they acted in what they considered to be the applicant&#8217;s best interests, the very purpose of procedural safeguards is to protect individuals against any &#8220;misjudgments and professional lapses&#8221; (Lord Steyn, paragraph 49 above).</span></p>

On the other hand, it has also noted the Government&#8217;s understandable concern (outlined in paragraph 80 above) to avoid the full, formal and inflexible impact of the 1983 Act.

It seems to me that in most cases this possibility would not help much because all it would do is add a person on the ground with obligations to monitor and review the (private) deprivation of liberty.

When s.5 applies it has the consequences that the providers of care and support, and those who apply P&#8217;s money to pay for it, incur no liability for their decisions and acts if they would not have done so if P had had the relevant capacity and had consented to those decisions and acts.  This is a core part of the MCA aimed at promoting decisions on the ground in connection with care and treatment of persons who lack capacity and it effectively results in such decisions being treated as ones that a person with capacity had consented to.

It is not easy to give an accurate estimate of the number of such cases. IMTC acts as a property and affairs deputy in a number of cases (approximately 9% of the professional deputyships across the country). It estimates that it has 25 cases in the same class as SRK&#8217;s and thus cases in which P lives in their own home with a 24-hour care regime entirely funded privately with no ostensible state involvement in the arrangements.  If this represents 9% of that class it would mean that there would be between 250 and 300 similar cases across the country.  But this does not include cases managed by either a lay deputy (about 47% of the total number of deputy cases currently supervised by the Office of the Public Guardian) or trustees or an attorney. I do not know how often lay deputies are appointed by the COP in cases when the damages awarded to P are substantial or how many of those awards are paid to trustees or attorneys.</p>

The statement also set out information relating to SRK&#8217;s capital and income which includes some state benefits and exhibited a proposed budget from December 2012 which includes payments for his support workers and treatment and identifies the balance to be met from capital deducting his monthly income of about &#163;21,000.

Although not advanced in this way this argument equates to one that is based on the need to determine whether a failure to obtain or grant a welfare order results in a situation in which the purpose and spirit of Article 5 has not been fulfilled because the relevant person has not been protected from arbitrary detention.</p>

In this case, the competent health authority also had supervisory powers to control the execution of these court orders. However, in the applicant's case, the clinic, despite the lack of the applicant's consent, had not obtained the necessary court order. Therefore, no public health officer had ever assessed whether the applicant &#8211; what was more than doubtful &#8211; posed a serious threat to public safety or order within the meaning of Article&#160;2 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Land</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> Bremen on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts.</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt"> Consequently, the State also did not exercise any supervisory control over the lawfulness of the applicant's detention in the clinic for some 20&#160;months.</span></p>

Moreover, a victim could, under German civil law, claim compensation in tort for damage caused by an unlawful detention. However, the Court, having regard to the importance of the right to liberty, does not consider such retrospective measures alone as providing effective protection for individuals in such a vulnerable position as the applicant. It notes that particularly in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:10pt">Land</span><span style="font-size:10pt"> Bremen on the detention of mentally insane persons, mentally deficient persons and drug addicts, there were numerous &#8211; necessary &#8211; safeguards for persons detained in a mental institution following a court order. However, these safeguards did not apply in the more critical cases of persons confined to a psychiatric institution without such an order. It must be borne in mind that the applicant, once detained and treated with strong antipsychotic medicaments, had no longer been in a position to secure independent outside help.</span></p>

But it is not necessary for me to embark upon any more general analysis of the possible reach of Article 5, and it is in fact undesirable that I do so. That exercise raises issues which are not before me and which are properly to be explored as and when the occasion arises.
