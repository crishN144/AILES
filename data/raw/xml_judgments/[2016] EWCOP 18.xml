She did try to describe them and knew it was two males and a female but she was unable to provide any details. When I asked Yvonne how she would change her LPA if she wanted to, she mentioned a phone and told me they would have to come and see her again but could not elaborate any more. Yvonne did appear to change the subject if she did not know the answer.

My mother&#8217;s main business, the care home, is struggling due to lack of management.

		    <p class="BodyText2" style="margin-left:0.5in">&#8220;I understand the court seeks to revoke this LPA and instead appoint a deputy. I was not aware that one of the attorneys (Kevin) was willing to resign as attorney. If he did so, I also would willingly resign and the remaining attorney, Thomas, could deal with his mother&#8217;s affairs. The only issue would be complying with the guidance that two attorneys agree the sale of either property but this would be an issue with a sole deputy also. This hopefully would be a quicker, easier and cheaper resolution for the problems encountered with operating under the LPA as it currently stands. My concerns regarding appointing a deputy in Australia relate to the donor&#8217;s business interest in the care home, which the Care Quality Commission as the regulator have already expressed concerns over geographic location with respect to an attorney and their availability in France.  They are likely to find Australia unpalatable. This is a serious risk to the business which is the donor&#8217;s main investment.&#8221;</p>
