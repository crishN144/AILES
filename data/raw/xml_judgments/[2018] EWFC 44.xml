	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.29in">On 21 December 2017, I handed down a judgment in these proceedings on the application by the petitioner (hereafter referred to as &#8220;the wife&#8221;) for a financial remedies order in divorce proceedings against the respondent (hereafter referred to as &#8220;the husband&#8221;). On 26 February 2018, I made an order consequential to my judgment. I understand that the wife has now filed a notice of appeal against my judgment and order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.29in">The full background to the case is set out in my earlier judgment and need not be repeated. It is sufficient to say that the parties come from different foreign countries but have lived in England for many years; that they were married in 2008 and have one son who has significant health and developmental problems; that following the breakdown of their marriage in 2015 the wife petitioned for divorce, and that she pursued an application for financial remedies within those proceedings culminating in the judgment and order referred to above. Their story is therefore typical of countless other couples whose cases come before the family court. What makes their case unusual is that the husband is an extremely successful businessman. Although he is not himself a well-known public figure, his products are widely used by millions of people across the world. Representatives of the press have therefore appeared before me opposing the making of a reporting restrictions order. It is said on behalf of the press that it is in the public interest for them to be at liberty to report information about the proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.29in">The law relating to reporting restrictions and the publication of judgments in matrimonial financial remedy proceedings has been considered in a number of recent reported cases. It is well known that there is a divergence of views amongst judges of the Family Division about whether applications for financial remedy orders should be heard in open court (see the discussion in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">DL v SL (Financial Remedy Proceedings: Privacy)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2015/2621" uk:canonical="[2015] EWHC 2621 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] EWHC 2621 (Fam)</ref>). In their written submissions in support of their applications for a reporting restrictions order, counsel for the husband and wife have referred to a large number of reported authorities. In my judgment, however, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to embark upon a further lengthy analysis of the law in this judgment. The principles as generally accepted by judges and practitioners can be summarised as follows.</p>

The party receiving the confidential information is subject to an implied undertaking not to use it for any purpose other than within the proceedings in which the information has been disclosed. &#8220;Information disclosed under the compulsion of ancillary relief proceedings is &#8230; protected by the implied undertaking before, during and after the proceedings are completed&#8221; (per Butler-Sloss P in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Clibbery v Allen</span>, supra, para 72).</p>

A judgment considering a point of law or practice has generally been released to the specialist series of law reports. There have been many first instance judgments so reported in addition to appellate decisions selected by the reporters. Without this collaboration between the judiciary and the reports evolution of ancillary relief law and practice by the judges would hardly have been possible.&#8221;</p>

In the alternative, he proposes that the judgment be anonymised and significantly redacted, and that the court makes a reporting restrictions order preventing publication of any other information relating to the proceedings. The wife is said to be neutral on the question of whether the judgment should be withheld from publication altogether, but strongly supports the anonymisation and redaction of the judgment if published, and the making of a reporting restrictions order. The parties have reached a measure of agreement as to some of the details of the anonymisation and redaction, but there is a number of details about which they do not agree and invite me to resolve, in the event that I reject the husband&#8217;s principal argument that publication should be withheld altogether.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.29in">In her statement, the wife draws attention once again to the particular circumstances of the parties&#8217; son. He suffers from a rare genetic condition which increases the risk of developing various forms of cancer and in some cases leads to global developmental delay and autism. The wife states that details of his condition are not widely known amongst their friends. At his school, which the parents have carefully selected to meet his particular needs, enquiries from other mothers about his condition are answered by the wife with a very general response because she is concerned that other children may learn about it, and in particular, the possible effect on his life expectancy. She is understandably concerned that any discussion of this information may cause distress and harm to the boy and affect his relationships with his friends. She wishes to avoid any change in attitude towards her son in the minds of other parents or their children as a result of press coverage. Having carefully selected the school as a place where he can receive education and nurturing, she is worried that it would struggle to cope with intrusive press coverage and that his day-to-day life at school, from which he has benefited profoundly, would be put at risk. The wife is concerned about the possibility of direct press intrusion were the family to be identified as a result of publication of the judgment. She contends that such intrusion will be particularly harmful to their son, whom she described as being extremely outgoing and trusting and therefore very vulnerable to the approach of strangers. The wife&#8217;s protective attitude towards the parties&#8217; son has led her to adopt a very cautious approach to social media. She has taken steps to ensure that his name is not available online. Although the husband, who as stated in the earlier judgment has devoted considerable time and funds to setting up a foundation to promote research into their son&#8217;s condition, has alluded to his son when speaking about the foundation, he has only done so in general terms.</p>

The hearing and judgment dealt at length with the financial affairs of her own family, in particular those of her mother who gave evidence in the course of the hearing and was subject to detailed and challenging cross examination. The wife reminds me that her mother, whom she described as a very private person, gave evidence about her financial circumstances only reluctantly in order to support the wife&#8217;s case, and that the experience caused her considerable distress. Her evidence included information about the family&#8217;s financial affairs which are unknown to some members of the family. Furthermore, the family is well known in the country where the wife was raised. Publication of an unredacted version of the judgment would lead to unwelcome publicity for the family in that country.</p>

They also stress the point identified above that the article 8 rights to be taken into account when conducting the necessary balancing exercise include those of the child as well as his parents.

He relies on the fact that, as mentioned above, there is currently disagreement amongst judges of the Family Division about whether financial remedy hearings should be conducted in private or in public, and that the case is taking place in what he describes as the wake of a transparency drive. He rightly points out that the wages of the judge and court staff are met by the taxpayer. Consequently, there is a public interest in knowing what a High Court judge in the Family Division is doing. He makes the point, of which this Court is only too well aware, that judges are hard pressed and that hearing dates are hard to find. Mr Farmer suggests that people might say that a judge&#8217;s time would be better spent dealing with cases involving vulnerable children rather than matrimonial disputes between rich people.</p>

There is therefore a public interest in his financial affairs. Furthermore, Mr Farmer rightly points out that the husband&#8217;s business activities extend to many other countries and that both parties originate from countries outside the United Kingdom. As a result, the case has an international dimension which is likely to attract the attention of media organisations in other countries. Since any order restricting reporting in this country will not extend beyond the jurisdiction, Mr Farmer submits that it would be unfair to &#8220;hobble&#8221; journalists in England and Wales when their colleagues outside the jurisdiction will be free to report whatever they like about the case. He rightly stresses the responsible attitude of the press in this country to the reporting of family proceedings which he contrasts with what he describes as the &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; foreign press and the uncontrolled activities on social media and the internet generally.</p>

But Parliament has decided that proceedings in the family court should normally be heard in private. Within the context of private financial remedy proceedings, the parties are required to give full and frank disclosure of all relevant matters, including details of their private financial affairs. Full and frank disclosure is essential if the court is to deliver justice in such cases. The guarantee of confidentiality is an important concomitant of the disclosure obligation. Accordingly, until Parliament decides otherwise, the family court at first instance must continue to take all necessary steps to respect the confidentiality of the parties and their circumstances.</p>

In fact, I conclude that there is little if any public interest in the exposure of the husband and his family and the issues which have been ventilated before the court in these proceedings. The fact that the husband is a successful businessman does not mean that his family life is entitled to less respect than that of anyone else. There is nothing in the conduct of either party in these proceedings that would justify such exposure. Neither party has been guilty of litigation misconduct which would justify the withdrawal of confidentiality. </p>

He is right in highlighting the question of whether it is appropriate to devote the limited judicial resources of the Family Division to financial remedy disputes between a rich husband and wife as opposed to complex child protection cases involving poor and vulnerable families. In fact, most family lawyers, and certainly most matrimonial financial specialists, would argue that children&#8217;s cases do receive rightful priority and that it is litigants in financial remedy proceedings that suffer from the delays caused by insufficient resources. Nevertheless, Mr Farmer is right to raise this issue. But in my judgment, the public interest in this aspect does not require the parties to be identified.</p>

I recognise, of course, that this case lies at one extreme end of the spectrum of financial remedy cases and that it may be thought that the decision is of little relevance to the vast majority of such cases in the family court, but for the relatively small cohort of &#8220;big money&#8221; cases the outcome of this case may have some relevance. A number of the issues that arose in the case &#8211; including foreign nuptial agreements, the identification and treatment of matrimonial and non-matrimonial assets, and special contribution &#8211; arise in cases where the value of the assets is much less than in this case.</p>

But the evidence establishes that the other component of the right to privacy &#8211; the right against unwanted intrusion into one&#8217;s personal space &#8211; also arises in this case. In particular, it is certain that identification of the parties would cause some intrusion into the life of their son, and it is significantly likely that the intrusion would be on a scale that would cause harm to this vulnerable boy. I accept the wife&#8217;s evidence as to the various risks of harm to her son that would arise were the judgment to be published in a form which identified the parties. For the reasons set out at length by the wife in her statement, and reiterated by counsel for both parties in their written and oral submissions, I am persuaded that there is a particular need in this case for the court to take all necessary steps to protect the family, and in particular the parties&#8217; son, from the risk of identification. I accept that any reporting restrictions order made by this court will have no authority outside the jurisdiction, but it is within the jurisdiction that the need for protection of the child arises.</p>

It is of course right that, when considering whether to grant relief which might affect the exercise of article 10 rights, the court is obliged by s.12 (4)(a)(i) of the Human Rights Act to have regard to the extent to which the material has become available to the public.  In this case, although Mr Farmer informed me that there was some knowledge about the case amongst members of the media, there is no evidence of any substantive prior publication. In the circumstances, the public domain proviso would serve no useful purpose. </p>
