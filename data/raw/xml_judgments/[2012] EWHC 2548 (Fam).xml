	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">This judgment considers a subsidiary issue that has arisen in care proceedings brought by Bristol City Council in respect of two children, SB and CB aged 4 and 3 respectively. Unusually, it is unnecessary to set out the family history that led to the proceedings. Suffice it to say that a major issue in the proceedings was the mother&#8217;s drug-taking and its impact on her capacity to care for the children. She therefore underwent hair-strand testing carried out in June 2011 by the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Intervener, Trimega Laboratories Ltd (&#8220;Trimega&#8221;). The results purported to show that the mother had been using increasing amounts of cocaine and opiates right up to the date of the sample being taken. The mother, however, vehemently denied that this was the case, and she was therefore given permission to obtain a second analysis on a sample taken at the same time. The results of the second test, carried out by Concateno Cardiff Ltd, (also known as TrichoTech but hereafter referred to as &#8220;Concateno&#8221;) appeared to confirm the mother&#8217;s version that that she had not used drugs as described or at all for approximately the previous four months. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Faced with this stark conflict of expert evidence, the proceedings were transferred to the High Court and listed for directions in October 2011 before me as Family Division Liaison Judge for the Western Circuit. In view of the local authority&#8217;s understandable view of the impact of the mother&#8217;s drug habit on her capacity to care for the children, I directed a hearing to resolve the conflict of evidence before any decision could be taken as to the long-term future of the family. Furthermore, the evidence appeared to raise questions as to the utilisation of hair-strand testing to detect drug use. Accordingly, both Concateno and Trimega were given permission to intervene in the proceedings. In view of the potential importance of the issues, I directed that the hearing be listed before the President of the Family Division, Sir Nicholas Wall, who had coincidentally arranged to sit in Bristol later that term. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The reason for including the third issue was that, at the time of the directions hearings before me, there was no clear explanation for the diametrically opposite conclusions of the two reports. It was plainly possible that the explanation lay in a straightforward error. On the other hand, it was suggested by the parties to the care proceedings, and accepted by the court, that the explanation may involve a systemic problem with hair-strand drug testing.</p>

The precise error was, and remains, unclear. Trimega said (although this is not accepted by Concateno) that it was believed that there had been an error in the process by which the hair sample was collected. The first issue was therefore resolved by an agreement placed before the President on the first morning of the hearing and recited as follows in the eventual order made at the conclusion of that hearing:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">As a result of this agreement, the second issue was also resolved without a contested hearing.  The Court accepted that the scientific evidence demonstrated that the mother had used class A drugs until early 2011 but had been abstinent for five months prior to the hearing. As a result, the Court directed a community-based assessment under s.38 (6). The President listed the case for an issues resolution hearing before me on 15th March 2012. Although it is unnecessary to set out subsequent events in detail, it is worth pointing out that the assessment was positive, that the mother remains abstinent and is continuing to make progress, and that there is cautious optimism that she will be able to care for the children in the community.</p>

I am told that, during oral discussion, the President indicated that he would adjourn that issue generally and leave it to whoever took on the case as to whether they chose to deal with it.  Leading Counsel for the two interveners identified four propositions about which there was full agreement, and suggested that these could be incorporated in the President&#8217;s judgment by way of resolution of the third issue, should the President see fit. In the event, the President did not take that course. </p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The interveners were not required to attend the IRH before me on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March, but by that date a report had been filed on behalf of Trimega in accordance with the agreement recited in the President&#8217;s order of 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November. In addition, a skeleton argument from Mr. Robin Tolson QC on behalf of Concateno was filed shortly before the hearing, addressing what were described as the &#8220;inadequacies&#8221; of the Trimega report, making further criticisms of Trimega&#8217;s work on this case, and suggesting general guidance that might be given by the court. At that hearing, in addition to making directions for the welfare stage of the care proceedings, to which no reference is necessary in this judgment, I directed that the question whether the third issue as identified in my earlier order should be further considered by the court should itself be determined at a preliminary hearing; that the interveners should attend that hearing by counsel; that no other party need attend, save that the mother was permitted to attend by counsel; and that Trimega should file a position statement in response to the latest skeleton from Concateno. On 4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April, as a result of the points raised in Mr. Tolson&#8217;s skeleton argument, I expanded the scope of the further hearing so that it would determine not merely whether the &#8220;third issue&#8221; left unresolved following the President&#8217;s hearing should be further considered but also whether there should be a further inquiry into the actions of the Trimega experts. The hearing was listed on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May but, in the event, that fixture had to be aborted because of pressure of other work, and consequently it was agreed that the court would resolve the two preliminary issues on the basis of written submissions alone.</p>

Including the original skeleton arguments placed before the President, each intervener has filed four skeleton arguments or position statements. For this preliminary issue, Mr. Tolson&#8217;s document filed in March and running to 15 pages and 36 paragraphs was met by a &#8220;position statement and skeleton argument&#8221; from Mr. Piers Pressdee QC on behalf of Trimega that extended to 47 pages, 124 paragraphs and 13,001 words. This was followed by a supplemental document from Mr. Tolson of a more modest size, but overall the effort expended by leading counsel on these two preliminary issues is very substantial. One wonders how voluminous their material would be, were I to direct a full hearing on the issues as proposed by Mr. Tolson.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">Mr Pressdee submits this overriding objective would not be served by extending the inquiry in the manner proposed by Concateno. He submits that, whilst it is often appropriate and helpful for courts to give guidance as to law and practice in family cases, such guidance normally arises as an adjunct to the court&#8217;s decision rather than as a free-standing issue. When the hearing was listed before the President, there were possible resolutions of the first issue which might call into question the integrity of the science. Now that the first issue has been resolved by an admission of error by Trimega, no need for guidance arises. Through counsel, Trimega accepts &#8220;that it did not fully or accurately investigate the reason for the difference between its test results and those of the First Intervener when first called upon to do so&#8221;, and that &#8220;initially it focused disproportionately on the aspects of the evidence that it felt supported its position and undermined that of the First Intervener, and that it was not as swift as it should have been to appreciate the contrary evidence and the wider picture.&#8221; Mr Pressdee further informs the court that Trimega &#8220;has, following wide-ranging review of its service, instituted a large number of changes geared to improve the service that it provides and to ensure that errors of the kind that occurred in this case are not replicated in others.&#8221;  Later in his skeleton argument he gives detail of the changes that Trimega has introduced to its collection and other processes. He therefore argues that a finding as to the actual source of Trimega&#8217;s error is not necessary to resolve any threshold, assessment or welfare issue concerning the subject children.</p>

For example, through counsel Trimega acknowledges &#8220;that it should have apologised to the court and to the mother for failing to deliver an accurate and reliable service in this case&#8221;. Mr. Pressdee adds, however, that &#8220;but for the presence of its major commercial rival at court, ready to extract the greatest commercial advantage out of any such apology, it would have done&#8221;. </p>

In the event, the reason for the discrepancy is now accepted as being human error on the part of one of the companies, Trimega. The integrity of the science, and the validity of hair strand testing for drugs, is unaffected by this case. There is, therefore, no proven need for a general inquiry into the matter, or for detailed guidance as to how such tests should be carried out or used in court proceedings.</p>

The jurisdiction of the family courts is to determine specific disputes about specific families. It is not to conduct general inquiries into general issues. Occasionally, a specific case may demonstrate the need for general guidance, but the court must be circumspect about giving it, confining itself to instances where it is satisfied that the circumstances genuinely warrant the need for such guidance and, importantly, that is fully briefed and equipped to provide it.</p>

I have already referred to Mr. Pressdee&#8217;s frank assertion that Trimega had withheld an apology to the mother because it feared that its rival would exploit such an apology for commercial advantage. In this respect, Trimega&#8217;s attitude does no credit to an organisation entrusted with the responsibility of providing independent expert advice to the court on matters that will affect the lives of children and families. In his final document, Mr. Tolson on behalf of Concateno frankly acknowledged that &#8220;ultimately &#8230; both companies have commercial interests in this case which are entirely legitimate&#8221;. In circumstances where both interveners admit to commercial motivation, the court cannot be confident that would have all the information at its disposal to provide clear, detailed and objective guidance. Any process designed to provide such detailed guidance would have to allow other interested parties to make representations. </p>

Mr. Tolson describes the report prepared following the hearing before the President as a &#8220;whitewash&#8221; and accuses Trimega of falsely asserting that the error lay in the collection process to conceal more fundamental flaws in their systems. He sets out the justification for that assertion in considerable detail. Mr. Pressdee denies this allegation and goes into even more extensive detail as to the investigation carried out by Trimega into the cause of the human error in this case. In order to investigate those matters, fully and fairly, the court would in my judgment have to conduct a hearing lasting several days, summoning several witnesses from Trimega for oral evidence, and in all probability commissioning further independent expert evidence. At the conclusion of such a hearing, the court might give a judgment setting out its findings, but no order would follow. </p>
