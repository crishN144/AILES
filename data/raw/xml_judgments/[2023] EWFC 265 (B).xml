The touchstone for all cases is for the Court to focus on the evidence before it and what it suggests as being accurate.

Domestic abuse as with all abuse is the imposition of one party&#8217;s wishes onto a weaker party. Domestic abuse typically occurs in the private sphere and with this comes real challenges as to assessment and obtaining of evidence. It will often be the case that the Court is left to evaluate the diametrically opposed evidence of the key participants without any help from extraneous sources. The Court can find guidance in Practice Direction 12J as to the concepts of domestic abuse including coercive and controlling behaviour. The Court is reminded through the guidance found in Re H-N &amp; Others <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/448" uk:canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 448" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] EWCA Civ 448</ref> as to insidious nature of domestic abuse and the need for sophisticated analysis.

Not every act of unkindness, rudeness or misconduct will be such as to justify fact finding. The Court needs to clearly delineate between those findings which will have a material impact on child arrangements (if proven) and those which will not. It is not for the Court to resolve all disputes between adults and it is positively unhelpful for the court to allow the proceedings to become &#8216;another battleground for adult conflict&#8217;.</span></p>

Father gave unconvincing evidence about his intentions to relocate, he still intended to do so when making his application in July 2022 yet the move has not materialised and Father remains to date living with his parents, and his new wife. </span></p>

However, before reducing this judgment to writing I have stood back and reflected on the evidence holistically considering the wide canvas of evidence placed before me. There must be room for the Court to make mixed findings. The rejection of one allegation does not justify the Court in moving on to reject all allegations. However, at the same time the Court is bound to draw upon its assessment on one allegation to an extent when considering others. In a case in which controlling behaviour is alleged it is important that I take care to look for and, if identified, interpret patterns of behaviour present on the facts.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This is a complex matter. The Court is invited to make findings in relation to what did or did not take place during the parental relationship in the context of previous proceedings concluding with an agreed position that the allegations made were not a bar to regular, unsupervised contact between Father and the children; such contact could progress to overnight once Father relocated to the Lancashire area. It could therefore be argued that it is not necessary to make any findings regarding the parental relationship itself, and this was my initial view when case managing the second set of proceedings for the first time in January 2023. However, Mother&#8217;s case is clear: it is necessary to determine the allegations as there is a direct causal link between Father&#8217;s behaviour during the relationship and Father&#8217;s behaviour during time spent with the children that has caused MFM to say that her Father prefers IFM more than her.</span></p>

As evidenced throughout the previous proceedings and set out within the consent order, Mother has consistently raised her concerns about the children being taken to London, and the influence of paternal grandparents. I take into account that Mother was aware, although not the extent to which, the paternal grandparents were continuing to spend time with the children during Father&#8217;s weekend contact, and the reference to the grandparents being &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">reintroduced</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221; to the children in the consent order recital was incorrect. Unfortunately, it is clear that the parties in subsequent discussions did not distinguish between recitals and the terms of the order, and this created issues between the parties that could easily have been clarified. For the avoidance of any doubt, I am satisfied that Mother was aware that the grandparents were spending some time with the children post separation, whilst with Father, and Mother did not breach the Court order after February 2022.</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">There remains the issue regarding Father&#8217;s decision not to relocate, I have already commented upon this when assessing Father&#8217;s evidence and will do so again later within my Judgment.</span></p>

It was suggested that Leicester was chosen as a mid-way point between Lancashire and London, however neither parent had any significant family members in the area. Although it may have appeared to be a compromise, a consistent theme occurred in relation to the parents disagreeing about the amount of time Father would spend with the paternal family.

Father&#8217;s justification for this is that Mother would make false allegations, and it was to protect the children from further allegations that an adult should be there. Father failed to appreciate the impact this would have on MFM, irrespective of the reason why, that other children of varying ages would be directed not to be alone with her. She was two, and she was expected to somehow understand why her cousins, for example, would run away from her when she woke up. I am satisfied from Mother&#8217;s evidence that the paternal grandparents, and Father as evidenced through messages in this bundle, were aware of this at the time and did not stop this.</span></p>

The analysis within the CYPS single assessment highlights conversations took place with Mother, Father and paternal grandparents, and that the couples&#8217; accounts varied greatly and Father provided a lengthy script of significant events according to him; such observations are entirely consistent with my own observations, with allegations and counter allegations made.

The evidence serves to highlight both the inappropriateness of recording video contact with the children and that the children were exposed to parental conflict, and differences in parenting responses.</span></p>

The relevant Cafcass tools were used, PH has considered all the evidence, and her firm view is that the children have not been alienated from Father. The issues, which I agree, are more in-depth and include the exposure to parental conflict, and Mother has tried to consistently promote contact. Further, children can be impacted by domestic abuse in many ways, and can feel guilt, shame and torn; children need to see parents who can co-parent without issue. MFM does have a fairly adult vocabulary, evidenced also by the videos produced, and her lived experiences had impacted on her. MFM is aware of family conflict and is not wholly negative about Father, she has told the school that she misses him and has spoken positively about the time spent with him. MFM is struggling to make sense of what is happening, this is clearly evidenced through the school report on 31</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> January 2023 when MFM became upset and said in a raised voice:-</span></p>

I accept Mother did not feel able to return to collect MFM and asked AS and her husband to do so, and this is accepted by Father.  As AS confirmed, she and her husband were able to take MFM with little incident from the paternal grandparents&#8217; home. Although it was argued that Mother&#8217;s actions were illogical, it is equally as plausible that Mother felt unable to take MFM due to the conflict, but ultimately the paternal family, including Father, on that occasion did not prevent AS from taking MFM, when Father could have exercised parental rights to keep MFM. I am not satisfied on this evidence that Father and the Paternal Grandparents purposely withheld MFM from Mother on this occasion. There was conflict on this occasion, involving the paternal grandfather, and Mother left feeling unable to take MFM with her due to the conflict.</span></p>

This is consistent with a pattern of behaviour that Father was the dominant partner in the relationship, and his decision meant that the day was over for the family, and also days later Father was still expecting Mother to apologise for her behaviour in public.</span></p>

Mother gave credible and consistent evidence regarding this, Father believed he had a right to know who Mother messaged and I find it more likely than not that he tried to access Mother&#8217;s phone, an argument and likely physical altercation took place, with Father twisting Mother&#8217;s arm, and Mother threw the phone out of the window in fear. Although it appears to be an irrational act by Mother, I find it more plausible than throwing the phone away to get rid of memories, as claimed by Father. Mother&#8217;s version of events is supported by the maternal grandfather&#8217;s witness statement, he was not challenged regarding this and he confirmed that the maternal grandparents looked after MFM whilst they went back to search for the phone.</span></p>

Mother confided in a medical professional and a referral was made, and Mother more likely than not minimised the abuse to Children&#8217;s social care &#8211; as she now accepts &#8211; due to fearing intervention from social care. Mother has provided a credible and consistent account of the incident, supported by contemporaneous evidence, and Mother presenting in a manner not uncommon to those within an abusive relationship, and I am satisfied Father used physical force on this occasion as alleged by Mother.</span></p>

The reference to a re-introduction of the paternal grandparents to the children was incorrect within the recitals, and I am satisfied that Mother was aware that the grandparents were having some contact, but not the actual extent of this. I have also made clear findings that MFM was aware that Father would be moving to Lancashire, but the move never took place, and the parents lacked some understanding as to the difference between recitals and Court orders. The allegation that Father breached the Court order was, quite properly, withdrawn. Neither parent breached the final consent order.</span></p>
