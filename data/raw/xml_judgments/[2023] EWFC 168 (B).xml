These proceedings were heard by HHJ Watkins at&#160;the&#160;pre-trial review on&#160;14&#160;April&#160;2023. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">All advocates presently before me appeared before HHJ Watkins at the pre-trial review.  Two relevant decisions were made.  First, the learned judge confined the times for examination of witnesses. Secondly, the learned judge confirmed the Designated Family Judge&#8217;s listing of this matter for trial notwithstanding the unavailability of the guardian on&#160;11&#160;and&#160;12&#160;May, resulting in it being likely, if not inevitable, that her evidence would be taken out of turn before the parents would give their evidence, and potentially resulting in her not hearing the parents' evidence at all.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">None of those case management decisions by HHJ Watkins, nor those of the Designated Family Judge listing the proceedings in this way, were subject to an appeal.  Helpfully, the parties narrowed the scope of the issues before me which allowed flexibility in the times available, although they may not consider there was&#160;a&#160;great degree of flexibility offered.  Each of the parties has had more time to challenge the witnesses than were confined by the trial management directions.  Where necessary, I have stopped examination in order to fairly and efficiently manage the hearing.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">During the hearing, the father took issue with the children's guardian giving evidence prior to the parents.  It was submitted that would be inconsistent with&#160;a&#160;fundamental right to&#160;a&#160;fair hearing.  If that was thought to be so fatal, and I am not required to express&#160;a&#160;judgment here as to whether or not it would be, the failure to appeal the Designated Family Judge&#8217;s ruling, and subsequent confirmation of it by HHJ Watkins, is quite surprising.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">Parties are under&#160;a&#160;duty to help the Court further the overriding objective: see rule&#160;1.3&#160;of the Family Procedure Rules&#160;2010.  It is inconsistent with that duty for parties to leave&#160;a&#160;point challenging the procedural fairness of&#160;a&#160;pre-trial review case management ruling until the final hearing several weeks later because, when challenges to case and trial management rulings are delayed until the event themselves, there is an inevitable risk that the final hearing fixture and valuable Court time will be lost, which would result in an inefficient and disproportionate use of limited resources.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">I agree with the general proposition that where it can be accommodated, regular order should be adopted.  Fortuitously, and thanks in part to the advocates and their management of the witnesses, and the children's guardian's commitments being less firm than was initially understood (on&#160;11&#160;May she was in fact in&#160;a&#160;private law matter that had not been allocated&#160;a&#160;judge and therefore the hearing was at risk) &#8211; it was possible to accommodate regular order.  I issued&#160;a&#160;witness summons under Part 24 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 for the children&#8217;s guardian to appear before me on&#160;11&#160;May, so that she would give evidence.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">Midway through the cross-examination of the father, the local authority sought leave to cross-examine him on&#160;a&#160;document purporting to rebut the father's oral evidence in chief that there was no financial assessment of his means undertaken by the local authority. It was not a document exhibited to a witness statement nor introduced into evidence as part of the local authority&#8217;s case.  I refused permission for the document to be admitted and these are my reasons for so refusing.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">I accept that evidence would be relevant because it would tend to render more probable&#160;a&#160;fact in issue, namely whether there was in fact&#160;a&#160;financial assessment.  That was not, however, the end of the matter.  I necessarily had regard to the overriding objective to deal fairly in my conduct of the proceedings.  I refused to admit the document for two principal reasons.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_13">

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">First, it was not necessary to admit the document to prove there was&#160;a&#160;financial assessment.  The father cross-examined witnesses on the premise that there was a financial assessment.  At no point was it put to any witness that there was in fact no financial assessment.  He did not challenge oral evidence that there was one, and nor did he challenge the written evidence that there was one.  Thus, the evidence was unchallenged in that respect.  I do not consider that every point need be challenged in&#160;a&#160;hearing where counsel have had limited time to cross-examine.  However, I do expect that, when the issue is in fact being cross-examined on, that had the father given instructions that there was in fact no financial assessment, he would put that through his experienced counsel, especially so given the father was on notice to the case against him that there <span style="font-style:italic">was</span>&#160;a&#160;financial assessment.  It is set out in the written evidence at PDF page&#160;663&#160;that&#160;a&#160;financial assessment was undertaken on&#160;22&#160;February&#160;2022&#160;and explained in the oral evidence given to me that there was&#160;a&#160;financial assessment.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">My second reason deals with the fairness of the proceedings.  In my judgment, it would not be fair to admit the document and it would be disproportionate given my evaluation, above.  The father was in the middle of his cross-examination.  The document had not previously been disclosed in the local authority's case.  Counsel had not seen it before the application was made.  The local authority heard the father's oral evidence before cross-examination began and there was, in my judgment, an opportunity for this matter to be raised before cross-examination began.  It would overall, in my judgment, have been unfair to have permitted such&#160;a&#160;document to be admitted into evidence in those circumstances.  </p>

I was affirmed in my judgment, not to admit the document by the <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span> relevance of the fact in issue once the case was finally submitted to me.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">MD (<span style="font-weight:bold">&#8220;the social worker&#8221;</span>) is a social worker employed by the local authority. In the social worker&#8217;s opinion G would be at risk of significant harm by neglect of his needs if he lives with his parents.  She considered that the father has not evidenced he could make necessary changes in his parenting skills to provide G with the consistent level of high care that he requires.  The social worker relied on the improvements in G&#8217;s independence (use of toilet, eating well, sleeping well and improved communication skills) as evidence of the deficit in his needs being met when he lived with his parents.  The social worker contended that the parents could not meet G&#8217;s needs, even with intensive support.  The acute stressor is the parental dynamic in which the father would be required to be the primary carer, but he is unable to challenge the mother&#8217;s dominant parenting style and her desire to resume her role as primary carer.</p>

As is apparent from the other evidence, this did not in fact reflect the support that was available.</p>

The social worker&#8217;s evasive responses when challenged about her understanding of the support provided to the family were unsatisfactory.  This was even more stark given the social worker accepted that in November 2019 there were <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> concerns about parenting capacity.  She eventually conceded, when asked by the Court, that the suggestion the support was &#8220;substantial&#8221; was &#8220;a bit generous&#8221;.  It was difficult to discern whether the social worker&#8217;s persistent defensiveness was because she was attempting to hide embarrassment at her lack of attention to detail or in fact revealed an unwillingness to be reflective on deficits in her analysis.  Along with the lack of analysis of the past and future support available to the family, the social worker was compelled to concede that the care plan did not satisfactorily engage with G&#8217;s religious and cultural needs.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.04in">The father is a taxi driver. He works varying shifts of 15-20 hours per week.  The father acknowledged that G receives a good level of care at Spring Home. It was expressly put to witnesses on his behalf that criticism was not directed at Spring Home.  The father believes the mother has found it difficult to &#8220;come to terms&#8221; with G&#8217;s diagnosis of Autism and she expressed to him that it is something G would &#8220;grow out of&#8221;.  The father perceived the mother &#8220;buried her head in the sand in the hope G&#8217;s disabilities would disappear as he got older&#8221;.  Given the mother was G&#8217;s primary carer, and she held these views which were wholly inconsistent with even a modest understanding of G&#8217;s needs, the father conceded that he &#8220;failed to prioritise G&#8217;s needs&#8221;.  In his witness statement of 3 August 2022, the father told the Court that he would &#8220;100%&#8221; be able to meet G&#8217;s needs and pressed for G&#8217;s return home.  He likewise pressed G&#8217;s immediate return home (under any order and with support) in his witness statement signed as recently as 27 March 2023.  I must inevitably conclude, given the position he now adopts in this hearing that G cannot safety return to him now, that there was a measure of unreality to the father&#8217;s assessment of his own capacity to care for G when he settled those documents.</p>

I have no doubt the balance he is trying to strike in promoting himself as the primary carer of G, very much as the expense of the mother resuming any significant caring role, and maintaining a cordial relationship with her, is challenging.  He perceives the mother <span style="font-style:italic">still</span>, despite their joint position to the Court, wishes to do G&#8217;s care by herself.  I credit the father for his candour, arguably against his interests, in shining light into the challenges that will exist in this parenting dynamic.</p>

The mother told me that there was no reason why G could not come home next week or &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221;.  I got no sense she understood the challenges G would face if I embraced that course.  The mother told me that G had strong routines at home.  She accepted that she would find it &#8220;very difficult&#8217; to take a back seat in G&#8217;s care.  I asked the mother if she believes there is anything the father must work on. She told me that the father already knows a lot and that, if he does need assistance, then she will be supporting him, &#8220;showing him and telling him.&#8221;</p>

She highlighted G&#8217;s needs as a child with diagnoses of cerebella vermis hypoplasia, Learning Disability, Epilepsy and Autism and the high level of support which he requires.  His parents have been struggling to care for him without the usual robust care package which one would expect for a child with G&#8217;s needs.  Dr XB identifies that &#8216;The mother is often caring for G alone and he presents with a high level of need, which many parents would find challenging, in my clinical experience. My impression is that the mother is fatigued by the level of support G requires at home...&#8217; [B128].</p>

G requires care which supports his social, emotional and behavioural needs He requires care that promotes his basic care needs and which supports development of his independence skills and learning, both at school and at home.  He requires care by those with understanding of and skilled in meeting his needs and development, and who can adapt their approach to meet his needs.  </p>

I accept this is not&#160;a&#160;consideration the children&#8217;s guardian has thoroughly considered.

I accept as&#160;a&#160;consequence that the prospect of rehabilitation has not been sufficiently considered or analysed.  I am further cognisant of anchoring bias wherein there is&#160;a&#160;tendency to rely too heavily on preliminary conclusions and information first received at the expense of new information and&#160;a&#160;fresh analysis.  To expect&#160;a&#160;great shift in the children's guardian's position when she was given such piecemeal information over&#160;a&#160;tightly-managed hearing is to ask&#160;a&#160;lot.  This hearing has not provided the environment to enable the children's guardian to scrutinise in any detail the new information received or given her the time required to reflect on her conclusions in light of that information.  Ending these proceedings after&#160;135&#160;weeks, with the profound delay that has occurred, has great attractions, but it would be wrong and the Court cannot sanction that course today.   </p>

In this case proceedings were issued primarily to address the breaking of&#160;a&#160;deadlock between Local Authority and parents. The proceedings may well have achieved that aim, though not before they had first further embittered and embattled that key relationship between the parents and the Local Authority. It seems to me that legal proceedings will often, at best, have&#160;a&#160;very limited contribution to make in cases like this. Whatever its deficits may be perceived to be, the family unit, if functional, is of central importance to the permanently disabled for it is the one fixed point in the constantly moving waters of state care provision. The welfare of such children over&#160;a&#160;lifetime is closely bound up with the ability of the family to remain&#160;a&#160;functioning and effective unit. By the same token, it must be emphasised that resort to litigation to advance one family's interests at the inevitable expense of others is to be deeply deprecated. As&#160;a&#160;general rule, as I have said, litigation rarely contributes to the resolution of these issues."</span></p>

In simple terms I will, at that hearing, conclude either that the rehabilitation plan that has been identified is one that can be implemented, or it cannot be, in which case I will have to consider other options.  </p>
