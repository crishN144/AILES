	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment concerns a fact finding hearing to determine the age of X. The parents are both Afghan citizens, their English is limited, and they have been assisted through a 5-day fact find by interpreters. For this reason, I will give my conclusion now without the reasons so that the parents can understand the conclusion and then the reasons can be interpreted for them later. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X is an Afghan citizen who came to the attention of the Local Authority and police on 10 January 2022 after she had approached a park liaison officer. She said that she was 16 years old and had been assaulted by her father and her brother. She was taken into police protection but subsequently withdrew these allegations and said that she was in fact, at that stage, a 9-year-old.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 January 2022, X approached a park liaison officer in a distressed state. She said in broken English, &#8220;help me, police.&#8221; During that conversation she said that she was 16 years old, but her parents had told her to lie about her age. They had told her, she said then, to say that she was 10 years in order that she could go into a lower class at school. The same evening X spoke to police and made allegations of assault against her father and her brother. She repeated that she was 16. Although the police interview started in English, an Urdu interpreter then attended on the telephone. I have watched body cam footage of that interview. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X signed a statement saying that she did not wish to pursue an allegation against her parents. She repeated to Sergeant Nasheen at about 8:30pm that she was 16. She said that her parents had told her to lie because her father wanted her to get an education in England and did not want either X or her parents to be placed under pressure for her to be married at 16 in Turkey, where she and most of the family had been living. She was adamant in her account and said that she feared for her safety and was in danger.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Rebecca West, the duty social worker who attended the police station and transported X to her placement that evening, spoke to X. Ms West only had limited conversation with X, but X asked in the car whether she could change the date of birth on her passport and that she did not want to be regarded as an 11 or 12 year old. Ms West also recorded that X asked about whether she would be given sanitary products at the placement during the same conversation.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note at this point that X is a native Pashtu speaker. She speaks some Urdu and not very much English. Sergeant Nasheen is an Urdu speaker. There is therefore some scope for misunderstanding in what X was saying at that stage, although the gist of what X was saying, namely that she was 16 and her parents had told her to say that she was much younger, is clear. I also note, having watched the bodycam footage, that it appears to me that X did understand quite a lot of English.  She was clearly responding to questions posed to her in English in a way that strongly indicated she understood the questions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">By the 12 January 2022, X was saying that she had been lying and that she was &#8220;crazy.&#8221; On that day there is a report from the placement about X&#8217;s behaviour. They said that she was very unsettled and kept coming into the room to ask for the wi-fi password and was extremely anxious. The log from the placement makes it clear that X had at least spoken to her older sister, I, before she changed what she was saying, and it may be that she had spoken to other family members. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An application for a care order was made on the same day and the Interim Care Order was made on 13 January 2022. On that day, X attended a child protection medical with her parents present and her parents claimed she was 9 years old. Dr Williams, who was the paediatrician, said in his report that he thought this was very unlikely. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">X has been in the placement since the 10 January 2022. As set out above, she has maintained that she was born in 2012 and that her initial story was untrue. The placement logs recalled a number of matters which the Local Authority say support their case that X is much older than 9 or 10. Examples include when she was taken shopping, that she was immediately interested in buying make up; that she watches films that are suitable for a much older child; and that her general interests seem to be those of an older child. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All parties agree that it is critical to determine X&#8217;s true age before any decisions are made about what happens next. Therefore, a fact finding hearing was ordered to determine this matter before the making of any welfare orders. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The chronology of the family, as stated by the parents and as at some points supported by the documentary evidence, is as follows. The Father was born in 1970 and Mother in 1978. They were married in 1994 in Pakistan. Their eldest child, I, was born in 1996. She now lives in Turkey and has two children. Her husband lives in the UK and it appears they cannot live together for immigration reasons. G, a boy, was born in 1998 and he sadly died in Pakistan in 2015/16. N, a boy, was born in 2000, he is married and lives in Turkey.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Mother says in her UK entry form that she and the family moved to Pakistan from Afghanistan in January 2001. In March 2002, the father travelled to Afghanistan for a funeral. At this time the Mother was pregnant with twins. The Father did not return to Pakistan and Mother says that she did not know what had happened to him for a prolonged period. The Father&#8217;s evidence was that his father was a senior person in a group in Afghanistan that was in conflict with the Northern Alliance. That led him to having to leave Afghanistan in considerable danger and later to the fear that the family, both when they lived in Pakistan and subsequently in Turkey, were themselves in danger from factions in the Afghani community. The detail of this conflict is not relevant to the court determination, but it does set the context to the family history. </p>

His application was refused and there was then a subsequent appeal which was itself refused. He became appeal rights exhausted on 23 January 2003. His case is that he remained in the UK for the following 8 years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 6 January 2009, the Father made further submissions to the Home Office. These were rejected with no right of appeal. The Father said in evidence that throughout his time in the UK, i.e., from 2002 until now, he has lived in this same area. He says that up to 2011, he never left the UK because he would not have been able to re-enter. On 29 July 2011, the Father was issued discretionary leave to remain in the UK until 2014. This meant that he could leave the country and re-enter lawfully. On 16 August 2011, the Father was issued with an Afghan passport. Soon after, he travelled to Pakistan with an entry date of the 30 August 2011. There is a passport stamp which confirms that date. On the 17 November 2011, the Father returned to the UK. The parents say that it was during this period that X was conceived.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 10 May 2012, the parents say X was born in Peshawar, Pakistan, in a refugee camp where the family had been living. This is the date of birth entered on X&#8217;s Afghan passport and on her Turkish Residence Permit. There is a certificate issued by the hospital in Peshawar, where she was born, that confirms her name, the names of her parents and the date of birth. An expert report was commissioned in these proceedings that says to the best of the investigator&#8217;s belief, this certificate is genuine and is based on the records in the hospital. I do not question the good faith of the investigator, but the veracity of the certificate is impossible to establish, and I put limited weight on this particular piece of evidence. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In 2016, G, the oldest boy in the family, was killed in Peshawar when aged 16. The evidence given by the Father is that this was part of the violence that related back to the Father&#8217;s position in Afghanistan. This event was naturally deeply traumatic for the family. It is somewhat unclear the degree to which X knew what was happening; on the parent&#8217;s case she would have been a four year old, or if she saw G&#8217;s body. However, the death of her brother may be one factor in the behaviour she has subsequently exhibited. </p>

A statement has been given from the school in which they state that X attended regularly (90% attendance) and that she appeared to be doing alright, although she needed extra help in Maths and English. </p>

The Interim Care Order has been continued since 13 January 2022. Paternity testing has been carried out which shows to a very high level of probability that the Mother and Father are X&#8217;s parents. Her Honour Judge Harris ordered that a Merton Compliant Age Assessment be carried out, I will refer to that below. On 27 June 2022, the matter was reallocated to me as the Family Division Liaison Judge for the Midlands. </p>

Both said in the report that they had carried out a large number of assessments. The age assessment was dated 29 April 2022 and the assessors met with X for about 2 hours. They also had a large number of documents, including the parent&#8217;s statements, which exhibited the Father&#8217;s paperwork from the Home Office. They also had the original dental report although not the most recent dental table which has been produced. The conclusion of the age assessment was that X was an older child, approximately 16 years old.</p>

There are no single determinative ways of deciding age. In this regard, their assessment is consistent, both with the guidance of the courts and professional bodies, on how to undertake age assessments. There is no one single factor. Care is needed in respect of both appearance and demeanour, both because those factors are subject to enormous individual difference, but also because culture, ethnicity and personal experience can have major impacts on how a child or young person presents. </p>

The age assessment says that the assessor&#8217;s observation was that X had all of her adult teeth. However, the dental records are in fact clear that at the time of the visit, X has mixed dentition with a number of her baby teeth. Dr Patsiamanidis, the dentist, said that it was normally the case that baby teeth were lost between the ages of 6 and 13.</p>

My sense is that the Father in particular wants the children to benefit from living in England, and for them to take advantage of the opportunities, both in terms of relative safety and education that living in this country offers. I did not find the Father or Mother easy witnesses to assess. There were aspects of their evidence which I found very difficult to accept, and where I do not think, unfortunately, they were being honest with the court. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">They both started their evidence by saying that X&#8217;s conduct on 10 January 2022, in refusing to go to school, hitting her face and pulling her hair were something that had not happened before. They both said that this behaviour came out of the blue on the 10 January 2022, and they could offer no explanation for why she had become so upset that day and ultimately ran away and run to the police. However, this account from the parents was plainly not true, and certainly was not the whole truth. The evidence is that X had only gone to school in Turkey for some three months, and the parents accepted after some cross examination by Ms Lakin, that X had become very upset when going to school in Turkey and effectively the parents capitulated and allowed her to stay at home. Then the Covid-19 pandemic had intervened and X remained at home and had not gone to school. The Mother had said to the police when interviewed on around 11 January 2022, that it was &#8220;not unusual&#8221; for X to behave as she had done on the morning of 10 January 2022. However, the Mother told the court that nothing similar had happened before, save for one occasion when X had become upset in Turkey over an incident with an iPad. I do not think the parents were telling me the truth about what had happened on 10 January 2022. However, that does not mean they were lying about X&#8217;s age. There may be a whole gamut of reasons for why the parents were very reluctant to be honest about X&#8217;s behaviour.</p>

Most importantly, this was a case management decision and if it was to be challenged, that should have been done within the timescales set out by the Family Procedure Rules. It is highly undesirable for fresh counsel instructed late in the process to advance arguments which, if they were going to be raised by the parties, should have been done so at an early stage within the timescales set out by the Rules. The instruction of leading counsel very late in the process is not in itself an excuse for raising new points which could lead to a trial being adjourned. This appears to be a not uncommon scenario in the Family Court cases, and it can cause late adjournments and the consequential delays, which is highly detrimental to the interest of the children. Of course I acknowledge that leading counsel have a duty to their clients to advance arguments on their behalf. But the Court has to be careful to ensure that further delay does not do harm to the children. </p>

It was plain when I met X that she was desperate to go home and was finding both living in the placement and the litigation extremely stressful. Therefore, it was of the utmost importance not to derail the fact find and adjourn the case. Given that X&#8217;s evidence was, in my judgement, of little, if any, forensic benefit, I agreed at the start of this hearing to entirely discount it and placed no weight upon the evidence she gave me on 6 October 2022.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have found this to be a very difficult case to decide. Although there is no burden of proof on either party in an age assessment, the burden is on the Local Authority in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> proceedings to establish the threshold, and therefore in practice it is upon the Local Authority to show that X is not 10 but is closer to 16. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are strong reasons to believe X is 16 or much closer to that age than 10.  X was adamant this was the case when she spoke to the park liaison officer, Sergeant Nasheera, the Police and Ms West on 10 January 2022. It is an unlikely story for a 9-year-old, as she would then have been, to make up. She might have said initially that she was 16 because she was angry with her parents and because being older would have allowed her more freedom. However, to maintain that position with a number of people and make up the story about her father wanting her to have an education and not feel pressurised into having her married, is a very sophisticated story for a 9-year-old.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Further, the age assessors and others who have been with X, feel that her behaviour is much more in keeping with that of a 15 to 16 year old, than a 9 to 10 year old. Her conduct in the age assessment interview, both in terms of sitting still and her language; her interests including Bollywood films and TikTok; her immediately wanting to buy make up when she went out shopping with placement workers; her apparent lack of interest in younger children&#8217;s toys; or children who are younger are all factors indicating an older child. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, balanced against the factors pointing to her being an older child, I am very conscious that X&#8217;s life experiences are far from those of a normal British child. She has had the highly traumatic experiences of her brother being killed, her parents living apart, growing up in a refugee camp, travelling from Pakistan to Turkey with the family being in considerable fear, a failed attempt to get into Europe in 2018 which must itself, on the Mother&#8217;s evidence, been very frightening, and very importantly virtually never having gone to school until she came to the UK and therefore having very limited contact with her peers. These are all factors which could make her appear older than her years.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The dental records point strongly to her being younger. Dental records are generally unhelpful in an age assessment, but that is because the normal case is trying to establish whether a person is over or under the age of 18 and the dental evidence is that of third molars which are subject to very wide disparity. In this case, the key issue is that X has a number of baby teeth, which would be very unusual in a 15 to 16 year old. This is not determinative as there will always be outliers, but it is a weighty piece of evidence.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is also the evidence in respect of her periods. The age assessors had assumed that X had started her first period because she asked about sanitary towels in the car on the way to the placement. I have to say, this does seem extremely odd if she hadn&#8217;t had her first period. However, the log from her placement is strong evidence that X had her first period in May 2022. She would have had to be a very good actor to have persuaded the placement that this was her first period when it was not. Whereas it would be relatively common for a 10 year old to enter into menarche, it would be unusual for this not to happen until the girl was very nearly 16. Again, this is not impossible, but is a strong indicator of a younger child. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The strongest evidence in favour of X being younger, is the Father&#8217;s immigration history. He illegally entered the UK in 2002, and did not lawfully leave until 2011, which accords with the dates the parents say X was conceived. As Ms Lakin says, it is not impossible that the Father left the UK in the interim, perhaps on a false passport, but there is no evidence to support that suggestion. It would be very unusual for someone who had unlawfully entered, presumably at considerable risk and expense, to then leave the UK in order to re-enter unlawfully, again presumably at considerable risk and expense. </p>
