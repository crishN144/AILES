	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So far as concerns the application under CPR 52.3(6)(a), it will be noticed that Mr Clemens does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> suggest any error of law on my part, does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>suggest that I had regard to any irrelevant fact and does <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>suggest that I failed to have regard to any relevant fact. Nor does he assert that I was &#8216;plainly wrong&#8217; in my &#8216;parallel analysis&#8217; or in my application of the &#8216;ultimate balancing test.&#8217; In essence his complaint is that in coming to my decision I gave the wrong weight &#8211; in some cases no weight or too little weight, in one case too much weight &#8211; to the factors which he refers to. </p>

Given that I am not giving permission to appeal under CPR 52.3(6)(a), it seems to me, as a matter of general principle, that a decision as to whether, in such circumstances, permission should be given under CPR 52.3(6)(b) is a question usually, and certainly in this particular case, better left for determination by the Court of Appeal rather than by the judge at first instance.</p>

He says that whilst that will no doubt be frustrating for the Wards, if the position was otherwise, any appeal would be academic and pointless if the &#8216;cat was (already) out of the bag&#8217;.</p>

He suggests that, pending the outcome of the appeal, there is scope here for co-operation. For, he says, if the Wards want to publish material it would be sensible for them to show it to Dr A&#8217;s and Dr B&#8217;s advisers prior to publication &#8211; as I understand it with a view to agreeing the necessary redactions to preserve the anonymity in the meantime of Dr A and Dr B.</p>

But in all the circumstances, and very conscious that once the &#8216;cat is out of the bag&#8217; any appeal will be largely nugatory, it seems to me that I ought, nonetheless, to extend the stay for a further <span style="font-style:italic">brief </span>period to enable Mr Clemens and his clients to consider whether they wish to renew their application for permission to the Court of Appeal and, if they do, to enable the Court of Appeal to consider for itself whether or not to extend the stay. When I refer to the stay I mean, of course, the stay so far as it relates to Dr A and Dr B. There being no application for permission to appeal by either the Trusts or CCC there is no basis for any further extension of the stay so far as it relates to either the treating clinicians or the social workers.</p>
