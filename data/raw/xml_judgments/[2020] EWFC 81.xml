Ms Gamble filed her detailed skeleton on 17 July and attached to that the expert evidence from the attorney from country Z, dated 9 July 2020. </p>

The applicants understood that once born the child would be registered as their child.  As a result of those discussions, they understood that they would need to identify their own surrogate. </p>

X was discharged the following day with C and was passed immediately to the care of A and B.

The applicants remained together for one week before A had to return to country Y to work.  A maintained his relationship with X, with daily Facetime calls and regular visits from country Y to country Z before the travel restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic prevented those visits taking place.  </p>

That application was withdrawn, but after receiving specialist advice a further application was made, which is still being considered.  Once the passport is issued, the plan is to live between country Y and the United Kingdom, as the applicants did prior to the surrogacy, until it becomes necessary for them to spend more time in the United Kingdom in relation to X's schooling.   </p>

The evidence to establish the biological link with A is provided by the letter from the treating fertility doctor which is notarised.   This confirms the IVF transfer of the embryo created using A's gametes to C.  Ms Roddy, the parental order reporter, raised the issue of the different way the fertility doctor describes herself in the documents.  The applicants were able to provide additional documents, namely ultrasound scans on letterhead papers that include both versions of the doctor&#8217;s name, and they carry the same signature as to the notarised document.  DNA testing has been considered but the logistics due to the travel restrictions meant that would cause a significant delay.  Having seen the additional material from the hospital I consider this requirement is met through the notarised letter from the doctor that confirms the genetic connection with A, and that X was carried by someone who is not one of the applicants. </p>

In addition, the court has additional information from Ms Roddy who was able to speak to C on 22 July for about an hour with the benefit of an interpreter.  She confirmed to Ms Roddy that she is aware of the application, the hearing and confirmed that she did not wish to play any role in these proceedings.  Ms Roddy discussed with her, appropriately, the effect of a parental order, including that it would extinguish her parental rights and she responded: "We already talked about that. I agree".  She said she recalls signing the Form A101A on 27 February 2020 and was clear to Ms Roddy she volunteered for this arrangement, and B, whom she considers a friend, was someone she wanted to help.  Ms Roddy concluded, having had that discussion with C, that she had provided full and informed consent. I agree with that evidence.  The Form A101A is notarised, and supplemented, importantly in this case, by the insightful discussion Ms Roddy had with C, and so this requirement is met.  </p>

Within her Skeleton Argument, Ms van Overdijk suggested there remain concerns (unassuaged by the Applicants' further evidence) that the Nigerian court may have been misled by them in the sworn evidence filed in support of the Motion to adopt. If that is correct, then argues Ms van Overdijk, it would be sufficient to engage the public policy threshold for refusing recognition; and she suggested that I may wish to hear oral evidence if I were to be sufficiently concerned. </p>

They were entitled to put their trust in a lawyer who held himself out as an expert in achieving international adoptions.  It must be assumed that he knew the requirements of the law; and unquestionably he was responsible for drafting Mrs W's Affidavit. In all of her dealings with Mrs M, the probation officer, Mrs W was transparent and entirely honest.  Mrs M knew exactly when and for how long Mrs W had been in Nigeria and looking after V prior to the adoption hearing. The important factors for her (and for the judge) were the altogether pleasing 'bond' that had developed between Mrs W and V and his future best interests. </p>

In that case the applicants entered into a private adoption arrangement knowing it was unlawful, but knowing they were unlikely to be approved by a conventional adoption application in this country because of their advanced ages and health issues.  They agreed to pay a pregnant woman &#163;1,000 and arranged for her to give birth in Germany, so as not to alert the authorities here.  They brought the child back here, failed to notify the local authority as they should have done, and then continued to lie about the truthful position for a period of about four years.  Additionally, they sought to delay any legal proceedings so that by the time the court came to consider the matter the child had been with the applicants for a considerable period of time.  Bracewell J dealt with the public policy considerations as follows: </p>

I find that the breaches of s.29 are particularly serious in this case, and that the breaches of s.57 are much less serious.  I have to look at the conduct of the applicants in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to grant them relief. I am driven to the conclusion they knew that what they were doing was illegal.  They had been deceitful, they entered into a scheme whereby the birth and handover and caring for the child were kept deliberately from the local authority, and in order to avoid statutory obligations.  They deliberately failed to inform the local authority of the child's arrival as required by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1980/6" uk:canonical="1980 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Foster Children Act 1980</ref>.  They have deliberately delayed the proceedings in order to allow a <span style="font-style:italic">status quo</span> to develop, and they have pulled the wool over the eyes of social workers, the guardian ad litem, and the doctors.   They have endeavoured to manipulate Dr C and also Mr P.A.  They have been deceitful in relation to the local authority and have either lied or deliberately concealed very important matters as to the arrangements surrounding A's arrival, their health, the problems, their marital stability and at one stage as to the nationality of A, who was thought to be Stateless.  It was a placement designed to circumvent <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1980/6" uk:canonical="1980 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> with a campaign of deception.  That is a very serious breach indeed, and there are strong arguments in this case which could lead the court to say that an order should not be made on grounds of public policy.  This is one of those unusual and fortunately rare cases in which, in my view, the court would be fully justified in failing to sanction the breaches." </p>
