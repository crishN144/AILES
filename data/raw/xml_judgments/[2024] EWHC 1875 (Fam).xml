The application concerns one child, C, who will be 9 years old next week.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father seeks the summary return of C to Romania.  C was brought to this country by her mother from Romania in early November 2023.  The mother accepts that C was habitually resident in Romania at the point of her removal.  She accepts that the father had, and has, rights of custody, and that he was exercising them at the time of the removal.  </p>

	    <num>4.</num>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the mother had initially sought to defend this application on the basis that the father had consented to the removal of C permanently to England, she conceded at the pre-trial review that she could not legitimately pursue this &#8216;defence&#8217;.  The mother had further sought to argue that a return to Romania would expose C to &#8220;a grave risk &#8230; [of] physical or psychological harm&#8221; or would &#8220;otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation&#8221;; this argument was also abandoned at the pre-trial review when the mother had an opportunity to consider the range of protective measures offered by the father.   I have set those out in the Annex to this judgment.</p>

It is the mother&#8217;s case that within the post-separation Romanian court proceedings (in particular, as I understand it, in relation to issues of financial support for the mother and/or C) the father made proposals which contemplated the mother and C moving to the UK so that she could be with her new partner.

But I did not detect a &#8220;strength, rationality, or conviction&#8221; in her current opposition to return to Romania.   This is, I remind myself, a question of fact.  Although I note that the Family Court Adviser had considered that C does object to a return to Romania, this is nonetheless a matter for me to decide. Ms Gray conceded, or certainly came close to conceding, on behalf of her client, that the evidence reveals that C does object to a return.

Again, consistent with her developing maturity, she has been assessed by the Family Court Adviser (in evidence which I accept, although I note that the mother does not) as viewing complex issues, including her relationship with her father, in a rather one-dimensional way.

		<p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">C appears to link a return to Romania with the resumption of a more involved relationship with her father, yet, as mentioned above, it was the Family Court Adviser&#8217;s view which I accept that she had a somewhat &#8220;one-dimensional&#8221; view of her father.  This lack of critical evaluation and balance possibly stemmed from her immaturity; it seems entirely possible that this is because she has absorbed the mother&#8217;s negative view of the father (see &#167;(v) below). The Family Court Adviser considered that the alleged physical abuse which the mother described that C had suffered at the hands of her father (&#8220;she spoke about a smack on the bottom&#8221;) &#8220;wouldn't usually be the basis for this level of rejection of a parent&#8221;;</p>

In her oral evidence, in answer to questions posed by the mother, the Family Court Adviser said: &#8220;I felt she was repeating her concerns <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">by rote</span> rather than answering the specific concerns I had about her contact with her father&#8230;&#8221; (emphasis by underlining added).  The Family Court Adviser detected a hint that some of the negativity about her father stemmed from the adults around her (citing as an example that there was insufficient &#8220;healthy food&#8221; in her father&#8217;s home);</p>

But there was disruption in bringing her here in the first place.  Moreover, I also note that even when C was living in Romania with her mother she was subjected to at least two moves of home; the father&#8217;s case is that the mother has moved C &#8220;five times to a different home, four times to a different city, and two schools in two different countries&#8221;;</p>

She has plainly had this permanent move in contemplation for some considerable time but she made, it seems to me, only half-hearted attempts to secure the father's agreement; when he did not provide it (either directly or by avoidance), she took no formal steps to obtain the courts approval.  Instead, she took a gamble; I find that she hoped or expected that, in presenting the father with a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">fait accompli</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> once she was here, he would not protest.
