At the final hearing,&#160;the judge gave a 'lengthy and thorough' judgment. She determined that threshold was crossed on the basis of risk of harm and concluded that there were only two realistic options: placement with the paternal&#160;grandmother (PGM) or placement for adoption. On a narrow balance, the judge determined that the best outcome would be for Child A to be placed with PGM under a care order (but with a higher than usual number of statutory visits, including unannounced visits and likely for longer than 12 months).&#160; However, that could not happen because the LA had refused PGM's application for approval as a foster carer. The judge deferred her final decision for PGM to be re-presented to panel with disclosure of her judgment.&#160; At panel the social workers did not advance the court's assessment but instead contested it. Panel refused to approve PGM and the agency decision maker (ADM) accepted their decision. The court&#160;reconvened and heard further oral submissions. The LA argued for a care and placement order, now supported by the Guardian, on the basis there was no alternative. The parents and PGM invited the court to consider an SGO, or a s.8 order and supervision order, or the making of an interim care order or care order, but not a placement order, as a mean of putting further pressure on the LA to change its plan.&#160; Making a placement order, the judge noted that her findings ruled out any placement with the PGM, unless such placement could be bolstered not just by a care order, but by increased LA vigilance. As the LA declined to approve PGM as a kinship foster carer, the judge concluded that she had 'absolutely no power to compel them so to do'.&#160; PGM appealed and issued judicial review proceedings.</span></p>

If the extended, maternal family wish to have contact with Child A and Child B then a risk assessment would be undertaken to include Child A and Child B&#8217;s wishes and feelings.

Child B demonstrates behavioural difficulties and Child A&#8217;s relationship with her mother is described as &#8216;difficult&#8217;.

The matters I have set out above in my view amply demonstrate why this is the case. The risks inherent in the transition to the father&#8217;s sole care are obvious. The risks inherent in the contact arrangements being ultimately the sole responsibility of the father and mother, both in terms of whether that contact takes place safely and whether it negatively affects the stability of the placement, are obvious. The need for inter-sibling contact is obvious and agreed but the ability of the proposed long-term carers to promote the same is untested. The likely needs of the children for medium term ongoing monitoring and support are obvious. I agree entirely with the assessment of the Children&#8217;s Guardian.</span></p>

In addition [they] have demonstrated that they are unable to be open and honest with professionals despite significant safeguarding concerns that both Mrs W and Mr W were well aware of at the time. Therefore, given all the highlighted concerns, this has resulted in a negative viability assessment.&#8221;</span></p>

It balances the positive and negatives of the children potentially being placed with Mr and Mrs W. It highlights further historical familial disputes and disruptions (involving both the father in this case and another child of theirs) but also notes a degree of insight on the part of Mr and Mrs W into past mistakes. It ultimately recommends, on balance, placement of the children with Mr and Mrs W.</span></p>

Further, Ms Clarkson met with Mr and Mrs W. She formed the viewed that they had gained insight into past difficulties.

She considers that on balance they would be the right placement for Child C and Child D and she comments very positively on the contact she has observed. She highlights the huge commitment involved, the change to the grandparents&#8217; lives, and the need for ongoing monitoring and support. Primarily, she is concerned that the children have not yet moved to live with Mr and Mrs W and therefore the placement is untested. In light of all the matters highlighted in the assessments and her own observations she recommends that Care Orders are made with a view to an early discharge application once the children have settled and all the predictable and unpredictable &#8216;loose-ends&#8217; have been monitored, managed and resolved.</span></p>
