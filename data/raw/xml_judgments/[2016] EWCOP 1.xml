It is feared that other members of the family may be taking advantage of Ron&#8217;s lack of capacity, and recently a cheque was drawn for &#163;80,000 which Ron apparently signed but has no recollection of. Ron&#8217;s property and affairs therefore require urgent protection, and the applicant seeks the Court of Protection to appoint a professional deputy, Miss Rheian Davies, Solicitor, to act as his deputy in this respect. Ron is unable to protect his financial interests himself, and no one else has the legal authority to do so. Therefore it is necessary to urgently appoint a professional deputy.&#8221;</p>

This has often involved him lending money. He has never managed his finances well. We have a better understanding of his finances than he ever has had. The application for deputyship has been made because my father&#8217;s youngest child Z wishes to gain knowledge and control of my father&#8217;s finances. Z has no knowledge of my father&#8217;s affairs. Z has struggled with drug addiction and managing her own life in the past. I have been concerned that Z is exerting control over my father and using threats of self harm and cutting contact between my father and her child to influence his behaviour and extract money from him. This has led to my father reducing contact with his wider family. This has also led to my father giving Z money despite telling people he did not want to do so. There have been concerns expressed by social services about Z&#8217;s relationship with my father. I propose the appointment of Sarah as deputy. I seek further time to file witness evidence.&#8221;  </p>

Notice of the directions appointment of 21st September was communicated to the parties by inclusion in the two page directions issued on 9th July. The respondents&#8217; solicitors operate a paperless case management system. Incoming post is scanned, the original paper documents are shredded and case &#8216;papers&#8217; are held in digital files. The directions of 9th July were received, scanned and emailed to the solicitor on 13th July. Those directions consist of one page and do not contain the second page which contained the listing notice. The first scanned copy included a marketing flyer at page 2 and the solicitor asked for the document to be scanned again. The document was scanned again but still consisted of one page of directions and a blank page. The respondents were therefore unaware of the directions appointment on 21st September and did not attend. The court office have indicated that the order would have been doubled-sided and believe the fault lies with the respondents&#8217; solicitors. The fault does not lie with the respondents. The respondents object to the interim order appointing [the solicitor for] the applicant and ask for it to be set aside with immediate effect. The respondents ask the court to relist this case at the earliest opportunity.&#8221; </p>

In her position statement, she referred to the judgment of His Honour Judge Cardinal in <span style="font-style:italic">EG v RS, JS and BEN PCT</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2010/3073" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCOP 3073" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCOP 3073</ref>; [2010] COPLR Con Vol 350. Judge Cardinal introduced his judgment by suggesting that it was &#8220;a cautionary tale for all those who put themselves forward as professional deputies when too closely associated with one party in a dispute before the Court of Protection,&#8221; and at paragraph [27] he went on to state that:</p>
