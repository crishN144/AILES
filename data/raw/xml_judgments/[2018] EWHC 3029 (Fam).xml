I shall refer to her hereafter as &#8216;the mother&#8217;.  The three children I shall identify as C, aged 16, O, aged 13, and I, aged 11.  They are all boys and they are currently believed to be in Nigeria where they were taken by their parents in 2013.  The father of the children is Levi Egeneonu who I shall refer to as &#8216;Levi&#8217; so as to distinguish him from the second respondent.  At this hearing and by the application before the court, the mother seeks the committal to prison of the second respondent, Mr Victor Egeneonu, who I shall refer to as </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The application was issued on 28 February 2018 and has an unfortunate litigation history, having twice previously been listed for final determination.  When the case was last before the court, before Moor J, on 22 June substantively, it was clear that Victor was making significant admissions in relation to the matters alleged against him.  These admissions were recorded in a document generated on the second day of the hearing before Moor J.  Further explanation and concessions were offered in a statement served on 19 September 2018 but Victor continued to dispute other allegations and it was contemplated by the parties, and by Moor J, that those matters would be tried by me.   </p>

I had, at the request of Victor&#8217;s solicitors, made a production order that Levi should attend this hearing, although in the event he was not called.  I received two large bundles of documents containing <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> statements from the mother, statements of evidence from Victor, statements of evidence from Tribal Chief Umbieri, who has also attended at court, a large volume of exhibits and a number of judgments from judges who have previously dealt with the circumstances of these three children. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The application that is before me has a very, very long history.  It is unnecessary for me to rehearse or reproduce that history at any great length here.  Few family lawyers, observers or commentators in the field of family law will be unaware of the case of Egeneonu because publicly reported judgments concerning this family are multiple and are easily identifiable on Bailii.  I located no less than eight and when they are read together, they give a good flavour of the issues in the case and the dynamics of it.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In short, the mother and Levi were married in Nigeria in 2001 and came to England, where Levi had already been living, in 2002.  The children, C, O and I, were born and grew up in the United Kingdom.  On 16 July 2013, the entire family left London to travel to Nigeria.  The mother contends before the court that this was a planned holiday and that she never intended to move back to Nigeria permanently.  She further contends that whilst in Nigeria, Levi told her that they would not be returning to the United Kingdom despite her wish to do so.  The mother contends that she lived with her parents in Nigeria to escape what she alleges was Levi&#8217;s abuse, and that the children lived with Levi, his family or his staff.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Levi, as I understand it, disputes substantial portions of this narrative and I make no findings about it.  In short, the mother returned to the United Kingdom from Nigeria without the children, using emergency travel documentation obtained from the British High Commission, on 12 November 2013.  On 22 November 2013, she commenced proceedings in this jurisdiction, applying for the children to be made wards of court and for an order that the children be returned to the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  Levi&#8217;s engagement with those proceedings was sporadic but after he returned to the United Kingdom from Nigeria, a number of hearings followed at which he participated.  Russell J warded the children.  Within those proceedings and over the course of very nearly five years, multiple efforts have been made to secure the return of the children to this jurisdiction.  They have, thus far, all failed. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is, I think, sufficient to record that it is a matter of judicial finding that Levi has control and knowledge of the whereabouts of the children, that Levi has been in repeated breach of court orders for not returning or facilitating the children to the jurisdiction of England and Wales, that he is currently serving an 18-month term of imprisonment in respect of breaches of civil orders &#8211; this is his third period of imprisonment related to these proceedings &#8211; and that the children are believed to be living with a paternal aunt. </p>

This is indeed a matter of judicial finding, see paragraph 87 of the judgment of Cohen J, although perhaps not binding for present purposes as Victor was not represented or present in that litigation.  Victor claims to be Levi&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">son</span> and a half-brother to the subject children.

A number of orders were made against Victor in relation to the production of information and requirements for his cooperation with the return of the children.  It has been, and remains, the mother&#8217;s case that Victor has repeatedly done what he could to assist Levi in defeating the orders of the court so as to keep the children in Nigeria. </p>

I am entirely satisfied that it was done deliberately.  I do not in any way underestimate the potential influence of Levi Egeneonu upon him, but my findings, therefore, are that in relation to that part of the committal, that is to say that Victor Egeneonu had provided a false statement of truth in his sworn testimony and has actively told lies before a Judge of this Division, I am satisfied so that I am sure that that is what he did and I am sure it was done for one purpose.

It did not have that effect and Victor was sentenced to a three-month term of imprisonment which Newton J suspended for a period of 12 months.  I drew attention to this as it serves to remind me that Victor has been in this position of contemnor or alleged contemnor before.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The evidence before the court now relevant to the allegations raised by the mother is largely contained within a number of transcripts of telephone recordings of conversations between Levi and Victor.  It is not necessary for me to determine the admissibility of those recordings.  That has already been determined by Williams J.  Nor is it disputed that the voices heard on the phone recordings are indeed Levi and Victor.  Cohen J, when he considered the allegations against Levi on the committal application relevant to him, carefully considered the reliability of the recordings to the perhaps unprecedented extent of hearing from the translator himself (some of the conversations in the native language of Levi and Victor, namely Ebu) and the Court of Appeal took the view that Cohen J was fully entitled to conclude that they were overall dependable.  The contents of these recordings significantly undermine Victor&#8217;s initial denials that he had been responsible for misleading the court and/or placing false evidence before the court during the course of 2017.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Given the level of acceptance now by Victor of the matters alleged against him, the fact of his silence before the court does not assume the sort of significance it might otherwise have done.  Nonetheless I have reminded myself of the directions given in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Cowan</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] QB 373" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] QB 373</ref> and remind myself that Victor has an absolute right not to give evidence, that the burden of proving the case rests upon the mother and the fact that Victor did not give evidence means that there is no evidence from him which rebuts, contradicts or explains the evidence of the applicant&#8217;s witnesses.  I gave, through Mr Shravat, due warning to Victor of the possible consequences of not giving evidence and the clear risk that I might conclude that the reason he was not willing to give evidence was because he has no answer to the points raised or none that would stand up to cross-examination.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I turn then to deal specifically with the Schedule of Allegations, with the response to that schedule and my conclusions upon the same.  The mother contends first that Victor committed contempt in the face of the court by giving false evidence as to his knowledge of the children&#8217;s whereabouts and his ability to assist in their return to the jurisdiction.  In particular (a) on 11 August 2017, Victor gave the following oral evidence under oath, that Levi telephoned him on 9 August 2017 and, (1) told him that he, Levi, wanted the children to be brought back to England; (2) asked Victor to go on and bring them; (3) asked Victor to telephone Caro Nwanko, sister of Levi and Victor, who the mother believes is currently caring for the children; and (4) asked Victor to telephone Samuel Osuji, the brother of the mother and who Levi says is caring for the children, to tell him that he, Levi, wants the children brought back to the jurisdiction.  It is a matter of record that is what Victor told the court and Victor accepts that the above statements were false.  Pausing there for a moment, given that acceptance, I find the allegation proved.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, that Victor told the court that he does not speak to Caro Nwanko regularly and that in the eight months prior to 11 August he could not remember any calls with her apart from a call he made a week before.  Victor accepts that he spoke to Caro Nwanko on 14 occasions in a 24-week period.  Victor maintains before this court that he did not regard that as &#8216;regular&#8217; contact.  I respectfully disagree.  In my judgment, 14 occasions in a 24-week period approximating to slightly more than once a fortnight, is regular contact.  Furthermore, it is in my judgment impossible to accept that Victor could remember no calls with Caro Nwanko apart from a call he had made the week before, when 13 calls had preceded that call in the preceding six months.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied so that I am sure that Victor materially misled the court in this respect and in the circumstances the allegation made by the mother in this respect is made out.  </p>

Victor tells me now that while he does not know where the children are, he accepts that he believes that Caro Nwanko knows of their comings and goings, and did at that time I </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The evidence on 10 November from Victor was to the effect that he had not written letters purporting to be from the children.  These were letters which I have seen, and which are contained as an exhibit to the fifth affidavit of the mother, at page 437, 438, 439, 440 and 441 of the bundle.  Victor accepts now, contrary to the evidence he gave in November 2017, that he was involved in the process whereby these letters were prepared but he did not write them.  Additionally, he says, in relation to the typed letter, purportedly from child C, the 16year-old, he accepts that Levi dictated the wording of a letter to him and that the dictation was in most part reproduced in that letter.  However, he has no recollection whatsoever of writing down the dictation.  Victor does not dispute that it would be proper for the court to infer from the accepted facts that he, Victor, did in fact make a written note of the dictation.  It is indeed proper for the court to draw that inference; indeed it is, in my judgment, the only proper inference to draw.  It follows that the second respondent, Victor, has, to my satisfaction, materially misled the court in November in that regard.  The mother&#8217;s allegation is, in this respect, duly proved. </p>

Now, at this hearing, some 15 months later, Victor accepts that he was involved in the process of the production of these letters prepared by the children, knowing that the intention of the letters was to mislead the court as to the children&#8217;s wishes and feelings. </p>

Again, Victor accepts that he was involved in the process of the production of that letter.  He accepts that Levi dictated the wording of the letter to him and that the dictation was, in most part, reproduced in the letter.  Victor today tells me, through his counsel, that he has no recollection of taking the dictation but does not dispute that it is proper for the court to infer from the accepted facts that he did make a written note of the dictation.  As I have earlier indicated in a similar regard, it seems to me pellucidly clear that Victor did take down the dictation of the letter, because it appears word for word in the document at page 441 and I reject Victor&#8217;s lapse of memory in this regard and find the allegation that the mother makes in this respect proved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is further said that on or around 23 August, Victor was involved in causing an email address to be set up in the name of the child C, without C&#8217;s knowledge, and for the above mentioned letters to be sent to the court from that address.  He says now that he did not set up an email address in the name of the child C but admits that he spoke to Okey about setting up an email address for C and passed on this request from Levi.  To that extent only, he had involvement in causing an email address to be set up in the name of C and for letters to be sent to the court from that address.  He himself did not send any letters from the court from that address and the mother does not seek to say otherwise.  In that regard, his acceptance in my judgment confirms to the required standard that he was involved in causing an email address to be set up in the name of the child C without C&#8217;s knowledge and the allegation is therefore proved. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is further said that he has committed contempt in the face of the court by causing a false statement from a third party to be produced to the court.  In particular on 25 August he caused a false statement to be typed and signed and caused this false statement to be sent to the court on 26 and 31 August 2017.  This is a statement or letter purporting to be from a friend of the mother&#8217;s, Mrs Ola Ajibola.  It is a letter replete with scandalous allegations implicating the mother and her purported associates.  Victor accepts that he was involved in causing a false statement to be produced to the court in that he accepts that Levi asked him to do these things and he listened and participated in telephone calls with him when he made the requests.  He says that he did not have any involvement in the typing, preparation, (save for the undisputed inference above), or sending of any false statement, although he may have passed on messages from Levi to Okey and Caro in relation to this.  He accepts, therefore, that he was involved in causing false statements to be produced to the court.  In that regard, given his acceptance of the facts, I find the allegation to the required standard proved. </p>

Other matters to which consideration may be given include where the claimant or applicant has been prejudiced by virtue of the contempt, the extent to which the contemnor has acted under pressure, whether the breach of orders was deliberate or unintentional, and the degree of culpability.  I am enjoined to consider whether he appreciates the seriousness of his breach and whether he has subsequently cooperated.  The decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Hale v Tanner</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2000/5570" uk:canonical="[2000] EWCA Civ 5570" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] EWCA Civ 5570</ref> or [2001] 1WLR 2377 is well-known territory in applications of this kind and I specifically have had regard to those passages at paragraphs 24 to 35 of the judgment and the ten matters to which the court should specifically have regard when considering what penalty to impose.

Mr Hepher has first described this case as one of the most serious cases of child abduction in the sense that these three children have been uprooted from their home some five years ago and have been denied any relationship with their mother for a significant part of that time.  Secondly, that Victor has himself already been the subject of a suspended committal order in 2015 and, says Mr Hepher, he therefore knows the seriousness of the situation he is in.  He can have been in no doubt about the view the court took of his actions in 2015 and yet he deliberately, or wilfully, repeated that behaviour in 2017 and early 2018. </p>

Fourthly, that, says Mr Hepher, the behaviour which is under consideration and on which I have now made findings, is both deliberate and repeated.  Fifthly, that the information which he has withheld or misrepresented to the court has been central to the court&#8217;s enquiry about the whereabouts of the children and the securing of their return.  Sixth, that his admissions have been slow to emerge and they have done so only in a piecemeal way.  He is a man who has been reluctant, says Mr Hepher, to face up to his wrongdoing and has wasted considerable court time as a consequence.  Finally, that the breaches are of the greatest seriousness and I should mark my disapproval by the sentence I impose.   </p>

In urging that outcome for his client, Mr Shravat addresses me on a number of mitigating factors as follows.  In relation to the circumstances of the contempts, he submits that Victor has today made what Mr Shravat described as &#8216;real&#8217; admissions and in that way has spared the mother the burden and distress of a trial.  Secondly, that there is in fact no continuing alleged breach, given that his alleged failure to use his best endeavours to return the children to this jurisdiction is no longer pursued.

Mr Shravat draws attention to the fact that at the time that Levi was applying the pressure upon him, Victor, Victor&#8217;s then three-year-old son had been hospitalised with a history of abdominal pain and nausea which would, says Mr Shravat, have been preoccupying and stressful to Victor, and a distraction which may have caused him to have some lapses of recollection of what he had been asked to do and/or lapses in judgment. </p>

I accept Chief Umbieri&#8217;s comment that Victor is a man in his family or community with little influence, but I am driven to the conclusion that an immediate custodial sentence is the only sentence that can be imposed because of the seriousness of the contempts, their repeated nature and the fact that I have before me a man who has been in this very situation before.  He must have realised what he was doing when he materially and gravely misled a judge of the Family Division in the legitimate and serious pursuit of information concerning the whereabouts of these missing children.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The sentences which I propose to impose are as follows.  In relation to the first contempt, that on 11 August Victor gave misleading, false information to the court as set out in paragraphs 1(a)(a)(i) to (iv), there will be a term of imprisonment of three months.  In relation to the second matter, that Victor falsely maintained that he did not speak to Caro Nwanko regularly, that in the eight months prior to 11 August he could not remember any calls with her apart from a call made one week before, I propose to impose a sentence of one month, which will be concurrent with the sentence already passed.   </p>

In relation to 1(b)(vii), that Victor told the court that he has not written letters purporting to be from the children when he accepts that he was involved in that process, there will be a term of imprisonment of three months.  That will be concurrent with the sentence that I imposed in relation to his misleading information about Caro. </p>
