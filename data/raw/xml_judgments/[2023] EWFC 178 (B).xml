CD has a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder (or &#8220;ASD&#8221;) and has an education health and care plan. AB is diagnosed with hypermobility but has no other diagnoses. The mother was diagnosed by an educational psychologist, in November 2021 with having ADHD, ASD, dyslexia and dyspraxia but within these proceedings Dr Lyall, consultant psychiatrist, has cast doubt on the first two of those diagnoses. He takes the view that a formal diagnosis of ASD has not yet been made because the complete diagnostic process, including the use of validated diagnostic instruments such as the autism diagnostic observation schedule, is required. He agrees that the mother manifests a number of possible symptoms of ASD. He does not come to a view that the mother has ADHD but says it is possible she manifests some symptoms of it although he does not think these are particularly severe.</span></p>

The mother made complaints against the foster carers and the Local Authority, and as a result the foster carers gave notice on the placement and the children had to move which, for AB, included a change of schools. The mother felt that this had happened because her concerns were validated. The Local Authority are clear that although one part of her complaint was upheld that did not require the termination of the placement. They say the placement ended because the foster carers felt inundated by the mother&#8217;s complaints and allegations, which resulted on occasion in police visits.

Dr Phibbs, for reasons I have accepted, was unable to give evidence at this hearing and there was no guarantee of when she might be able to give evidence. I have had to consider whether it was possible to conduct a fair trial without her. In her closing submissions the mother has confirmed that she no longer seeks an adjournment on the basis of Dr Phibbs not being available providing I do not rely on her evidence. There is a wealth of other evidence in this case and in fact I have had no difficulty in putting her evidence to one side and reaching my conclusions on other evidence. I have been alive to the question of whether other witnesses had relied on her to come to their conclusions. If they had, that would have made it difficult to rely on their evidence.</span></p>

Those applications were not justified by the evidence of Dr Lyall. On the other hand, in view of her diagnoses and in view of the sensitive nature of some of the allegations she was making, I treated her as a vulnerable witness and considered that FPR 3A and PD3AA were engaged. I ensured that a separate waiting room and screens in court were available to help reduce the stimuli which might make things harder for her in view of her possible diagnosis of ASD, and I agreed that I would take breaks where necessary. I said she could come and go from the court room as necessary when not giving evidence and arranged the screens to make that possible. I also made clear that I would not allow questions which went beyond the scope of what was strictly necessary, and that I would do all I could to minimise any distress, whilst still allowing the other parties to put their cases. In fact, the mother coped very well with the proceedings. I offered her regular breaks but she declined them all and was well able to answer questions and concentrate for substantial periods. I was left wondering why she had asked for further adjustments. They were not, in my view, necessary.</span></p>

Starting with the father&#8217;s allegations against the mother, the most straightforward of his allegations is that on 14 March 2016 the mother was cautioned for harassing him. That, it seems to me, is a matter of record. The PNC record for the mother shows two cautions for harassment, one on 4 October 2005 and one on 12 of March 2016. The 2016 caution states &#8220;pursued a course of conduct which amounted to harassment between the 1 January 2016 to 6 March 2016&#8221;. A number of aggressive and threatening text messages are attached to the father&#8217;s police statement and on 28 February 2016, when the father reported the matter again, the police report states that whilst the father was in the police front office mother sent a text saying &#8220;the more you don&#8217;t listen to me the more I&#8217;m gonna fuck you over you won&#8217;t have a penny left when I&#8217;m finished&#8221;. The police note that there are lots of other text messages mother has sent the father including claiming to have a private investigator following him and watching all his moves and who he&#8217;s with. On 1 March 2016 the police record that they received 10 screenshots from the father including messages saying &#8220;Ur not seeing ur kids again because of ur bad behaviour. Its all ur fault!&#8221;, &#8220;wotless nigga shit father&#8221; and &#8220;If you don&#8217;t unblock me U won&#8217;t know if Ur address is on my Whatsapp LOOOL!&#8221;.</span></p>

In evidence she tried to persuade me that the texts saying &#8220;Wotless nigga shit father&#8221; would not be seen as insulting in her south London community of people of colour. She said concerning the &#8220;N&#8221; word that because she was of colour she could use that word although a white person could not. She said a white person could never understand that it was not offensive in her community. I have asked myself, as a white person, whether that might be right. I do accept that the &#8220;N&#8221; word has a different resonance when used by a person of colour. But the &#8220;N&#8221; word is only one element of the text message. I take &#8220;wotless&#8221; to mean worthless and that is plainly an insult. &#8220;Shit father&#8221; likewise. Sending the message repeatedly is angry and aggressive.

Whilst the father was reporting this, the police officer recorded that the father received a phone call from his mother stating that she had been receiving repeated phone calls and text messages. The officer spoke to the paternal grandmother who told him that she had received a message from the mother saying that if the father did not move home with her soon she would stop the grandmother from seeing the children. The police officer noted that this threat correlated with the texts the father had claimed to receive. At that point a five year check on the police computer showed that the father had been a victim of malicious communications from the mother on four occasions since 2012 and that the grandmother had been a victim of malicious communications from the mother on two occasions since 2011. It is recorded that the mother received a warning from the police in connection with these communications in 2011.</p>

A police caution is a serious matter. It is based on the acceptance of guilt for the offence alleged and it goes on a person&#8217;s criminal record. In the mother&#8217;s case this would have been a first offence and the first time she had had a criminal record. For most people that would be a watershed moment and something they would remember. I consider it more likely than not that the mother did engage in the conduct which is alleged for the following reasons. First, her responses were unconvincing; I did not believe her when she said she did not remember being cautioned. Second, two independent police officers witnessed some of the texts and some of the calls. I accept the calls were from a private number but given that the mother was sending offensive texts at the time (as seen by the police officer) it is more likely than not that it was the mother who was making the phone calls and sending the texts. Third, it is conduct similar in nature to the conduct for which the mother received a caution in 2005 and a warning in 2011. Fourth, the allegations made by the father and the paternal grandmother were made consistently and persistently over many years despite the police failing to manage to make the mother stop. It is hard to see why in those circumstances the father and grandmother would continue to make those allegations unless they were true since the reporting did not seem to get them anywhere. And fifth I have already made a finding of similar conduct by the mother in 2016. It seems to me that the facts are so similar that I am entitled to take that into account. I therefore make the following finding: that </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">from 2011 to 2016 mother from time to time harassed the father and the paternal grandmother  with numerous unwanted phone calls and</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">messages</span><span style="font-size:12pt">.</span></p>

On behalf of the father it is said, that in the context of an investigation into the publication of naked photos of the father, this line in the police evidence substantiates the allegation of revenge porn. I do not agree. I accept that at the time the offence of revenge porn did not exist so the officer could not have said the evidence would support that charge. It is unfortunate that the police record does not describe the content of the evidence which would, in the view of the police, substantiate the charge but the charge in question is harassment/malicious comms. It is quite right that the evidence may have been evidence that the mother had been sharing naked photos of the father, but the police evidence simply does not make this clear. It seems to me that on the basis of this evidence I would be entitled to make a further finding in relation to harassment or malicious communications, but I do not think that would add anything to the findings I have already made. In the absence of police evidence to the effect that the content of the handset contained evidence of naked photos, I find the allegation of revenge porn unproven. I cannot therefore make a finding on it.</p>

It should have said there were toys in the garden, and that was not connected to the hammer. I pause to note that this is the mother&#8217;s statement, which was prepared on her instructions, and which she read and signed and which she confirmed at the start of her evidence to be true. She was now saying it was a mistake by the person who drafted the statement. In any event, the mother was quite unable to answer the question of why she mentioned her son&#8217;s garden toys at that point in her statement if they were not connected to the hammer and she provided no coherent answer. CD was only a few months old at the time of this incident. She said he had a swing in the garden and that is what she had been referring to. I can see no reason why she would suddenly refer to CD&#8217;s swing in the middle of a paragraph about hammer damage to a car. It is entirely irrelevant. I do not accept that &#8220;toy tools&#8221; was a typo, and it seems to me that the mother <span style="font-style:italic">was </span>seeking in her statement to introduce some confusion by suggesting that it might have been a toy hammer. It is clear that a toy hammer has nothing to do with this incident as the police record at a later point refers to them recovering a clawhammer from the garden.

She said he made the threat during a telephone call when he had rung her to complain about having to pay child maintenance, saying having the kids had ruined his life.

That does not seem to be seriously challenged by the mother. This is not a man who tries to get out of paying maintenance for his children. Nor is there any other evidence of him being resentful of it. In his oral evidence he says he would never make threats against his children. There is no suggestion elsewhere in the evidence that he has ever done so, other than this one allegation by the mother. What there is, in the evidence, is a great deal of information about the father&#8217;s love and commitment to his children. I shall deal in more detail with that in the welfare section of the judgment but in short, the evidence is that since being reintroduced to the children the father has bonded with them in an extraordinarily quick way which has surprised the professionals (in a good way), and that he has never missed a session of contact despite travelling three and a half hours each way once a week. He has never been late, never turned up unprepared. His commitment and dedication to his children is shown not only in that, but in paying child maintenance for 4 years when he did not see them or even know where they were. Furthermore it is clear that he is a mild mannered man, not generally prone to fits of anger. When he has been angry he admits it, as for example when he admitted that he might have threatened to punch the mother in the face during an argument. It seems to me that if he had made this threat to kill and chop up his children and the mother he would have admitted that too.

I take that to mean false allegations, knowingly and maliciously made. I have found the following allegations not proved: the allegation of rape, the allegation of physical abuse in January 2014, the allegation of threats to kill and chop up the mother and children, allegations of verbal abuse and threats of physical violence between 2009 and 2015 and the allegation of coercive control. In relation to all of these except coercive control, they are prima facie allegations which the mother must have known were untrue at the time when she</span></p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.12in">made them, because of the nature of the allegation in each case. For example, the mother must have known that she was not raped when she made the allegation of rape. Coercive control is more nuanced, because it depends on a judgement about the nature of a relationship and people may see that relationship differently. However in this case I have found that if anything the power balance was the other way round. In circumstances where the mother sent extraordinarily abusive messages to the father to the point where she was cautioned for it, and where she did not give him a house key, and (as I shall come on to) did not allow him to see the children it must have been obvious that this was not a relationship of coercive control even to the mother. I therefore conclude that that allegation too was made in the knowledge that it was not true.</p>

The mother&#8217;s allegation of rape was made three days after she was interviewed about another complaint by the father of harassment. The nature and timing of her harassing messages is also testament to her tendency to have an angry reaction when things do not go her way. An example is her text to the grandmother saying &#8220;I just want to confirm that you and you son will not be seeing my kids ever again. Your son keeps running to the police with his pathetic complaints which get him nowhere&#8221;.

The first finding sought in Schedule A is an overarching finding that Mother has led each of the children to believe that they are less capable than they are, causing harm to the children&#8217;s emotional and social development. It is also said that the Mother seeks to protect the children to an excessive degree, rather than encouraging the children to reach their full physical, social and educational potential.</span></p>

LM provided a statement in which he flagged up his concerns, and he also gave oral evidence. In his oral evidence he explained that the school had a significant specialist provision for children with autism. About 30 children attended it, many of whom had significantly higher levels of disability than CD. Some were non-verbal, having major emotional dysregulation incidents several times a day. CD was placed in Orchard but had some time out of that class in the mainstream provision each week. LM described CD as a chatty, verbal, lovely little boy. He said he needed to be around peers who could interact, play and speak with him. He said CD needed to interact and play using language. He said CD loved being in the mainstream class and when it was on his schedule he looked forward to it. LM, and indeed the school, was clear his educational needs would have been better met in the mainstream. His academic level was on track for maths and only a little behind in writing and reading.</span></p>

In oral evidence he said he had written that based on a conversation with the mother. He could not recall seeing any paperwork saying she had special educational needs. But as he got to know AB he came to the view that she did not have any special educational needs, and indeed was one of the brightest in her cohort, meeting expectations. The school had no concerns about AB having autism or autistic traits, and I remind myself that it is a school with a sizeable autism resource, with all staff trained every year in managing children with autism and dealing with autism regularly in their mainstream classes. It was against that background that LM gave evidence that the mother had informed the school she was applying for an EHCP for AB. The school did not think that was necessary.</span></p>

I must also take into account the statement from W School, the school which AB attended before B Primary School.

LM gave evidence that children were expected to be at that sort of level at the start of the year, when their level would often be described as &#8220;emerging&#8221;, moving to &#8220;developing&#8221; by the middle of the year, and then &#8220;securing&#8221; by the end of the year. It was put to the mother that CD was not really behind, he was just where he would be expected to be at the start of the year. The mother did not engage with this point directly, instead asking to know what CD&#8217;s levels were by the end of the year. It was pointed out to her that by then she had removed him from the school, so that could not be known. At no point did the mother engage with the wider points made by LM, about CD&#8217;s need to be with children who were verbal, and who could play with him at his own level and stimulate him socially. The mother said she did not object to CD spending some limited time in the mainstream class, but what she had objected to was LM&#8217;s plan to move him into the mainstream completely. I am satisfied that LM had made it clear that what he proposed was a gradual transition. The mother did not find that acceptable.</span></p>

The main thing which she wished to prevent, namely mainstream schooling, was not prevented, and a school with a specialist autism unit was lost. It is difficult to see what she achieved by moving CD at that time other than a shorter walk to school, which is what she said in her oral evidence was the advantage. In neither her oral nor her written evidence did she discuss the loss to the children of experiencing another school move, of losing friends, of having to start all over again, of being unsettled.</span></p>

She thought of the badges as supportive, because if, on that journey, they needed a little more time or space than would ordinarily be expected, people would be able to see that there was a reason to be patient. If the mother is right about that then I can see that there might be some merit in the badges. She said that she never used the badges, or indeed the special needs buggy, once the family moved nearer to the school and were provided with a taxi.

It was her routine, which she did unthinkingly, to clip the badges on and off each day. I find that rather extraordinary, in the context of a three metre journey. They clearly were not needed on such a short journey and the children would have been seen by staff and pupils in those three metres just as much as within school. It makes no sense to me that she would pin the badges on and off for that short journey, nor that she would not worry about the impact on the children for the first three meters and worry about the impact on them after that.

Either CD would get into it and be pushed into school, or the mother would put him on reins. Clearly the mother and LM cannot both be right. I find it unlikely that a head teacher would mis-remember something so graphic, something which he had seen frequently and something which troubled him so much that he wrote about it in his statement. I note that there is a wider concern that the mother was using a buggy which was not needed. It is not in dispute that the mother brought CD in a buggy when coming from another London Borough. LM&#8217;s evidence is that the school did not believe he needed a buggy at all. He was around 6 years old at this time. He was able to access local school trips on foot with all the other children with no difficulty. He ran around the playground quite happily. The Deputy Head and the Deputy Designated Safeguarding Lead from F school say in their statement &#8220;EF believes the children require resources to support their needs which the school believes are not needed, such as a wheelchair to support CD&#8221;. There has been confusion about the terminology of wheelchair and buggy. No witness has said they saw the mother using a wheelchair. The mother clarified that the McLaren Major buggy has a full name of &#8220;wheelchair buggy&#8221;. I take the F school reference to the wheelchair in the paragraph I have just quoted to be a reference to the wheelchair buggy. Again, their evidence resonates with that of LM.</span></p>

It gave CD a low score for balance and aiming and catching. He was found to have motor difficulties, fatigue and significantly reduced balance and a referral to a paediatrician was recommended. In the meantime he was given an updated exercise programme. There is no mention of pain or of the need to use a wheelchair. When it was put to the mother that the current foster carer describes CD as enjoying running and jumping and going on his scooter and playing ballgames, and not mentioning any pain, the mother said that did not mean CD was not getting pain.

In my view, if children are in pain, it will show when they run, jump, scoot and play ball games. They will either mention it, or simply be unwilling to engage in the painful activity. Information from the foster carers suggests the opposite of that: they say the children are keen to go to the park, and to play in the ways I have described. It seems to me that a much more natural explanation is that they are not in pain, but are enjoying themselves. I am mindful of the mother&#8217;s point that the buggy was allocated to CD by a hospital who must have thought he needed it. But it is striking that the mother gives such weight to that, and so little weight to the evidence of multiple other professionals who spend 30 hours a week with CD and the evidence of her own eyes.</span></p>

It may well be that at some stage CD did tell the mother that he had pains in his legs: but even if he did, it is equally clear that the mother has allowed that idea to take root in her mind, to the exclusion of the other evidence around her of CD running around in the playground, going on school trips without difficulty and playing energetically in foster care.</span></p>

I have already said I think it unlikely LM was mistaken about that. Given the mother&#8217;s preoccupation with what she perceived as CD&#8217;s needs, I think it is not unlikely that she would put him in his buggy for that last short leg of his journey. I therefore prefer LM&#8217;s evidence to the mother&#8217;s evidence and I find that she did put CD either into his wheelchair buggy, or on reins, when she emerged from the taxi outside school. It is the mother&#8217;s evidence that the taxi was always further than 3 metres from the school gate. If that is so then it is even more likely that she put him in his buggy. I find, in view of the school&#8217;s evidence about his physical abilities, that it was unnecessary for her to do so. In those circumstances it cannot </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">but </span><span style="font-size:12pt">have had an impact on CD, either making him embarrassed or making him feel that he was less able than he was.

She has told me, and I accept, that she has only ever done what she thought was in her children&#8217;s best interests. LM was very clear that the badges were worn when the children got out of the taxi. Again I prefer his evidence. It seems likely to me that the mother, having got into the habit of the badges on the journey from the other London Borough, saw no reason to discontinue their use. Whilst they may, possibly, have been helpful on the longer journey, their continued use was not necessary once the family were travelling by taxi. The badges were big enough for staff to see and read. Other children would have seen them too. The impact of the badges would have been to focus the children on what CD and AB couldn&#8217;t do, rather than on all the things they could do. At that point, I agree with the Local Authority that the badges had become negative things, which were unhelpful to the children. LM described their use as &#8220;excessive&#8221;. I agree.</span></p>

I have heard a lot of evidence about the mother&#8217;s persistent requests to have a full autism assessment for AB. I am invited to criticise the mother for asking again and again for an assessment even when she knew CAMHS had said they would not assess her until proceedings were concluded. In fact, I do not criticise the mother for this. I can see that to the Local Authority this must have appeared as part of a wider problem, but in each case the mother was following up recommendations from professionals saying an assessment should or could be done. This was against a background of her, her son and her older daughter all having ASD.</span></p>

Likewise it is common ground that she asked the school for a lift pass for AB to help with the pains in her legs at a time when AB was not complaining to anybody else that she had pains in her legs and was seen to be mobile and comfortable by staff. Likewise she seemed determined to apply for an EHCP for AB when the school felt she did not need one. Likewise she told LM that AB had special educational needs when AB first started at his school, and it later became clear to him that she did not. Likewise she prevented AB going on the school trip because of alleged &#8220;meltdowns&#8221; which nobody else has ever seen, including the two sets of foster carers with whom AB has lived since being taken into foster care. Likewise she sought ear defenders, fidget toys and putty for AB which AB did not want or need. It is noted in the statement of the initial social worker, that in 2022 the mother listed AB as having memory issues, a lack of focus and motivation and social communication issues. She said the whole family had been diagnosed with some form of disability and so she was going back to CAMHS to request a reassessment for AB. The social worker records that whilst the mother was reporting all of this she observed AB in the background first rolling her eyes then becoming visibly tearful and shrinking within herself until she was lying down on the sofa. The social worker felt that her appearance seems to be one of a child with possible anxiety or low mood. That conversation was followed swiftly by the mother requesting that AB have an EHCP. At that time AB was performing at school at the expected level</span></p>

She also said she got pains in her legs which she thought was a result of her hypermobility. This is contrasted against the evidence of the current social worker that AB is excelling at school, is in the top set for all subjects, has raised no concerns to her foster carers about joint pain, and now in her current placement goes bike riding, goes trampolining, walks in the park, goes swimming and goes to the beach. It was put to the mother that she had coached AB to say what she said to the GP. The mother denied this saying that although she was in the room at the time she was at the back and AB was talking to the GP on her own. I see this in a much more concerning light. It is notable that AB has only made these complaints when she is in her mother&#8217;s presence. It seems to me more likely than not that AB knows very well what her mother thinks and feels and wants her to say, and feels obliged to say it. She does not say it when her mother is not there.</span></p>

The impact on the children is in some cases obvious, for example when AB was denied the opportunity to go on the school trip or when she shrank down onto the sofa. The impact in some other cases can be inferred, as for example the impact of being required to use a buggy which was not needed or to wear a disability badge in front of the other children. The social workers and the Guardian consider that that would have caused the children to have lower self-esteem than they would otherwise have had and to believe themselves less capable than they really were.

However the mother&#8217;s first statement in the care proceedings confirmed that the mother chose to remove the children from W primary school because she did not like the way the staff treated the children, and it is clear from both the mother&#8217;s and LM&#8217;s oral evidence that the move from B Primary school to F Primary School was in large part to do with a disagreement about the children&#8217;s abilities.

I have some concerns about the evidence of this teaching assistant. The tone of the text messages indicates a close friendship between her and the mother, much more than a professional relationship. That is borne out by the fact that the same teaching assistant was put forward at one stage as a possible carer for the children, and a connected persons assessment was at one stage contemplated. Nevertheless, her text messages on 12 September 2022 are evidence that she saw something which might be described as a meltdown and I have no reason to think she would make that up.</span></p>

She says that the school was trying to build CD&#8217;s independence and resilience as he was very reliant on adults and he believed he needed 1:1 support at all times. There is no mention from the Deputy Head Teacher of any meltdowns or any other behavioural issues from CD. The school attendance record does not support the mother&#8217;s claim that she had to come and collect him regularly because of meltdowns, nor that at times he could not be got into the building.

She feels justified in having taken that course of action because the GP letter resulted in CD being given 15 hours per week of home tuition. I find myself unpersuaded by this justification. The mother&#8217;s medical notes record the mother as saying to the GP that she would go to a private GP to get the sick note, and it is recorded that the GP explained to her that this would not be appropriate as they do not have the full background information. I agree with the GP&#8217;s advice. The private GP would not have had any previous knowledge of CD or the mother, nor did they have his medical notes. There is no mention in the private GP&#8217;s letter that they have any knowledge of the Local Authority&#8217;s involvement or concerns. They would have been entirely reliant on the mother&#8217;s and CD&#8217;s self-reporting. The mother, I have already found, persistently over-stated CD&#8217;s needs.

It is not in issue that CD was home schooled from January 2019 until September 2019 and from February 2020 until September 2020, a total of just under a year and a half (including summer holidays) without a school. There is evidence by way of photographs to show that the mother took the children out on activities from time to time, but I am not clear how the mother provided regular, ongoing peer relationships for the children. In that regard the children may well have felt somewhat isolated during their periods of home schooling. The concern about isolation was shared by the Local Authority who noted at a child protection plan review meeting in early 2021 that the children did not have many long term relationships with adults except their mother and older sister and the changes to their school placements had reduced this further. There was thus a limited number of adults in their life who they might be able to speak to if they had worries. Although I consider there is some evidence to support the assertion that the children were isolated from their peers, I do not consider it contains enough details or specific examples to enable me to make a separate finding on it.</span></p>

The solicitor&#8217;s correspondence shows the mother throwing repeated obstacles in the way of contact. It is no wonder the father gave up via that route. His commitment is evidenced by his continuing CMS payments throughout the time he was not seeing the children. Initially, when contact was offered to him he took it up. The contact stopped, it appears, because the mother moved house and did not tell him where she had moved to. The father took time to save enough money to go to a solicitor to seek contact, but he did then go. When negotiations through solicitors failed he issued private law proceedings. When contact was re-started through the care proceedings he was committed and reliable. It is plain from his course of conduct that he would have wished contact with the children if he could have made it happen.</span></p>

But historically she has made no secret of the fact that she has been very against contact. In both her first and second statements in the public law proceedings she says she does not agree with any direct contact taking place at all. She says the children have expressed that they do not want to have contact with the father and that AB has been especially vocal about this matter. She says that the father has been sexually, emotionally and verbally abusive towards her throughout their entire relationship and that he had also been emotionally and verbally abusive towards the children as he had made threats to kill them. I have already found those allegations to be not only untrue but to be malicious.</span></p>

In the ensuing weeks the mother gave a number of reasons why the children could not come &#8211; they did not want to, it was too far, they were too tired, the mother has college, the children will be hungry and so on. On 5 October 2022 DJ Barrie noted that the mother had breached the order and said further breaches would result in a penal notice. On 25 November 2022 DJ Cassidy noted that the mother had failed to take the children to contact on a sequence of 5 dates in September, October and November 2022.

For the first two sessions, the social worker brought the children. They were initially shy, but the father won them round and they had good contact &#8211; described in the notes as &#8220;delightful&#8221;. Between the second and third sessions of contact a Child Protection Conference review took place at which it was stated that AB was becoming more comfortable with her father. At the third session of contact, the children were brought to the contact centre by their mother. The children had given the father a list of foods they wanted him to bring and he brought them all. He had also prepared a quiz, with prizes in a bag, the children being invited to dip their hand in for a prize when they answered a quiz question correctly. The children simply did not want to engage and the contact was difficult, in a way that the first two had not been. The father felt that the children had been coached by their mother to behave in this way. The former social worker who attended the contacts described the difference between the second and third contacts as being stark. Social workers were of the opinion that the mother had disliked hearing that AB was becoming more comfortable with her father and had made it plain to the children how they must behave. The mother denied this, and said that AB had wanted to go out with school friends and missing out on that had caused her to be disengaged. When AB was asked about her behaviour at the third contact, she said that her father had not been there for her and he did not care about her or her brother.</span></p>

	      <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.1in">explanation was not supported by AB, who gave a different reason. Third, AB&#8217;s reason is itself troubling. The criticisms she makes about her father not being there for her and not caring about her are long-term matters. They would have troubled her at the first two sessions of contact if they were concerns genuinely held by her. She had been enjoying her time with her father without worrying about him having been absent or not caring about her. It is, to my mind, inescapable that the only reason she would suddenly be put out about these matters at the third session when she had not been put out about them at the first two is if somebody put them in her mind. The only person with a reason to do so was the mother. Fourth, since the children have been in foster care and have been having contact regularly their relationship with their father has taken off in a way that surprised and delighted professionals, the father and the children alike. The Guardian says that CD speaks about his dad with joy and pride, and AB says seeing him is the best part of her week. She described AB as rising out of her chair in happiness when talking recently about her time with her father. These are the emotions which the children exhibit when they are free. The implication seems to be that at that third session of contact, they were not free. Looking at the evidence in its totality I am in no doubt that the children behaved as they did at that third session of contact because of things said to them, or pressure brought to bear on them, by the mother.

The mother denies this allegation. She says she did not speak to the children about their father as he had chosen not to make contact with them. I have already found that that is not true. She says she was supportive in re- building the relationship between the children and their father. I have already found that not to be true. She refers to a letter from her psychotherapist to substantiate her claim that she has been supportive of the re-introduction of contact. The letter says that the mother has used therapy to help her positively encourage her children to engage with contact, and that she did this by scheduling her therapy sessions to be at the same time as contact, to ensure that the children do not overhear. I do not consider that that was at all a helpful step. The outcome of it was that the mother undertook her telephone therapy in the contact centre, the centre having provided her with a private room for it. On 5 October 2022 DJ Barrie had stated in a recital to her order that &#8220;The court expects the mother to comply with all contact arrangements including that she leave the contact centre during the children&#8217;s contact&#8221;. The arrangement the mother made with her psychotherapist contravened that expectation.

The mother had also told her the father had been accused of rape, sexual abuse of minors and sharing indecent images of minors, and that she was terrified of exposing her children to this and was deeply concerned for their safety and welfare should they continue to have contact with them. It strikes me that this is a curious document for the mother to rely on in support of her contention that she was supportive of contact when in fact, it focuses much more on all the reasons why she would be obstructive to it. Be that as it may, the letter is concerning for other reasons. The mother has clearly told her therapist that the father has a history of violence. He does not. It is true that he was accused of rape, but the accusation came from the mother and I have found that to be an untrue and malicious accusation. He was accused of sexual abuse of minors and sharing indecent images, but those matters were not taken forward by the police and there is a concern on the part of professionals that those allegations too might have been malicious allegations made by the mother. What is clear from this letter is not that the mother was supportive of contact but that she was ferociously continuing her campaign against the father and acting in breach of a court expectation.

The former social worker in her statement describes the children&#8217;s reluctance to see a video of their father prior to being reintroduced, and quotes AB as saying her mother had not informed them of it, and CD as saying that his father had been out of his life for a long time and he did not want to speak about it. When, three days later, they were shown the video they expressed joy at seeing their father. The former social worker relies on this to support her view that the mother has been alienating the children from their father. I tend to agree. There is a clear sense of a narrative that they have had to follow which breaks down when confronted with the reality of their father. It is difficult to see where their negativity could come from, if not the mother. And given the strength of the mother&#8217;s negative feelings about the father, as seen in the psychotherapist&#8217;s letter, it is difficult to imagine that she would be able to hide that negativity from the children. I have already made findings about her negative influence in relation to the children&#8217;s third contact. Taking the evidence as a whole, I make the following finding: that </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">the</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">mother has inappropriately influenced the children to think negatively about their father</span><span style="font-size:12pt">. I do not make the remainder of the finding which would have been that it resulted in the children not wishing to have a relationship with him. Thankfully, that has not been the result. For the avoidance of doubt I have taken into account the work the mother did with the social worker to help her talk to the children about the father. That the work took place is a further indication that a problem existed. There does not seem to me to be any evidence that the work achieved the desired result.</span></p>

She spoke to the social worker about some of her worries and there is no appearance of reluctance. Even more striking is the session on 22 September 2021 when AB became tearful talking about her mother&#8217;s treatment of her and how she feels less well treated than CD. She expressed her frustrations about having to keep watch over CD and her worry that she would never have a good relationship with her mum.

She expressed concern about being socially restricted, and at the end expressed gratitude to the social worker for the opportunity to &#8220;open up&#8221;.

She said that when the children attended their solicitor&#8217;s office with the mother in August 2022 the mother said that AB wished to instruct her own solicitor. AB stated that she had been studying the law in the holidays and had read about Child Arrangements Orders and Barring Orders. She was asking to instruct a solicitor that the Child Arrangements Order allowing contact with her father be overturned and a barring order put in place to prevent the father applying for a further order. In view of what I have found the children&#8217;s true view of contact to be, and indeed the mother&#8217;s true view of contact, I consider this far more likely than not to have been the mother&#8217;s wish rather than AB&#8217;s and in my view this is clear evidence of coaching.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.1in;text-indent:0.12in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In her case analysis dated 28 February 2023, only a few days before the children were taken into foster care, the Guardian said that in her fifteen years in social work AB and CD were among the most coached children she had worked with. She gives the following examples: that both children say they don&#8217;t want to see their older sister JK (with whom they previously had a good relationship) but cannot give adequate reasons for this. AB has stated that JK has said bad things about her mum and she is the one who started everything. The Guardian says, and I agree, that that is a narrative that could only have come from the mother. In oral evidence the Guardian continued to express in strong terms the difficulty she had had in obtaining any information from the children which she felt was true and reliable. She said that AB had an ability to express her views clearly but there was a lack of energy or urgency about it. It did not feel like the many conversations she has had with children who are desperate to get back to a parent. It felt like the request to go home and live with the mother or failing that another family member was something AB felt she had to say but she couldn&#8217;t explain why she said it. When she talked about her mother being a good mother she spoke about her mother buying her things and cooking her meals, but never spoke about emotion, care or love. In early visits to her in foster care she was &#8220;incredibly coached&#8221;, but even on the most recent visit she was still influenced, but to a lesser extent. She was still talking about sending letters to the judge, or meeting the judge to &#8220;make sure&#8221; nothing was left out or misinterpreted. That, to the Guardian, felt like earlier conversations in which AB had expressed disbelief that her views were being properly conveyed. AB had not spoken to the Guardian with any passion or energy. It was lacklustre. The Guardian felt AB was not really trying to convince her. She contrasted that with the moment when she rose out of her chair in happiness talking about her father. That had felt like a real honest moment when she was speaking from her heart and she could see AB was experiencing happiness.</span></p>

He couldn&#8217;t explain why he wanted to live with his mother. His secondary plan was to live with the paternal grandmother. That was the mother&#8217;s position at the time, but it made no sense for it to be CD&#8217;s secondary position, rather than living with his father. CD showed no emotion on having this conversation. He also had expressed emotional warmth only when talking about his father. The Guardian said that was a genuine moment, and she was unused to it as she usually had to interpret what the children said. These observations appear to me to be evidence-based, and are made by an extremely experienced and competent professional working within her area of expertise. I give them a great deal of weight.</span></p>

She insists that the views of the children are their own views and she has not sought to put any pressure on them. I would perhaps be able to place more weight on these assertions if the mother had not also asserted that she supported contact, that she did not influence the children against their father and that she did not prevent the children seeing social workers alone. I cannot say whether she gave the children scripts, or told them off if they said the wrong thing or simply made it plain by her own behaviour what it was they must say, but the balance of the evidence comes clearly down on the side of the mother having coached the children. It is clear from the evidence of the Guardian that they are only now, some six months on from living in the mother&#8217;s care, beginning to be able to find their own voices. There is also evidence in the contact notes of the mother whispering to the children in contact despite being told not to and saying to them. &#8220;They are trying to isolate you and stop me from gathering evidence against them&#8221;. The mother denies doing this but the contact note is clear. The current social worker  gave oral evidence that when she had supervised the mother&#8217;s contact with the children the contacts had been very hard to manage. She said that there were times the mother would run out of the contact room and huddle at the back of the garden with the children and there would be a lot of whispering. There were clearly things the mother wanted to say to the children that she did not want social workers to hear. </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">I find that the mother has coached and pressured the children to put forward her views as</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">their own.

The first finding sought is this: If the mother disagrees with a professional&#8217;s opinion or recommendation or finds her views challenged, she pursues a course of conduct which includes making complaints, allegations and referrals to professional bodies or outside agencies. These complaints are unfounded and hinder the ability of the professionals to work with the mother and the children. I propose to consider this overarching allegation by looking at the examples cited by the Local Authority.</span></p>

The message says this: &#8220;How would you feel if this happened to your daughter [named] and grandchild??&#8221;. So far it is not threatening, in my view. But it goes on to say &#8220;Mind no one don&#8217;t lie to social services about your daughter, you wouldn&#8217;t want all of this happening to her!&#8221; The mother denies that this message was intended to be threatening. She says the question was simply how she would feel if she was in the same position as the mother, and says she was trying to appeal to the manager&#8217;s sympathy. That argument in my view holds some weight as far as the first part of the message is concerned but it does not adequately address the injunction &#8220;Mind no one don&#8217;t lie to social services about your daughter&#8221;. It is hard to read this as anything other than a threat to make false allegations. Making false allegations is something the mother has done numerous times and it was not, in my view, an empty threat. I am not satisfied by the mother&#8217;s explanation on this point and I find that </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">on 15 March 2023</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">the mother sent a message to the social work team manager, threatening to make</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">false allegations about the team manager&#8217;s daughter and grandchild.</span></p>

The children moved into foster care on 2 March 2023. On the same day the police were called out to conduct a wellbeing check. The police were satisfied and took no further action. The mother says the phone call to the police was not made by her and suspects AB made the phone call. I consider this most unlikely &#8211; that a child who had been taken from her home and moved to another part of the country would phone the police to conduct a welfare check in circumstances where they would inevitably find no welfare concerns stretches credulity. The child would have other things to think about rather than making vexatious calls to the police. In view of the mother&#8217;s general course of conduct, which I shall set out below, I consider it more likely than not that the mother made that phone call and called the police to the foster carer&#8217;s home on the first day the children were there.</span></p>

The mother says this is not a complaint but a concern. I think that is a distinction without a difference. The complaints were investigated and it was found that the foster carer had left CD in the car while she ran across the road to take AB to the bus stop, with CD in sight the whole time. She had also once left CD at home alone whilst taking AB to the bus stop. The matter was addressed with the foster carer and was described as a &#8220;learning point&#8221; for her, but was not a reason to terminate the placement.

The Local Authority asserts that it was the mother who sent that complaint. She denies it, saying &#8220;AB may have seen the details of this organisation when using my laptop&#8221;. That seems to me exceptionally unlikely. AB had been separated from her mother, and her mother&#8217;s laptop, for nearly four weeks by the time the email was sent. It is absurd to think that she may have written down the name of the website while still living at home in case she was ever removed and ever needed to complain, and then waited four weeks before doing so. Based on the mother&#8217;s pattern of behaviour and the similarity of the complaint to the mother&#8217;s other complaints I consider it more likely than not that the mother made this complaint in AB&#8217;s name.</span></p>

The mother denies that this email had anything to do with her. However there are other emails purporting to be from AB, for example an email sent on 18 May 2023 to Helping Hand in which the author gives &#8220;my mum&#8217;s phone number&#8221;; and then in a follow-up email the next day said &#8220;my number is still the same&#8221;. It was put to the mother by counsel for the children that she had written both emails and had slipped up by referring in the second email to the phone number as &#8220;my number&#8221;. The mother denied it, saying that was hearsay and there was no evidence. But it seems to me that those two emails are themselves evidence. I agree with the case put on behalf of the children that by far the most likely explanation is that the mother wrote those emails and did indeed &#8220;slip up&#8221;. It seems to me that writing emails in the name of AB was something the mother did on a number of occasions. Going back to the complaint to the Ombudsman, it seems unlikely that a child would know that such a person existed, nor that she would reach out to such a person, nor that she would ask for the &#8220;discharge of the care order&#8221;. These are actions much more indicative of an adult mentality. In view of the mother&#8217;s propensity to impersonate AB by email I am satisfied it is more likely than not that the mother wrote to the Ombudsman on 29 March 2023 in AB&#8217;s name, and I do not accept her denial.</span></p>

It is their case that the mother was unable to see that the effect of her actions was detrimental to the children, causing them to be questioned over and over by professionals, and causing the distress and anxiety of having to start again with new foster carers. It is the mother&#8217;s case that either she did not make the calls or send the emails or, in the cases where she did, it was justified.</span></p>

That could have been dealt with by phoning the social worker rather than ringing the police. In other cases, her complaints seem to me to have no foundation and it is unclear to me why she made the calls. My findings then are these:</span></p>

The second matter is the oral evidence of both the social worker and the Guardian that the demeanour of the children has changed since all the secret phones have been removed and there has been no unauthorised and unsupervised contact. They both say that the children have changed, they have relaxed, they have become for the first time able to articulate views which appear to be their own rather than the views of their mother. I have already set out the Guardian&#8217;s views about her final visit, and having the unusual experience at last of hearing wishes and feelings which appeared genuine.

The mother&#8217;s denials, it seems to me, are weak in the face of her past insistence on the children having phones and the use she made of the phones when the children had them in foster care. I consider it was very much in her interests for the children to have those phones. Taking the evidence all together it seems to me that it does amount to more than mere suspicion. There are just too many pieces of evidence, all pointing at the mother and none of them pointing in any other way.

In her oral evidence she said she had never worked on a case with the number of complaints there were in this case. She had found it completely overwhelming and made her work absolutely impossible from the time the children moved into foster care up to the time when the phones were finally removed from the children. She said she did not believe there was a single visit made either by her or by the social worker to the children where they had not had to explore complaints with the children. The bulk of their work with the children had been on investigating allegations rather than focussing on work to help them understand why they were in foster care, exploring their feelings, taking them on positive activities. None of that direct work could be pursued meaningfully. The Guardian said it was really concerning that we were so far into proceedings and so little work had been done with the children. They had had no narrative about their father, and having been left without a proper understanding that was likely to be distressing for them. She pointed out that children need guidance otherwise they create their own narratives which are harmful to them. She said the children had been put in a position where they felt it necessary to be angry or hostile to her and the social worker because of the complaints, and that must have been really uncomfortable for two such sweet, nice, kind-natured children.</span></p>

She said it had taken a lot for her to try to ensure she practised in the way she normally would, and not to practice differently because of concerns about herself or her family. The mother had accused the Guardian of being racist and ableist, and that had created a huge amount of extra work. She said that for some periods social workers had felt they needed to work in pairs in order to protect themselves. She said that she had a caseload of 17 cases on average but had spent a quarter of the last year working on this case.</span></p>

She is of course entitled to raise genuine concerns. But the sheer range, nature and quantity of her complaints and threats are beyond reasonable. The complaints and threats listed in this judgment are only a fraction of the overall total. In many cases they are extremely heavy handed, telephoning the police or escalating matters to an MP or journalists when a simple phone call to the social worker would have sufficed. It is clear that the mother uses complaints, and threats of complaints, as a weapon to try to bring professionals to heel. She uses them to try to frighten and browbeat professionals into doing what she wants. The evidence I have cited above speaks for itself. The harm to the children is eloquently expressed in the Guardian&#8217;s evidence which I have quoted. I therefore make the following findings, based on that evidence:</span></p>

I accept Dr Lyall&#8217;s evidence on that point. However Dr Lyall said that the mother manifested a number of possible symptoms of ASD, for example being preoccupied with certain ideas, her interpersonal style and her poor eye contact. He felt that if she had ADHD the symptoms were not particularly severe. He also found that she demonstrated traits of schizoid, avoidant and paranoid personality disorders. These traits made it challenging for the mother to work with others and to accept the opinions of others, and as a result there was an ongoing risk of her making complaints. He said her belief that she is neurodivergent and in her children being disabled in the ways she described were important aspects of her identity. He considered that even if the court were to reach the view that her understanding of her children&#8217;s difficulty was inaccurate (which the court has now done) it would still be unlikely that the mother&#8217;s views on this issue would significantly change, given how central those beliefs were to her sense of self and to her relationship with her children.</span></p>

And I have not seen any sign that the mother has begun to accept that social care professionals are driven by a wish to help and protect her children rather than a wish to discriminate against the mother, or obtain a financial benefit. In fact, in the week before the trial the mother wrote to the court again re-stating her view that she was being discriminated against. There is no sign of any change.

It is also said, and the father accepts this, that the father needs further training in parenting and in autism before he would be ready to have them. However the signs are good that he is willing to do the work and is willing to wait so that the children are placed with him at the right time to ensure that the placement is most likely to be strong and successful. The very fact that the father understands this and agrees with it is in my view a good sign.</span></p>

The first option is placement with the mother. This could be done under a care order, a supervision order, a child arrangements order or no order. The advantages of that placement are that the children would be with their birth mother. The disadvantages are that the children would be at risk of the mother continuing to exaggerate their disabilities, bringing them up to believe themselves less able than they are. This brings with it a risk of missing opportunities and not fulfilling their potential. It also brings a risk of emotional harm from having to espouse the mother&#8217;s views in public, bringing the children into confrontation with professionals, which is something the children have clearly found traumatic in the past. There would be the risk of a continued fracturing of their education as the mother continued to complain about the schools and move them from school to school. There would be the risk of AB&#8217;s needs not being met as she has to help look out for her brother, the social work view being that it is better for the children to be apart at present to give AB a little space.

Without putting any time limit on this, the figure of a year has been mentioned as one possible timescale. The advantages of this are that the children would remain separate to begin with to give AB in particular the space to consider her own needs and have those needs met. The children&#8217;s daily physical, emotional and educational needs are being met in foster care. The foster carers are able to meet CD&#8217;s needs arising from his autism. The children are thriving and learning new activities such as trampolining and swimming. The children are permitted to live normal lives, not being placed in wheelchairs or having special arrangements made for hypermobility problems which do not exist. There would be the potential for placement with the father in due course which would reunite the children, when they are ready, in a safe family placement. In the meantime, they will be supported to have contact with both parents and with each other and will be able to maintain connections with their family in this way.</span></p>

In each case she can rely on a document or a recommendation from a professional to say or suggest that the support is necessary and she uses these professional views to justify her actions. But those professional views are often based on her own self- reporting (for example the letter from LM describing AB as having special educational needs, or the letter from the Private GP written without any background knowledge).

That, the mother is not able to do. If I were to return the children to the mother I have not the slightest doubt she would continue her campaign of seeking an EHCP for AB, asking for her hypermobility problems to be accommodated, telling CD he has mobility problems, refusing to allow the children to participate in activities which she considers beyond them, moving their school when the schools do not do what she wants, coaching the children to follow her line no matter what trauma it causes them, frightening social workers and others with her threats and causing harm to the children by each and every one of these behaviours, and the other behaviours I have detailed in this judgment.</p>

It was written by the social worker and she told me in evidence that it was written based on how the children presented generally and in therapeutic sessions, what the relationship between the children was like (she said it was not a normal sibling relationship) and her concerns about AB being somewhat parentified. She had taken the report of Dr Phibbs into account but the report was based on her own observations of the children. The ISW Sarah Cockley supported that view, saying that AB had a lot going on and needed to be able to focus on herself and her needs. Supporting her brother was an extra pressure which she didn&#8217;t need. The Guardian also agreed. She told me in evidence that her view was based upon her own enquiries. The foster carer had told her that CD lent on AB to express his feelings and views, which was something the Guardian had also observed. He would ask her to answer on his behalf or he&#8217;d get her to whisper the answer to him. The foster carer was also concerned about AB&#8217;s feelings always coming second when they were together, even in matters as mundane as choosing a film to watch, with AB getting CD to choose even when it was her turn. The mother&#8217;s unsupervised contact with AB had an impact on CD because the children were living together and AB passed the messages on. Being separate ensured that CD was away from that influence. Furthermore, the children had quite different needs. CD was warm and affectionate and cuddly and liked 1:1 attention, all of which his current carers provided for him. AB&#8217;s foster carers were nurturing but not as physically affectionate which suited AB better, but would not suit CD so well. AB was not ready for the sort of affectionate care CD&#8217;s foster carers gave. All in all, because of the current needs of each child the Guardian felt they would thrive better in separate placements at present. The idea, though, was for work to be done in the coming months so that their needs aligned to the point where they would be able to be placed together, preferably, if all went well, with their father.</p>

She said it was extremely important for them to be together because they had grown up together. She said splitting them up was a real loss for them, and must be affecting them mentally and emotionally. She wanted them to be together because then at least they would have each other.</span></p>

Secondly, there is the sheer weight of the unanimity of the professionals. And thirdly there is the evidence of the children themselves, who were asked by the Guardian about each other.

She says she wants weekly contact, maybe twice weekly, for 2-4 hours, reviewed regularly with a view to increasing it, and with the Local Authority regularly reviewing unification.

Bringing proceedings would be a similar strategy for her to the strategy of making complaints.

The effect on the children of her previous complaints and threats has been that they have been interviewed and re-interviewed, they have had the police coming to ask them questions, they have had to spend their time with the social worker and Guardian on dealing with these issues rather than on their own welfare. It has been harmful for them. If the mother were to make an unmeritorious application now, the children&#8217;s carers would shield them from the worst of it, but they would again have a Guardian appointed, they would have to talk to her, they would know about the court proceedings, they would have to be asked questions. They would be plunged once more back into a world of uncertainty, not knowing whether the stability they had only just achieved was about to be plucked from them. I consider that that would be very harmful for them, just when they are at the point of starting to recover from their trauma and when they are starting to build their relationship with their father. Because I consider it likely that the mother may want to bring such applications, and because I believe that would be harmful for the children, and because I remind myself that a s91(14) order is only a filter and not a bar, I do consider it appropriate to make such an order in this case. If the mother has good reason to make an application, she will be given leave, so she is not excluded from the court by the making of this order. But the children will be protected from vexatious and unjustified applications.</span></p>

What the Guardian means by that is that she will have finished her GSCEs. I can see the merit in that, but I wonder why CD should not be afforded the same or similar protection. By that time each child is 16 they will be more robust, and have a clearer understanding of their life story, and be better able to withstand any applications the mother may make. I consider a s91(14) order is necessary and proportionate to protect the children&#8217;s emotional and developmental safety, and </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:12pt">I therefore make a s91(14) order against the mother preventing her from making any applications in respect of either or both of AB and CD without the leave of the court until 4pm on AB&#8217;s 18th birthday, and extending that, in the case of applications in respect of CD until 4pm on CD&#8217;s 16th birthday</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">. </span><span style="font-size:12pt">The reason for those time periods is as follows. Ideally I would protect both children until they are 16, when they will be more robust and have a more adult understanding of any applications which are made. However if I extend the order in relation to AB until she is 16, CD will be 13 when it expires. If an application is then made in relation to AB it has the potential to affect and disrupt CD when he is still 13, particularly if he is still living in the same household. In order to protect him from that, I must extend AB&#8217;s order as long as possible, which will be until her 18th birthday. Thus CD will be protected from the knock-on effect of any application in relation to AB until he is 15, which is the best I can do. As for applications in relation to himself, I can, and I do, protect him until he is 16.</span></p>

I am satisfied that the mother has been in contact with AB in breach of court orders, and that that has been severely to AB&#8217;s detriment. It has also been to CD&#8217;s detriment as AB has passed messages on to him. It is the utmost importance that this does not happen again.

I amend paragraph 4(d) of the existing non-molestation order to make clear that it does not prohibit the mother from attending contact.

By the time of the expiry of the order the children may have their own views about contact with their mother. If the children genuinely wish to contact their mother outside official contact times and the Local Authority consider that matters have moved to a point where that is no longer harmful, they will be able to facilitate such communication within the terms of this order, or, if necessary, apply to amend the order.</span></p>

The grandmother falls into neither of these categories. I do not, therefore consider that I have jurisdiction to continue this order, and it will expire therefore at the end of this hearing.
