If the organisation is not the applicant, it should normally be named as a respondent in the application form.   The expectation in applications relating to medical treatment is that P would normally be joined as a party.   It is therefore important that the applicant provides as fully as possible details (including contact details) for members of P&#8217;s family and others with an interest in P&#8217;s welfare.  </p>
