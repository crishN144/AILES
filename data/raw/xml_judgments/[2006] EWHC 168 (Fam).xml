	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">MAB was born in 1980, so he is 25 years old. He suffers from marked autistic spectrum disorder, which has been evident from the age of 3. He shows impaired reciprocal social relationships with limited empathy or understanding of the needs of others. He has impaired communication and very little language. He exhibits challenging and unpredictable behaviour. His older brother, who was born in 1978, also has severe autism. He has a younger brother born in 1983 who is unimpaired and is indeed at university. The family is Muslim and comes from Pakistan but all three children were born and brought up and live in this country. In fact all three children still live at home with their father, MB, and mother, NA.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In my opinion, [MAB] does not understand the nature of the contract of marriage. This is because of his level of learning disability which precludes him from understanding the mutual responsibilities of marriage &#8230; It is also my opinion that because of his autistic spectrum disorder he cannot grasp the social implications of marriage and duties and responsibilities normally associated with marriage.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The present proceedings were started on 24 March 2005 by the local authority for the area where MAB and his family live. The local authority, which has had extensive involvement with MAB and his family, providing support services for the family and for MAB and his elder brother, was concerned that MAB&#8217;s parents were about to take him to Pakistan, possibly to be married. The same day Her Honour Judge Bevington, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, made various orders, including a tipstaff passport and all ports alert order, and granted various injunctions. Those injunctions have remained in place ever since. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The matter came on for trial before me on 28 November 2005. There was, as I have said, no issue between the parties as to MAB&#8217;s lack of capacity. The main issue was as to what if any relief, and in what form, should be granted to restrain MAB being married or being taken to Pakistan. On that there were differences between the various protagonists: Mr Adrian Whitfield QC and Ms Hilary Watson appearing for the local authority, Ms U R Sood appearing for MAB&#8217;s father and mother, and Ms Alison Ball QC appearing for MAB&#8217;s litigation friend, the Official Solicitor.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Very properly, and in my judgment wholly appropriately, the local authority accepts that MAB&#8217;s parents are deeply committed to the well-being of all their children. Mr Whitfield correctly described them as loving and heroic parents. I should like to associate myself with that description. The parents, I have not the slightest doubt, are devoted and committed in their care for MAB and his elder brother, just as they are also, of course, devoted to their youngest son. Their only motivation is to do their very best for their sons. Their sons&#8217; welfare is their only consideration. It is their guiding objective. Many parents would long ago have buckled under the strain. MAB&#8217;s parents have not.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Two very impressive character witnesses were called, one an elected member of the local authority and the other an Anglican clergyman who, as it happens, lived for some years in Pakistan. Both know the parents very well. Both spoke of them in the highest terms, displaying, as it seemed to me, a profound admiration and respect for the parents and everything they had being doing over the long years of looking after their sons. That admiration and respect, I have no doubt, was well justified. It accorded entirely with the impression I formed from observing the parents in court and whilst giving evidence. The parents are entitled to an unqualified recognition &#8211; in my case a humble and admiring recognition &#8211; of their commitment and devotion to their sons.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no doubt that for many years it has been the ambition of MAB&#8217;s parents that he should marry his first cousin R. She was born in 1978 and is the daughter of MAB&#8217;s mother&#8217;s sister. She lives in Pakistan. The local authority accepts that it is entirely understandable that MAB&#8217;s parents should wish to see him happily married. But it is concerned that, as Ms Farooqi Thakrar, the independent social work expert put it in her report dated 2 August 2005,</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Given the lack of social support for people with learning disabilities in Pakistan, marriage between a learning disabled person and a person without a learning disability is often considered a means to securing their future care.&#8221;</p>
		  </content>
		</level>
	      </embeddedStructure></block>
	    <p class="ParaNoNumber" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority is also concerned that, particularly in Pakistan, there may be cultural and family pressures towards marriage despite the parents&#8217; very clear insistence that they would not force an unsuitable or unwanted marriage on their son or niece. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The essential thrust of the local authority&#8217;s case is that MAB&#8217;s parents have not abandoned hope of a marriage between MAB and R, indeed, as Mr Whitfield puts it, that they have shown &#8220;marked persistence&#8221; in exploring the possibility of marriage between MAB and R. And this even though the evidence is clear that he lacks the capacity to marry, even though all attempts by R to obtain leave to enter this country as his fianc&#233;e have failed and even though the evidence is also clear that MAB is not at present able to tolerate the long flight to Pakistan. The local authority&#8217;s case is that performance of a ceremony of marriage abroad while MAB lacks capacity would be, as it puts it, &#8220;disastrous&#8221; because, quite apart from the risks for MAB attached to the long distance he would have to travel, (i) if the couple attempted to return, and the authorities knew that the marriage was not considered valid, R would be barred entry and (ii) if they stayed abroad the facilities for looking after MAB, as well as parental support, would be less available than they are in this country. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The local authority recognises that these are issues which require sensitive exploration, not least bearing in mind the undoubtedly deep concern which his parents have for MAB&#8217;s welfare, but they submit that nonetheless at the end of the day this is a case where injunctive relief is necessary to safeguard and promote MAB&#8217;s best interests.</p>

That application was refused by the ECO on 18 May 1999. R appealed. Her appeal was heard by an Adjudicator, Professor G K Morse, on 20 March 2000 and dismissed in a determination dated 13 April 2000. Applying the test set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Mohd Meharban v ECO Islamabad </span>[1989] Imm AR 57, Professor Morse held that MAB and R had not &#8220;met&#8221; within the meaning of paragraph 290(ii), their only meeting having been in 1983 when MAB was aged 3.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">In July 2001 an application was made to the Secretary of State for the Home Department for a visa to enable R to settle permanently in this country. The application was made outside the normal Immigration Rules and, as it was put, on compassionate grounds. It was refused by the Secretary of State on 14 December 2001. R appealed and filed additional grounds by letter dated 30 May 2002 raising various issues under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Her appeal was heard by an Adjudicator, Mr P J M Hollingworth, on 17 September 2003. The appeal was successful, Mr Hollingworth&#8217;s reasons being set out in a determination dated 8 December 2003. On 10 February 2004 the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (Mr K Drabu) gave the Secretary of State permission to appeal. The appeal was heard by the IAT (Mr M S W Hoyle, Mr B D Yates and Mr R A McKee) on 15 October 2004 and allowed for reasons set out in a decision dated 13 December 2004. Essentially the IAT allowed the appeal because the parties had never &#8220;met&#8221;. That being so there was no basis for any exercise of discretion, and there could be no breach of Article 8 given the absence of any established family life as between R and MAB.</p>

That application was refused by the ECO on 28 July 2005. As I understand it, there has been no appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Now as Mr Whitfield was understandably at pains to point out, there are a number of striking features about these events. In the first place, R was described throughout as MAB&#8217;s fianc&#233;e (see, for example, his father&#8217;s use of that expression in his evidence to the Adjudicator at the hearing on 20 March 2000, and in his witness statement dated 5 September 2003). The father sought before me to downplay the significance of this, asserting in his witness statement dated 28 September 2005 that &#8220;we used the word fianc&#233;e in documents within the immigration application in accordance with legal advice, to satisfy the immigration rules. It did not mean there had been a formal engagement.&#8221; That may be, but the implication of the repeated use of the word fianc&#233;e is clear enough. Furthermore, as the bare chronology of events shows, the family&#8217;s endeavours to bring R to this country with a view to her marrying MAB were pursued with vigour and throughout a protracted period of over six years. Moreover, this was all being done at a time when, as his parents knew, the consistent view of Dr C was that MAB lacked the capacity to marry. Thus, as the medical notes show, as early as 29 January 1999 Dr C in the course of a long discussion with MAB&#8217;s parents expressed his view as being (see his letter dated 3 February 1999) that MAB &#8220;cannot fully grasp the concept of marriage and its implications.&#8221; The medical notes also show Dr C telling MAB&#8217;s father on 3 February 2005 that MAB &#8220;cannot give consent to marriage.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But there is, as Mr Whitfield also pointed out, another striking feature of the family&#8217;s endeavours. An important fact being relied upon by the family in support of its case that R should be allowed to enter this country, either as a fianc&#233;e or as a family visitor, was the assertion, backed up with medical evidence from Dr C and from MAB&#8217;s general practitioner, Dr R, that MAB was unable &#8211; because medically unfit &#8211; to travel to Pakistan (see letters from Dr R dated 15 August 2003 and from Dr C dated 4 September 2003 and 2 October 2003). Dr C said that MAB &#8220;is unable to travel long distances due to his Autism, associated behaviours and his learning disability. He cannot tolerate long journeys in a confined space&#8221;. Indeed, in the letter to the ECO dated 7 July 2005 it was said that MAB &#8220;is unable to travel to Pakistan due to his medical condition. Furthermore, no Airline permits him to travel with them due to their safety regulations&#8221;. This would appear to be a reference to letters from British Airways and Pakistan International Airlines dated respectively 24 May 2004 and 24 June 2004. The letter from PIA made it clear that it would carry MAB only if there was a medical consultant&#8217;s fitness certificate. The letter from BA pointed out that in the event of any disturbance by a passenger endangering either the crew or other passengers the flight crew would have to take appropriate action &#8220;which could result in diverting the flight, offloading the passenger or even deny boarding on the return flight.&#8221; As Mr Whitfield commented, the stakes are very high: suppose, for instance, that MAB was offloaded in, eg, the Gulf and stranded there because no airline would carry him.</p>

That was something which he had also discussed with the local authority at a meeting on 11 January 2005. This meeting, or rather the local authority&#8217;s note of the meeting, is important because of what the father is recorded as having said.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This rule has been the subject of much academic dispute and a certain amount of judicial debate: see the discussion in Dicey &amp; Morris at paras 17-055 &#8211; 17-069, in particular of Lord Simon of Glaisale&#8217;s observations in <span style="font-style:italic">Vervaeke (formerly Messina) v Smith </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1983] 1 AC 145" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">[1983] 1 AC 145</ref> at pages 165-166 and also of the various judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">Lawrence v Lawrence </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] Fam 106" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] Fam 106</ref>. It has, for example, been suggested that a marriage which would otherwise be invalidated by the &#8216;dual domicile&#8217; rule will be valid if the parties have capacity under the law of the country of the prospective matrimonial home &#8211; the law of the country of their intended matrimonial domicile &#8211; or under the law of the country with which the marriage has its most real and substantial connection. There is no need for me to enter into this debate, for whichever of the three proposed rules applies, the result in this case is the same. For in this case, and in many such cases, England is not merely the country of MAB&#8217;s domicile. It would also be the country of the intended matrimonial domicile and the country with which any proposed marriage would have its most real and substantial connection. </p>

So it is neither here nor there that a marriage celebrated in Pakistan might be recognised as valid in that country. The short point is that MAB&#8217;s incapacity to marry in the eyes of English law means that no marriage entered into by him, either in this country or abroad, will be recognised in English law. And if it is not recognised in English law it will not be recognised by English public authorities.</p>

As Ms Ball correctly put it, the fact that a person may not in particular circumstances be able to contract a valid marriage under English law does not mean that under the law of another country, where the test of capacity may be different, that person may not be able to contract a valid marriage. She asks rhetorically whether it can be right &#8211; or indeed whether it would be effective &#8211; for this court to declare that the person does not have capacity to marry under the law of another country. I agree with Ms Ball&#8217;s analysis. The form of words originally suggested by Mr Whitfield is, in my judgment, wrong in principle: wrong as a matter of international judicial comity and wrong as a matter of English conflicts law. I shall accordingly make a declaration in the terms suggested by Ms Sood and Ms Ball. </p>

She suggests that the parents&#8217; perseverance in their endeavour to arrange for MAB and R to meet shows their respect for MAB&#8217;s volition and free will: they have never contemplated a proxy marriage for MAB and have, she says, been anxious for the parties to meet for a trial period so as to ascertain both whether MAB has the capacity to marry and in any event whether he and R in fact wish to marry. She also points out that, despite the suggested Islamic stress on &#8216;arranging the marriage of one&#8217;s children [as] a parent&#8217;s duty&#8217;, the parents have never sought to arrange a marriage for MAB&#8217;s elder brother, who they have always recognised does not have the capacity to marry. Their different approach in relation to MAB reflects, she says, an appropriate recognition that MAB is less disabled than his older brother and their hope that in due course he may be shown to have the capacity to marry. She says that, although the parents may have had their differences with the local authority over care and respite issues, their approach to these proceedings is uninfluenced by this. She emphasises that there are no present plans either to arrange a marriage or to take MAB to Pakistan, but she points out that neither Dr Land nor Dr C is prepared to rule out the possibility of a recovery by MAB sufficient to enable him to fly to Pakistan and even possibly to marry. She submits that should there be a future improvement in MAB&#8217;s condition there should not be any unnecessary bar to his future life.</p>

She submits, on the one hand, that, although the parents have shown a real and consistent commitment to MAB and are motivated to act in his best interests, there is a risk that they may, despite his incapacity, believe that they are acting in his best long-term interests by arranging for him to meet and become attached to a person &#8211; R &#8211; who is prepared to be a companion and carer for him through marriage. She submits that this belief and impetus may be strengthened by cultural and familial considerations and pressures. And she suggests, echoing Singer J&#8217;s observations in <span style="font-style:italic">In re SK (An Adult) (Forced Marriage: Appropriate Relief) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/3202" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 3202 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] 1 WLR 81" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] 1 WLR 81</ref>, at para [4], that whether such a marriage if performed in Pakistan would be recognised in English law is, in the final analysis, less important than the fact that MAB would become involved in a marriage relationship which he did not understand, to which he had not consented, and which might be emotionally damaging to him. As against all that she suggests that these risks have now receded, so that the situation can be adequately and appropriately safeguarded by undertakings and without the need for a passport order. She points to the stigma the parents will feel if they are injuncted. She points also to their protestations that they are law abiding citizens whose word can be trusted. </p>

Were the need ever to arise, the court could act swiftly and, if need be, grant appropriate injunctions. For the moment it is sufficient to note that the order I am proposing to make provides for disclosure of appropriate documents to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Home Office, the Registrar General and the British High Commission in Pakistan. This, in my judgment, provides more than adequate protection to cover any &#8216;gap&#8217; between the perceived effect of undertakings as compared to injunctions. I use that phrase because there is not, in truth, any difference between the two. An undertaking is enforceable in precisely the same way as an injunction. Indeed, if anything, the court is likely to take an even more serious view of any breach of an undertaking, for the breach of an undertaking involves the breach of a solemn obligation voluntarily assumed, not the breach of an obligation involuntarily imposed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Time was when our law took the view that a wife&#8217;s body belonged to her husband. Time was when our law believed, as Sir James Hannen P put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Durham v Durham</span> (1885) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="10 PD 80" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">10 PD 80</ref> at page 82, that the &#8220;natural relations&#8221; which spring from marriage include &#8220;submission on the part of the woman&#8221;. Time was when consortium was understood as conferring on the husband the right to his wife&#8217;s society and services &#8211; her sexual as well as her domestic and social services &#8211; whilst conferring on her not so much a reciprocal right to her husband&#8217;s consortium as a correlative duty to give him her society and her services. However, and as I sought to demonstrate in <span style="font-style:italic">Sheffield City Council v E </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2004/2808" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2808 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] Fam 326" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] Fam 326</ref>, all this has now been swept away. The fact is that the wife is no longer the weaker partner subservient to the stronger. Today both spouses are the joint, co-equal heads of the family. And in so far as the concept of consortium still has any useful role to play, the rights of husband and wife (if &#8220;right&#8221; is indeed the correct word to use) must now be regarded as exactly reciprocal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moreover, as Ms Ball correctly reminds me, it was for many years the view (albeit sometimes doubted) that a wife, as part of the matrimonial contract, had consented to sexual intercourse with her husband and that she could not retract that consent. A married woman was deemed to consent to sexual intercourse with her husband. This view underlay both the assumption that a man could not be guilty of the rape of his wife and, as decided in <span style="font-style:italic">The Queen v Clarence </span>(1888) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="22 QBD 23" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">22 QBD 23</ref>, that he committed no criminal offence if he infected her with a venereal disease. (The Divorce Court was more enlightened. For it had been recognised in the very early days of the new Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes that an adulterous husband who infected his wife with a venereal disease might be guilty of the matrimonial offence of cruelty, thereby entitling her to divorce him on the ground of adultery and cruelty: see <span style="font-style:italic">Brown v Brown </span>(1865) LR 1 P&amp;D 46 and <span style="font-style:italic">Boardman v Boardman, The Queen&#8217;s Proctor Intervening </span>(1866) LR 1 P&amp;D 233. At that time, of course, a wife could not obtain a divorce on the ground of her husband&#8217;s adultery alone. There had to be an additional aggravating feature or matrimonial offence: incest, bigamy, sodomy, rape, bestiality, cruelty or desertion.) These relics of a former age lingered on for a surprisingly long time. Only very recently were they exploded as the fictions they had always been.

In these circumstances, she suggests, the nature of the contract of marriage may need to be elaborated in recognition of the fact that marriage requires respect by each party of the right of sexual choice by the other. </p>

To fail to incorporate this specific development in the criminal law into the test of capacity to marry in civil law would, she submits, be to disregard Parliament&#8217;s clear intention that an individual should not be placed in a position where they are unable to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity.

Generally speaking, capacity to marry must include the capacity to consent to sexual relations. And the test of capacity to consent to sexual relations must for this purpose be the same in its essentials as that required by the criminal law. Therefore for present purposes the question comes to this. Does the person have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature and character &#8211; the <span style="font-style:italic">sexual</span> nature and character &#8211; of the act of sexual intercourse, and of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of sexual intercourse, to have the capacity to choose whether or not to engage in it, the capacity to decide whether to give or withhold consent to sexual intercourse (and, where relevant, to communicate their choice to their spouse)?</p>

The question of whether someone has capacity to marry is not the same as the question whether that person has capacity to consent to sexual relations. The two questions have to be considered separately. That said, since a sexual relationship is, generally speaking, implicit in any marriage, it must follow that, generally speaking, someone who lacks the capacity to consent to sexual relations will for that very reason necessarily lack the capacity to marry. The converse, of course, is not necessarily true. Someone may have the capacity to consent to sexual relations whilst lacking the capacity to marry.</p>

And it is a distinction which makes this analysis much less important in practical terms in the case of capacity to marry than in the two other situations. The distinction, as I have already said, is that marriage is not something on which the average person needs to obtain either expert advice or expert assistance.

That was a clear error. It is an error for which the court bears sole responsibility, for it is the court which draws passport and other tipstaff orders and the practice is not to supply copies of them to the parties. This error by the court was the cause, the <span style="font-style:italic">causa sine qua non</span>, of everything that followed.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">On 24 May 2005 the parent&#8217;s solicitors issued an application for an order that the local authority be required to return the parents&#8217; passports &#8220;seized by the authority of&#8221; the local authority. That application came before another Circuit Judge on 26 May 2005, who made an order that the Z Constabulary forthwith return the parents&#8217; passports to them. Unfortunately both the application and the order were misconceived. The parents&#8217; passports, which had been in the constructive custody of the tipstaff ever since they were seized by the police, had in fact been in his actual custody from a very early stage. (An attendance note of a conversation with the tipstaff on 1 April 2005 indicates that he had by then received the passports.) The order should accordingly have been addressed to the tipstaff, directing the <span style="font-style:italic">tipstaff </span>to return the passports to the parents. This was in fact pointed out by the tipstaff in an e-mail to the local authority on 31 May 2005. The point, if I may explain, is simply this. The original direction made by Judge Bevington on 24 March 2005 in Form 3B required the tipstaff &#8220;to keep [the passports] safely, until further direction of the court&#8221;. The tipstaff was accordingly obliged to keep the passports until such time as <span style="font-style:italic">he </span>received a direction of the court. The tipstaff was entitled &#8211; indeed obliged &#8211; to say that without a direction addressed to him his obligation was to comply with the terms of Judge Bevington&#8217;s order. As an officer of the court, the tipstaff is entitled to the protection of a direction &#8211; an order &#8211; before he parts with any passport which he has seized in accordance with a previous direction he has been given by the court. The order dated 26 May 2005 was useless for this purpose; it merely beat the air.</p>

On 16 August 2005 they telephoned the tipstaff&#8217;s office and were told &#8211; quite correctly &#8211; that the parents&#8217; passports could not be released without an order. The same day they sent the tipstaff a copy of the order dated 26 May 2005. On 30 August 2005 the tipstaff informed them &#8211; again quite correctly &#8211; that he could not release the passports without an amended order directed to him rather than to the Z Constabulary. It is most unfortunate that the local authority did not see fit to tell the parents&#8217; solicitors what they had learnt from the tipstaff on 31 May 2005. As can be seen this omission occasioned a further three months delay. </p>

Unfortunately, that direction was included in a lengthy order, some of the details of which took a little time to be agreed between the various parties&#8217; representatives. It was only on 9 November 2005 that the order was finally sealed and only on 16 November 2005 that a sealed copy sent to them by the court was received by the parents&#8217; solicitors.</p>

The primary blame, as I have already acknowledged, lies with the court. But others contributed to the excessive time it took to remedy an error which, if its precise cause had not then been exposed, had seemingly been identified as early as 29 March 2005 when the parents&#8217; solicitors wrote to the local authority complaining about the seizure of their clients&#8217; passports.</p>

Indeed, it might justifiably have been the subject of criticism if it had not done so and if MAB had in fact been taken to Pakistan. Moreover, it was not until September 2005 that MAB&#8217;s father acknowledged that his son did not have capacity to marry. On the other hand, by November 2005 &#8211; and indeed <span style="font-style:italic">before </span>the final hearing began &#8211; the parents had indicated that they would be prepared to offer suitable undertakings. To a significant extent the reason why the proceedings had to continue, and in the event take up the best part of three days in court, was because the local authority was pressing for the injunctions and for the relief in relation to MAB&#8217;s passport which in the event I refused. But for the local authority&#8217;s stance the final hearing would probably have been very much shorter. I do not criticise the local authority. I merely set out the facts as I find them. In all the circumstances I think that justice will best be done if I direct that the local authority pays two-thirds of the parents&#8217; costs of the final hearing. In relation to the costs incurred prior to the final hearing I propose to make no order.</p>
