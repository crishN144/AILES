The father has been employed over the years in a number of jobs in Spain, on the land, as a street-sweeper, and as a waiter; S is his only child.  The parents met in a nightclub on millennium eve, and some months later (October 2000), the mother moved to Spain, with her son and daughter, permanently to live.  The mother and father moved in together shortly after the mother&#8217;s arrival in Spain, and also for a period ran a small business together.  S was born in May 2005.  The parties never married.</p>

In April 2010, the mother signed a &#8216;convenio&#8217; (agreement) which detailed many aspects of S&#8217;s future care and parental responsibility, including notably the grant of &#8216;custody&#8217; to the mother with provision for S to reside with her in England.  The father did not in fact sign this &#8216;convenio&#8217; but, instead, in June 2010 he re-instigated the court process in Spain in the same court with a fresh application for residence.  </p>

The &#8216;convenio&#8217; provided for there to be &#8220;guardianship and child custody&#8221; of S to the mother living in England with &#8220;communications and visitations&#8221; to the father.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is appropriate to record that at the point at which the Spanish Court made this order, the mother in fact believed that it was the English Court which had primary jurisdiction to make orders in respect of S, by virtue of her conviction (reflected in her assertions before Baron J.) that S was habitually resident in this country.  In submitting therefore to the jurisdiction of the Spanish Court in October 2010, she was (as she later acknowledged) proroguing that jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of Article 12(3) Council Regulation (EC) No.2201/2003 concerning Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Matrimonial Matters and the Matters of Parental Responsibility (hereafter &#8220;BIIR&#8221;).

The father told me, in his oral submissions, that in the months which followed he sought (without legal representation) to revive those proceedings, but failed to effectively to do so, as (he said) he did not know where the mother was living and could not serve her with any court papers.  There is no evidence before me of any written application or (more pertinently) Court Order in Spain which post-dates that of 20 October 2010.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Less than two months passed before fresh proceedings concerning S were issued, this time in the English courts.  On 17 December 2010, the mother issued an application under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> in the Principal Registry of the Family Division seeking a residence order, a variation of the contact arrangement contained in the &#8216;convenio&#8217;, and a specific issue order.  The father was served with these proceedings; he countered this step by issuing proceedings in Spain and in England (by Originating Summons, just within the three month period contemplated by Article 41 and 47), seeking enforcement of the Order of 20 October 2010 and the &#8216;convenio&#8217;.  The combined proceedings were listed before Hedley J for directions in February 2011, and then substantively before Charles J. on 14 April 2011.  The substantive hearing before Charles J. was adjourned part-heard; the part-heard hearing was finally re-listed for hearing on 16 December 2011.  </p>

At that hearing the mother indicated that she would not, after all, resist enforcement of the Spanish Court Order (made on 20 October 2010).  However, she made clear to the English Court that she was intending to apply in Spain for an order transferring any Spanish proceedings to England under Article 15 of BIIR.  Charles J provided for enforcement of the Spanish Order of 20 October 2010, and a detailed schedule was appended to the order, setting out the specific arrangements for the parties to comply with the &#8216;convenio&#8217;. </p>

If the October 2010 prorogation continues to endow the Spanish Courts with jurisdiction, but such jurisdiction is not being actually exercised, and if Article 15 is only applicable to extant proceedings (a proposition not conceded as correct by Mr Setright but one which may, as I have said, have been adopted by the Spanish Judge) by what means can a transfer of jurisdiction be addressed where indeed there are no &#8216;live&#8217; proceedings currently before the Spanish court, and there appears to be nothing more tangible than an unexercised residual jurisdiction to transfer?  By its ruling of the 29 February 2012, the Spanish Court does not appear anxious to assume (or resume) jurisdiction.   Meanwhile, S has become habitually resident in England and Wales, for over two years, with the consent of both parents and endorsement of the Spanish Court.</p>

Nor can the jurisdiction be brought to an end by the withdrawal of an unequivocal and express acceptance of jurisdiction of the prorogued court (see [2010] EWHC 2040 at [76] and [78], and see Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re I</span> at [23]: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000">Certainly a party who has once accepted jurisdiction should not be able to withdraw it at any time before the conclusion of the case.

The mother contended in the English Courts that S had acquired habitual residence in England after she brought him here in February 2010 and in any event by 9 July 2010 (when appearing before Baron J).  That position was not accepted by the father.  However, in my judgment, there can be little doubt that all of the necessary factors to attribute habitual residence of S in England were in place for him after 21 July 2010, when both parties signed the &#8216;convenio&#8217; agreeing that the guardianship and child custody of S should vest with the mother, and that S should live with the mother in England.  S was of course physically living in England at that time, he had been living in England for some time by then, he has been in England since that time, and throughout the period, he has been and is in school here.</span></p>

When the &#8216;convenio&#8217; was submitted to the Spanish Court in October 2010 for approval, this was (as the mother acknowledges) by her proroguing the jurisdiction of the Spanish Court under Article 12(3) of BIIR.

The Practice Guide to BIIR supports such an interpretation providing that:</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel5" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seised.  Once a competent court is seised, in principle it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding (principle of &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">perpetuatio fori</span>&#8217;).  A change of habitual residence of the child while the proceeding is pending does therefore not itself entail a change of jurisdiction.</p>

		    <p class="ParaLevel5" style="margin-left:0.79in">However, if it is in the best interests of the child, Article 15 provides for the possible transfer of the case, subject to certain conditions, to a court of the Member State to which the child has moved.

This interpretation is consistent, in my judgment, with the approach of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re I</span> (citation above) at [23]-[32]).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, prorogation under Article 12(1) is not, it appears, open-ended; it does not survive beyond the conclusion of the second set of parallel proceedings in a divorce case (Article 3) (see discussion of Article 12(2) above).  Such prorogation comes to an end <span style="font-style:italic">either</span> when the proceedings bringing the marriage to an end conclude with a final judgment, <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> the parental responsibility proceedings conclude with a final judgment whichever is the later (unless the proceedings have come to an end for a different reason: Article 12(2)(c)).  In my judgment, it would only be consistent with the scheme under Article 12(1) for the scheme under Article 12(3) to apply in the same way, and for the jurisdiction to &#8216;cease&#8217; when the judgment has become final. </p>

At best this would be unnecessarily cumbersome; at worse (for reasons explained below) not possible without active proceedings in the prorogued state. </p>

If there are no &#8216;live&#8217; proceedings, there is nothing to transfer.  It could not be right, in my view, for the jurisdiction of a Member State which has been established through prorogation (Article 12(3)) to survive beyond the completion of proceedings, when the effect would be to frustrate the legitimate wish of a court of another Member State (where the child is habitually resident) from exercising effective jurisdiction.  </p>
