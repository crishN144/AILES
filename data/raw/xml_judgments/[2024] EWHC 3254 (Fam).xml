It is necessary for me to take matters more shortly than the parties have in their written evidence if I am to deliver this judgment during the 2-day time estimate allocated to this case.  I will not therefore deal with every point raised in the written evidence. I intend to set out my decision and the reasoning that led me to it with sufficient clarity to enable my decision to be understood.  I hope to be able to deal with the narrower range of points that counsel put to me.  I apologise if the speed of preparing this judgment leads to poor expression of my thoughts.</span></p>

I do not on balance consider that is an appropriate understanding of what she said then.

I cannot within a summary process embark on a full welfare consideration.  I do note that J has said she is very unhappy with her isolation in America.  It is accepted that it is a 2-hour bus journey to her school and that her mother rarely drives and will not fly because of a medical condition so she is very much on her own.  It is accepted that her mother has fallen out with her parents following an argument with her brother so that there is a hindrance on family interaction.  This is not however the proper venue to carefully weigh up where J&#8217;s welfare best interests lie.

J&#8217;s objection is based on not wanting to live with her mother and not wanting to be isolated.  The isolation point is rational if not in these circumstances the strongest of grounds.  The fact that J does not want to live with her mother is something on which Ms Callaghan comments as follows: &#8216;I did have a sense that her lived experiences have left her emotionally vulnerable and her complaints about her mother may be more than what I consider usual teenagers complaining about their parent&#8217;.  I combine that with the historic communications that I have seen and reach the conclusion that this is a rational ground.  What is being suggested by the mother is that in the first instance J returns to live with her parents until her relationship can be mended.  This does not negate the rationality of the objection, in that the return to the mother remains the medium or long term aim.</span></p>

He points to an email written in July 2024 by the father to the mother in which the father says that J is again asking if she can move to live in the UK.  It is clear from that email that the father would like her to move to the UK, but it is also right to note that he says expressly that the problems between J and the mother can be sorted out by enabling J to have a bit more fun: going to a caf&#233; once a week, buying her a bun, taking her swimming, going on some trips.   This I find to be an email to be taken at face value.  The father was being asked by J if she could stay.  He recognised that the agreement was she should return.  He wanted to help J by either having her stay or making her have a better time when she returned.  It does not lead me to think that J&#8217;s objections are to be put on one side.</span></p>
