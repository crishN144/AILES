Prior to the arrest, HX had complained of chest pain. Her son CX (the second respondent to these proceedings), reports that this pain progressed and resulted in a seizure and collapse. He gave his mother CPR. Paramedics arrived at 18:22 and resuscitated HX, but she arrived at hospital unconscious at 19:14. She was transferred to the critical care unit on the same day. She has since been diagnosed with severe, global, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or brain damage, resulting from the arrest. HX is currently a patient in the critical care unit at the Northumbria Hospital and is the first respondent in these proceedings. Her participation has been secured by the appointment of the Official Solicitor as her litigation friend. </span></p>

He had moved to HX&#8217;s home when he was a teenager. He considers them as having a relationship as best friends, and provides a vivid picture of his mother as she was before her hospitalisation: as a creative woman who loved shopping, choosing outfits for other people, and listening to music; someone who took pride in her appearance and enjoyed beauty and spa treatments.  He describes her however as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8216;closed off&#8217;,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> preferring the company of family to strangers, but generous to others and selfless.</span></p>

She was born when her own mother was a teenager and raised with the help of her grandmother. At the age of 16 she suffered a rape and then began a relationship with someone described as a violent and abusive drug-user who also introduced her to drug use. She has experienced ongoing mental health problems and domestic violence; her two children born after CX were adopted. One met HX later in life but has not gone on to form a close relationship. The other child is yet to meet HX since the adoption. CX himself was looked after by HX&#8217;s parents in childhood, until he was taken into care, before returning to his mother 3 years later.  HX and CX have lived together since then, and although he reports some positive and memorable times, he acknowledges that HX&#8217;s mental health deteriorated. He describes her as not wanting to leave the house, and isolating herself from other people. Over the last three years, HX&#8217;s mental health struggles have increased. She has found it difficult to access medical treatment, either in relation to her mental health or the physical treatment for a known heart condition explained below.</span></p>

He describes repeatedly requesting help which he considers was not forthcoming. Whatever the reason, it was the case that HX did not fully engage in the treatment which she required for diagnosed triple vessel coronary disease, which is highly likely to have been the precipitating factor in the cardiac arrest which precipitated her brain injury.  HX has a formal diagnosis of Borderline/Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. Her family, however, feel this may be a misdiagnosis and have suggested that she may in fact suffer from Schizophrenia and Agoraphobia. HX&#8217;s family are also reported to feel that HX&#8217;s behaviour and mental health symptoms deteriorated precipitously when her prescription for risperidone was discontinued (due to concern about its wider effects on her physical health).  </span></p>

He describes her as a Christian who had a bible and believed life was precious.  She is recorded in her medical records previously as a Methodist, but in 2021 as having no religion.  In his statement, CX acknowledges that he has not discussed end of life care with his mother.

She is recorded in the medical notes as saying on 10 July 2024 that HX would not want to be alive like this. There is in truth, and despite all of the evidence from her family of the sort of person that she was, very little evidence available as to what HX would want for herself, given her current situation.  It is impossible to know whether her wish for resuscitation recounted by CX would continue if she were able to understand her present situation and the consequences for her if she were to receive CPR.  Sadly, the medical evidence which I will examine later is very clear that there is no treatment which will significantly improve HX&#8217;s condition, nor that giving her further time now will enable her to make any significant recovery. </span></p>

This is due to the significant risk of complications which are likely to arise and her notable lack of physiological reserve. HX&#8217;s risk of complications is elevated in light of her pre-existing severe cardiac dysfunction, as well as her diabetes. Complications are likely to include: ventilator acquired pneumonias; venous thromboembolism; ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke; further heart attack; and blood-stream or other infections. The risk of worsening pressure sores seems to have been a major concern at the time when the Hospital Trust first made its application to the Court of Protection, but these have now begun to improve following implementation of two hourly turning for HX.</span></p>

The medical evidence is clear that the primary injury to HX&#8217;s brain is both severe and very sadly irreversible. Whilst a delay to addressing the questions which are now before me would enable HX&#8217;s family more time to come to terms with the desperate injury which she has suffered, it would not serve to enable any treatment which could alleviate her condition. Although it cannot by now be determined whether or not HX will eventually come to be diagnosed as VS or MCS-, it can be said with a very high degree of probability that her recovery trajectory will not enable her to progress beyond these levels. </span></p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.69in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt">&#8216;The perceived importance of a definitive diagnosis has reduced over time. As is increasingly recognised by clinicians and the Courts, drawing a firm distinction between vegetative state or a minimally conscious state is often artificial and unnecessary. In practice, when assessing &#8216;best interests&#8217; and analysing the information relating to the patient&#8217;s current condition and prognosis for cognitive recovery, the level of certainty to which these can be assessed is often more important than an actual diagnosis. Many patients would want CANH continued until there is a clear sense of the level of recovery that can be achieved. In these patients the prognosis is important as it allows those concerned to make best interest decisions. For example, they may have refused treatment if the Prolonged Disorder of Consciousness (PDOC) assessment showed that they were likely to be left permanently unconscious, but not if they were likely to regain consciousness.&#8217;</span></p>

She relies on the Royal College of Physicians Guidance &#8216;Prolonged Disorders of Consciousness following Sudden Onset Brain Injury&#8217; (&#8216;the PDOC Guidance&#8217;) at page 37. Insofar as it is necessary to determine whether HX&#8217;s correct diagnosis would be permanent VS or MCS, then she is right that it is currently too soon to make that judgment.

Treatment is given in the early stages following severe brain injury in the hope of a good recovery, but must always be in the patient&#8217;s best interests and in line with their likely wishes. Best interests discussions should not be delayed until the condition is diagnosed as &#8216;chronic&#8217; or &#8216;permanent&#8217; but should take place whenever a treatment decision is made&#8217;</span></p>

In the absence of clear evidence about HX&#8217;s views, I have to consider that her life now is one without evidence of enjoyment, and one which, were sensation to return would be one marked principally by the discomfort inherent in being a patient in ICU, which Dr Danbury described as &#8216;torture&#8217;; he told me that those who do recover often experience symptoms of PTSD as a result of their awareness of their experiences. It is therefore perhaps fortunate that HX, who has been in ICU for very much longer than the vast majority of patients, is not apparently experiencing what happens to her. There is, of course, no absolute certainty about that. </span></p>

In HX&#8217;s case, the removing of mechanical ventilation is quite likely to precipitate a further cardiac arrest in circumstances where there have been episodes of apnoea which have required to be corrected by ventilation, as well as some which have not. The withdrawal of CANH will not necessarily be the eventual cause of HX&#8217;s death if the palliative pathway is embarked upon. That path would include the removal of HX&#8217;s invasive treatment devices, and a possible transfer to a palliative care ward or hospice and away from ICU, together with necessary medicine to address any pain or distress. </span></p>

I acknowledge that both HX&#8217;s, and CX&#8217;s, Article 8 rights are engaged by this application &#8211; as are HX&#8217;s Article 2 and 3 rights. There is also no question that any assessment of HX&#8217;s best interests could be coloured in any way by as Ms Kohn puts it, a &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">negative assessment of the intrinsic value of the life she lived prior to her cardiac arrest</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217;. A human life that has been unhappy is just as valuable as one that has been happy, and indeed if anything, HX&#8217;s positive relationship with CX may have been all the more valuable to her for the difficulties she had encountered in other aspects of her life. She may have wanted to live for his sake. She may also have been less concerned than some about notions of dignity.</span></p>

The principal benefit to HX of continuing with mechanical ventilation, and with CANH, would be the simple preservation of her life. That of course is a matter of fundamental importance, but I also must bear in mind the evidence that there is no prospect that any further time will afford any real prospect that HX may ever again enjoy a positive experience of any description. Her loss would of course be a great sadness for her family, but I must consider HX&#8217;s best interests, and the treatment which she must continue to undergo which would cause her great pain and distress, if she were able to experience it, is all that lies before her with no real hope of recovery. Weighing all of the evidence that I have about her as a person, and her views as recounted to me by CX, I cannot find that, if she had known of the situation that she would find herself in, she would have chosen to remain in her current condition indefinitely, with no prospect of ever returning to any level of function. </span></p>

Whilst such a course would be likely necessary to enable HX to leave Intensive Care, it may well precipitate a further cardiac arrest. Such an effort may well therefore lead to a traumatic death at a time when her family cannot be with her. By contrast, a palliative pathway would enable HX&#8217;s body to choose its own time, as part of a peaceful process in which her family can be fully involved. On a careful but clear balance I do consider that the latter outcome is in HX&#8217;s best interests, in all of the circumstances.</span></p>
