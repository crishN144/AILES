She did not in fact return.  There were several subsequent hearings, all of which were directed to enabling Amina&#8217;s solicitor, Miss Anne-Marie Hutchinson, to have a confidential and unrestricted meeting with Amina in Saudi Arabia.  For reasons which it is not now necessary to go into in any detail, it took a very long time for that meeting to be able to take place.  There were problems with regard to passport and visa and other issues.  I am very pleased, however, to record that last week on 27 March 2017 Miss Hutchinson was finally able personally to be present in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and there to meet Amina.  </span></p>

At the very end of that statement, at paragraph 28, Miss Hutchinson says that Amina has read the statement and fully approves its contents and has confirmed that to her in a secure way.   Save insofar as the statement contains the subjective observations of Miss Hutchinson with regard to the demeanour and wellbeing of Amina, the statement can effectively be regarded as the words of Amina herself.  </span></p>

If that cannot be avoided she wishes it to be as limited as possible.  The press coverage of the summer and autumn last year was repeated and reported in Saudi Arabia.  Further press detailed interest, she believes, will impact on her life and her opportunities in Saudi Arabia, particularly and specifically with any prospective employers.  She explained that in Saudi Arabia reputation means everything and she does not wish to engender further press interest in her or for matters to be disclosed which will encourage the press to pursue her.  This will isolate her in Saudi society&#8221;.</span></p>

I perfectly understand and am respectful of the position of Amina and her father and those submissions by their respective counsel.  Nevertheless, it is now part of the history of this case that the original hearing late last July and on 3 August 2016 took place entirely in public without, indeed, any opposition on behalf of Amina herself.  This case did generate considerable coverage in the press and media, from which I must assume that the public did take some interest in it.  It did raise at the time some quite significant issues, both as to the law and as to the approach of this court to making orders in relation to an adult who by then had been living for some time in another sovereign state, namely Saudi Arabia, of which she is a citizen as well as being a British citizen. So the case is one of genuine and legitimate public interest.  In those circumstances, it seems to me that I must enable the public, if they have any continuing interest in this case, to have some knowledge and understanding of the way in which matters have turned out and of the reasons why this case ends today with the proceedings being withdrawn.</span></p>

But as I do so, I wish to stress and underline what Amina herself has said through the statement with regard to further press coverage; and I hope that editors in the media will bear her comments and wishes very much in mind and exercise restraint and discretion in what, if anything, they decide to publish.</span></p>

I travelled to the Sheraton Hilton Hotel in Jeddah with John Neil who, as my sponsor in Saudi Arabia, was obliged to meet me on arrival in Jeddah and to accompany me.  I had made an arrangement with Amina by text and email to meet her that day.  She had also been in communication with Mr Neil in respect of the arrangement.  Amina arrived at the hotel independently and alone, having been dropped by her driver at the hotel.  Following introductions Mr Neil left.  I had a meeting with Amina in a secluded area of the hotel, which was an area that we chose.  We were not overlooked or overheard so far as I am aware.  During the course of our 3.5 hours meeting we moved freely to another sunny outside area of the hotel.  </span></p>

Amina is now committed and determined to resume her education and would very much wish to attend university and be educated to a degree level.  Her objective is that this will be in the UK.  She has made a plan for that to come about.  It is her belief that once she has been able to work in Saudi she will accumulate savings and her father will support her in further education outside Saudi Arabia, including in England.  Her father and her family are aware that it is her wish to return to England to resume her education and that she cannot resume her education in Saudi Arabia.  She is firm in her instructions that her father supports her in this endeavour and accepts that she should complete her further education outside Saudi Arabia if that is what she wishes.</span></p>

She has a privileged life in Saudi Arabia insofar as she is able to work and she has her own driver and she has the support of her father in that endeavour.

She would prefer them to be concluded by way of a withdrawal of the proceedings.  She does not withdraw the allegations made but she does now wish to conclude the proceedings.  She wishes to thank the court and the judge.  Amina instructs that without the proceedings her life would be very different and not where it is now.  Amina is very clear that she would not have what she has now in terms of freedom and a life if it were not for these proceedings.  This is based not only on what the court has achieved for her in terms of orders and her ability to meet outside agencies for assistance but because of the understanding that she has achieved with her father and the reconciliation that they have made in their relationship.  Amina is aware of how to seek outside assistance if ever she needs it.  Amina also wishes me to express her gratitude to the British Embassy and consular staff in Saudi Arabia.  She is grateful for their continued support of her.  She feels that to continue to pursue these proceedings would now be counterproductive. She has come to this decision freely.  She explained that she wishes the court to understand that she makes this decision with full legal advice and in the full knowledge that she is not able to leave Saudi Arabia without her father&#8217;s consent.   She does so on the basis that she trusts her father to continue to comply with the assurances and meet the assurances which he has given to this court and most importantly which he has given to her.  The conclusion of these proceedings will seal their relationship moving forward.  She wishes to repeat and request that there be no detailed press coverage of what she said because she does not wish to further embarrass her family by disclosure of matters in the press.&#8221;</span></p>

The formal part of the order will give permission to Amina to withdraw these proceedings and will discharge all orders previously made within both the present proceedings and the proceedings for a forced marriage order which were themselves dismissed by the order which I made on 3 August 2016.  The precise wording of the order will make crystal clear that the order itself of 3 August 2016, which dismissed those proceedings, remains effective.</span></p>

I am very pleased indeed that the essential message from the statement of Miss Hutchinson is that there has been a great improvement in relationships between Amina and her father, and that they now love and respect each other and have worked out clear understandings as the basis upon which to move forward.  It does not seem to me that these proceedings have been in any sense futile, despite their ultimate withdrawal; and, indeed, in a passage that I have quoted within the statement Amina herself has stated that &#8220;she would not have what she has now in terms of freedom and a life if it were not for these proceedings.&#8221;  I part from this case with my very sincere and genuine best wishes to Amina and her father and her family for their future relationships and their future lives generally.  </span></p>

I have also received the utmost assistance at every stage of these proceedings from the three counsel who have been involved, Mr Henry Setright, Queen&#8217;s Counsel, and Mr Michael Gration on behalf of Amina, and Mr Marcus Scott-Manderson, Queen&#8217;s Counsel, on behalf of the father.  I am immensely grateful to all three of them.</span></p>
