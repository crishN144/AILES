	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In this matter I am concerned with what has been listed as an application for permission to appeal, with appeal to follow if permission is granted against an order made by District Registrar Murphy on 7 August 2019 requiring the Appellant to exhibit on oath a true and perfect inventory of the estate of Mohammed Taj (hereafter &#8216;the Deceased&#8217;) and render a true and just account of the administration of the estate of the deceased.  The Appellant, who is the younger brother of the deceased, acts as an Executor of the estate of the Deceased, along with Mohamed Arshad Khan, who is the brother in law of the Deceased&#8217;s second wife.  It would appear from the documents before the court that Mr Khan now asserts that the Appellant has been dealing with the Deceased&#8217;s estate without his knowledge or approval and has raised concerns regarding the Appellant&#8217;s administration of the estate. </p>

On 7 May 2008, a Grant of Probate of the estate of the Deceased was made out of the London Probate Registry to the Appellant and Mr Khan.  The executors swore a gross value of the estate of &#163;18,573,258 with a net value of &#163;8,761,708 (although it is now possible that the Estate may have a value of up to &#163;118M).  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Notwithstanding that a Grant of Probate was made nearly 11 years ago, the Respondents contend that the Appellant and Mr Khan have never provided an inventory of the property comprising the estate nor properly accounted to the beneficiaries for the administration of the Estate, notwithstanding what the Respondents contend is the fundamental duty of executors and trustees to stand ready with such an account.  It is apparent that the Appellant contends that the administration of the Estate has been drawn out largely as the result of an extensive investigation by HMRC into the affairs of the Deceased and, latterly, by the discovery of offshore companies that significantly increase the value of the estate in the way I have described and raise the spectre of a possible fraud on HMRC. </p>

Enclosed with that letter was a draft affidavit for an inventory and account.  The letter gave notice to the Appellant and Mr Khan that a summons would be issued in 14 days if the estate account requested was not forthcoming and invited Gelbergs to confirm that they were authorised to accept service.  No such confirmation regarding service ever appears to have been forthcoming.    </p>

By that affidavit Ms Taj contended that the position in respect of the administration of the Deceased&#8217;s Estate was unclear, that there had been a complete refusal by the Executors to disclose any information despite numerous requests and that when limited information had eventually been supplied it omitted important assets, including the Deceased&#8217;s property portfolio.  Ms Taj asserted that the beneficiaries had real concerns that accounts were only now being attempted, some ten years after the Grant of Probate, and asserted that unless the Appellant and Mr Khan were ordered to give an inventory and account under oath they would continue to delay serving an account and risk further depleting the residuary estate. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Ms Stanley&#8217;s third submission is that the order made by the District Registrar was, in the particular circumstances of this case, premature and an order that no reasonable tribunal, properly directed on the facts and law, could have made, particularly in the unlimited terms chosen by the District Registrar.  Within this context, on behalf of the Appellant Ms Stanley submits that given the uncertainties that attach to the administration of the estate (in particular the ongoing HMRC investigation, the difficulties in identifying the extent of the estate upon the discovery of offshore assets, the alleged refusal of Gelbergs and the Estate&#8217;s accountants to release their files and the allegations now raised by Mr Khan against the Appellant, Gelbergs and the Estate accountants), the Appellant&#8217;s duty to provide a &#8220;true and fair&#8221; account could not extend beyond the interim estate account provided on 5 July 2019 and, in any event, it would now be <span style="font-style:italic">impossible</span> for the Appellant to swear on oath as to the truth and justice of <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> account at this stage.  Further, Ms Stanley submits that, in any event, given the highly contentious nature of the matter, it is only suitable for determination in the Chancery Division, particularly in circumstances where an application is proposed to be issued by the Appellant under CPR Part 64. </p>

In this regard, Ms Stanley prays in aid the fact that an Inventory and Account is a process not an event.  Relying on Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate (21st Edn.) at para [42-28], Ms Stanley submits that once an inventory and account has been rendered by the Executors pursuant to the order of the court and the court has investigated it and pronounced for its validity, the Executor cannot be subject to further suits in that regard, opening up the possibility of inconsistent decisions if the action in the Chancery Division came to a different decision as to the true account. </p>

Within this context, Mr Dumont reminds the court that the Appellant has sworn an oath as executor to accept the obligations of that station, one of which is to produce an account if required by the court. </p>

With respect to the Art 6 rights of the executor in this context, Mr Dumont submits that the Appellant&#8217;s civil rights and obligations must be considered in the context of his having taken an oath to provide an account when called upon to do so.

In circumstances where what the law demands is a &#8220;true and just account&#8221;, Mr Dumont submits that there is no difficulty in dealing with such uncertainties, which the estate account can, where necessary, account for by indicating that the relevant items are estimated, provisional or uncertain.  This, submits Mr Dumont, would not offend against the account being &#8220;true and just&#8221;.   Likewise, whilst the inventory must be &#8220;true and perfect&#8221;, it is submitted on behalf of the Respondents that, some 12 years after death, the provision of such a list should not cause difficulty and if any item is still the subject of doubt it can be expressed as such.   </p>

Mr Dumont further points out that the Appellant has already accepted the obligation to provide an account and had attempted, albeit inadequately to do so.

The senior registrar considered the matter in a careful judgment, but some of the points which were taken before him were not taken before me, and some of the points which were not taken before him have been taken before me. So I approach the matter afresh. It might be wondered why such an application is dealt with in the Family Division of the High Court. The answer is that noncontentious probate is part of the jurisdiction of the Family Division, and although this matter could hardly be more contentious, it is, nevertheless, categorised as a non-contentious matter.&#8221; </p>

The executor has appeared under protest, denying the right of the party citing him to call for the inventory, and denying that this court has jurisdiction in this case, as being one involving a question of construction.  This court must sometimes of necessity enter into points of construction before it can decide whether a party, who calls for an inventory, is entitled to require one.  The statute (21H. 8, c.5, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Edw7/6/55/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.4</ref>) enacts that an inventory shall be exhibited in every case without being called for; but this is not done, according the practice of this court, at the present time; the Court now always exercised a discretion whether or not to compel an inventory, and in cases where there has been a great lapse of time between the death of the party and the citation calling for the inventory has frequently refused to enforce the exhibition of an inventory.  In this case the Court must necessarily enter into the question of construction, for if it were to hold that the party is not entitled to call for an inventory, it would in effect be deciding he is not entitled to any part of the property of the deceased.  I am bound to see that a party called for an inventory has an interest to the extent of the citation.&#8221; </p>

However, whilst a beneficiary does not have an absolute entitlement to an account in common form, the court will ordinarily exercise its discretion in favour of ordering an inventory and account and the circumstances in which it will not do so will be limited (see <span style="font-style:italic">Henchley v Thompson</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2017/225" uk:canonical="[2017] EWHC 225 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWHC 225 (Ch)</ref> in the context of beneficiaries of a trust).  The inventory should ordinarily contain a true and perfect description and valuation of all the estate, real and personal, in possession and in action, to which the representative is entitled.  However, the court has a discretion as to the sort of inventory it will accept from a representative (see <span style="font-style:italic">Reeves v Freeling</span> (1812) 2 Phil. 56). It is important to note that an application for an inventory of the estate of the deceased and an account of the executors administration of the estate is a process.  Once the account has been made available the court will investigate the account and, if the court finds that it is true and perfect, will pronounce for its validity. </p>

The summons was not sealed, issued or served on the Appellant.  The Appellant had no notice of the hearing and the order was made without hearing from him or Mr Khan.  Whilst the District Registrar had power both to dispense with service on the Appellant, pursuant to r 66(2) of the NCPR and to proceed without an oral hearing, pursuant to r 61(5) of the NCPR, it is not clear that these steps were taken as the result of a reasoned decision as opposed to procedural confusion. However, as regrettable as these procedural lapses were, I agree with Mr Dumont that the short point is that this appeal proceeds by way of a re-hearing, with this court looking at the matter afresh.  Within that context, the Appellant has had notice of this hearing, has been represented by leading counsel, has had a full opportunity over the course a one day hearing to make each of the points he wishes in opposition to the grant of an order for inventory and account.  In the circumstances, the procedural deficits that afflicted the application before the District Registrar have not afflicted my re-hearing of that application.

However, having regard to the cardinal nature of the obligation on the executor to exhibit an inventory and render an account when called upon, and the importance for the beneficiaries of those steps, it is difficult to see how mere practical difficulties in providing the required inventory and rendering an account can amount to one of the limited circumstances in which the court will refuse to exercise its discretion to order the same under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1925 Act</ref>.  Indeed, the authorities to which I have referred above make clear that even in the face of <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> considerable practical difficulties, such as leaving all relevant paperwork on another continent, will not prevent the court from ordering an account to be rendered, albeit the court may make allowances for the difficulty of the task by way of the timescale within which it requires to the task to be completed.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Within this context, court has discretion as to what is required by way of an inventory.  In so far as there remain doubts as to whether a particular asset should be included in the inventory of the estate, this can be made clear by the Appellant.  This would not offend against the requirement for the inventory to be a true and perfect reflection of the position.  With respect to the rendering of an account of the administration of the estate, the terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1925 Act</ref> make clear that the Appellant&#8217;s task in this regard is to render an account of the administration of the estate to the court.  This requires no more of the Appellant than he provide to the court an account of what the Appellant himself has (with Mr Khan) been doing by way of administration of the estate over the course of the past decade.  As executor with conduct of the administration, that information is within his control and where it is not, for example because former solicitors retain files, he can take steps to recover it.   In addition to not being persuaded that the practical difficulties prayed in aid by the Appellant amount to a reason for refusing to exercise the discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/23" uk:canonical="1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5) c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1925 Act</ref> in principle, I am not persuaded that the practical difficulties that the Appellant advances <span style="font-style:italic">in fact</span> prevent him from giving the court an account of his administration of the estate.  Further, and once again, the law demands a true and just account.  Within this context, I am satisfied that the estate account can, where necessary, indicate that information is provisional or uncertain.  This would not offend against the account being true and just account of the position.   The court can have regard to the contended for uncertainties in the inventory and/or account in determining whether to vouch for that inventory and account.   </p>

Whilst it is correct that the Respondents now seek to remove the executors by way of an administration action in the Chancery Division, this does not act to absolve the Appellant of his obligation to provide an inventory and render an account of his administration of the estate.  Again, the authorities are clear that executor will remain liable to provide an inventory and an account of his administration of the estate even after he has been removed as an executor or his administration has expired.  Whilst I also accept that it is the stated intention of the Appellant to seek directions in the Chancery Division in circumstances where he contends the validity of the will is now in question, I cannot but be sceptical regarding the timing of that development.  In any event, notwithstanding the application for directions, the Appellant will remain under an obligation to provide an inventory and account for the reasons I have set out pursuant to his cardinal obligations as an executor. </p>

With respect to the Appellant&#8217;s ground of appeal against the costs order made by the District Registrar, during the course of the hearing leading counsel agreed that the sensible course would be for the court to deal with that question following judgment.  Within this context, I am content to receive, within 14 days of the handing down of judgment, such written submissions as the parties wish to make on (a) the Appellant&#8217;s ground of appeal dealing with the costs order made by the District Registrar and (b) the costs statements that have been served in this appeal in accordance with CPR PD 44 para 9.5(4)(b)). </p>
