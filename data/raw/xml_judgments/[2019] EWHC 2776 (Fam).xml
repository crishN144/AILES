	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">This is an application made by Mr Subtain Ali, the Respondent/Cross-Applicant, who I will refer to as the husband.  The application, according to the application notice, is for an order that the decree absolute pronounced on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016; the decree nisi pronounced on 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2016; the order for deemed service of Deputy District Judge Yeshin on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016;  and the resulting certificate of entitlement to a decree dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2016, in cause number RM15D01195, concerning the marriage of Rodrigues Barbosa and Subtain Ali, all be set aside. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The facts of the case, in summary, are that the husband and wife married in Scotland on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2014.  The wife is a Portuguese national and the husband is a Pakistani national.  The wife, therefore, has EU rights.  The wife&#8217;s petition to divorce the husband was issued on 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> June 2015 on the pleaded facts of unreasonable behaviour, but the allegations in the petition are disputed.  The address for service of the petition given by the wife was Flat 3, 58 Broughton Road, Edinburgh, EH7 4EE, which I will refer to as Broughton Road. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The husband accepts he lived at that address from March 2015.  It is his case that he left on 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015. It is the wife&#8217;s case that the husband either continued to live at the address or had access to it after that date. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The Court posted the petition to that address on 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2015 and it was returned to sender.  On 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October, the wife&#8217;s then solicitors instructed a process server, Robert Carrigan, to serve the petition.  Mr Carrigan visited the address on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015 and he filed an affidavit of service.  According to that affidavit, he said that he attended the address on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October.  He knocked repeatedly on the door, received no reply and left a calling card addressed to Subtain Ali, which bore Mr Carrigan&#8217;s name and telephone number.  He called again on 31<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> October, again received no reply. He then said the following in his witness statement;  <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;On Monday 22</span><span style="font-style:italic;vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span><span style="font-style:italic"> November 2015, I received a telephone from a male who identified himself as Subtain Ali, who said he&#8217;d received my calling card.

The Court replied stating that the issue fee had not been paid.  A further letter was then sent, accompanied by a cheque.  On 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016, the Court replied saying, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">There&#8217;s no actual application with the paperwork.  Further having established that the respondent does live at the address, they should instruct their agents to leave the papers at the address and apply for deemed service.&#8221; </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I have not seen the application for deemed service. However,  the critical matter  is that on 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> February 2016, an order was sent to the parties from the Family Court at Romford with an order from Deputy District Judge Yeshin made on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">As I have said, that order was sent by the Court to both sides, although obviously the husband says that he did not receive it.  The husband was in Pakistan from 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January 2016 to 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2016.  A certificate of entitlement to a divorce was issued on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2016 and decrees nisi and absolute were pronounced in the Romford Family Court on, respectively, 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April and 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2016.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The husband petitioned for divorce in Scotland on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2016, three years and five months after the date of the marriage and at least two years and three months from the date of the separation.  On 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2017, the Edinburgh Sherriff Court and Justice of the Peace Court pronounced the decree absolute, which I will refer to as the Scottish decree. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">It is worth noting at this point that the date of the petition to divorce and indeed the date of  both the  English and Scottish decrees is highly important to the husband&#8217;s immigration status because one way in which a former EEA family member can retain a right of residence is if the marriage exceeded three years in length.  If the English decree stands, then it would not exceed three years in length.  If the Scottish decree stands, it would exceed the three year period. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015, the wife had written to the Home Office, setting out her name, her Portuguese ID card number, her residence and stating &#8220;I was married to Mr Ali,&#8221; setting out his passport number and the last known address as being the Broughton Road address, and she went on to say, &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">I want to cancel my sponsorship.  We are already separated from January 2015 and I have already started my divorce proceedings in March/April 2015.  Because Subtain Ali currently changes his address and returning letters, our divorce is still in process and taking too long.</span>&#8221;  She goes on to say she wants to cancel her sponsorship or any responsibility for Mr Ali. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In those circumstances, there are three issues before me.  Was the petition or the application in the English proceedings served in accordance with the Family Procedure Rules?  Should the Deputy District Judge&#8217;s order for deemed service be set aside; and if there was a procedural irregularity, can it be rectified. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The relevant Family Procedure Rules are as follows.  Because the application was served in Scotland, the starting point is FPR 6.43, which concerns where service is to be effected on a party in Scotland.  That then refers one back to 6.26(5) &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Any document to be served in proceedings must be sent, or transmitted to, or left at, the party's address for service unless it is to be served personally or the court orders otherwise.&#8221; </span></p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1in;margin-right:1.04in;text-indent:0in">&#8220;Putting the issue in its wider context, Mr Murray helpfully took me to the discussion, in the eighth edition of <span style="font-style:italic">De Smith&#8217;s Judicial Review</span> &#8230; of current thinking about the distinction in public law (that is, public law as the expression would be understood by administrative lawyers, rather than as it might be understood by family lawyers) between acts or decisions which are void and those which are voidable.  It is reassuring to see that family lawyers are not the only ones who struggle with the distinction, for the authors observe that &#8220;Behind the simple dichotomy &#8230; lurk terminological and conceptual problems of excruciating complexity&#8221; and go on to cite (para 4-070) a dispute within the Academy where the view of one corner is denounced by the other as &#8220;a tissue of pseudo-conceptualism behind which lurks what is in reality a pragmatic conclusion.&#8221;  Grateful though I am to Mr Murray, it is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to chart these difficult waters, though I note the view of the authors that in the public law context the distinction has been &#8220;eroded&#8221; by the courts, which &#8220;have become increasingly impatient with the distinction.&#8221; </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">There is a trend in divorce law, and as can be seen from paragraph 101 of <span style="font-style:italic">M v P,</span> and in public law administrative law, to move away from technical distinctions of void and voidable and look perhaps more rigorously at prejudice and change of position. </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in">There plainly remains a category of case where a decree or an order will simply be void, see <span style="font-style:italic">M v P</span> paragraph 94, but in my view, the most obvious examples of that is where there is simply no jurisdiction to make the order or where there is fraud </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In my view what the case law shows is that when it comes to failures related to service, it is appropriate to look at the nature of what went wrong and where the prejudice, if any, lies.  It follows from the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Wiseman v Wiseman</span> that not all errors related to service necessarily render the decree simply void.  In my view it cannot be the case that any failure to serve, in strict accord with rules, renders a decree void because to reach that conclusion would create obvious injustice, particularly in the case where one of the parties may be seeking to avoid service, for whatever reason. Further there is nothing on the face of the rules that would force the Court into the conclusion that an error in respect of service necessarily rendered the ultimate decree void.  In other words, the principle of the outcome being void is not one dictated by the Rules themselves, let alone the statute. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Applying those principles to the facts of this case, first of all the wife put on the application the last known address and she had no reason to know, as at 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2015, that the husband had left Broughton Road.  As I have recorded, she checked the address by using an  appropriate website, 192.com, to try to ascertain his address. The evidence suggests she tried to find from him whether he had moved, so this is not a case where there was any fraud or, in my view, any failure to take reasonable steps to find the husband&#8217;s location. Therefore there were no grounds for the wife not to put on the application the Broughton Road address. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Secondly, the process server tried to serve personally and spoke to a man who identified himself as the husband and said would meet him at the address.  The process server had no reason to believe that was not the husband, so the process server was, in my view, fully entitled to believe that the husband was still living at the address. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Thirdly, there is some evidence to suggest that the husband was seeking to avoid service.  I make no findings of fact on this, not having hard any oral evidence, but given the fact that the marriage had broken down and  the husband was in the UK on a spousal visa  possibly simply reliant on EEA rights as a spouse, he therefore necessarily had a precarious immigration status.  In those circumstances it it is surprising that he did not take steps either to pick up his mail or to arrange forwarding of mail unless he was seeking to avoid service. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">To the degree that there were any procedural errors in that order and, as I understand it, the errors that Ms Roeb relies on are that the application was not served by post or other service, but rather left at the property by the process server and that she says that the District Judge could not be satisfied that the respondent had received the application; in my view, any such error does not render either the order or the subsequent decrees and orders void. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In respect of any prejudice to the husband, it is not being suggested that if he had received the application in October 2015, he would have had any grounds to resist the divorce.  He is, of course, prejudiced by the fact that if the English decree absolute stands, the marriage did not subsist for three years, which is important as I have said in immigration law, but the issue there is not whether he was prejudiced by the failure to serve. As far as I can see, there is no prejudice from the failure to serve. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On the other hand, the prejudice to the wife is extreme because she has remarried and, as I understand the timing, if the English decree is set aside, then her second marriage would have been made at a time when the first marriage persisted.  That would be a very serious impact on her, her second husband and the child. </p>
