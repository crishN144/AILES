Following his birth, he suffered two episodes of infection, one of which developed into meningitis, and possibly ventriculitis, resulting in extensive brain damage and microcephaly. He remained in hospital until 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2015 at which point he was discharged, but readmitted on 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January suffering from a lower respiratory tract infection. There were also concerns that he was aspirating his feed secondary to gastro-oesophageal reflux. His condition deteriorated and he was intubated to provide further respiratory support. During the period of intubation, he suffered a period of no or low cardiac output lasting thirty minutes, during which he underwent prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is estimated that, during the period of thirty minutes, he would have probably received about three thousand chest compressions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Y was transferred to an intensive care unit where he was taken off the ventilator. Initially his condition stabilised but in the early hours of 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> January his health deteriorated again with a decrease in heart rate and abnormal breathing pattern. His parents were keen that he should receive as much support as possible and a further intubation and ventilation procedure was carried out. This proved particularly difficult and as a result Y suffered a number of complications which necessitated various intrusive procedures including the administration of inotropic drugs to perfuse his lungs so as to facilitate the oxygenation of his blood. He was unable to tolerate any movement and required heavy sedation to achieve physiological stability. Further episodes of cardiac arrest or malfunction followed requiring CPR on several occasions. It was felt that these episodes were due to deficiencies in the cardiac centre in the brain stem. The doctors became concerned that these episodes were likely to recur and that there was no treatment to reverse the effects of the brain damage. They concluded that it was in his best interests not to subject him to repeated episodes of CPR but his parents disagreed, urging them to continue with this treatment. </p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;In our judgment, the intellectual milestones for the judge in a case such as the present are, therefore, simple, although the ultimate decision will frequently be extremely difficult. The judge must decide what is in the child&#8217;s best interests. In making that decision, the welfare of the child is paramount, and the judge must look at the question from the assumed point of view of the patient&#8230;there is a strong presumption in favour of a course of action which will prolong life, but that presumption is not irrebuttable. The term &#8216;best interests&#8217; encompasses medical, emotional, and all other welfare issues.

As a result, he is microcephalic with a head circumference significantly below the 0.4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile. His pupils are fixed. He has low truncal and limb tone. The paediatric neurologists at the treating hospital concluded that he will have severe quadriplegic cerebral palsy with motor deficiencies in all four limbs, severe visual impairment and severe cognitive impairment. He has experienced many episodes of bradycardia and cardiac arrest, attributable to brain stem dysfunction. His condition is said to be irreversible. His weight is below the 0.4<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> centile, attributable in part to the episodes of reflux which in turn are caused by his neurological condition. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0in">The medical team therefore recommends that Y should continue to receive naso-gastric feeds and antibiotics as required for infection, and to be kept comfortable, but there should be no further CPR, nor should the intensive care support be increased from its current level. Thus he would receive no high frequency oscillatory ventilation, nor further inotropic medication or cardiac support, nor would a new central line or intraosseous needle be inserted, both of which procedures are regarded as invasive. The clinicians advise that there should be a further attempt at extubation. Not to take such a course would impose him to physiological imbalance from overventilation, and to the likelihood of lung tissue injury which in turn would further increase the risk of infection. It is the clinicians&#8217; view, however, that if, after extubation, he is unable to support his own respiration, he should not thereafter be re-intubated. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his report, Professor Vloeberghs analysed and summarised the history of Y&#8217;s medical treatment. He examined the October MRI images and confirmed that there is extensive bilateral brain damage, extending into the cerebellum and upper brain stem. Y has reflex movements upon stimulation, which Professor Vloeberghs describes as stereotypical and resulting from significant brain damage leading to autonomy of the brain stem and spinal cord, but no other discernible responses. He thought it unlikely that there was any significant processing of tactile or other environmental information. Professor Vloeberghs advises that, if children in this condition survive, they require full time intensive attention and support. Such long-term disability can be managed, albeit with great effort. Professor Vloeberghs emphasises, however, that his outlook and disability should be disconnected from his current clinical condition. In other words, he stresses &#8211; rightly &#8211; that the application to withdraw and/or withhold treatment relates to issues beyond Y&#8217;s likely profound cerebral palsy. As to his current clinical condition, Professor Vloeberghs agrees with the treating doctors that leaving Y intubated is not realistic. He also agrees that there is a significant risk that extubation will fail and that Y will not be able to breathe unassisted and may suffer a further cardiac arrest.  In all the circumstances, Professor Vloeberghs agrees with the treatment plan &#8211; in other words the doctors should not provide further CPR or intensive care support, in particular no high frequency oscillatory ventilation or inotropes, nor should further attempts be made to insert a central line or intraosseous needle. </p>

This court has profound sympathy for them and admiration for all that they have done for Y. They have fought hard to ensure that every possible treatment is made available for their son. It is clear from Professor Vloeberghs&#8217; conversations with them that they feel that relations with medical staff at the treating hospital have not been as good as might have been hoped. They are, of course, extremely distressed about their son&#8217;s condition. Professor Vloeberghs found, however, that they are fully aware of the extent of his health problems.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In her first statement, the paediatric intensive care consultant responsible for Y&#8217;s care sets out the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options. By continuing attempts at resuscitation, including CPR and inotropic medication, and the refitting of the central line, the clinicians would be keeping open the remote possibility that Y may in due course survive without ventilation. Entirely understandably, this has been the parents&#8217; hope. The doctors, however, do not regard it as realistic. The doctors identify a number of disadvantages if the present treatment is continued. If Y&#8217;s heart were to restart after cardiac arrest, he will be put through the suffering of the initial deterioration leading to the arrest, the resuscitation, and the prospect of further suffering when it occurs again, all to no clinical purpose. The PICU doctors and nurses regard it as unethical to undertake cardiac resuscitation and intensive care escalation in these circumstances, maintaining that this course would not respect Y&#8217;s right for a dignified life, for as long as he survives, and for a dignified death when it comes. The consultant believes that this course would surrender the child to an unknown period of suffering which has the potential to be prolonged. </p>

The doctors stress that they are not proposing the complete withdrawal of intensive care, but only the further escalation of that care. They contend that this course would allow Y a dignified life so long as he remains alive, and will not oblige him to endure further distressing compressions or other intrusive treatment if and when he suffers a further cardiac arrest.</p>
