Z is the son of X (hereafter &#8220;the mother&#8221;) and D (hereafter &#8220;the father&#8221;).  Z&#8217;s maternal grandmother is Y (hereafter &#8220;the maternal grandmother&#8221;) who is currently an intervener in these proceedings.  The local authority applies for a care order in respect of Z by an application issued on 5 November 2015.  Z&#8217;s interests are represented in these proceedings by his children&#8217;s guardian.

I further found that the mother was in contact with the father to a far greater extent than she had admitted prior to the finding of fact hearing, that it is likely that the father is in Syria and is involved in terror related activity in that location, that the mother was aware that the father was so involved and that the father planned that the mother and Z would travel to Syria to join him and to live there.</p>

On 8 July 2016 I gave my reasons for deciding that the local authority should be given permission to disclose the mother&#8217;s statement to the MPS and the CPS, for refusing to restrain the disclosure of my judgment to the MPS and CPS and for attaching conditions to that disclosure.  That disclosure took place subject to the conditions that I have already described.  As I have recounted, the MPS now seek permission to disclose a copy of the statement of the mother dated 13 June 2016 and my substantive judgment dated 21 June 2016 onwards to the Security Service.  </p>

Finally in this regard, Mr Evans and Mr Hill remind the court of Paragraph 7 of the President&#8217;s Guidance which emphasises &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the need to ensure that the operational requirements of the Police and other agencies are not inadvertently compromised or inhibited&#8230;because of any order made by the court</span>&#8221;.  Mr Evans and Mr Hill submit that, having regard to the nature of the task of the Security Service, the risk of the material being published by reason of there being no conditions attached to onward disclosure is outweighed by the desirability of the Security Service being able to operate freely and without the need to return to court.</p>

The strong public interest in the prosecution of serious crime and the punishment of offenders includes the public interest in identifying those who have been guilty of grave offences under the anti-terrorism legislation.  This public interest argues heavily in favour of the court permitting the MPS to make available to the Security Service information which may permit the latter to assist the former in a criminal investigation.  At the same time, the court must ensure it gives effect to laws passed by Parliament aimed at guaranteeing the fundamental rights of the parties to these proceedings, the maintenance and protection of which rights the work of the police and intelligence agencies in a liberal democracy is designed to achieve.  In each case where disclosure is sought, the tension created between these competing principles must be balanced fairly and in a Convention-compliant manner by reference to the factors set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (A Minor)(Care Proceedings: Disclosure) </span>sub nom <span style="font-style:italic">Re EC (Disclosure of Material)</span>.

Whilst the need to encourage frankness is somewhat reduced in this case<span style="font-style:italic"/>in circumstances where the mother has already made frank admissions which have informed the fact finding process, more widely it is important that parents and family members involved in family proceedings can have confidence that, whilst the court may decide it is in the public interest to disclose the material outside the confines of the proceedings, the court will maintain a degree over control over how that material is handled by those to whom it is disclosed.   To paraphrase the words of Burton J in <span style="font-style:italic">Liberty (The National Council of Civil Liberties) v Government Communications Headquarters and Others</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>it is in the interests of all citizens involved in family proceedings to know that the law makes effective provision to safeguard the confidentiality of information provided in family proceedings.</p>

In this case, within the context of the public interest in the proper administration of public justice, the submissions advance by the MPS for not attaching conditions to the onward disclosure are based primarily on operational expediency, the argument being that such conditions will reduce the &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">operational agility</span>&#8221; of the Security Service.  </p>

Where there is clear evidence that this is, or risks being the case then the court can tailor its approach to take account of such difficulties.   However, in circumstances where what is in issue is the disclosure of confidential, and in some cases highly sensitive, material, the court will require evidence concerning the operational impact of refusing disclosure or imposing conditions that goes beyond mere inconvenience.  The mere fact that an agency will be required to return to court to obtain permission for onward disclosure is unlikely to be sufficient, particularly in circumstances where the court is equipped to consider applications for permission urgently in appropriate circumstances, including outside normal court hours.   In this case, the evidence of the impact on the Security Service of disclosing conditions on onward disclosure does not go beyond the bare assertion that it will impact on &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">operational agility</span>&#8221;.

Against this, it is correct to observe that the disclosure that has taken place to date has been to identified individuals whose identity is known to the court and over whom the court can exercise its jurisdiction by way of, in in relation to the MPS, the conditions on onward disclosure set out in the order of 8 July 2016 and, in relation to the paternal relative, by way of undertakings that relative has agreed to give to the court not to disclose the information without further order of the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I have borne in mind the relevant human rights engaged in this case.  Both the mother and Z benefit from the Art 8 right to respect for their private life.  Any interference in that right, which interference will include the disclosure to others of confidential information concerning them, must be necessary and proportionate by reference to the terms of Art 8(2).  Art 8(2) expressly recognises that an interference in the Art 8 right to respect for private life may be necessary and proportionate in the interest of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of rights and freedoms of others.  It is noteworthy that the detection and prevention of terrorism is important in securing each of the goals articulated by Art 8(2).  It is further of note that by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/5/section/1/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss 1(2)</ref> and 1(3) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/5" uk:canonical="1989 c. 5" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Security Service Act 1989</ref>, the function of the Security Service is also closely aligned to securing these goals.    Finally, the need for any interference in the Art 8 right to respect for private life to be necessary and proportionate once again highlights the fact that the decision on an application for disclosure is not simply a binary one and that, whilst permitting disclosure, the court may also impose conditions on disclosure in order to render proportionate disclosure that would, absent such conditions, constitute a disproportionate interference in the Art 8 right to respect for private life.  </p>

In particular, there is no indication of the factors which inform the criterion of necessity in relation to disclosure of that material outside the confines of the Security Service. In the circumstances, beyond the broad criterion of necessity, the court has, in fact, no real indication of the extent to which the factors that would inform a decision by the Security Service to disclose material confidential to these proceedings to a further and unidentified recipient for an unspecified purpose compare to those that this court must apply.

Within this context, I observe once again that such disclosure would, without the attachment of any further conditions, be to recipients unknown to, and possibly outside the jurisdiction of the court and for purposes unknown to the court.  Further, the legal, and certainly the practical reality is that court is unlikely to be able to impose enforceable conditions as to the handling of information on, for example, a foreign intelligence agency to whom the information is disclosed.  In my judgment these matters speak strongly to the need for this court, charged as it is by Parliament with the responsibility for regulating disclosure of information confidential to family proceedings, to require the Security Service to seek the permission of the court <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> it discloses the information in this manner in order that the court can examine the request for disclosure against the criteria it is obliged to apply to all such requests.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My decision raises the possibility of the Security Service needing to make an application to this court for permission to disclose the material outside the Service.  Whilst such applications are ordinarily straightforward, as set out above, given the nature of the Security Service and its manner of operation, an application in this context presents specific potential difficulties.  In particular, the practice of neither confirming nor denying an interest or involvement means that it is unlikely that the Security Service will wish to give notice of such an application in circumstances where, in some situations, simply confirming or denying that an agency is interested in information or seeks information will result in risk that that agency will disclose its interest in, or alert suspects.  In addition, the nature of the disclosure sought means that it is likely the Security Service will thereafter wish to adopt a closed procedure. Given the impact of these contentions on the Art 6 rights of the parties, they will need to be the subject of rigorous examination by the court.   Within this context, I note that The President&#8217;s Guidance recognises that in cases in the family court concerning the issue of radicalisation the court may need to consider the use of closed hearings or special advocates.

The acid test is whether, in all the circumstances, the interference with the individual's Convention right prescribed by national law is greater than is required to meet the legitimate object which the state seeks to achieve.

Rather, it is a question of adapting the existing, well established procedure for such permission applications.  The key adaptations will be the need to recognise the greater likelihood that the initial hearing will need to be without notice to the parties to the proceedings (although it will remain incumbent on the Security Service in each instance to justify a without notice application by reference to the principles set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Re S (Ex Parte Orders)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 FLR 308" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 FLR 308</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">KY v DD</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 2 FLR 200" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 2 FLR 200</ref>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Re C (A Child)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1412" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1412" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1412</ref>) and the possible use thereafter of some species of closed procedure involving the deployment of special advocates when determining the application for permission.</p>
