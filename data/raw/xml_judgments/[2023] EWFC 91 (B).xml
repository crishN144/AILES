The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition that in any report, no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name, current address or location [including school or work place]. In particular the anonymity of the child and the members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.</span></p>

I have also considered the evidence supplied in the bundle, though note that this did not include two recordings exhibited to the father&#8217;s final statement, but which are in a format which is not accessible on judicial or court equipment and which have not been provided in a format that can be viewed by me despite alerting the father&#8217;s solicitors to this prior to the start of the hearing.  However, it is not clear that either recording is relevant evidence required to determine the remaining issues in this case, something that I will return to later in this judgment when clarifying the scope of this final hearing and the various case management decisions which have led up to it.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">It was not necessary to hear evidence from the father, despite the father wanting to give evidence because the father has filed evidence and no party sought to question the father about that.  It is clear (and has been from the outset) that the father feels very strongly that the father has been treated unfairly by various public bodies.  However, as I will cover later in this judgment, those issues are Human Rights Act and discrimination issues which I do not have jurisdiction to determine. The issues in this final hearing were not issues of fact finding that would require evidence from the father, the burden of proof in relation to threshold is in fact on the Local Authority not the father, and the question of whether largely accepted facts meet threshold is a submissions point.  Miss Sparrow submitted in closing that somehow it had been suggested by some that the father was being unreasonable in challenging aspects of whether threshold was met and whether the proposed supervision order support plan was adequate.  I have never suggested that and made the point that it was for the court to determine the scope of the final hearing and that, for A, accepting that threshold was crossed solely on the basis of the mother&#8217;s alcohol use was not necessarily sufficient to enable the court to determine any risk of future harm to A and hence what support either parent may need to mitigate this.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">This had been listed as an attended hearing with permission to the mother to attend remotely as a special measure in light of the allegation of parental acrimony.  However, on the afternoon of the last working day before this hearing was due to commence, the court received an application to permit the father to attend wholly remotely from the father&#8217;s solicitor&#8217;s offices with counsel for the father present at the same location.  It is not clear why such an application was left until the last minute, nor why there was a sudden change in the father being able to cope with a remote hearing.  Previously the father had been very clear that the father could not cope with a remote hearing.  However, no party had any objection and Miss Sparrow for the father was very clear that the father had given instructions and Miss Sparrow was satisfied that the father would be able to participate effectively if remotely connected.  On that basis, I permitted the father and Miss Sparrow to participate remotely.  At the conclusion of day one, the Local Authority and the other parties also sought to participate remotely, which assisted with availability of the previously allocated social worker who was one of the witnesses required to give evidence.  Given the narrow scope of the issues in this final hearing, that the father was participating remotely and had no objection to others doing the same, I granted that request and continued with the remainder of the hearing as wholly remote.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">I mentioned case management and the relevant issues in this case above.  This case has taken over the statutory 26 weeks, partly because of the positive progress being made by both parents in working with professionals, but partly also because of the need to carefully ensure that the father&#8217;s vulnerabilities were catered for and to give the father a proper opportunity to obtain legal representation.  Thus I have directed wholly attended hearings at the request of the father in the early stages when the courts were still grappling with the aftermath of Covid 19 and struggling to accommodate a surge in workload in limited physical courtrooms.  Hearings have been listed for far longer than is standard in public law proceedings to allow for the extra time that the father has been assessed as requiring to process information, as well as to accommodate the fact that the father can become overwhelmed and upset in hearings, resulting in outbursts and hasty retreats from the courtroom.  Inevitably given the strength of sense of grievance that the father has, additional time to keep the focus of the proceedings on A was also required, and the impact on the mother who has also been visibly distressed in hearings at times when the father has become upset has also had to be allowed for.  Initially the father was a litigant in person and the potential for an independent intermediary was also explored at my direction to try to assist the father and in light of what was then known about the father&#8217;s needs, though this has not been pursued by those who represent the father.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">I have taken the time to produce an anonymised written judgment in this case, despite the narrow focus of the final hearing itself, because of the needs of the father so that there can be time for the father&#8217;s solicitors to go through the draft written judgment carefully (and have allowed far longer than the 1 hour for this that Miss Sparrow requested as I have allowed 2 weeks for consideration of the draft judgment).  It has also enabled me to deliver what I hope is a clear written judgment on the two case management aspects that were dealt with at the outset of the final hearing.  Perhaps most importantly, this judgment is potentially then available for A to read when A is old enough and gives me an opportunity to repeat that, although some aspects of the judgment necessarily refer to issues raised by the father, overall A has been and remains my paramount concern and even in dealing with the issues that the father raises this has been the context.</span></p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">When the father was a litigant in person in previous hearings I tried to explain the general legal considerations that a Family court has to apply in these sorts of proceedings including the processes under the Family Procedure Rules (FPR) and Practice Direction (PD) 12A, and the boundaries between the jurisdiction of the Family Court and other jurisdictions such as the European Court of Human Rights, the High Court and the Civil Court.  This was necessary because much of what the father has consistently sought to argue before the court, both before and after obtaining legal representation, has focused on the way in which the father feels the father has been treated by various public bodies, with the father seeking to raise arguments around the Human Rights Act, the actions of public bodies in relation to the performance of their public duties, and arguments around discrimination.  As the father has been repeatedly advised, applications under the Human Rights Act (HRA) seeking particular redress require a specific application to be made under the appropriate process and fall outside of my jurisdiction in the Family Court (they are in fact applications which must be made to the High Court).  Equally, the father has been repeatedly advised that applications under the Disability Discrimination Act fall outside of the Family Court jurisdiction (such applications are Civil and must therefore be made to a Civil court).  Applications seeking a form of redress under Administrative law are also not part of my jurisdiction in the Family Court - those would be applications for Judicial Review to the High Court.  The father seemed initially to be operating under a misapprehension that simply raising these sorts of issues in various documents submitted as intended evidence directed for specific purposes in accordance with Part 22 and PD 22A of the FPR was sufficient to require the Court to conduct some form of inquisition into the actions of, for example, a Local Authority.  Whilst HRA considerations may form part of the overall evidential aspects of a court considering public law proceedings such as these, they are only part of the picture, and only if they are relevant to the issues that the Court needs to determine.  </span></p>

The father also largely accepts that A did not attend school in accordance with expected levels between October 2021 and May 2022 and that there have been numerous moves for A between the mother and the father.  The father does not, however, accept that this crosses threshold for the purposes of section 3.  The father does not accept that the father&#8217;s care of A was in any way below that which would be reasonably expected and argues that many of these aspects arose due to exculpatory or mitigating factors outside of the father&#8217;s direct control.  The father also takes issue with some of the detail of the Supervision Order Support plan, arguing that more support for the father should be recorded as part of that.  As a result, the father does not agree that the proposed Supervision Order Support plan will work and does not therefore agree with a Supervision Order.  Miss Sparrow for the father did not address the issue of whether the overall Final Care Plan at D7-D18 was in A&#8217;s welfare interests.

In the latter case, it was noted by Mr Walthall for the mother that one of the items that the notice sought to adduce related to professional conduct and would, if admitted, potentially necessitate a change in representation for the mother.  That aspect alone highlights the importance of compliance with the timescale set in rule 22.15(2), and the potentially disastrous consequences for a listed final hearing when such notices are not served in good time to enable respondents to respond and, if need be, for the matter to be considered at an urgent further case management hearing.  Given the absence of reasonable explanation for this notice being served so late, the narrow issues that now fall to be considered at this final hearing, and the potential for adjournment of the final hearing if the facts sought to be adduced result in professional embarrassment for the mother&#8217;s legal representatives, I will dismiss this notice to admit facts.</span></p>

It is not disputed by the father that A&#8217;s school attendance during this period when in the father&#8217;s care was around 40%.  The father&#8217;s case, in essence, is that the low school attendance was authorised, arose as a result of difficulties with transport to and from school, was as a result of A&#8217;s anxiety about attending school due to the mother being in rehab at the time, and that the poor school attendance was beyond the father&#8217;s control because neither the father nor the social worker could get A to school.  The father also asserted at A47 in the father&#8217;s response to threshold that the father did ask the school to provide work for A to complete at home, the school suggested a service provider, but nothing came of this despite the father signing the papers concerned. </span></p>

In my view, it is possible that the father's anxiety and coping through avoidance colluded with A's anxiety and avoidance, which had left the parent-child dyad stuck in a cycle of maladaptive coping. It is important to note that background reports indicated that A witnessed potentially traumatic situations involving parental conflict, which may have impacted on [A&#8217;s] ability to self-regulate emotions; avoidance is adaptive in the presence of a real threat and becomes maladaptive in the long-term, or if it is extended to a variety of life situations. I understand from the case documents that A was assessed by the neurodevelopmental team, and that support has been put in place by the educational setting (access to Link project and Safe Space). I believe that the father acted in a manner that the father believed it was in the child's best interest at that time, and that the father struggled to understand the professional perspective or to challenge the father&#8217;s own inflexible beliefs and the father&#8217;s own coping through avoidance.&#8221; (E83)</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Although, as was accepted by the two social workers who gave me evidence, the school absences were authorised, the prior allocated social worker was very clear in oral evidence that a child missing approximately 60% of schooling would be at risk of suffering significant harm through not having their educational needs met.  Thus, whether authorised or not, A missing such a high level of schooling is capable of amounting to significant harm, and there is no credible evidence to discredit the Local Authority evidence that adequate home schooling was not provided as an alternative to meet this need.  In fact, on the father&#8217;s own evidence as noted at A47, the father accepts that school work at home for A was not in place at the relevant date.  I appreciate that the response to threshold at A46-A47 is not a formal witness statement for the purposes of the FPR, but it seems clear that the father wishes this to be taken as such given the lengthy detail.  I find that therefore A was both suffering and at risk of suffering significant harm as a result of A&#8217;s schooling needs not being met arising from the low level of school attendance and lack of suitable alternative provision and thus the first limb of the threshold test is made out in relation to this allegation.  </span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The second aspect of the threshold test is whether the Local Authority have proved, on balance of probability, that this harm can be attributed to the parenting being provided to A by the father.  This does not require the Local Authority to show that the father&#8217;s parenting was solely responsible, or even to demonstrate to what extent the father&#8217;s parenting was responsible as a defined amount of attribution as would be the case in relation to, for example, Civil liability.  The legislation and subsequent case law simply requires the Family Court to consider whether this arises from some deficiency in parental care as I have noted earlier.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The case that was put on behalf of the father seemed to be that A was in fact beyond any parental control in relation to addressing low school attendance because neither the father nor the social worker could get A to school as I noted earlier.  It was accepted by the former allocated social worker, when questioned by Miss Sparrow, that even with the Local Authority providing transport to and from school (as requested by the father) and the social worker attending at the family home to try to persuade A to get in the car to go to school, this did not result in A attending school.  Miss Sparrow submitted that a higher level of parenting should not be expected of a lay parent, and this is in accordance with the legislation and case law which emphasises that the issue is, objectively, what it is reasonable to expect a parent to provide by way of parenting.  I fully accept that, as seems to be acknowledged by all concerned, that the issue of school attendance for A involved a host of complex factors and, by the time the allocated social worker was involved in trying to persuade A to go to school, had been an issue for a significant period.  Based on the evidence of the psychological assessment at E83 noted above, and the recordings I have noted on the social work chronology, it does seem that A did not receive the sort of parenting from the father that it would be reasonable to expect be provided because a) the father&#8217;s own anxieties are more likely than not to have contributed to any anxiety that resulted in A having authorised absences; and b) the failure to engage promptly and, at times, at all, with the school will have contributed to a lack of resolution of the issue for A.  I therefore find that this threshold allegation of significant harm both being suffered and likely to be suffered by A in relation to low school attendance was attributable at least in part to the parenting provided to A by the father.  In saying that, I wish to make it clear that this does not rule out other contributory factors, but it is not necessary for me to delve into those because I do not have to carry out any determination of the extent to which other factors may or may not have also played a part.   I am also clear that the Local Authority has never put its case in relation to this on the basis that the father was solely or mainly responsible for this either.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The next threshold allegation that is disputed by the father is that A has been exposed to the parents&#8217; acrimonious relationship with each other.  It seems to be accepted by the father that there were arguments between the mother and the father, and that these were often abusive towards the father (A50).  The father&#8217;s case seems to be that the father did not in any way expose A to such arguments, was never abusive to the mother and that any conflict between the parents was solely attributable to the mother&#8217;s behaviour and drinking.  That A was present for some of the incidents between the parents referred to in the social work evidence does not appear to be disputed.  This includes two incidents in the chronology at C7 and C8 when the former allocated social worker accepted being present part of the time when giving evidence to me.  One of those on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:Arial">st</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> May 2021 seems to have resulted in the father accepting that the father locked the mother in the house to enable the father to leave the house with A.  The social worker was very clear in evidence to me that both parents have a responsibility to protect A from any parental conflict.  I can also take judicial notice of the fact that a child does not need to be physically present to be potentially aware of and/or harmed by parental conflict.  It also seems clear, even on the father&#8217;s evidence, that the relationship between the mother and the father was extremely fraught and characterised by arguments between both and abuse from the mother towards the father.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">I have used the term &#8216;conflict&#8217; rather than acrimony in considering this threshold allegation because a) that is actually often used fairly interchangeably within the papers in this case despite the dictionary definitions being different as Miss Sparrow noted, and b) because, in my view, from A&#8217;s perspective </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:Arial">conflict</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> between the parents would be potentially harmful regardless of whether that could be categorised as including bitter and angry words from the father.  Again, looking at the two stages of the test and the evidence in this case, I am satisfied that a failure to protect A from the parental conflict in this case would mean that A was likely to suffer significant emotional harm.  In terms of whether this was attributable to the parenting of the father etc, on the limited admissions of there being arguments between the mother and the father when A was either present, or not present but whereby those arguments would be likely to affect either or both parent and for A to become subsequently aware of those effects, and the father&#8217;s acceptance of becoming distressed and needing to minimise direct contact with the mother, I find that this was in part attributable to the father failing to protect A as A should be able to expect a reasonable parent to do.  As with the earlier disputed threshold allegation, I do not need to go further into apportionment of responsibility between the parents.</span></p>

That A has had multiple moves between the parents, and that some of these have taken place at very short notice due to the mother&#8217;s alcohol issues is not in fact in dispute.  The father takes issue with the use of the word &#8216;unplanned&#8217;, Miss Sparrow exploring in cross examination that some of the moves were actually in accordance with safety planning that the Local Authority had put in place to deal with lapses in sobriety by the mother.  This was accepted by the Local Authority witnesses, though the former allocated social worker did tell me that A had suffered significant instability and some moves were not part of safety planning.  It was also accepted by the social workers that A wanted to live with the mother and that the father may well have been trying to act in accordance with A&#8217;s wishes and feelings in returning A to the mother&#8217;s care.  </span></p>

It links to the first threshold criterion in relation to school attendance, I find, because it must have had the potential to exacerbate A&#8217;s anxieties and moving to live with the father also added considerably to journey times to and from school as the father set out in evidence.  However, I am not clear why the Local Authority seems to have allowed this to happen repeatedly and to have endorsed some level of safety planning whereby A moving to live with the father was part of the protective measures to be deployed if the mother relapsed.   The former allocated social worker accepted that some of the instability experienced by A was therefore at the instigation of the Local Authority.  </span></p>

Whilst this does indeed evidence significant instability for A, I am not satisfied on balance of probabilities that when the father removed A from the care of the mother due to concerns about the mother&#8217;s drinking, that this was anything other than a parent acting reasonably to protect a child.  Viewed from A&#8217;s perspective, A would no doubt want a balance to be struck between honouring A&#8217;s wishes to remain in the care of the mother, but also to be kept safe from any harm likely to arise from the mother being under the influence.  It is curious that, in pursuing this threshold allegation, the Local Authority has not explicitly addressed the point made on behalf of the father by Miss Sparrow that safety planning under the proposed Supervision Order continues to include the father providing what is effectively respite care if the mother relapses.  I accept that this is not solely dependent on the father, as there will be others including the mother&#8217;s partner who will be potentially able to assist with this too.</span></p>

The social worker also acknowledged that, with the benefit of hindsight, when allocated to the case it was a complex situation, things were quite chaotic at the time and it was not one parent or the other but the situation itself that was challenging, and that at times the social worker&#8217;s responsibility to challenge a parent led to a very challenging relationship with the father.  The team manager&#8217;s evidence to me when asked by Miss Sparrow about whether a Child Arrangements Order would meet A&#8217;s welfare needs was unequivocally that this would not meet A&#8217;s welfare needs.</span></p>

As the team manager told me in evidence, although Ward Andrews, who conducted the parenting assessment of the father and made this recommendation, can offer this service, the practice of A Local Authority is to use another service.  It is not within my jurisdiction to compel a local authority to use a particular advocacy service, and the main concern, which is that there should be a referral for such a service, has been addressed by adding this to the plan, I find.</span></p>

	    <p class="Body" style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Arial">In terms of the safety planning details if there is a relapse, it is clear again in the final care plan that A is quite aware of the safety plan and will be able to call upon those family members identified as able to support in those circumstances (D8-D9), so I am unclear why the father feels that more details need to be provided.  It seems to acknowledge A&#8217;s growing maturity that A should be given some autonomy and thus input to who to call if the mother has a relapse, I find.  It was also put to the team manager by Miss Sparrow that there was effectively no contingency if the mother&#8217;s relationship with the mother's current partner were to end.  The team manager was very clear that the safety plan does not rely solely on the mother&#8217;s partner but also other family members.  I&#8217;m also not clear why the father fears that the relationship may end since there is no current evidence of any issue and they have been in a relationship for over three years at this point.</span></p>

Such plans can and do change depending on the circumstances of the family in any event.  The question for the court is whether a Supervision Order is in A&#8217;s welfare interests and necessary and proportionate, and whether what is proposed in terms of the support under that order for A and A&#8217;s parents to enable them to meet A&#8217;s needs is sufficient to mitigate any identified risks for A.  It does not have to entirely remove risk and cannot cater for unforeseen eventualities.  Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that a 12-month Supervision Order is in A&#8217;s welfare interests and necessary and proportionate to mitigate the risks to A from any repetition of the harm that A has previously suffered.  The amended support plan does now address the legitimate professional concerns of the Guardian, and it is clear from both the plan and final care plan that in fact the local authority is intending to provide the sort of support that the father agrees may be necessary to enable the father to parent A to a good enough standard.  It is not necessary to require the local authority to provide more detail about this since it is clear that further work needs to be done with the father to help tailor that support more appropriately.  That does not, however, necessitate the continuation of these proceedings and is something that can be achieved under the auspices of a final Supervision Order, I find.</span></p>

I have also noted how positively both parents have worked with A Local Authority in the best interests of A, and how clear it is that A loves them both very much and they love A.  A is clearly a delightful, articulate, intelligent and mature child, which must also be a reflection of the mother and the father as A&#8217;s parents despite the issues that have affected all three. The outcome of these proceedings for A overall was not in dispute and both parents also deserve great credit for this, and I wish all of them the best for the future.</span></p>
