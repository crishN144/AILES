	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents accept the injuries as described but have remained consistent in denying that either of them intentionally caused harm to D at any time.  The parents consider it likely that the father caused the bruising to D accidentally when asked to hold him firmly during the pre-operative procedure to repair his cleft lip and palate on 24 February 2023 when D was hungry, distressed and wriggling.  The parents both say that the anaesthetist asked him on two or three occasions to hold D more firmly.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents were unaware of the rib fracture until told by the hospital on their account.  The only incident the parents can think of which might have caused the rib fracture was on 11&#160;February 2023 when they left the children for a few hours with their friends, F and E, who were staying with them over the weekend.  The friends reported that C had climbed onto the bed and was found by F in the beside-me cot, on top of D.  </p>

At the twenty-week scan in June 2022, they were told that the baby had a cleft lip and palate.  They both agreed that a termination was not an option for them.  D was born by caesarean section at the North Middlesex Hospital  at thirty-six weeks gestation.  He remained in the neonatal intensive care unit for 9 days to stabilise and enable his feeding routine to be established.  He required a special adapted squeezy bottle to be fed with a specialised teat, as well as the careful syringing of his palate after each feed to prevent infection.  The parents spent most of the time in hospital with him whilst C stayed with her maternal grandparents nearby.</p>

For instance, they have been noted to have had a positive engagement with the local authority safety plan and written agreement, hence why the section 20 agreement was assessed to be a proportionate measure to safeguard the children.  Both parents have shown that whilst the allegations were made against them are deeply upsetting to them, they are willing to comply in order for the inquiries to demonstrate their position that they have not placed any of their children at risk of significant harm, nor will they do so in the future, as well as providing some evidence of their commitment to resolving the issue.  This demonstrates that consistently the parents have offered a unified explanation to family and friends.  If various contradicting narratives were conveyed during the support network interviews, this would certainly raise questions about the parents' capacity to maintain transparency and credibility.&#8221;</p>

It was reportedly B's concern that encouraged maternal grandfather to seek medical attention.  This eventually led to B permanently leaving his work to become a full-time carer for his father-in-law, as well as to be more physically present to support his wife during the pre and postnatal periods as she was experiencing a difficult pregnancy.  B's ability to effectively care for A's health needs has also been observed by the family GP nurse, who commented, 'B, I think, does an amazing job'.&#8221;</p>

There has also been no suggestion that B may have a neuro-developmental difference, such as autism or ADHD.  My assessment did not reveal that B had any difficulties forming warm, secure, stable relationships.  As part of this my assessment did not indicate any difficulties with anger management.  For example I observed no angry outburst towards professionals in B's GP records, nor does B have anything concerning on his police record, nor did B appear overly defensive during our clinical interview.  Any frustration and resentment which B had expressed regarding current investigations appear to be fairly common expected expressions, given the unusual and stressful situation he is in.  He did give the impression of being someone who was reluctant to become emotionally vulnerable with too many people.  However, this appeared to be within the bounds of expected personality differences and preferences.  I am not of the opinion that this is a cause for concern."</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:1in">&#8220;D has suffered a fracture of the posterior right eighth rib which, in my opinion, is in the region of three to ten weeks of age on 1 March 2023.  The radiological dating of any fracture is difficult, imprecise and a subjective estimation.  The rib fracture is the result of significant force applied to the bone.  The amount of force required to cause this fracture is unknown, but in my opinion it is significant, excessive, and greater than that used in the normal care and handling of a child.  This fracture would not have occurred from normal domestic handling, over-exuberant play, or rough, inexperienced parenting.  </p>

At the time the fracture occurred, I would expect that D would have been in pain and shown signs of distress which would have lasted for some moments.  Following this initial distress, the signs and symptoms relating to this fracture could have been variable, but I would defer to the paediatricians in all aspects of clinical presentation, both at the time the fracture occurred and subsequently.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:1in">&#8220;To cause any fracture requires both a suitable mechanism and a significant level of force.  Rib fractures are typically the result of a severe excessive squeezing compressive force applied to the chest.  The amount of force required to cause these fractures is unknown, but in my opinion, it is significant.  For example, in life-saving cardiac massage where the chest is forcibly compressed by one-third of its diameter, rib fractures rarely occur.  Alternatively, an isolated rib fracture could occur from a direct blow or impact at the fracture site.  From the radiological appearances, I am unable to determine if the posterior right eighth rib fracture is the result of squeezing, a squeezing compressive force or a direct blow impact.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:1in">&#8220;The action of kneeling on and compressing a child's chest could create a suitable mechanism to result in a rib fracture.  To cause the rib fracture, there would need to be significant compression of the chest.  Child development and strength is outside my area of expertise, and I would therefore defer to the paediatricians with regard to the likelihood of C being able to cause the rib fracture from this scenario.  In my opinion, a kneeling event on or around 10 or 11 February 2023 could account for the appearances of the rib fracture on 1 March.  In my opinion, restraint of D for any medical procedure or investigation would not generate sufficient force to cause a rib fracture.&#8221;</p>

This is unlikely to be due to the gripping episode, as such a large bruise is unlikely to result from this action and this area.  This bruise remains unexplained and may have resulted due to other mechanisms, such as squeezing the tissues with force.

This history requires clarification, as the gripping episode happened during the anaesthetic on 23 February.  The sequence of events that leads to a bruise are as follows.  The injured area turns red within a few minutes.  This is followed by blood beginning to track out of blood vessels in the next few minutes, and this starts to stain the tissues leading to the bruise.

As no mention about the child's distress has been made at this stage, it is unlikely that this incident led to the rib fracture.  C falling headlong is unlikely to cause a single rib fracture, as the force is unlikely to be concentrated on just a small area.  D would have been in severe pain, taking a lot of consoling to stop him from crying when he sustained the rib fracture.  No external signs are usually visible.  A carer who was present when the incident happened is very likely to have been alerted by his cry of distress, however, they may not have realised that the child had sustained fractures.  As no external signs will be seen on his body to alert a carer if they were not present at the time of the incident, they may have dismissed his discomfort on handling due to non-specific reasons.  </p>

His view was that the variation in pain responses was in how long and how loud babies cry for, not whether they cried at all.  On the bruises he maintained his position that dating bruises is difficult and caution is required.  He would expect bruising to appear in a matter of hours, due to blood leaking out of the damaged blood vessels.

Both parents confirmed that they were worried about his mouth, the stitches and the bleeding, and whether he had become dehydrated.  They did not bathe him between 23 and 28&#160;February.  Their bedroom had the curtains closed and fairly dim lighting.  </p>

The father was clear that C had climbed onto an upturned curry pot to get onto their bed.  F did not remember that.  </p>

It was only during the trial itself that the mother said that she had WhatsApp messages from 11 February whilst the parents were out.  A message timed at 22.34 asks, &#8220;How is D doing?&#8221; from her friend E.  She replies saying, &#8220;Absolutely fine.

I immediately followed C as I knew D was sleeping.  When I walked into the bedroom, I saw C kneeling on top of D's stomach. I could see both C's knees on D's stomach.  I believe she had climbed on the bed and then gone towards the cot in which D was sleeping in.  I immediately removed C from D.  D appeared to be grumpy as he had been woken up, but appeared half asleep with his eyes closed.  It looked like he wanted to go back to sleep.  D was not upset nor was he crying.  D appeared groggy.  I picked up C and went to E and told her what had happened.  I told E to check on D.  E went to check on D and came back about fifteen seconds later and said, &#8216;Everything is fine, as D has gone back to sleep.&#8217;  D slept until A and B returned.

There are concerning injuries in a non-mobile child.  The combination of bruising and rib fractures are timed by the experts as occurring on at least two separate occasions.  As far as the rib fracture is concerned, Dr Johnson and Dr Rahman accept that it is possible for it to have been caused by the C incident, but Dr Rahman's view is that it would have caused significant pain for a short period of time, which does not fully accord with the babysitters&#8217; or parents&#8217; evidence.  </p>

He did not accept that the larger bruise would have been caused that way.  Furthermore, the hospital entry for 23 February says, &#8220;No bruising noted&#8221;.  The parents changed the baby's nappy, washed him, stripped him down to his nappy several times a day between 23 and 28 February, albeit in a darkened room.  If the bruising was there, surely they would have seen it.  The hospital again did not note any bruising on the admission on 27 February at 4.00&#160;a.m.  The local authority submit that there were two occasions when looking after this vulnerable, needy baby became too much for the parents and that one of them lost their self-control when sleep-deprived and injured the baby and that the other parent has colluded.  They do not posit a specific mechanism for them injuring the baby, but they had care of the child; no one else did during the relevant times.</p>

There is convincing evidence from several sources of their individual, strong, attuned physical and emotional parenting abilities.  The maternal grandparents have a close relationship and frequent contact with them and the children.  The parents sought medical advice for D for their health concerns on very many occasions after the period when he was allegedly injured by them.  There is no evidence of any attempt to conceal or hide D from professional scrutiny, quite the opposite.  If even one parent had injured D and the other was not aware of it, allowing this amount of professional contact from health visitor, practice nurse, GP, specialised cleft palate nurse, and the hospital would be surprising.</p>

It is within this context, when I saw the father demonstrate in the witness box how he was holding the wriggling baby and told to grip tighter on two or three occasions, I found it easy to accept that a child might have been bruised in the way D was during that episode.  It would be unusual, but I do not find it impossible to believe, that the extent of the coloration of the bruising and, therefore, the appearance to the parents did not become obvious to the parents caring for the child post-serious surgery, particularly on a child with darker skin, until some five days later.  </p>

I accept that the baby did cry out before F came into the room.  E's evidence, corroborated by the late disclosed WhatsApp message, refers to that cry.  The lack of a cry and distress in the baby, which gave concern to the paediatrician, is not sufficient enough for me to discount the parents' explanation for the fracture.  Both experts accept the mechanism and timing are possible.  I find that these explanations, incomplete as they are, are a more likely explanation than that one of these otherwise impeccable parents, with no evidence of depression, drugs, alcohol or other concerns, no evidence that they were not coping, deliberately injured their much wanted baby on two separate occasions, and that the other parent either has colluded, putting their children at risk, or was not aware of it.  It just does not sit with their willingness to have D seen by so many professionals throughout the relevant period and risk being discovered.</p>

For all these reasons, on the balance of probabilities, I do not find the local authority to have proved that the parents caused the injuries.  The threshold for state intervention is not met.
