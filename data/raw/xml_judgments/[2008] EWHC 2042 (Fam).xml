On occasions during the Schedule 1 proceedings I have permitted Dr Pelling to address me and make submissions. My recollection, which is challenged neither by the father nor by Dr Pelling, is that it was Dr Pelling himself who suggested this, making the point, with which I agreed, that since the matters on which he sought to address me involved technical points of law and procedure it would be simpler and quicker if he, with all his knowledge of such matters, addressed me rather than the father. </p>

On that occasion the mother had appeared in person, assisted by a McKenzie friend, Mr David Holden, and the father likewise in person assisted by Dr Pelling as his McKenzie friend. It is common ground that Pauffley J permitted both Mr Holden and Dr Pelling to address her. In a witness statement dated 22 July 2008 Dr Pelling, having referred to the principle that this should be permitted only in &#8216;exceptional&#8217; circumstances, says &#8220;I can&#8217;t recall [Pauffley J] making any specific finding as to what the exceptional circumstances were, if indeed there were any, and I rather think that problem was slurred over by everyone, including the Judge, in order to get on with the case as smoothly and expeditiously as possible.&#8221; In the unsigned draft of this witness statement, which Dr Pelling himself sent me before the sitting of the court on 22 July 2008, the passage I have just quoted continued, &#8220;It is my observation that this happens quite a lot in the secret courts of the Family Division and in Family proceedings in the County Courts. Whether it is lawful is another matter but not for me to say. It is also true that Mr Justice Munby himself has adopted the same approach in my observation when hearing various stages in [this litigation].&#8221;</p>

The father was represented by Mr James Bogle of counsel, who was instructed by Bance Commercial Law, solicitors. Mr Bogle was attended throughout by Dr Pelling, acting now in the capacity of his instructing solicitors&#8217; clerk. The mother appeared in person, assisted by Mr Holden as her McKenzie friend. N, who in accordance with directions I had given on a previous occasion is a party to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> proceedings and has a Rule 9.5 guardian acting for him, was represented by Ms Kate Hudson of counsel.</p>

Mr Bogle&#8217;s objections were two-fold: first, that the mother had not made an application to that effect at the start of the hearing as required by the <span style="font-style:italic">President&#8217;s Guidance: McKenzie Friends</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 FLR 110" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 FLR 110</ref> issued by Sir Mark Potter P on 14 April 2008 (coincidentally the very day of the hearing before Pauffley J), nor had she given any notice of such application; secondly, and relying for this purpose on <span style="font-style:italic">D v S (Rights of Audience)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 724" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 724</ref>, that there were in any event no exceptional circumstances to justify Mr Holden being permitted to act in this way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No-one had come prepared to argue the point. Since the parties in any event wanted time to discuss matters with a view to seeing whether the issues in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/27/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> proceedings might be narrowed, or even resolved altogether, there was no immediate need for me to rule on the point. I therefore directed that skeleton arguments or similar documents be prepared by the next day. In accordance with that direction I received, in addition to Dr Pelling&#8217;s witness statement, a witness statement from the mother setting out why, as she submitted, I should permit Mr Holden to represent her and make representations on her behalf, a skeleton argument from Mr Bogle and a skeleton argument from Ms Hudson.</p>

Indeed, I would have thought that the same courtesy would have been given to me.&#8221; She said that, as the father had been represented by Dr Pelling, it never occurred to her that any objection would be raised to her instructing a McKenzie friend, adding that the father had known since April 2008 that she no longer had solicitors on the record.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Bogle referred me to various authorities which I deal with below. The sheet anchor of his argument that a McKenzie friend is to be granted a right of audience only in &#8216;exceptional&#8217; circumstances was the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">D v S (Rights of Audience)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 724" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 724</ref>.

Fundamentally, he submitted, there were here no exceptional circumstances to justify Mr Holden being granted a right of audience. True it is, he said, that the father had been represented by a McKenzie friend, Dr Pelling, in some parts of some previous hearings but he was now represented by counsel for the trial. The issue of such representation is not one of mere mutuality but each application must be made on its merits and determined in accordance with the guidance given by authority. Doubtless Mr Holden would be able to put the mother&#8217;s case better than she herself, otherwise she would not be asking for him to be her advocate, but that, said Mr Bogle, is plainly not a reason for the court to accede to the application.</p>

He had indicated that he had only ever sought to assist one other person and that was in a housing matter. (This should be put in context. Dr Pelling in his witness statement deposed &#8211; and this was not challenged by anyone &#8211; to a conversation he had had with Mr Holden on the occasion of the hearing before Pauffley J in which he (Mr Holden) had told Dr Pelling that he had acted in the courts as an advocate on a number of occasions and for example had represented companies. So be it, but as Dr Pelling is no doubt very well aware, for as he told me he has had personal experience as company secretary of conducting litigation for a company, the representation of companies raises very different issues which are regulated by CPR Part 39.6.) </p>

The guardian&#8217;s solicitors had done everything in their power to accommodate Dr Pelling in terms of sending him documents and generally dealing with him. It was not understood that either the mother or the guardian had ever sought to restrict Dr Pelling&#8217;s role in the litigation (although it was accepted that clearly it was for the court to determine not for the parties to agree). The father had been aware for some time that the mother had dispensed with the services of her solicitors. She appeared before Pauffley J in April 2008 and was assisted by Mr Holden, who was given permission to act as her advocate on that occasion. No indication had been given by the father prior to the case actually starting in court on 21 July 2008 that objection was to be taken to Mr Holden acting in a way in which Dr Pelling had so frequently acted in these proceedings before. The mother was entitled to assume that she would be afforded the same courtesy and opportunity that had been given to the father. If the mother were now to be refused permission to have Mr Holden act as her advocate she believed that her position would be so severely compromised as to be untenable and had indicated that she would in those circumstances be forced to apply for an adjournment of the proceedings so that she could arrange some other representation.</p>

Moreover, significant time had been taken up and significant costs expended in dealing with the point.

But this, as I pointed out, gave rise to a difficulty, for Mr Bogle&#8217;s skeleton argument (which I understood Dr Pelling wished to adopt) had concluded with the submission that, because the mother&#8217;s application raised important questions of principle and fairness in relation to rights of audience, and because the hearing of the application and judgment thereon would not appear to require any reference to the circumstances or private life of the child the subject of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/8" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 8</ref> proceedings, the hearing should be in open court with public pronouncement of judgment in accordance with the common law principle of open justice (reference being made to <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1913] AC 417" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1913">[1913] AC 417</ref>) and in accordance with Article 6(1) of the Convention.</p>

And given the objection he wished to take on behalf of the father to Mr Holden being granted a right of audience for the purpose of the proceedings, it would scarcely have lain in either his or his client&#8217;s mouth to assert a similar right of audience on his own part. So although Dr Pelling would be at liberty to address me in chambers in support of the preliminary argument that the substantive hearing be in open court, were he to be successful in that argument (which I was inclined to think he would be) and were I accordingly to go into open court for the substantive argument (which was likely), he would not be able to address me. Thus, unless Mr Bogle were to be instructed in the matter, any oral arguments which the father might wish to put before me he would have to make himself.</p>

In the ordinary way it will be for them to satisfy the court that that is appropriate.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;[28]<marker name="tab"/>I agree with both judgments. The judge directed himself that the question which he should answer was whether there were exceptional circumstances which justified granting Mr Keter rights of audience under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41/section/27/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 27(2)</ref>(c) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41" uk:canonical="1990 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Courts and Legal Services Act 1990</ref>. I agree with my Lords that that is not the relevant question in a case of this kind. As I see it, the question is simply whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the court should exercise its discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41/section/27/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 27(2)</ref>(c). The section does not in any way fetter the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion, although the discretion must be exercised in the light of the objective of Part II of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41" uk:canonical="1990 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41/section/17/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 17(1)</ref> and of the general principle set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41/section/17/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 17(3)</ref>. In exercising the discretion in any particular case, I agree that the court must have in mind the general principles referred to by Lord Woolf. There is a spectrum of different circumstances which may arise so that it is difficult to lay down precise guidelines. Cases will vary greatly. For example, in a case where the proposed advocate is holding himself out as providing advocacy services, whether for reward or not, the court will only make an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/41/section/27/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 27(2)</ref>(c) in exceptional circumstances: <span style="font-style:italic">D v S (Rights of Audience)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1997] 1 FLR 724" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1997">[1997] 1 FLR 724</ref>. On the other hand, where the proposed advocate is a member of the litigant&#8217;s family, the position is likely to be very different, although, as this case shows, even in such cases the circumstances may vary widely.  </p>

That discretion should only be exercised for good reason. The question is whether, having regard to the general principles set out by Lord Woolf, there is good reason on the facts of this case to permit Mr Keter to speak on behalf of the claimant at the forthcoming interlocutory applications and at any trial. To put it another way: is it just to permit him to do so?&#8221;</p>

In that case the McKenzie friend was the claimant&#8217;s husband and she had suffered an angina attack and suffered from depression. Moreover, the husband was a law student who had completed Bar finals. Attempts had been made to obtain a lawyer to act on a conditional fee or <span style="font-style:italic">pro bono</span> but without success. Here, in contrast, the proposed McKenzie friend was neither a husband nor a relative but only a &#8220;family friend&#8221; and there was no evidence of ill health on the part of the mother.</p>

The decision in that case was intended to be confined to the proposition that a spouse, partner or relative could act when circumstances were unusual or where there was a good reason for allowing them rights of audience, such as when the litigant was in poor health and had no access to public or other funding for legal representation.

At the other end of the spectrum there will be the McKenzie friend who is the litigant&#8217;s spouse or partner, though even there, as Clarke LJ was careful to point out, the circumstances may vary widely. In between &#8211; and Mr Holden falls somewhere between the two ends of the spectrum though as it seems to me much nearer the spouse / partner McKenzie friend end of the spectrum than the &#8216;professional&#8217; McKenzie friend advocate end of the spectrum &#8211; there will be a very wide range of circumstances which it is futile and indeed impossible to classify or categorise.

Moreover, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Guidance </span>reminds us, &#8220;the attendance of a McKenzie friend will often be of advantage to the court in ensuring the litigant in person receives a fair hearing.&#8221; Similarly, in my experience, there will be occasions &#8211; sometimes; sometimes not &#8211; when the grant of rights of audience to a McKenzie friend will, to adopt the President&#8217;s words, be of advantage to the court in ensuring the litigant in person receives a fair hearing. Sometimes, indeed, it will be essential if justice is to be done and, equally importantly, perceived by the litigant in person as having been done.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father, in subsequent written submissions prepared for him by Dr Pelling, says that there are no good reasons for anonymisation, and good reasons against it. The judgment, he says, concerns only an issue about rights of audience, does not concern the private lives of the parties or of N and contains little which, if published by an individual, would be a contempt: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/8-9/65" uk:canonical="1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2) c. 65" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1960</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">X v Dempster</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 FLR 894" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 FLR 894</ref>. Dr Pelling says that he and the father wish to be free to write and talk about the proceedings but that it would be quite artificial and unnecessary for the father to conceal the fact that he was a party and was speaking from direct experience. He refers in this context to the acceptance by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton v Clayton</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/878" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 878" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 878</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2006] Fam 83" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] Fam 83</ref>, that Mr Clayton should be free to publicise his agreed shared care parenthood plan from his own experience and under his own name. Further, he says, anonymisation inhibits the free interchange of ideas and communication of experience in a democratic society and if the case is anonymised then it will be difficult for anyone interested to contact the father, though others interested in rights of audience and McKenzie friend issues may well wish to do so. He adds that there is a case for changing the law in regard to rights of audience but campaigning is inhibited if one does not know the identities of those involved in setting case precedents. For how can one make contact? (I do not fully understand this point, because the name of the father&#8217;s solicitors appears on the front-sheet and will, no doubt, be printed in any published law report.)</p>

And, he says, where the issues do not in fact involve private and family life, as in a McKenzie friend or right of audience issue, the burden must surely be upon any person, including the judge, to justify anonymity. That balance, he asserts, comes down clearly against anonymisation, for in the balance between Articles 6, 8 and 10 there is nothing private, or only <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span>, to put in the balance on the Article 8 side whereas there is, he says, a great deal on the Articles 6 and 10 and what he calls the common law side. He says it is absurd to suggest that any privacy inheres in one&#8217;s own name or in the mere fact of being involved in legal proceedings &#8211; he says that if you live in a democracy then everyone is known by his name and if you invoke the public organs of the state apparatus of the judicial system that is not a private matter.

She points out that the litigation, or &#8220;the trouble&#8221; as N calls it, has been going on for almost his entire life and that the very purpose of the consent order was to put an end to this and allow N, as well as his parents, to move on and get on with their lives. She says that the father&#8217;s and Dr Pelling&#8217;s wish to publicise the case in connection with the rights of audience judgment cannot be in the best interests of N where he could be identified. She is very disturbed that N should be used as a pawn for what is, she says, clearly a political agenda and that the court should be being used to further that agenda. N is a child and should, indeed must, be protected. She concludes, &#8220;As a mother, I plead with the court &#8230; that there should be no possibility or chance that N could ever be identified &#8230; and I pray that [the father] will seek to protect his son from being used for purposes that would be of no benefit to anyone, but possibly Dr Pelling.</p>

She points out that the judgment does contain some personal information about N and makes reference at paragraph [10(iii)] to the father&#8217;s allegations against the mother. Were the parents now to be named, it would follow, she says, that N would be easily identified. He is a child who has already been exposed to years of &#8220;the trouble&#8221; between his parents, a child who has begged both the guardian and the independent social worker for them to make the troubles stop. It would, she submits, be most unhelpful and inconsistent with N&#8217;s welfare were the difficulties surrounding his life to be exposed to anyone but the immediate circle of family and friends. Whilst transparency may well be an ideal we should strive for, this must not, she says, be at the expense of the welfare of the child. Each case needs to be viewed on its own individual merits. N has a fundamental right to privacy and this should not be infringed by any person&#8217;s desire to &#8216;make law&#8217; or to facilitate campaigning. It is, she concludes, a matter of real regret that this point is being raised at this late stage, it having been the guardian&#8217;s earnest hope, now an order, so painfully negotiated at court, has been reached, that the parties could focus on making the order work and on promoting N&#8217;s best interests first and foremost.</p>

But he takes, as his main objection to Ms Hudson&#8217;s submissions, the assumption, without a scrap of evidence he says, that N&#8217;s welfare would be harmed if he were identified or it were possible to identify him from the published judgment. The authorities, as he points out, referring in this context both to my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly v British Broadcasting Corp</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] Fam 59" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] Fam 59</ref> at pages 70 and to what the Court of Appeal said in <span style="font-style:italic">Pelling v Bruce-Williams (Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs Intervening)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2004/845" uk:canonical="[2004] EWCA Civ 845" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWCA Civ 845</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] Fam 155" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] Fam 155</ref> at para [35], require a proper evidential foundation, and not mere assumption or assertion. (That, of course, is so, but as I pointed put in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly </span>at page 85, this does not mean that the court cannot use its common sense.) It is, he says, wrong of Ms Hudson to assume without evidence that transparent publication will be &#8220;at the expense of&#8221; the welfare of the child. In fact, he asserts, it is implausible that this would be the case, for we are talking about a judgment on a technical matter that is likely to be published in the legal press for the benefit of those involved in family and child related litigation, in particular litigants in person. The judgment, he says, will be of interest only to those who deal with these matters, so he cannot see how this could have any impact on N, notwithstanding that, as I have already mentioned, the father and Dr Pelling wish, as Dr Pelling puts it, to be free to write and talk about the proceedings. Moreover, he says, in this kind of decision the welfare of the child is not paramount.</p>

But that does not, of course, mean that his interests do not carry weight. Indeed, in undertaking the &#8220;ultimate balancing test&#8221; described by Lord Steyn in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S (A Child) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2004/47" uk:canonical="[2004] UKHL 47" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] UKHL 47</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 593</ref>, at para [17], it is necessary, as Lord Steyn observed at para [25], to measure the impact on the child of what is proposed, just as it is necessary to focus on the specific circumstances of the particular case. For, as Lord Steyn said at para [17], when, as here, the values under different Articles of the Convention are in conflict, &#8220;an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary.&#8221;</p>

This is a child who has already suffered enough from the litigation &#8211; &#8220;the trouble&#8221; &#8211; and who is likely to suffer even more if he knows that the names of his parents are being bandied about in the public discussions of the case which his father and Dr Pelling now seem intent upon. </p>
