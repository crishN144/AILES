That said, Mr Gupta had referred to this application (in the US) when in correspondence with the mother&#8217;s solicitors on 24 June he had sought an adjournment of the 6 July hearing; the mother&#8217;s solicitors replied to that correspondence on 26 June 2015, acknowledging the information.  In light of the developments in Florida, the father&#8217;s solicitors had suggested that the hearing on 6 July be reduced to 1 hour; the mother agreed to vacate the hearing and invited the father to withdraw his applications;</p>

On 2 July 2015 the father&#8217;s solicitors confirmed to the Clerk of the Rules than only one hour would be required on 6 July; at that point, the father was not intending to withdraw his application.  In his witness statement, Mr. Gupta apologises for not having notified the Clerk of the Rules of the change of circumstances sooner; he explains that he was on leave for some of the relevant period, and therefore was not immediately involved in the last minute developments;</p>

Court time is precious, and the efficient administration of the court lists in the Royal Courts of Justice (as elsewhere around the country) depends upon parties, and where represented, their solicitors, conscientiously advising the listing offices of changes in time estimates.  This is a case in which failures to comply with court orders, and to notify the listing office of change of circumstances, led to extensive Court time being allocated and preserved for this case unnecessarily, most likely to the detriment of other families whose cases need urgent consideration. </p>

As earlier indicated, <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> sides appear to have paid somewhat casual regard to the strict requirements of the order.  Whether difficulties in complying with court orders arise out of funding difficulties or otherwise, solicitors must be assiduous in ensuring compliance, or seeking specific alternative direction from the court.  </p>

There was no proper excuse for Duncan Lewis not notifying the mother&#8217;s solicitors straight away when they knew that the father was actively pursuing fresh applications in the US Court; their reasons for not doing so summarised in [6(ii)(a)-(c)] do not properly justify their stance.  While some effort was made to notify the Clerk of the Rules of the changed time estimate, this was far too late in the day in these circumstances; the father&#8217;s solicitor should have been on to this much earlier.  Failure to lodge the bundle in an effective and timeous way was a failure on the part of the solicitor which caused considerable disruption to my own preparation of the case for hearing.</p>
