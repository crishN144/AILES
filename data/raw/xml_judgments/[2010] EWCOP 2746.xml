I have, however, made it clear on many occasions that I regard such appointments are being of the utmost importance in proceedings of any kind. This case is no exception. Although, therefore, I have indicated to the parties what I am minded to do, I have taken a short time to formulate my reasons. This will, accordingly, be a public judgment, although I have anonymised the various participants. Nothing must be published which at this stage, identifies anyone other than the lawyers in the case by either name or location.</p>

He is currently in hospital, and according to Dr DH, a consultant neurologist at the hospital, AVS, over the 18 months to September 2010 &#8220;has no evidence of awareness of self or environment&#8221;. It is not clear that AVS is in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) and his family remain certain that he continues to respond to stimuli. On any view, however, AVS is incapable of conducting his affairs, and, by consent,  I declared on 14 October 2010 that he lacked capacity both to instruct solicitors in these proceedings and to make decisions as to his medical treatment and care.</p>

In other words, (1) is dependent upon (2). Thus, if the court were to decide that PPS should continue to be administered to AVS, it would be in his best interests to undergo the surgery which would permit that to happen.</p>

AVS&#8217;s family requested the institution of treatment with intraventricular PPS, and AVS was referred to a hospital in Scotland, where the appropriate pump was inserted by a team under the overall direction of Professor K. Thereafter, AVS was returned to the hospital and continued to be administered PPS by means of the pump. On or about  26 August 2010 (or 27 July according to CS&#8217;s first witness statement) the infusion pump malfunctioned and the administration of PPS to AVS ceased.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.13in">There is evidence to indicate that the administration of PPS to patients suffering from CJD slows and / or  halts the progress of the disease and / or prolongs life&#8230;&#8230;. there is no evidence to suggest that  there are any adverse side effects from the administration of PPS but evidence of improvement in condition.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.13in">At the time of diagnosis  in May 2008, the prognosis for (AVS) was that he was unlikely to survived more than 3 to 4 weeks. He had in fact survived two and a half years  since diagnosis. He received PPS from June 2008 until the infusion pump malfunctioned. The administration  of  PPS is therefore very likely to be the reason why the progress of the disease has been slowed and / or  halted, and (AVS&#8217;s) life lengthened. The continued administration of PPS is therefore likely to to be beneficial to (AVS) and is most unlikely to be detrimental to his welfare. The application is urgent since discontinuing the delivery of PPS for more than a few weeks is expected to result in increased damage and death of previously functioning cells.</p>

It is immediately apparent from the documents (I have, of course, heard no oral evidence); (1) that the relationship of trust and confidence between CS and the clinicians treating AVS has broken down completely; and (2) whilst making every allowance for the  high level of emotion which his brother&#8217;s condition  generates, it is plain to me that CS does not retain the objectivity which, in my judgment, is necessary for the proper conduct of proceedings as a next friend</p>

This is,  in my judgment, most unfortunate and makes the court&#8217;s ultimate task more difficult. However, CS gives abundant evidence of it in his two statements. As examples:</p>

For example,  he uses the word &#8220;beseech&#8221; in asking the court to find that it is in the best interests of AVS for the administration of PPS to be continued. I would not normally pick up on such a semantic point, but CS, I remind myself, is a solicitor in practice. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 September 2010, Dr DH wrote to Professor K asking him for his opinion on the continued administration of PPS to AVS. It is a long letter, running to 4 pages. Professor K&#8217;s response is also lengthy, and runs to 12 pages of single spaced A4. I do not propose to set out either all the questions he was asked or all of his answers. However, he does express a number of important and in some cases unequivocal conclusions. PPS, he says, has not been assessed in any formal human clinical trial.  &#8220;In general terms, the evidence such as it is for PPS would suggest that any benefit would be in slowing disease progression rather than halting disease progression and it is certainly not a cure&#8221;. He acknowledges that AVS is still alive some 2 years and 8 months from onset, but simply does not know whether PPS treatment has had any efficacy in AVS&#8217;s case. </p>

Professor K finds the question of continuing PPS &#8220;exceedingly difficult&#8221;. However, his final view is unequivocal: &#8220;it would not be reasonable to continue with treatment&#8221;.</p>

That letter, which had been composed at short notice on 26 October 2010, indicated that Dr P was willing to take over the care of AVS,  with the plain implication that the administration of PPS should continue. It is for this reason that I indicated earlier in this judgment that the case may not continue in the court arena. Plainly, if AVS is transferred to Dr P&#8217;s care, and a NHS transfer occurs, the ongoing administration of PPS to AVS will be a matter for Dr. P and CS, and will not involve the court.</p>

At the same time, it seems to me that both the court and the trust are entitled to know what Dr P&#8217;s opinion is. I therefore came to the view that the proper course was to direct that the current proceedings should stand dismissed at the expiration of 14 days from the date on which this judgment is handed down unless within on that time CS files a report from Dr P in answer to the reports by Dr DH, Professor K and Dr. MR identifying a proper issue for the court&#8217;s determination.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Since this judgment was prepared in draft and circulated to the parties, I have received submissions about additional witnesses. SC wishes to call (1) his partner; and (2) a neurologist, Dr. W. In relation to the former, the rationalisation is that CS&#8217;s partner &#8220;can give evidence on the patient&#8217;s level of response and on his historical level of response whilst being administered PPS&#8221;. As to the latter, the argument is that the Trust will be calling three neurologists, and that CS only has permission to call one. This, it is argued, does not achieve a level playing field. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Having re-read Dr W&#8217;s statement, I am prepared to give permission for him to be called, although I do not think that his evidence adds greatly to the case. In the absence of a statement from the nurse (see paragraphs 21(1) and 40 above) I am not at present minded to allow CS to call his partner. I am, however, prepared to reconsider admitting the evidence of CS&#8217;s partner on further application made to me either in writing or on short notice.  It is, of course, a pre-condition of any such application that the Trust is given notice of it, and enabled to comment on it.</p>
