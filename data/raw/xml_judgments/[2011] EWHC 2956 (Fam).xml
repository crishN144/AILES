They are: Petrodel Resources<span style="font-style:italic"/>Limited, an Isle of Man company, as second respondent; Petrodel Resources Nigeria Limited as third respondent; Petrodel Upstream Limited, an Isle of Man company, as fourth respondent; Vermont Petroleum Limited, an Isle of Man company, as fifth respondent; Elysium Diem Limited, an English company, as sixth respondent; Petrodel Resources Nevis Limited as seventh respondent and; Elysium Diem Limited Nevis as eighth respondent.  None of these respondents took any part in the proceedings until the final hearing when the second, fourth and fifth respondents instructed Mr Wagstaffe QC to appear on their behalf.  At the commencement of the hearing Mr Wagstaffe made an informal application for these respondents to be discharged from the proceedings.  It was informal in that there was no written application and it was unsupported by any evidence.  I rejected the application.</p>

He discloses assets with a combined value of approximately &#163;1.5 million consisting principally of a property called 16 Elnathan Mews, London and shares in Elysium Diem Nevis Limited of which the husband is the sole owner.  Set against these assets are liabilities totalling just under &#163;50 million, consisting mainly of an alleged liability under a personal guarantee to the Guaranty Trust Bank Limited of US $100 million.  The husband&#8217;s section 25 statement dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011 contains no account of his capital resources.  He also states that since September 2010 he has had no regular income.  In his closing submissions Mr Pointer produced an asset schedule totalling $4 million.  This does not purport to be a schedule of the husband&#8217;s resources but was clearly intended to give some indication of the wealth that may be available to him.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The wife contends that the husband is worth many tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds.  She relies on documents and other evidence adduced on her behalf.  It is also submitted that I should draw adverse inferences against the husband as to the likely level of his wealth.  The wife relies in particular on an Information Memorandum which she found at the matrimonial home in London in February 2008 and on the evidence of a Mr Le Breton who first gave oral evidence under a witness summons in December 2010.  In the Information Memorandum the Petrodel group of companies, which it is admitted the husband controls, was broadly stated to have a value of approximately $250 million.  In his oral evidence in 2010 Mr Le Breton said that the husband had told him on occasions between 2001 and 2004 that he was worth in the region of $40 to $50 million.</p>

Mr Pointer acknowledges that there is, &#8220;huge controversy as to the assets in the case&#8221;.  He also acknowledges that Peter Jackson J has found the husband to be in contempt by failing to provide relevant and discoverable documents as ordered by the court.  In making this determination Jackson J did not accept the husband&#8217;s reliance on an order made by the Nigerian High Court, which I deal with later in this judgment.  However, in any event, Mr Pointer submits that this determination was concerned with the production of documents and that this, &#8220;does not and cannot mean that the husband&#8217;s account of the available resources is automatically or necessarily wrong&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">When assessing the evidence in this case, I fully take into account that a party might lie or exaggerate in support of a true case and/or that they can be mistaken or confused about what happened or have simply forgotten what happened.  If I decide that it is a lie and is material, I must also consider the possible reasons for the lie.  People can lie for a number of different reasons including, as I have said, to bolster a true case.  Further, the mere fact that a person lies about one or more points does not necessarily demonstrate that their whole case is or, indeed, other parts of their case are false.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This judgment has taken me far longer than it should have done largely because I have sought to make sense of the husband&#8217;s factual case.  Ultimately I have decided that this has been a vain task because the husband has failed so comprehensively to comply with his obligation to provide full and frank disclosure and to give clear evidence that his case does not permit of such an exercise.  It became apparent to me that the evidence in this case is not such as would enable me to produce a comprehensive account into which all the various pieces of evidence could be fitted.  Notwithstanding the quantity of documents which have been produced, there are far too many gaps for this to be an attainable objective.  As I commented during the hearing, the result of the way in which the case has developed is that a great deal of energy has been expended by the husband on seeking to establish what he is not worth rather than the more conventional focus being on seeking to demonstrate what he is worth.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The first task which normally faces a court hearing a financial application under the Matrimonial Causes Act is to determine the factual background including crucially the financial position of the parties; the &#8216;computation&#8217; stage as referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Charman v Charman <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 FLR 1246" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 FLR 1246</ref> 67</span>.  As a result of the husband&#8217;s abject failure to comply with his disclosure obligations and to comply with orders made by the court during the course of these proceedings, I do not have the evidence which would enable me to assemble a conventional schedule of assets.  One of the matters I must determine is whether the husband&#8217;s default is deliberate or whether he has been unable to comply with his obligations in these proceedings.  The husband relies very largely on the order made by the Nigerian High Court to seek to explain his default.  In addition, however, the husband succeeded in his oral evidence in failing to provide a clear exposition of many of the factual issues raised by these proceedings.  With all due respect to the husband, his evidence consisted significantly of obfuscation and dissembling.</p>

The wife&#8217;s total costs are approximately &#163;1.3 million of which she has paid just under &#163;900,000, very largely by way of a litigation loan.  The other respondents have incurred costs of just over &#163;200,000.  These are truly staggering sums given the lack of clarity with which I am confronted.</p>

The husband became resident in Monaco and ceased to be resident in the UK.  An important witness in these proceedings, Mr Tim Le Breton, began working with the husband in or about 2001.  In 2005 Aurora ceased operations and the husband began working full-time in the business of the Petrodel group with the title of chief executive officer of Petrodel Resources Limited.  Tim Le Breton also worked with the husband in Petrodel until 2008.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Petrodel Resources Limited was incorporated in 1993 in the Isle of Man and Petrodel Resources Nigeria Limited was incorporated in Nigeria also in 1993.  The development of this business is not clear save that the main trading company has, at least until recently, always been PRL Isle of Man.  The public documents filed in the Isle of Man state that the company was dormant until 1996/97 and then became a property investment company.  The accounts state that it did not commence operations until 2002.  The husband asserts that the Isle of Man company acted as agent for Vitol and for Marc Rich from about 1993.  Whatever the precise history, for a number of years PRL has been involved in the oil business in what are called downstream activities, namely trade and transportation, and more recently has been involved in upstream activities, namely oil exploration and production.  Accounts for the years 2005, 2007 and 2008 are included within the bundles and they show turnover of between $572 million and $1,400 million and profits of between just under $3 million and approximately $6 million.</p>

Its predecessor is said to be a company called JH Agrodata Services also devised by his late father.  The start up capital for this earlier company is said to have been provided by the husband&#8217;s father and the company was run by the husband&#8217;s sister, H, and her husband.  Agrodata was a company engaged in the collection of data relating to agricultural products.  Apart from the husband&#8217;s assertion in his statement, I have seen no evidence which supports the assertion that Agrodata was Petrodel&#8217;s predecessor.</p>

His father, therefore, &#8220;instigated the creation of Petrodel&#8221; as a business platform in which the whole family could participate.  He refurbished an office, put in place transport and clerical staff and, to quote the husband&#8217;s section 25 statement, &#8220;Provided me with sufficient funds, I recollect the sum of $10,000&#8221; to hold &#8220;for incorporation in London&#8221;.  This sum of $10,000 has assumed great significance in the husband&#8217;s case because it is said to be the seed capital which entitles the husband&#8217;s siblings to an interest in the Petrodel group.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In 2001 the final matrimonial home, at 16 W Avenue W2, was purchased in the name of PRL.  It was at or about this time that the husband became resident in Monaco and non-resident in the UK.  The property was purchased for &#163;1.4 million and approximately &#163;1 million was spent on refurbishments.  In his section 25 statement the husband says that it was purchased as a P family investment.  The wife says that the husband told her this property was purchased from his bonus income.  In his oral evidence the husband said that the funds used in this purchase came from PRL which was then acting as an agent for Marc Rich.  He gave this answer to explain, when asked, the source of the funds used to purchase and refurbish the W Avenue property.  This evidence does not tie in with the documents obtained from the Isle of Man, as referred to above, which state that PRL was dormant until 1996/97 and then became a property investment company.  It also does not tie in with the statement, for example, in the 2008 accounts which say that the company started operations on 25<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2002.  The lack of clarity is also exemplified by the fact that the husband said in his oral evidence he was not sure whether he had put any money into any of the companies.  No rent or other payment has ever been made in respect of the family&#8217;s use and occupation of this property.</p>

I also gave directions requiring the husband, or his solicitors on his instructions, to sign letters of instruction to property valuation experts in London and Nigeria and to a Professor Sagay who was going to give expert evidence on issues of Nigerian law.  The husband failed to sign these letters and also failed or refused to give his solicitors instructions to sign them on his behalf.  There was no justification for the position adopted by the husband and this is yet another example of the manner in which he has sought to frustrate the proper progress of these proceedings.  Despite the husband&#8217;s evidence to the contrary, I am satisfied that he then also sought to frustrate, successfully, Knight<span style="font-style:italic"/>Frank&#8217;s attempts to value the properties in Nigeria.

I heard extensive oral evidence from the wife and, over a number of days, from the husband.  I also heard oral evidence from Mr Le Breton and from two accountants instructed as experts on behalf of the parties, namely Mr Lazarevic of Moore Stephens LLP and Mr Matthew-Jones of PKF UK Limited.

In 2006 it appears the husband transferred, he says sold, his shares to PRL Nevis.

There is some dispute between the parties as to Miss Walters&#8217; qualifications.  She is a Nevis national who was appointed as a director in 2003.  The wife says that she is employed by the parties to assist them with household tasks.  The husband accepts that she does this work but says she also holds a position with the Nevis Historical Society.  I have not heard evidence from Miss Walters but, whatever her status, I am satisfied that she has taken no more than a nominal part in the management of PRL.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">After the conclusion of the hearing further evidence was produced consisting of very brief letters from Mr Murphy&#8217;s GP and a letter from 2006 from a consultant cardiologist.  The latter refers to Mr Murphy having cardiac arrhythmias from about 2003 &#8211; in other words, since well before he took on the role of director of PRL.  The evidence, including the terse comment by Mr Murphy&#8217;s GP that he is not medically fit to attend court on the basis of high blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmia which can be worsened by stress, does not satisfy me that Mr Murphy was, indeed, unfit to attend court.  It seems to me more likely, and I so conclude, that Mr Murphy was unwilling rather than unable to attend court.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">A very broad statement but supported with no detail at all.  Further, this assertion runs contrary to the balance of the other evidence I have heard, including the significant evidence given by Mr Le Breton that the directors acted pursuant to the husband&#8217;s instructions.  In this context I also remind myself of the terms of the husband&#8217;s contract as CEO which give him complete discretion in the management of the company&#8217;s affairs.  I am satisfied that the directors of the group, including Mr Murphy, act in accordance with instructions given by or on behalf of the husband.  The husband was unable in his oral evidence to provide details of any specific occasion when the directors had not acted in accordance with his instructions.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">As referred to above, the PRL (IoM) accounts contain, under creditors, a directors&#8217; current account entry for just over $10 million in both 2007 and 2008.  When the husband was first asked in cross-examination to whom any money in a directors account would be payable he replied, a director, being Miss Walters and Mr Murphy.  He was then shown the entry in the 2008 accounts.  This entry was then explained by the husband as being the result of a misstatement.  He said that the properties had been valued by Knight Frank in 2006<span style="font-style:italic"/>in<span style="font-style:italic"/>pounds.  This valuation was then included in the accounts in dollars.  The difference between these figures, he said, &#8220;makes up the bulk&#8221; of the sum appearing as being owed to the directors.  It was not possible to understand the evidence given by the husband on this subject.  Given that the properties held in the name of PRL are currently valued at just over &#163;5 million, it seems reasonable to conclude that the amount appearing in the accounts, if not converted to dollars, would have been an understatement.  This could simply have been rectified.  It does not explain why a substantial sum had to be credited in the way alleged, nor where the sum of $10 million comes from.</p>

The husband also said on one occasion in his oral evidence that, as he is not a director of the Isle of Man company, he does not have a director&#8217;s current or loan account with PRL.  Despite this latter evidence, it is clear that there is no person other than the husband to whom such sums could or would be due.  Indeed, in his section 25 statement the husband gives examples of Petrodel incurring expenditure for the benefit of the wife&#8217;s relations which he says would have been charged to, &#8220;my director&#8217;s loan account&#8221; if they were not permissible business expenses.</p>

Indeed, there is no direct evidence at all as to how the husband&#8217;s income and bonuses are dealt with in PRL&#8217;s accounts save possibly for references to directors&#8217; remuneration which, given the amounts, are very unlikely to relate to the actual directors.  Further, the amounts given for directors&#8217; emoluments are significantly less than the annual amounts spent by the husband on himself and his family and for which there appears to be no significant source other than PRL Isle of Man.  The husband told me that he does not know how his income and bonus are dealt with in the accounts.  When he was asked whether he receives any benefits from PRL other than his salary he replied that this is an accounting question.  When asked in cross-examination to explain how some of the payments relating to the wife&#8217;s mother were for the company&#8217;s benefit, the husband replied that she was a shareholder.  When Mr Todd asked whether a dividend had been declared, the husband said he was not sure how this benefit or these payments had been achieved.</p>

He denied this but when then asked how he paid for school fees he said he would either pay it himself or he would take a director&#8217;s loan.  The only company of which the husband is a named director is PRL Nigeria.  There is no indication that this company has had sufficient resources to enable school fees to be paid.  As the husband&#8217;s employment contract permits him to set his own bonus, the whole exercise is artificial in any event as, if required, he could simply ascribe all payments made for his or his family&#8217;s benefit as being part of his bonus.  I have no doubt at all that the husband does, indeed, just draw from PRL whatever he and his family need, as and when they need it.</p>

This was, again, a puzzling answer as on the husband&#8217;s case it was difficult to understand how such a sum could have been paid to him or on his behalf by either the Nevis or the Nigerian companies.  The husband, no doubt seeing the difficulty with his answer, later added that this sum had been lent to him pursuant to a written agreement signed probably in 2008.  I am not aware of any previous reference to the existence of any such agreement, nor has it been produced.</p>

This is an example of a deliberately evasive answer, as I have no doubt that the husband is aware of all the trades being conducted by all the companies.  It later emerged from documents produced during the course of the hearing that substantial trades have continued to be made by companies within the group being, probably, either Vermont Petroleum and/or Nevis.  It follows that the suggestion in the husband&#8217;s statement that his source of income had dried up is clearly also false.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">During his evidence the husband asserted for the first time that the sum due to BNP had been reduced to $7.6 million.  This piece of evidence was given by reference to a BNP statement dated 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2011 which had been produced during the course of the committal proceedings.  This statement contains a summary of the sums due from PRL to BNP.  Under &#8216;letters of credit&#8217; the total amount due is $89 million.  Under &#8216;loans&#8217; the total amount due is given as $33.7 million.  Of this latter amount the husband said that $7.6 million is in respect of the loan the subject of the charges.  The balance of approximately $26 million was said by the husband to be a new loan which had been obtained to fund a trade or trades effected by PRL in February/March 2010 in respect of which the company has still not been paid by the Nigerian government.  The sum should have been paid by the end of May 2010.  It is interesting to note that the BNP statement refers to letters of credit with a total amount due of $89 million suggesting continuing trades.</p>

From these it appears that the BNP loan probably reduced to $7.6 million by June 2009.  These documents also show that BNP has a cash collateral of just over $4 million and also a guarantee from Credit Suisse.  The latter is said by the husband to be secured against an account with Credit Suisse.  Statements from Credit Suisse were also disclosed by the husband later during the hearing.  Prior to the disclosure of these latter statements the husband said that the Credit Suisse account(s) were in the name of the Isle of Man company with a balance of something over $2 million.  In another unexpected development, the account holder of the statements which were disclosed is PRL Nevis and the statement address is &#8220;Personal, Mr MP c/o Petrodel Resources Limited&#8221;, Monaco.</p>

The Credit Suisse statements were also said to hold the sum of $2.8 million which had been paid by a company called Afren Plc in respect of costs incurred by Petrodel in the Tanga oil block when Afren acquired an interest in the block.  The statements also show very substantial trades being conducted through letters of credit in 2010, apparently under the name of PRL Nevis.  This latter development was unexpected because the husband&#8217;s case had been, as he told Mr Matthew Jones, that PRL Nevis is a holding company.</p>

Further, if BNP called on the guarantee from Credit Suisse, the amount might be reduced by $2 million or more.  However, as a result of the husband&#8217;s failure to give clear disclosure, the evidence is not sufficient for me to reach any firm conclusions as to what the true net position is in respect of the loan due to BNP.</p>

This wrong-footed the husband as he had clearly not been thinking where his answers were going.  He replied that he thought there was a loan between himself and Petrodel.  This last answer was clearly made up by the husband to seek to explain his previous answers.  He could not explain why it did not feature in his form E.</p>

She puts her income needs, as I have described, at &#163;310,000 p.a. for herself and &#163;420,000 p.a. for the children.  Her capital needs comprise principally the former matrimonial home.  The wife&#8217;s section 25 affidavit was sworn by her on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2011.  In this she says that during the marriage the husband&#8217;s career blossomed and his personal wealth exploded.  She asserts a &#8220;firm belief&#8221; that the husband is the beneficial owner of all the properties held in the names of the companies.

Nor has anyone ever referred to the existence of any trust for his siblings or their children.  It is her firm belief that H, who has a law degree from King&#8217;s College, would have taken active steps in these proceedings if she had any interest in any of the companies.  The wife has never met anyone other than the husband who has claimed to be a shareholder in any of the companies, nor anyone other than the husband who has given instructions concerning the companies&#8217; affairs.  In their conversations the husband always talked about &#8220;I&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;for us&#8221;.  The extent of the husband&#8217;s control, she says, is reflected in the tight financial control he exercises over the companies.  She also refers to how she and the husband alone made decisions about mortgaging the properties in London and buying and selling other properties.</p>

It is her understanding that the husband was not on good terms with his father in the period before his death and had not spoken to him for some time until very shortly before his death.  In respect of the claim by the husband that his family has an interest in the Petrodel group or that there is a trust for them, the wife says that neither the husband nor any of his siblings ever mentioned that they had any such interest or that there was any such trust.  She would have expected somebody to have told her or that she would at least have heard of it, if it was true.  She was aware of disputes concerning their late father&#8217;s property in Abuja and Warri, including that the husband had taken the land in Abuja for his own use.

The husband told her that she should sell everything and move to Nevis.  The wife was to use the proceeds of the sale of the properties in the UK to meet her living expenses.

This guarantee is said not to be secured on the company&#8217;s assets because the bank insists on the husband&#8217;s personal guarantee.  The husband later produced a copy of one of the letters from Guaranty Trust Bank offering banking facilities.  It is dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2008.  It is the offer of a loan to finance the importation of refined petroleum products.

Further, the document shows that there were, in fact, two facilities and that the husband&#8217;s guarantee is limited to the second in the sum of $20 million.  In the husband&#8217;s oral evidence he insisted that he is or was potentially liable for the full amount of $100 million although, as I have said, this conflicts with the letter.  In either event, it is notable that the bank considered it appropriate to procure a guarantee from the husband for either $20 million or $100 million, providing some indication of the bank&#8217;s view of the husband&#8217;s wealth.  Later in his oral evidence the husband said that the guarantee of $100 million was, in fact, to the United Bank of Africa.  This was the first mention of the existence of any such guarantee.</p>

To understand the situation better it is necessary to go into some history.  In 1992 my father died.  Prior to that, he had given me his business contacts and also the seed money to start up the company in Nigeria.  In keeping with Nigerian customary law it was to be for the benefit of his children.  At inception my sister, my wife and I were the shareholders and to avoid conflict with my then employers, in 1996/97 I divested myself of my shares and handed them to a lawyer to be held effectively in &#8216;trust&#8217; for my children.  At this time I was an employee of the Marc Rich group.  I handed the shares to this Nigerian lawyer with a free hand but also with the option to buy my shares from me and also any debt of the company.</p>

It had also acquired exploration rights in Nigeria for which it paid $14.5 million and for which it required up to $1 billion to develop.  It was agreed that in the proposed float entity my wife would have shares in her own maiden name and my siblings would have shares which they would hold in trust for their children.  In addition shares would also be issued to staff and third party investors.  There would be a majority block of shares held in trust for my children and provision made for my wife.  This never happened because the market collapsed in February 2007.  Accordingly, all the shares remain with Petrodel Resources Nevis Limited.  The Memorandum of Information which was referred to in the freezing order proceedings was prepared in support of this concept which I still hope may be implemented in the future.&#8221;</p>

In his oral evidence the husband was asked by Mr Pointer what he meant by this answer.  He said that he was referring to who the shareholders were of the company which owns the property.  This was a puzzling answer, not least because five of the London properties are not held in the name of Petrodel Resources.  Mr Todd suggested to the husband that putting his answers together it would mean that the shareholders are the beneficial owners of the properties.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Mr Le Breton, as I have described, first gave oral evidence pursuant to a witness summons on 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2010.  I have read a transcript of this evidence.  He describes how he started working for the husband in 2001, when he helped him set up Aurora of which the husband owned just under 50%.  Petrodel was, he says, one of the husband&#8217;s key development vehicles for his West African business.  Mr Le Breton was a member of the board at Aurora.  When Aurora was wound up in 2004, they then raised independent banking finance for Petrodel to operate as an independent entity.  Mr Le Breton was employed as managing director between the end of 2004 and about July 2008.  He was clearly a close and valued colleague of the husband.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In the period 2001/2004 Petrodel was engaged in trading oil products and short term shipping contracts.  According to Mr Le Breton, Petrodel built up a portfolio of oil export contracts which gave Petrodel the right to export one or two crude oil cargos a month from Nigeria.  They also had fairly constant opportunities to sell other oil products to the Nigerian government.  From 2006 Petrodel began to develop an oil exploration and production portfolio with two blocks in Tanzania called Tanga and Latham Kimbiji.  These did not involve an upfront payment.  The company agreed to undertake specified activities and committed to a minimum level of expenditure.  This would be funded, for example, by farming out the contractual obligations to a larger operator who in return would acquire a percentage interest in the contract.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">At or about the same time Petrodel won a bid for a Nigerian licence which required a deposit of $12.5 million.  This deposit was paid with the loan from BNP Paribas.  Petrodel did not then proceed with the contract because the prospects looked very poor.  The evidence appears to show that the Nigerian Government agreed to refund the deposit but the husband says that this has not yet occurred.</p>

He controlled every business decision.  The directors acted merely on his instructions.  Throughout the seven or eight years that he worked with the husband and Petrodel, the directors, according to Mr Le Breton, acted only on the husband&#8217;s instructions.  There was also significant expenditure through Petrodel for the benefit of the husband, the wife and the children but Mr Le Breton was not aware of any significant sums being spent for other family members.  There were also investments made through the company which were not business opportunities but were, he said, &#8220;Private commitments that (the husband) chose to make&#8221;.</p>

This was in the context of the proposal to bring private investors into Petrodel.  The conversations took place in the years 2001 to 2004.  The husband told Mr Le Breton that he was worth in the order of $40 to $50 million.  This was based in part on what value an investor in the oil trading business might have been prepared to ascribe to Petrodel.  When Mr Todd asked the husband about it, the husband said that the figures were not a fair appraisal of his worth at that time and, later, that he had had no such discussions with Mr Le Breton.  When asked for <span style="font-style:italic">his</span> best estimate, he said that he did not think in those terms and was &#8220;amazed&#8221; that Mr Le Breton would even suggest something like that.</p>

He often paused for a short while before giving his answer.  In my judgment, he did this because he wanted to give the question proper consideration so that his answer was as full and accurate as possible.  Mr Pointer was able to suggest in cross-examination that Mr Le Breton&#8217;s evidence is unreliable both because he has fallen out with the husband and has been engaged in litigation with Petrodel and also because his wife is a very good friend of the wife in this case.  I reject these attempts to suggest that Mr Le Breton is a biased or unreliable witness.  As I have said, I am satisfied that his evidence was reliable.  For many years Mr Le Breton and the husband were very close work colleagues and were also friends.  I am satisfied that Mr Le Breton is in a very good position to give me an accurate insight into the husband&#8217;s and Petrodel&#8217;s affairs.</p>

The husband is clearly an extremely intelligent, articulate and astute individual.  I formed the clear impression that he regards the proceedings as a game in which he has sought to manipulate the process to his advantage.  Despite occasional suggestions, largely at my prompting, that he was seeking to help the court, the husband was an extremely evasive witness.  He was adroit but was deliberately evasive.  He would frequently fail to answer a question although he clearly understood its meaning and would often digress onto a different subject or ask questions about the question.  I do not consider that I can rely on any of the husband&#8217;s evidence unless corroborated by other reliable evidence.</p>

Mr Pointer acknowledged in his closing submissions, and in something of an understatement, that there is an &#8220;incomplete analysis of the assets&#8221;.  The defence or explanation put forward by the husband to seek to explain at least some of his default is that he was bound by the terms of the order made by the Nigerian High Court which, he contends, prohibited him from complying with his disclosure obligations in the English proceedings.

It would, as I have said, be a vain task to seek to make sense of his evidence because I am satisfied that much of it was opportunistic in that he would say whatever he felt at the moment best suited his case or at least provided him with an answer to the question.  There was little attempt to provide a coherent explanation or account.  The wife submits that I can properly draw adverse inferences against the husband having regard to his abject failure to make proper disclosure and his contumelious conduct.

These letters refer to their late father&#8217;s property and/or estate.  The only specific asset mentioned is the Abuja plot.  There is no reference to seed money or the companies but merely to the father&#8217;s estate and to the husband developing the estate for himself and his family.  The husband has, indeed, developed at least part of the father&#8217;s estate in Abuja by building a house.  Interestingly, also, H refers to her having given the husband a sum of money in 1984 which she says he used to buy a property in London which, &#8220;is still in <span style="font-style:italic">your</span> family&#8217;s property portfolio&#8221; (my emphasis).  The first reference to Petrodel appears to be in the letter dated 6<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> June 2008 written on H&#8217;s behalf by lawyers in Nigeria.  In this letter, for the first time, it is asserted that the &#8220;interests&#8221; the husband holds in the company are held on trust.

His recollection, which he said could be wrong, is that the total was either &#163;10,000 or $10,000.  His father asked the husband to hold the money and spoke to him about his role in the company he was then working for and said everybody should try and assist him.

He is clearly well qualified to provide evidence on Nigerian law given his experience as a practising lawyer and as an academic.  The letter of instruction to Professor Sagay contains a list of the assets said to form the father&#8217;s estate.  It is an interesting list as it comprises a number of properties and $1.1 million in bank accounts.  The sum of $10,000 or, indeed, &#163;10,000 apparently given such great significance by the husband and his family is rather modest when contrasted with the size of the late father&#8217;s estate.  The husband&#8217;s evidence on this subject did not make the matter any clearer.  When he was asked in cross-examination what had happened to the sum of $1.1 million, he initially replied that he had &#8220;no idea&#8221;; he had been too busy dealing with other things.  When I explained I was puzzled by this reply, the husband sought to provide a different explanation.  He said that his father&#8217;s sisters had said that the money was theirs.</p>

The main house of the deceased passes to the eldest son.  If, accordingly, the husband took over the main dwelling of his late father and also took control and possession of the bulk of his real property, then a trust would come into effect under Itsekiri customary law under which these properties would be held on trust for himself and his siblings.  This concept, &#8220;does not apply to seed money given by the deceased in his lifetime to the senior son&#8221;.  He also comments about the references to &#8216;seed money&#8217; being expressed in extremely vague terms:</p>

She was also, as I have said, aware of arguments between the siblings but this related to their late father&#8217;s land in Abuja and Warri.  She recalls a meeting which took place in the late 1990s at the parties&#8217; home in London.  The husband&#8217;s siblings complained that the husband had taken the plot in Abuja for his own use.  She has no recollection of the discussions about how, &#8220;we could each liquidate some value from Petrodel,&#8221; which are alleged by the husband to have taken place in Italy in 2006.</p>

The suggestion that the whole family has a substantial interest in PRL as a result of the gift of $10,000 dollars or pounds is, frankly, fanciful.  No attempt was made during the course of the proceedings to produce any documentary evidence to demonstrate how any such sum was used to establish any part of the Petrodel group and no other member of the family has provided evidence in these proceedings to support the husband&#8217;s case.</p>

I am satisfied the husband&#8217;s evidence as to the existence of any seed monies is false.  This has been invented for the purposes of seeking to defeat the wife&#8217;s claims.  Accordingly, the husband can have no obligation towards his siblings in respect of the Petrodel group.  Insofar as the husband has interests in the group or any of the companies within it or any of the assets held by the companies, such interests are held solely for the benefit of himself and his immediate family.  However, I accept Professor Sagay&#8217;s evidence that the husband might be under some customary law obligations in respect of the real property and, in particular, the plot in Abuja left by the husband&#8217;s late father in Nigeria.  My factual conclusions on the issue of the seed money undermine the basis of the Nigerian proceedings but I propose to consider them separately in any event.</p>

Secondly, it refers to the shares originally registered in the husband&#8217;s name as continuing to be held by him as trustee.

As a result of the absence of this information neither expert is able to provide a current market valuation of the group.  Indeed, the husband&#8217;s expert went so far as to say that a current valuation should be obtained based on up-to-date financial information.  As a result, as I have said earlier in this judgment, the expert evidence has provided me with no real assistance in seeking to ascribe a value to the Petrodel group.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">Petrodel was involved in the downstream oil business, the trading of oil products, until about 2006 when it also became involved in the upstream oil business.  As to the latter, Petrodel has an interest in oil blocks in Tanzania.  The company entered into two production sharing contracts (PSCs) with the Tanzanian government in September 2006, one contract being in respect of areas called Kimbiji and Latham and the other being in respect of the area called Tanga.  PRL has in turn entered into agreements in 2008 and in 2011, called farm out agreements, with very substantial public companies by which those companies take responsibility for the costs of exploration and development in return for an interest in the PSC.</p>

Heritage then has the option to proceed with further works costing $30 million.  Under the 2011 agreement a company called Afren has agreed to undertake works as required under the PSC to a maximum cost of $40 million in return for a 74% interest in the Tanga block.  It can be seen from these amounts that the blocks represent very substantial investments.  PRL also appears to have, or there has been reference to its having, a block licence in Zambia but very little information has been given about this.</p>

The husband questioned the use of the word &#8220;typically&#8221; but accepted that the business has generated profits at this level.  The 2007 accounts show a net profit of $5.9 million and net assets of $98 million.  The 2008 accounts show a net profit of just over $400,000 after provision for the diminution in the value of short term investments of $5.8 million.  As Mr Lazarevic comments, this is a book entry and the profit generated from the company&#8217;s activities was above $6 million.  In that year the company repaid loans of $3 million and increased its bank balances by $1.5 million.  The net assets are stated to be $75 million.  I do not consider any significant weight can be placed on the draft 2008 accounts produced with Mr Murphy&#8217;s affidavit.

The husband says that it is an internal document which was a work in progress and never finalised.  It was prepared by a Mr Corrigan who was involved in accountancy and in banking.  He spent some time speaking to the husband for the purposes of preparing the document.  It was intended to be used for the purpose of providing a comprehensive Memorandum to banks to assist with raising money, which the company did not then proceed with.</p>

The husband could also provide no explanation for the fact that the heading remains &#8220;Ownership&#8221; when, following the deletion of the word &#8220;owned&#8221;, there is no longer any reference in the paragraph to ownership.

Mr Lazarevic does not consider that he has had the information necessary even to undertake the tasks referred to in Mr Matthew-Jones&#8217; report, principally a critique of the Information Memorandum and the valuation contained within it.  Mr Lazarevic also made the point, a telling point in my view, that as two major oil companies have invested in the oil blocks in Tanzania held by PRL, there must be a great deal of information available and to which, as the husband controls the group, he would have access which would assist with arriving at a proper value for the PRL group.  He would expect this to include what is called a &#8220;competent person&#8217;s&#8221; report giving an assessment and evaluation of the PSCs.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">The experts agree that neither the book value of the PSCs under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), nor the directors&#8217; valuation as appearing in the accounts (of December 2008), reflect their current market value.  Mr Matthew-Jones also questioned the reliability of the accounts generally because of the number of errors in them.  In the 2007 accounts the oil blocks were given a value of $76 million, in the 2008 accounts this is reduced to $39 million.  Mr Matthew-Jones deletes the latter figure entirely from his revised schedule and replaces it with a figure supplied by the husband of &#163;1.86 million arriving at revised net assets for PRL of $12 million.  I see no reason to accept this reduction simply on the husband&#8217;s word.  I am also not in a position to determine whether the figure of $39 million or any other figure is too high or too low.  The unsatisfactory nature of the evidence and the way in which the case developed can be demonstrated, for example, by the fact that in his opening submissions Mr Pointer says the best evidence of the present value of Petrodel is in the range of $20 million to $58.6 million while in his closing submissions he gives the value of PRL Isle of Man as minus $10.8 million.  This arose as a result of the failure previously to allow for the additional BNP loan of $33.7 million &#8211; shifting sands.</p>

Given that he was provided with very little of the information he would require properly to undertake even the limited exercise of preparing a critique of the Information Memorandum, his evidence has been of little assistance.  Further, as referred to earlier in this judgment, he does not purport to seek to determine the current value of PRL but rather he analyses the extent to which some of the figures which have been put forward comply with IFRS.  These are accounting standards which Mr Lazarevic described as only going a very limited way towards a valuation.  I agree with this observation.  He also made the sound observation that what would be required would be a valuation of the company&#8217;s assets, not of the figures to be included in accounts in accordance with IFRS.</p>

By a legal mortgage dated 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2006 PRL charged the properties in its name in favour of BNP for $14.625 million.  The charge was, as I have said, to secure a loan of $12.5 million provided to PRL to finance what is called a signature bonus in respect of an oil block called OPL258.  The loan initially matured on 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2007.  The husband says that the sum of $12.5 million has not been repaid by the Nigerian government or its agencies.  In the course of his oral evidence the husband first said that when PRL pulled out of block 258 the Nigerian government refused to refund the money.  He said that he has a letter to this effect, which has not been produced.  He was then shown correspondence in the bundles in which it is clear that the government, or its agency, says that the sum will be refunded.  The husband then gave a string of unconvincing answers in which he sought to give an explanation for his evidence.  They were based on a suggestion that in order to get repaid PRL entered into negotiations in respect of and took an option on a different block.  It may well be that the sum of $12.5 million has been repaid but, if it has, it is clear that it was not used to repay the loan obtained from BNP.</p>

He also submits that I should accept the wife&#8217;s evidence and find that the properties are held on resulting trust as a result of the husband providing the money used for their purchase.

Mr Todd also submits that the husband&#8217;s conduct during the course of these proceedings entitles me to draw adverse inferences against him.

If he were to argue the case on the wife&#8217;s needs, Mr Todd submits that the application of this principle would produce an award in the region of &#163;17.4 million.  This comprises a house in London for &#163;4.4 million, a holiday home of &#163;2 million, a Duxbury sum of &#163;10 million based on a level income need of &#163;400,000 and a legal expenses fund of &#163;1 million.

	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.54in">&#8220;Ideally the Family Division and the Chancery Division should plainly apply a common approach.  However, the fact remains that different considerations do frequently pertain: the company approach, on the one hand, being predominantly concerned with parties at arm&#8217;s length in a contractual or similar relationship; the family approach, on the other hand, being concerned with the distributive powers of the court as between husband and wife applying discretionary considerations to what would often be a mainly, if not entirely, family situation.</p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.54in">I would echo the experience referred to by both Cumming-Bruce LJ and Connell J as regards lifting the veil in the Family Division when it is just and necessary.  In practice, especially in big money cases, the husband (as I will assume) will often make a concession that company/trust assets can be treated as his, whereafter the case proceeds conventionally on that basis.  It is pragmatic, saves expense and usually works.  Problems such as have arisen in this case are rare and anyway can be avoided where there are other assets against which the lump sum order can be enforced.</p>

		</level>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.54in">The difficulty remains in defining those situations when lifting the veil is appropriate by way of enforcement following such a concession in ancillary relief proceedings.  I would suggest that the Family Division can make orders directly or indirectly regarding a company&#8217;s assets where: (a) the husband (as I am assuming) is the owner and controller of the company concerned and; (b) where there are no adverse third parties whose position or interests would be likely to be prejudiced by such an order being made.  I include as third parties those with real minority interests in the company and where relevant on the facts creditors and directors.  The reason for my including the latter two categories will become apparent later in this judgment.</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.54in">I adopt the rationalisation of this offered by Mr Hunter, that it would amount merely to a short-circuiting of the full company law route, namely the declaration of a dividend to the husband comprising the company asset concerned, eg the matrimonial home, enabling him and/or the court then to transfer it onwards to the wife.  It would amount to his property for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref> in the same sense that the law may look on that as done as ought to be done while the mechanics of the order would be along the lines adopted by Connell J in <span style="font-style:italic">Green v Green</span>.&#8221;</p>

Although the effect is to pierce the corporate veil it is, in my view, a question of statutory interpretation.  Does the power given to the court by the Matrimonial Causes Act extend to property held through a corporate or other structure to which one spouse is (in effect) entitled through the use of rights and powers available to him or her?  Bodey J decided that if a party has effective control of the legal or corporate structure and, because third party interests would not be prejudiced, is also the only person effectively entitled to the benefit of the property, then that property is within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref> as being &#8220;property to which &#8230; (that) party is entitled in possession&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">This is an important issue because in wealthy families it is not uncommon, and among international families it is common, for assets including an English matrimonial home to be held through a company, for sound and legitimate tax and other reasons.  <span style="font-style:italic">Minwalla v Minwalla <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 FLR 771" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 FLR 771</ref></span> is an example of such a situation and one in which the court made an order in respect of the property.  The existence of such a structure rarely provides any true restraint on the beneficial use of this property by one or other of the spouses.  It is simply a choice of the form in which they hold <span style="font-style:italic">their</span> wealth so that, notwithstanding the corporate structure, the equity in such a home is an asset to which they have full access, or, to put it in the language of the statute, to which they are entitled.  The company may be a separate legal entity as a matter of English law, and in some cases, although not in this, rent or licence payments may be made,  but I am confident that the owner of the corporate structure would invariably view the wealth within the company structure as being theirs and available for their use as they wish.  In practice this is also achieved because they have complete control over the corporate structure and, subject to legitimate third party interests, are alone entitled to the benefit of the wealth within it.</p>

The court cannot grant relief merely because the husband&#8217;s arrangements appear to be artificial or even &#8216;dodgy&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

A company could be a fa&#231;ade even though it had not originally been incorporated with any deceptive intent.  The question was whether it was being used as a fa&#231;ade at the time of the relevant transactions.  The court could not pierce the corporate veil merely because it was thought to be necessary in the interests of justice and the required impropriety must be linked to the use of the company structure to avoid or conceal liability.  The court would pierce the veil only so far as was necessary to provide a remedy for the particular wrong done by those controlling the company.  The wife had failed to establish sufficient control of the company by the husband and there was no relevant impropriety.  The court was not entitled to pierce the veil of incorporation in this case.&#8221;</p>

It might be thought that it would be relatively straightforward for me to state what the husband&#8217;s case is in respect of his interest in the Petrodel group.  It is not.  The husband has never clearly described the extent of his interest in the group.  In his Form E he makes no reference to his having any interest at all.  Further, as referred to earlier in this judgment, the husband has not provided the evidence which would enable the value of any such interest to be ascertained.  When I asked Mr Pointer during his final submissions to tell me what I would write down if I was to set out the husband&#8217;s case as to ownership of the group, he was unable to provide me with a clear answer.  All he could do was to invite me to accept the husband&#8217;s evidence and that the shareholdings are as described, adding that the structure functions for the benefit of the husband and the wider P family.  This takes the matter no further having regard to the nature of the husband&#8217;s evidence which itself does not provide an answer.</p>

Just before this evidence, the husband had been asked by Mr Todd whether it was right that he was the ultimate owner.  The husband also replied to this question that he would have to take the advice of his Nigerian lawyer, Mr Elusogbon.  Yet the husband has specifically sought to assert that, as a result of the gift to him from his late father of seed money, the Petrodel group is subject to a trust for the benefit of his late father&#8217;s children.  The extent of this alleged trust is not clear.  In the course of his cross-examination the husband agreed that his position in the Nigerian proceedings is that he holds <span style="font-style:italic">his</span> interest in PRL Nigeria on trust for his siblings.  But, when he was then asked what interest he is holding on trust for himself and his siblings he replied that this was to be defined by the Nigerian court.  This was an answer that he gave on a number of occasions during the course of his evidence: that it was for the Nigerian court to determine or, for example, he could do something such as give shares to his family if the Nigerian court determined that he was obliged to do so.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">From the husband&#8217;s answers the whole structure appears to be sufficiently flexible so that the Nigerian court has the ability to determine who owns what.  Potentially, everything is held for the benefit of the family and it would be for the court to decide how it should be divided within the family.  As Mr Pointer commented during the course of the hearing, this flexible power would, on the husband&#8217;s case, be pursuant to Itsekiri customary law and not English trust law.  If, however, I were to reject, as I have, the husband&#8217;s case as to any alleged interest held for his siblings, it would seem to follow that the whole structure would be held for the husband&#8217;s benefit alone.</p>

He said it is his late father&#8217;s estate which would include everything that derives from what his father left the husband and also everything that derives from the seed money.  The husband specifically asserted that the trust includes <span style="font-style:italic">everything</span> (my emphasis) which Petrodel has and <span style="font-style:italic">everything</span> (my emphasis again) created by Petrodel.  This was a very broad answer.  When he was then asked whether this would include the properties held in the name of Petrodel the husband, clearly seeing the difficulties created by his broad answer, said that he is uncertain and would have to seek legal advice to be sure.  When asked whether the company shares would be subject to the trust, the husband said that he did not know the answer to that question.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">A bit later the husband said, in contrast to his earlier answer, that he does not hold any shares in PRL Nigeria.  He could not then explain why his brother would assert that he did hold shares, nor why he did not assert in his Nigerian defence that he holds no such shares.  When I then asked the husband what interest he has in PRL Nigeria which he holds on trust for his siblings, the husband said, &#8220;I have an interest consistent with Itsekiri customary law&#8221;.  When I asked what that interest is, the husband again said that this is what is being determined by the court in Nigeria.  He said that he had inherited his father&#8217;s estate which may or may not include PRL Nigeria, &#8220;That is what we are trying to define in Nigeria&#8221;.  If it is included, the husband would presume that his late father&#8217;s children would own the shares in PRL Nigeria.  If PRL Nigeria was not part of the estate, the husband could not say what the consequence would be because, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t thought it through if it&#8217;s not,&#8221; and, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t given that matter any thought&#8221;.  This was, yet again, an evasive answer, no doubt because the husband could not think what to say which would help his case.</p>

As described earlier in this judgment, the husband for the first time made the surprising assertion that PRL Nigeria owns the shares in PRL Nevis.  This alleged circular arrangement was later said by the husband to have been set up on the advice of his Nigerian lawyer.  He told the husband not to worry; that everything was under control; and that the husband would be able to do <span style="font-style:italic">whatever</span> his customary law obligations required and would be able to float the company and, &#8220;provide shares for my siblings&#8221;.  It is clear to me, from this evidence alone, that the husband has control of the corporate structure effectively as beneficial owner as he is able to change the structure and distribute the wealth within it to himself and/or his family as may be required or, I would add, as he wishes.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In a sworn statement filed in the Nigerian proceedings the husband said that in 2006/2007 he was planning to float Petrodel and allot shares in the floated company to the wife and his siblings.  In his section 25 statement the husband said that discussions took place in 2006 about how, &#8220;we could each liquidate some value from Petrodel&#8221;.  In his oral evidence he said that &#8220;everybody would have shares&#8221; in the &#8220;family business&#8221; and upon floatation they could sell some of their shares thereby producing a &#8220;revenue event&#8221; for them.  When cross-examined about this, the husband gave what, in my judgment, were deliberately evasive answers.  This was typical of the husband&#8217;s evidence when he found it difficult for the purposes of his case to provide a clear answer.  He was unable to explain how the allotment of shares to his family was going to be achieved.  When it was suggested that he would not have been in a position to &#8220;give away&#8221; shares as a chief executive, he said that his written statement contained an expression of the &#8220;game plan&#8221; and a &#8220;general expression of what the intention was&#8221;.  When it was suggested that he could not have achieved this intention if he did not own any shares he said, &#8220;If you apply a literal translation, I understand what you are saying&#8221;.</p>

When it was suggested to him by Mr Todd that he could cause the sale of any of these properties and the payment of the net proceeds of sale as he directed, the husband gave a similar answer to that which he gave on many occasions, namely that he operates and controls the group of companies and that the seed money for these companies was given to him by his late father to invest on behalf of himself and his siblings consistently with Itsekiri customary law.  Accordingly, he went on to say that, if what Mr Todd was proposing was consistent with his obligations, then he, &#8220;would accept what you say&#8221;.  In other words, the husband accepted that if his customary law obligations required him to procure the sale of the properties and the payment of the net proceeds of sale as he directed, he could do this.  Further, when the husband was then asked whether there was any obstacle in his deciding to pay all the net proceeds of sale to himself as one of the beneficiaries of this alleged trust, he did not identify any obstacle beyond saying that this is a matter which has yet to be decided by the Nigerian court.  In respect of the property at W Avenue the husband also said in cross-examination that the Nigerian court would also determine whether his siblings are entitled to a share of the net proceeds of sale of this property.</p>

How do these cases stand together?  It would seem to me that one way in which they would stand together would be if the assets held within the corporate structure are held for the benefit of someone who does not hold any shares.  If the husband does not have an interest in the companies and/or any of the assets he would be a trustee of nothing.  In this part of the husband&#8217;s evidence he could be taken as acknowledging the possibility of Petrodel&#8217;s assets being subject to a trust.</p>

Ultimately I have decided that I have been seeking to impose an unduly legalistic framework onto a relatively simply factual situation, namely that the husband operates and controls the Petrodel group and its assets for the benefit of his immediate family.  The wealth within the group is the family&#8217;s wealth to which the husband has unrestricted access.  I am satisfied that the husband is both the effective owner and controller of the whole of the Petrodel corporate structure.  In coming to this conclusion I accept the evidence of Mr Le Breton that the husband told him that he is the ultimate beneficial owner and I also accept his apposite phrase that Petrodel is the husband and the husband is Petrodel.  In my judgment, the Information Memorandum as found by the wife accurately describes the husband as the owner.</p>

If not by schedules he could have achieved the same result by other clear evidence.  The same observations apply to a considerable degree to explanations of his current expenditure.  Instead the Registrar and this court were faced with prolonged argument on a welter of potentially confusing facts, a mass of figures in confused order, a complete absence of books of account or even a wages book, no schedules or summaries prepared by or for the husband, and no proper affidavits or documents or list of documents.&#8221;</p>

This requires the production of such information and documents as is needed to provide as much clarity as is reasonably possible.  In this case the husband has wholly failed to comply with this obligation and he is, indeed, in the same position as the husband referred to in the judgment of Sachs J.  He has failed to comply with court orders including for specific disclosure and he has given misleading information and evidence.  In the course of preparing this judgment I have had the opportunity to consider the course of the financial proceedings and all the evidence in detail.

He has failed to provide any convincing explanation for these failures.  The documents and information he has supplied during the course of the hearing were too late for any proper analysis or investigation to take place.  In any event, given the husband&#8217;s lack of credibility, I can place little, if any, weight on his oral evidence when unsupported by credible corroborative evidence.

I am satisfied that he has the financial resources to meet the award I propose to make in the wife&#8217;s favour and that, in addition, he will retain sufficient resources to meet his own needs and to give him a fair share of the wealth.  The only fair conclusion to draw is that the husband has other resources which he did not want to reveal to this court in the hope, or perhaps expectation, of minimising any award in the wife&#8217;s favour.  He continued to be obstructive even after Mr Le Breton had given evidence of the husband telling him in the years up to 2004 that he was worth between $40 and $50 million.  I have no doubt that since these conversations took place the husband&#8217;s fortunes have increased.  Petrodel has moved significantly into oil exploration and it would have been easy for the husband to procure the disclosure of the information necessary to enable these particular interests to be valued.  This suggests to me that the husband&#8217;s total wealth is likely to be substantially in excess of the figures he discussed with Mr Le Breton, although I take into account that a significant element, namely the value of his interests in Petrodel, may not be easily realisable and may be properly described as risk assets.</p>

The accounts for PRL suggest that the company has made a total net profit for the four years 2005 to 2008 of $19 million (adding back the sum deducted in the 2008 accounts for the diminution in the value of investments).  It is not possible to identify properly what profits might have been generated through any other companies.  It is also not possible properly to value Petrodel&#8217;s interests in the PSCs.  Given that the husband considered he was worth in the region of $40 to $50 million in the period up to 2004, it is obvious to me that his wealth will have increased since then by the accumulation of savings or other hidden investments and by the development of Petrodel in the years since.

In my judgment the company structure in this case was set up and has been used for conventional reasons including wealth protection and the avoidance of tax.  Mr Todd is right, for example, to point to the reference in the annex to the husband&#8217;s Form E to his transferring his shares in PRL Nigeria to the Nevis company because he was involved in litigation.  However, this does not result in the company structure being used to conceal or avoid liability.  It is seeking to provide a degree of protection for the wealth, which may or may not be effective depending on the nature of the rights retained by the husband.  He is also right to point to the company structure effectively being the husband&#8217;s money box which he uses at will.  This might be contrary to accounting or company law principles but any disregard of those principles does not, in my view, mean that the structure is being used to avoid or conceal liability.  From the husband&#8217;s perspective the wealth and the corporate structure is and remains his but at the same time he is able to take advantage of the tax and other benefits of holding it within a corporate structure.</p>

It is simply a husband giving false evidence.  Accordingly, I do not consider that the wife has established impropriety in this case.  I must, therefore, address the issue of whether I can make orders direct against shares and properties held in the names of the Respondent companies absent any impropriety.

I have seen no reference to any determination being made of the husband&#8217;s bonus.  The husband does not know how his income and bonus were accounted for in the accounts.  There is reference to director&#8217;s remuneration but the amounts are substantially less than the amounts paid to the husband or for the benefit of the family.  The husband himself accepts that the structure is such that he is able to effect whatever might be required to meet his obligations under Itsekiri customary law, be it transferring shares to his siblings or otherwise.  How, I ask, would the husband be able to achieve this if he is not the effective owner of the whole group and of the companies?</p>

It is also clear to me that the husband looks at things from the perspective of obligations or need.  The legal structure is of secondary importance save that clearly any such structure must be capable of being used to enable his obligations and/or needs to be met.  So, for example, if the husband&#8217;s customary law obligations require him to give his siblings shares in the company, then the structure must be such as to enable him to do so.  I am confident that Mr Elusogbon did tell the husband not to worry because, indeed, the structure which holds the wealth and assets can be adjusted as required, or to put it another way the wealth held within the structure is freely available to be distributed as the husband directs.  It is difficult to see how this could be achieved by him unless he controls, in English law terms, both the legal and beneficial interests in the worth.  Further, if the husband not only has complete control but also is the sole effective owner, which I have found that he is, in my judgment, again in English law terms, I would see this as equating to beneficial ownership.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In summary, therefore, in my judgment the answer to the question of whether an asset held in the legal name of a company is property which falls within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24(1)</ref>(a) depends on the facts of the case.  It is right, of course, that as a matter of company law a shareholder only has a right of participation in accordance with the terms of the Articles of Association and has no right to any particular item of property.  But, what if the shareholder is, in fact, able to procure the transfer to them of a particular item of company property, such as a matrimonial home, as a result of their control and ownership of the company and the absence of any third party interests.  Am I to ignore the reality that the shareholder is able to procure the transfer to them of that property for the purposes of deciding whether it is property to which they are entitled?</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">In my judgment, it would be contrary to the purpose and intention of the legislation if I was to do so.  The legislation is intended to ensure that marital wealth can be distributed by the court between the parties in a fair and just manner.  In this case the husband can without inhibition acquire the properties and shares which the wife seeks because, in effect, the companies are his nominees or agents.  As a result, in my judgment, the husband is &#8220;entitled&#8221; to the shares and properties held in the names of the corporate respondents because there is no impediment, including third party interests, to his enjoying the full benefit of these assets.  They are held by the companies for the husband because the corporate structure is being used as a repository for the family wealth.  Effectively the husband, in respect of the companies and their assets, is in the same position he would be in if he was the beneficiary of a bare trust or the companies were his nominees.  There exists no legal impediment to his procuring the transfer of the assets held by the companies into his name.  In the language of the cases, they are his &#8220;alter ago&#8221;.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I do not consider that the company law principles, relied upon in particular by Mr Wagstaffe, determine the scope of the powers given to the court under the Matrimonial Causes Act.  In my view, if a party is both the effective controller and the effective owner of a company it does not strain the language of the Matrimonial Causes Act to decide that he is &#8220;entitled &#8230; in possession&#8221; to an asset held by that company such as a former matrimonial home.  This interpretation accords with what was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Nicholas</span>.  As identified in <span style="font-style:italic">Mubarak,</span> he is entitled to the asset in possession because he has the right and ability to procure its transfer to him for his own use.  This is not to challenge the principles established by <span style="font-style:italic">Salomon</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Adams v Cape</span> or the other authorities referred to in the decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Ben Hashem</span>.  It is to recognise, as was said by Slade LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Cape</span> at page 536G, with my emphasis:</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">As a matter of general law the companies in the Petrodel group may be separate legal entities but, in my judgment, under the Matrimonial Causes Act their assets fall within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/24" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 24</ref> as a result of the complete nature of the husband&#8217;s control and ownership.  As Mr Wagstaffe submitted, the wife can have no stronger claim than the husband&#8217;s.  In this case, as a result of his control and ownership, the husband is able to procure the transfer of the properties and shares into his sole name or as he may direct.  The case was argued on behalf of the husband and the companies on the basis of the husband&#8217;s rights as against the company.  Apart from the alleged interests of the husband&#8217;s siblings, which I have rejected, it has not been asserted that any other rights or interests would or should inhibit me from making the orders sought by the wife.</p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.49in">I also propose to deal specifically with the position of W Avenue.  I am satisfied that the monies used in the purchase and refurbishment of that property came from the husband.  There is no evidence that he lent this money to the company, nor that he gifted it to the company.  Accordingly, if it were necessary for me to decide the issue, I would decide specifically that the company holds that property on resulting trust for the husband.</p>

I also propose to structure the order in the manner advanced by Mr Todd but at this stage I propose to limit the properties which I order to be transferred to the wife to the properties in Nevis and the properties in England and in respect of the shares I propose to limit the order to the shares in EDL England and EDL Nevis.  I adjourn the issue as to whether I should make any transfer in respect of the shares of any other company or any other property to a later date.</p>
