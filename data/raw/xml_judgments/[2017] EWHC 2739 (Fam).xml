I have decided that in the particular circumstances of the case this judgment should set out my findings of fact (i.e. computation) and that I should then receive further submissions before I decide how to exercise my dispositive powers (i.e. distribution). Counsel do not oppose this course.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is common ground that the family enjoyed a very high standard of living. This is because the husband was a highly successful businessman and was very rich. The question that I must decide is whether he still is very rich. The husband says that he is not; indeed, he says he is insolvent to the tune of &#163;2m. This, he says, is as a result of virtually his entire fortune, some &#163;200m, being stolen from him in March 2014 by a convicted fraudster Dr Gerald Smith with the assistance of his (the husband&#8217;s) treacherous former &#8220;front-men&#8221; Simon Cooper and Simon McNally. The wife says that this is a false presentation. She says that the husband remains vastly rich in that very large sums, or the right to receive very large sums, are held on his behalf by a nominee, Anthony Stevens. Further, should he win an arbitration against BAE very large value from the development of two BAE sites which he will be able to purchase will come his way.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The abstraction was, according to the husband, a breath-taking act of self-help by Dr Smith done in the middle of proceedings commenced, effectively by him (Dr Smith), in the Commercial Court on 29 October 2012 (&#8220;the Orb litigation&#8221;). Those proceedings, which gave rise to a counter-claim by the husband, were complex, elaborate and expensive. They spawned allegations of the worst kinds of litigation misconduct. To describe them as &#8220;hard-fought&#8221; would be a serious understatement. Although they were ostensibly compromised by a consent order made by Mr Justice Popplewell on 6 May 2016, providing for a mutual dismissal of the claims (&#8220;the drop-hands agreement&#8221;), they have recently sprung back into life (&#8220;the Phoenix proceedings&#8221;).</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A key historical fact is that in the autumn of 2002 Dr Smith, who was then Chief Executive of Orb, stole approximately &#163;35 million from Izodia plc, a company in which Orb held a 29.9% shareholding, and misapplied the bulk of those monies for Orb's benefit.  In April 2006 Dr Smith pleaded guilty to theft and false accounting and received an eight-year prison sentence. In November 2007, a confiscation order was made (by consent) in the amount of &#163;41m, a national record, with a default sentence of a further 8 years in prison. KPMG were appointed as enforcement receivers. Modest recoveries have been made but interest has accrued so that the sum outstanding now stands at over &#163;60m. In Mr Pointer QC&#8217;s words &#8220;Smith is out to defeat [the husband] utterly. He chooses to blame [the husband] for his conviction and incarceration in 2006&#8221;. Moreover, Dr Smith says (and in a recital to the confiscation order he asserts) that the husband holds realisable property belonging to Dr Smith in a sum in excess of &#163;41m, and that he (Dr Smith) has no other assets. On his release from prison in 2010 Dr Smith (through his cohorts) intimated his claims against the husband which led to the launch of the Orb proceedings in October 2012. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">All of the judgments are interlocutory, and they by no means represent the full extent of the litigation. There have been numerous other rulings and orders, a foray to the Court of Appeal, as well as proceedings in the Isle of Man, and in the BVI and on appeal to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal. The Phoenix proceedings are described in Judgment No. (vi). It can be seen that in that case there are four official parties but additional &#8220;interested parties&#8221; making claims, in different forms. All the judgments, whether before or after the revival of the proceedings, were given publicly, and most of the proceedings were held in public. It was for this main reason that I, exceptionally, ruled that the trial before me should be held in public, but subject to certain reporting restrictions. In this way, the interested parties could attend and observe the husband give oral evidence under thorough cross-examination. That has not yet happened in the Commercial Court.</p>

The husband is not a party to, or otherwise participating in those proceedings. I declined to do so. The wife&#8217;s financial remedy claims were well advanced, and had been ongoing since January 2014. By contrast, the Phoenix proceedings only commenced in June 2016, and are in their very early stages; indeed, some of the claims by the interested parties, have not yet, even now, been expressed in issued claim forms. There was no prospect of any resolution for years. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in order to try to avoid the prospect of inconsistent judgments, and the vice of duplicative proceedings generally, I ordered that the wife&#8217;s statement of case and other key document were to be served on the parties to, and the interested parties in, the Phoenix proceedings, together with a copy of my judgment on that day, and I allowed those persons and bodies so served to intervene in the proceedings before me.   In that judgment, I expressed the view that if the served persons and bodies did not intervene then my findings would not be binding on them. Plainly, cause of action estoppel could not arise as neither the parties nor the subject matter of the proceedings would be the same. Nor could issue estoppel, as the served persons and bodies would not, in the absence of their intervention, be parties to the proceedings before me. I expressed the view that it would be doubtful if the doctrine of abusive collateral attack could apply. Now, I am not so sure, although it is not for me to make the definitive ruling.

This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all.&#8221; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">For the purposes of the case before me I have been given reams of paper from the Orb proceedings and the Phoenix proceedings. The paperwork has included the judgments mentioned above and numerous witness statements. In his opening skeleton Mr Pointer QC argued that the judgments were inadmissible under the rule in <span style="font-style:italic">Hollington v Hewthorn</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1943] KB 857" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1943">[1943] KB 857</ref>. He further argued that the witness statements had questionable status as the notice requirements in FPR 23.2 had not been complied with. However, as the case proceeded over its 10-day span Mr Pointer QC made numerous references in support of his case to this material and specifically relied on those judgments which had been in the husband&#8217;s favour and especially strongly on a lengthy witness statement from Mr Stevens dated 7 November 2014. By the time he came to make his final submissions he had largely abandoned his objections.   I therefore do not need to decide definitively whether the rule still survives (as Christopher Clarke LJ has held in an obiter dictum in <span style="font-style:italic">Hoyle v Rogers &amp; Anor</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/257" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 257" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 257</ref> at [39]), or whether it has been abrogated by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/38" uk:canonical="1995 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Civil Evidence Act 1995</ref>.

The husband and the wife were each thoroughly cross-examined. The husband was in the witness box over four days. No stone was left unturned. I have previously explained why the scrutiny of contemporary documents in oral evidence under cross-examination is the gold standard for producing reliable evidence for the proof of facts (<span style="font-style:italic">Carmarthenshire County Council v Y</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2017/36" uk:canonical="[2017] EWFC 36" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] EWFC 36</ref> at [7] &#8211; [10]). I was therefore surprised that the husband did not cause Mr Stevens to give oral evidence to support the case that he (Mr Stevens) was not, and never had been, the husband&#8217;s nominee. Mr Stevens is the husband&#8217;s ally and there is nothing to suggest that he would have been resistant to attend to give evidence to back up his lengthy and detailed witness statement made in the Orb proceedings. Equally I was surprised that the wife had made no attempt to secure the attendance of Dr Smith. She has had many meetings with him, and he has even tried to reward her with a &#163;500,000 gift for the maintenance and education of the children. I refer to this at para 84 below. Dr Smith has had a representative sitting in court throughout the proceedings before me and has supplied the wife with important documentary evidence late on in the trial.

Thus, depending on the circumstances, a prima facie case may become a strong or even an overwhelming case.

		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;The modification to which I have referred concerns the drawing of adverse inferences in claims for ancillary financial relief in matrimonial proceedings, which have some important distinctive features. There is a public interest in the proper maintenance of the wife by her former husband, especially (but not only) where the interests of the children are engaged. Partly for that reason, the proceedings although in form adversarial have a substantial inquisitorial element. The family finances will commonly have been the responsibility of the husband, so that although technically a claimant, the wife is in reality dependent on the disclosure and evidence of the husband to ascertain the extent of her proper claim. The concept of the burden of proof, which has always been one of the main factors inhibiting the drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of evidence or disclosure, cannot be applied in the same way to proceedings of this kind as it is in ordinary civil litigation. These considerations are not a licence to engage in pure speculation. But judges exercising family jurisdiction are entitled to draw on their experience and to take notice of the inherent probabilities when deciding what an uncommunicative husband is likely to be concealing. I refer to the husband because the husband is usually the economically dominant party, but of course the same applies to the economically dominant spouse whoever it is.&#8221; </p>

In drawing on my experience and the &#8220;inherent probabilities&#8221; I conclude that the reason for the absence of Mr Stevens was that the husband feared that admissions would have been extracted from him at variance with his case. Equally, the failure by the wife to call Dr Smith is unfortunate and of significance. Dr Smith would have been able to have given relevant evidence in support of the wife&#8217;s case, although as a convicted fraudster his testimony would have had to have been treated with great care. </p>

Of the total sum of &#163;35 million stolen, only about &#163;2.8 million was returned, leaving a balance of about &#163;32.2 million owing to Izodia. In December 2002, the Serious Fraud Office raided Orb's offices in London and Jersey. As a result of the SFO's investigations, Dr Smith personally faced criminal sanctions. By early 2003, Izodia had also brought proceedings against Orb and Dr Smith for recovery of sums transferred from Izodia's bank account. Once Dr Smith's Izodia theft had been discovered, those in control of Orb resolved to sell a substantial proportion of Orb's assets.</p>

In particular the Orb Parties allege that it was agreed amongst other things that Mr Ruhan would redevelop, restructure, manage and/or dispose of the Hotel Portfolio and the Orb Securities Portfolio; he would pay Orb, Mr Taylor and Mr Thomas (in agreed proportions) 40% of the profits thereby generated from the Hotel Portfolio; and he would pay Orb 50% of the profits thereby generated from the Orb Securities Portfolio, with Orb retaining a 50% interest in any assets retained within the Orb Securities Portfolio. It is alleged that Mr Thomas subsequently negotiated a further 7.5% share of the profits and retained assets in respect of the Orb Securities Portfolio. Mr Ruhan denies any such oral agreement. The written agreement dated 7 May 2003 by which the Hotel Portfolio was transferred (as varied on 13, 14 and 23 May 2003) provided that Orb group should receive interest bearing loan notes in the principal sum of &#163;35 million issued by Atlantic Hotels (UK) Ltd, which following completion would be the holding company of subsidiaries through which the Hotel Portfolio would be held, and that these should be assigned by Orb to Izodia in settlement of the claim brought by Izodia against Orb and Dr Smith, amongst others.</p>

The trustee was Atticus Trust Co Ltd. Between 2005 and 9 April 2014, there were over 100 companies within the Arena Settlement. It is the Orb Parties' case that Mr Ruhan, in breach of the May 2003 agreement and his fiduciary duties, sold on the Orb Assets to third parties for his personal profit and concealed such sales behind an opaque arrangement with, principally, a Mr Anthony Stevens.</p>

The husband in his evidence denied this, or anything like this, absolutely. I accept the husband&#8217;s evidence, which Dr Smith has not sought to challenge before me. I am satisfied that Dr Smith did not acquire or retain an interest in the relevant assets and that the entire Orb proceedings were based on a lie. However, from the time that the enforcement receivers were appointed the husband was aware that Dr Smith was making this claim, and the question is whether he took protective measures, using Mr Stevens as his nominee, in relation to his subsequent disposal of the assets.  </p>

At a later stage, 20% of the shares in Cambulo Madeira were transferred to Wellard, a company owned by Mr Stevens' brother. It is the claimants' case that these shareholdings in Cambulo Madeira are held as nominees for Mr Ruhan so that profits received by that company are subject to the alleged profit-sharing oral agreement.</p>

So far as the Kensington Park and Kensington Palace Hotels were concerned, additional expenditure was involved in relation to the purchase of other land and the development of social housing in order to fulfil the terms of a section 106 agreement with the local authority which was necessary in order to obtain planning permission. There is no reason to doubt Mr Stevens' evidence that the total profit on the Kensington Hotels for Cambulo Madeira amounted to &#163;114.6 million, as its half share of the net profit.</p>

By this time, Mr Ruhan, using companies outside the Arena Settlement, namely Bridge Towers Holdings 1 Ltd, Bridge Towers Holdings 2 Ltd and six subsidiary Bridge Towers companies, was involved in property development in Qatar in two separate projects. In pursuing this, Bridge Tower Holdings 1 obtained a loan of $143 million from Investec, secured on the Qatar assets themselves, and on the Sentrum assets also (rather than vice-versa). Investec was however looking for additional security and Mr Stevens' evidence is that, for a fee and a small profit participation, he was prepared to assist Mr Ruhan in this respect. On 21 December 2007, although the Kensington Hotels had not yet been sold, profits were expected when they did sell and Mr Stevens allowed Euro Estates 80% shareholding in Cambulo Madeira to be used as collateral in respect of the Investec loan to Bridge Tower Holdings 1, it being a term required by Investec that, if there was a relevant sale of the Kensington Hotels which preceded the realisation of the proceeds of the Qatar development or other refinancing, the proceeds from such disposal would be used to repay the outstanding Investec loan facility.</span></p>

From 2012 to 2015 the Lotus F1 team was 90% owned by Gravity Motorsports S.a.r.l. It was then sold back to Renault for a nominal sum. Gravity is majority owned by Genii Capital, created and controlled by two Luxembourgers Gerard Lopez and Eric Lux. The husband has a 2% interest in Gravity. Until its demise he was co-chairman of it. The evidence shows that Grenda (Mr Stevens&#8217;s company) lent &#8364;91m or &#163;75m to Gravity. The husband says that this was Mr Stevens&#8217;s decision, and that unfortunately it has been irretrievably lost. As against that, there is a personal guarantee in existence from Messrs Lopez and Lux in favour of Grenda for &#163;35m.  There is no evidence that they are not good for the money. Therefore, on the evidence &#163;40m has been lost.</p>

And that accordingly they were the subject of the appropriation by Dr Smith in 2014. I have no reason to doubt that.

On 25 April 2017, they applied for an order that the husband should produce the loan note and all other documents by which the proceedings were settled, and on 10 May 2017 I made an order to that effect. On 15 May 2017, the husband made a witness statement to which he attached the loan note; a confidential no-sue deed; a sale and purchase agreement concerning the share capital of Minardi Investments Ltd; a letter from Dr Cochrane to Phoenix; a deed of release between Minardi and SMA; and a liquidation inter-creditor settlement agreement. All of these documents were dated <span style="font-weight:bold">29 April 2016.</span> They had been received by the husband&#8217;s matrimonial solicitors from his current commercial solicitors, Richard Slade &amp; Co. Unfortunately, as a result of a glitch in the offices of the husband&#8217;s matrimonial solicitors not every document in the email from the commercial solicitors to the matrimonial solicitors was printed out and attached to the husband&#8217;s witness statement. This was only discovered during the hearing before me and as a result there was produced a confidential settlement deed bearing the date 28 April 2016 (but probably actually signed the following day) and a signed letter between Dr Cochrane and Phoenix dated 29 April 2016 whereby she promised to transfer 50% of the shares in Sentrum Rugby to Phoenix. These shares would have quite considerable value. Of course, I attribute no blame to the husband&#8217;s matrimonial solicitors for failing to print out these additional documents, as mistakes like this happen all the time even in the most efficiently run office.

He quite clearly stated in it that he was forced to discontinue because he was unable to obtain litigation funding for the Orb proceedings. On 14 September 2017, he produced a witness statement from Ms Lowry-Lee, a solicitor with his commercial solicitors, detailing the attempts to obtain litigation funding. In that statement, she referred to and relied on opinions from counsel and other documents in respect of which she purported to maintain privilege. I ordered the documents mentioned in that statement to be produced and gave an interim judgment giving my reasons. The opinion from his counsel dated 24 April 2015, updated on 13 March 2016 is indeed favourable. It estimates a 60% chance of success of defeating the claim against him and of winning his counterclaim. It predicts the quantum of the claims to approach or exceed &#163;100 million, and perhaps to be as much as &#163;205 million. It realistically states that enforcing an award of damages significantly in excess of &#163;100 million would be an unknown quantity.

I ruled that I could inspect the documents and having done so I further ruled that they were admissible. I gave two short judgments.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first document is an email from the husband to Dr Smith dated 4 April 2016. It was headed &#8220;without prejudice&#8221; and concerned a cash schedule. That document had been previously produced by the wife, it having been handed to her by the wife of an estranged colleague of the husband, and was in the bundle before me. In his evidence-in-chief the husband told me that the document had been generated in May 2015; that Dr Smith had given him a copy at that time; and that he only had a paper version. However, the email of 4 April 2016 shows that the document in the papers was provided to the husband at that time and that he had had an earlier version with different numbers on it. The email shows the husband commenting in great detail on the figures in the schedule. Towards the end he states, &#8220;in general I think we can get to an agreement on the division as discussed but we need the additional detail to explain the very significant changes from previous schedules, particularly as it relates to the liquidators, all of which I assume as a reasonable explanation&#8221;. In his final sentence he states, &#8220;let me know when you want to discuss this and how we get the additional information to get an agreement in an agreed form&#8221;. When confronted with this the husband did not really have any coherent explanation for its content.</p>

If this is a true document then it shows the husband&#8217;s evidence that he had not seen the loan note before September 2016 to be untrue. When confronted with this the husband asserted that the email had been forged by Dr Smith. The husband did not go so far as to suggest that the attachment was a forgery. This showed that the loan agreement would be between Dr Cochrane and Minardi rather than with Phoenix. There were good reasons why the husband would want to take control of Minardi. That version of the loan note put the debt at &#163;72.5 million &#8211; slightly less than the amount that was ultimately signed up to.</p>

He was well into his negotiations with Dr Smith by 4 April 2016. All the building blocks of the overall deal were in place by 21 April 2016 and the deal had effectively been done by then. The husband was at the very centre of the negotiations. At that point two of the funders had not yet turned him down. It was completely untrue for him to say that he discontinued because he was deprived of litigation funding &#8211; he settled with Dr Smith well before he reached the end of that road.</p>

In a briefing paper supplied to Therium on 19 April 2016 it was stated &#8220;in negotiations, Dr Smith has offered and Mr Ruhan has rejected &#163;35m by way of settlement&#8221;. Why was an agreement not concluded at that time? The husband says that Dr Smith was never negotiating in good faith &#8211; those negotiations were of the nature of a filibuster and he never intended to provide any money to the husband. A different perspective is given by a document which was on the agreed reading list and which I read before the case was opened. It was an exhibit to an affidavit made by Dr Smith on 4 October 2017 in the Phoenix proceedings. It is a letter from Stewarts Law, the solicitors for the Orb parties, not expressed to be &#8216;without prejudice&#8217;, to the husband&#8217;s commercial solicitors dated 4 August 2015. It announced the end of the negotiations, stating:</p>

Leaving aside whether this is commercially acceptable, it is structurally unworkable and possibly illegal. Our clients have sought and received advice that a settlement on such a basis, where a payment  demanded by Mr Ruhan had to go to Mr Stevens which is not commensurate with Mr Stevens&#8217; claims, is potentially criminal.&#8221;</p>

I acceded to Mr Pointer&#8217;s secondary submission that if I were to read this letter I should read those that followed it. These show that the husband&#8217;s commercial solicitors trenchantly denied this characterisation and asserted that the amount payable to Mr Stevens was in discharge of bona fide liabilities of the husband to Mr Stevens. However, Stewarts Law firmly maintained their position, maintaining that the claims by Mr Stevens were either non-existent or de minimis.</p>

I have found above Mr Stevens acted as a nominee for the husband in relation to the payment of the &#163;92 million in November 2012, so it follows that this is in fact not a genuine debt due from the husband to Mr Stevens. But that aside, even at its highest, the figure due as further consideration under the TSA is a mile away from the figure of &#163;73.75 million which simply cannot be justified on any honest basis. And there is absolutely no rational explanation for Dr Smith gifting 50% of Sentrum Rugby to Mr Stevens.

And, of course, nothing was paid, which has led to Phoenix commencing debt proceedings against Dr Cochrane which are being defended strongly on various grounds including illegality and the eventuation of force majeure.

Rather, and this is very clear from the documents filed by Dr Smith in the Phoenix proceedings, it is strongly in his (Dr Smith&#8217;s) interests that &#163;60 million goes to the Serious Fraud Office so that he does not face the prospect of incarceration for another eight years.</p>

Therefore, there was no genuine debt due in April 2016 from the husband to Mr Stevens, not even &#163;3 million. The agreement that was reached may have been na&#239;ve in that it allowed the proceedings to come to an end before a penny had been paid but that na&#239;vet&#233; does not alter my fundamental conclusion. I think that at that stage a degree of trust, surprising though it may seem, had developed between the husband and Dr Smith. An aper&#231;u into the thawing of their mutual hostility is given by two emails between them during the negotiations in April 2016. On 17 April 2016, the husband sent Dr Smith a meme. It was a picture of &#8220;a day in the life as an entrepreneur&#8221; and shows the ups and downs as the day progresses. The nadir is &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going bankrupt&#8221; and the zenith is &#8220;wait a second, my life is great&#8221;. The husband&#8217;s message to Dr Smith was: &#8220;Do you recognise this &#8211; I do&#8221;. On 29 April 2016, the day the documents were signed, Dr Smith sent the husband an email with the subject &#8220;can I buy you a drink?&#8221; I do not have this email, but I do have the husband&#8217;s reply sent at 17:37 which was &#8220;see you downstairs in 20 mins&#8221;.

For the reasons I have explained above I am completely satisfied that Dr Smith did not have a claim against any of those monies, and that the Orb proceedings launched by him were spurious and abusive. Dr Smith had the opportunity to intervene in the proceedings before me to argue that the monies appropriated by him were in fact his, or to be treated as his; but he did not do so and in my opinion it would be an abuse were he (or his cohorts) to be allowed in later proceedings to assert this.</p>

In my judgment, no one has any valid claim against the husband, apart from the wife, to those assets. The other parties may well wish to fight over what is left in Arena &#8211; and I am thinking particularly of the SFO &#8211; but I am clear, having considered the evidence very carefully, that those assets represent the consensual recovery achieved by the husband of his own money following the appropriation by Dr Smith.</p>

Minardi was a party to the settlement of the dispute with the Al-Arrab Construction Company in June 2015, whereby &#163;31m was recovered (see para 71 above). The previous month Minardi lent the husband &#163;2.5m (to help him with his legal costs at a time when settlement discussions in relation to the Orb proceedings were taking place) which in turn had been lent to it by SMA. Mr Justice Popplewell observed that this may well have been in breach of undertakings. When the 2015 negotiations failed Minardi (i.e. Dr Smith) sued the husband on the loan. According to the husband Mr Barton felt sorry for the husband and arranged in November 2015 for the right to pursue two debts owed by Minardi to respectively Mr Barton and Mr Pelz for $181m and $4.6m to be assigned to the husband for him to use as a shield in the &#163;2.5m debt claim. That debt claim was later settled after a sum of &#163;2m owed to the husband by Harry Harvey was somehow set-off against the &#163;2.5m debt. This however left the husband with the right to pursue the Barton and Pelz loans. </p>

A clean break settlement with the husband would clear up issues of costs and would hand over the hornet&#8217;s nest that was Minardi for him to deal with Mr Barton and Mr Pelz. In fact, now that Mr Barton realises that the husband owns Minardi, as well as the right to pursue his debt against it, there is no chance of that debt being pursued, and it has not been. Mr Barton is very annoyed, to say the least.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have referred at para 15 above to the &#163;500,000 &#8220;gift&#8221; from Dr Cochrane to the wife for the maintenance and education of the children.  This is a strange story which I do not believe I need to get to the bottom of for the purposes of my primary decisions. At a meeting attended by the wife&#8217;s then solicitor, Dr Smith, his femme d&#8217;affaires Dawna Stickler, and the Orb solicitor Mr Upson, held on 9 September 2014, Mr Upson stated: &#8220;today is the start of a conversation about how we can help each other&#8221;. Dr Smith went on to say: &#8220;Gail [Cochrane] wants to settle an independent trust for the children to get them through to university education and there are no strings attached and we will do that on terms at your behest&#8221;. Dawna Stickler added: &#8220;that is a genuine family concern from one mum to another. There is a sum Gail has in mind and it is between &#163;400k &#8211; &#163;500k and is not be misinterpreted as anything other than a gesture from one mum to another&#8221;. The wife told me that there was a meeting the following month at the matrimonial home attended by Dr Cochrane and Mr Philbin, a friend who happened to be a solicitor. She went into the dining room alone with Dr Cochrane where the sum was offered. According to Mr Philbin, who was a manifestly honest witness, the wife then returned and stated that she did not want anything to do with it. Nevertheless, on 4 November 2014 the money was sent to Mr Philbin&#8217;s client account by Dr Cochrane and her email of that day stated that it should be released to the wife directly or to a company that she owns beneficially and totally. That same day Mr Philbin replied that he was establishing a trust for the children (this is quite difficult to square with the wife&#8217;s statement that she did not want anything to do with it). Dr Cochrane confirmed later that day that she was content for the &#163;500,000 to be credited to a trust for the children. Bizarrely, a year later Dr Cochrane (that is to say, in real life, Dr Smith) changed her mind and sued Mr Philbin for the money back. He defended the proceedings. They have been concluded although the money remains virtually untouched in an investment held by the trustees. He does not know what to do with it. It is an absurd state of affairs but does shine a light on the modus operandi of Dr Smith. I do not believe that the wife has given me false evidence about this episode but I am doubtful that she has told me the whole truth.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I refer to the BAE arbitration. In this regard, there is no dispute between the parties. If the arbitration succeeds and the contract is reinstated then the husband will have opportunity to buy these sites and to develop them, hopefully for a significant profit. To do so he will need to borrow very large sums, and in this respect Miss Harrison QC is right to say that when seeking credit he certainly will not be presenting himself as actually insolvent, reliant on the largesse of friends.</p>
