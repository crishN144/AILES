The arguments for and against removal have already to some extent been canvassed in the July 2013 judgment, and I adopt the reasoning set out there, without repeating it.  I am satisfied, as I was then, that removal of the children from their home would be &#8216;<span style="font-style:italic">devastating</span>&#8217; to them; on the other hand, leaving them in an emotionally harmful environment (i.e. their current home) could be, for different but potentially equally powerful reasons, contrary to their interests. </p>

It is now apparent there has been a low level of understanding in the wider family about the problems which has existed in M1 and M2&#8217;s relationship, and of M1&#8217;s mental health; there plainly need to be better access to the supports of the family;</p>
