He issued proceedings for the summary return of his two children from this country to Ukraine, and specifically to Kyiv, where he remains.  Although his wife and children left Ukraine at the start of the Russian invasion of their homeland, he was unable to leave the country due to the requirements of the nation&#8217;s martial law, whereby men between 18 and 60 were obliged to remain as part of the resistance to the Russian invasion that began almost exactly a year ago.  </p>

No one disputes but that the father has rights of custody under the Ukrainian Family Code.  The four of them lived in the Kyiv area and had a comfortable life.

The mother learned of the UK&#8217;s &#8220;Homes for Ukraine&#8221; scheme and applied.  Her application was successful and she arrived on these shores with the children on 4 April 2022.  A family in the south of England provided accommodation and the children began to attend a local school, where they have settled well and have made progress. On 22 September, the mother issued divorce proceedings in Ukraine.  On 27 October, the father applied under the Hague Convention 1980 for the summary return of the children to Ukraine.  </p>

At the second hearing on 1 December, the matter was set down for final hearing for yesterday&#8217;s date, 16 March 2023.  The mother opposed return on a number of grounds: habitual residence, acquiescence, Art. 13(b), child objections.  A CAFCASS report was ordered and Ms Baker of the bespoke CAFCASS High Court Team met with the children and elicited their wishes and feelings.  While very naturally being conflicted, they do not wish to return to Ukraine.  Yet they love their father and he is unquestionably a very important part of their life.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.64in">This is how the matter came before me yesterday.  In the meantime, the situation on the ground was evolving.  The father reassessed the changing circumstances following the issuing of proceedings and sought permission yesterday to withdraw his application. He has been living in Kyiv.  He knows very well what is happening around him.  I informed parties that the court would give its outline assessment of the prevailing factual and risk situation.  Further, because of the public interest in the question of the war in Ukraine and possible returns of children to that country, the court would deliver a judgment focussed exclusively on the Art. 13(b) question.  I received no further submissions about the other grounds of resistance (Convention exceptions).  Although the mother abandoned the habitual residence point, disputes remained about whether the father agreed that the children could leave Ukrainian territory permanently.  There is the question of whether, once in the United Kingdom, he acquiesced, and questions surrounding the objections of the children.  There are also issues around refugee status and refoulement.  I make no findings whatsoever about any of them.  </p>

The Art. 13(b) exception has historically presented trial courts with conceptual and implementation problems.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Re</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">IG</span> the Court of Appeal recognised these difficulties and provided guidance.  In particular, Baker LJ set out the structured approach first instance courts were encouraged to adopt.  He reduced the vital principles to a set of ten propositions at [47].  Of especial relevance to this case are the following: </p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.04in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">When the allegations on which the abducting parent relies to establish grave risk are disputed, the court should first establish whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then establish how the child can be protected from the risk.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.04in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">In assessing these matters, the court must be mindful of the limitations involved in the summary nature of the Hague process. It will rarely be appropriate to hear oral evidence of the allegations made under Article 13(b) and so neither the allegations nor their rebuttal are usually tested in cross-examination.</p>

	      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.04in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">That does not mean, however, that no evaluative assessment of the allegations should be undertaken by the court. The court must examine in concrete terms the situation in which the child would be on return. In analysing whether the allegations are of sufficient detail and substance to give rise to the grave risk, the judge will have to consider whether the evidence enables him or her confidently to discount the possibility that they do.</p>

This was a judgment at first instance of Williams J on 21 September 2022.  Q applied for the return of her son E from the UK to Ukraine.  Mother and child arrived from the Ukraine in April 2022 on one of the visa schemes put in place in this country after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  The mother wished for E to return to Ukraine, but this was resisted by R, the father.  Q&#8217;s proposal was to locate the child at Town B in the west of Ukraine.  This is a significant distance from hostilities.  Williams J did not find the Art. 13(b) exception established and ordered summary return.  His reasoning included:</p>

Thus, E's return to that environment would seem not to expose him to any immediate or direct risk of exposure to armed conflict; the risk of exposure would come with a significant escalation in the extent of the war. Town B, it should be noted, is in the far west of the Ukraine: to the north lies Poland; to the south lies Hungary; to the southeast lies Romania; to the west lies Slovakia. Thus, it is in a well-protected part of the country geographically.</span></p>

It seems to me, therefore, that that risk is very low indeed, although cannot be entirely discounted. If that were to happen though, there would be a period of time preceding it which would give warning to those in that part of the country the opportunity to leave, given that the Hungarian border is close by, and the mother is a Hungarian citizen who is entitled to enter that country.</span></p>

However, Town B has, I am told, no military installations, it is not a central transport hub, and that is supported by the absence of any attempt to target it since the invasion began some six months-odd ago. Thus, that risk, it seems to me, is at a low level, although cannot be ruled out, but sufficiently low that the risk of exposure in Town B to any of the consequences of the hostilities are capable of being addressed by the mother taking protective steps.</span></p>

There is no dispute between parties but that the situation in the Ukrainian capital is serious.  Further, the father has accepted that it has &#8220;deteriorated&#8221; more recently.  There is, I judge, plainly a grave risk that the children would be exposed to physical harm if they returned to Kyiv.  Ms Gray mentioned at the end of her oral submissions that there would likely be a risk of psychological harm if returning children to a city where there were regular missile strikes.  I can entirely foresee this to be true when civilian buildings and infrastructures are being targeted by a hostile enemy.  A moment&#8217;s thought at what the living reality of life in Kyiv might look like for the two children indicates that this submission has great force.  However, I indicated that if this basis were being relied upon, or if it was the exclusive basis for resistance, then I would need further evidence.  That, however, was unnecessary as I found that the physical harm element was unquestionably established by the mother on the uniform and consistent evidence.</p>

Next, the court must consider whether the risk can be &#8220;ameliorated&#8221; or sufficiently mitigated to enable the children to return to Kyiv safely.  It should be noted that there is here a fundamental factual distinction between this case and <span style="font-style:italic">Q v R, </span>as Ms Gray correctly points out.  There, Williams J was able to order a return to Ukraine because the location the child would return to was 100 miles away from hostilities.  That case was decided in September 2022.  The situation on the ground is not the same.  As indicated, the father agrees that the situation has &#8220;deteriorated&#8221; in Kyiv; there is &#8220;increased risk&#8221; and that there have been recent attacks &#8220;on civilian targets&#8221;.  Now, he says, there is &#8220;more risk than was previously the case&#8221;.  In his statement, drafted at the beginning of this year, before the spate of missile attacks, he proposed as a protective measure that the children could live with him in the family home in what he said is &#8220;a safe area&#8221; in Kyiv, where there have been &#8220;little [few] military movements&#8221; (B150/&#167;18a.).  He no longer believes this would be sufficiently protective.  Given the overall picture, he is without doubt absolutely correct.  The difficulty of protective measures in this specific case is that the source of the grave risk is entirely independent of the applicant and beyond his control.  He can do nothing to influence the military strategy of Vladimir Putin or the Russian state.  Plainly, Kyiv as capital is an ongoing target with obvious military, strategic and symbolic significance.  The BBC map produced by Ms Gray shows how close areas of Russian control are to the north and east of the capital.  </p>
