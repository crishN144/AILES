O was brought to hospital at the age of 5 months with a fractured skull, three older fractures, and an account of having fallen off a sofa.  Medical opinion is that this would be a highly unlikely explanation for the skull fracture but for the fact that O may have been suffering from Vitamin D deficiency rickets at the time, leading to his bones being more susceptible to fracture.  This issue needs to be resolved so that it is clear why the threshold has been crossed and why the children cannot live with their mother.</span></p>

The mother and Mr H deny that they knowingly caused any injury to O, but say that if injury was inflicted, the other must be responsible.  The father takes a neutral position, as does the Children's Guardian.</span></p>

Unsuccessful attempts were made to insert a line.  The notes refer to a 'difficult' cannulation.  Evidence was given by Dr O about the degree of force that would be involved in holding a baby&#8217;s arm while inserting the needle.   He described it as a gentle pressure on the arm to promote a vein, not involving an angulating force but perhaps some flexion of the wrist. </span></p>

He went red in the face and started going blue.  He was having difficulty in breathing.  Mr H picked him up and took him to the front door for air, held him in one hand while patting him firmly on the back and trying to get mucus out of his mouth with the other.  It was an alarming incident.  Mr H could not say how much force he was using as he was anxious to get the baby breathing again.  An ambulance was called and O was taken to hospital, where he stayed overnight and was discharged the next day.</span></p>

About 80 per cent of the transfer occurs in the third trimester. Following birth, the child becomes entirely dependent on other sources of vitamin D primarily through exposure to sunlight and diet.  O was a child who had difficulty feeding from birth.  Further support for his having had rickets arises from the fact that the mother has recently been diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency during her current pregnancy and, on this occasion, in line with national guidelines, has been prescribed a vitamin D supplement.  Despite the 2010 Guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the mother was not provided with a Vitamin D supplement by when pregnant with O.</span></p>

The local authority therefore invites the court to consider the other evidence, and in particular what it describes as lies and inconsistencies in the evidence of the mother and Mr H.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-size:12pt">This is an exceptional case.  In a child with a normal metabolism the almost inevitable conclusion would be that these fractures, and in particular the broken ribs and wrist, would be likely to be the result of violence or at least of rough handling.  Likewise, it would normally be extremely unlikely that such serious injuries as a skull fracture and a subdural haemorrhage would result from such a low fall.  Taken together, the medical picture would point strongly to inflicted injury.    </span></p>

However, there is no evidence of a propensity for serious violence to children.  On the contrary, the mother&#8217;s physical treatment of both children has never caused any concern.  H has never come to harm.  O was taken to all his many health appointments.  For his part, Mr H has never been criticised for his behaviour towards these or any other children.  </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-size:12pt">As indicated above, the mother is not a witness whose evidence can be relied upon.  She is prone to lie on the spur of the moment.  She is inconsistent.  I have carefully considered whether her lies at the time of O&#8217;s admission cast light on how he came by his injuries.  My conclusion is that they do not.  The mother is capable of lying without a logical reason or a sinister motivation.  She has been sadly damaged by her experiences.  She is isolated and involved in a mutually destructive relationship.  My assessment is that she probably lied about being present on 27 November with hardly any thought for the consequences.  Faced with figures of authority, she told a naive and pointless lie that was designed to support Mr H because he was in difficulty.  I do not know whether he actually asked her to do this: it is equally possible that she was reacting to his need for support.  Whatever the truth of the matter, it does not alter my conclusion that the mother&#8217;s lies do not illuminate anything beyond her own difficulties. </span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-size:12pt">In contrast to the mother, Mr H's account of what happened on 27 November has been consistent.  Like her, he is not someone whose word can be taken at face value.  He has a streak of self-pity and consistently minimised his responsibility for his behaviour, both criminal and domestic.  He has not shown any sign of shame at his own account of having recklessly left a small baby in a dangerous position that led to a grave injury.  However, having listened to his evidence about the events of that day, I did not find any solid reason to disbelieve it.  In so far as any weight can be placed on his demeanour as a witness, Mr H appeared to be a man with a bad record who was scared of being convicted of something that he did not do, rather than a guilty man attempting to cover his tracks.  There were moments in his evidence that rang true.  Asked</span><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt"> why he agreed to do some hoovering, he indignantly said that he was not lazy.  Asked whether the injury happened as a result of him dropping O, he immediately replied </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt">&#8220;I'd have said if I dropped him."  </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt">Asked a question based on the premise that we do not know what happened to O, he shot back: </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt">&#8220;I do know what happened &#8211; he rolled off the sofa." </span><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt"> It is not the words themselves, but the manner in which they were said that made an impression.</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:12pt">I am also confident that the mother and Mr H are not colluding to conceal occasions when they know injuries were inflicted.  They are quite capable of forming a plan of that kind but they are not capable of sticking to it.  Their relationship is so volatile and chaotic that one of them would be bound to try to spill the beans on the other at some low point, particularly as they have been facing not only these proceedings but also possible criminal charges.  In short, it would be beyond them to maintain an effective lie.</span></p>

I cannot exclude the possibility that they were caused by violent or rough handling, but I do not think it probable.  Given O&#8217;s particular vulnerability and very young age I consider it more likely, indeed probable, that these injuries were caused in another way.  They may have been sustained on one of the occasions suggested by the mother and Mr H, or on a similar unrecorded occasion.  To take an example, it is entirely possible that some or all of these fractures occurred when H fell on top of O.  It is also entirely possible that the rib fractures were caused by Mr H in the stress at the moment when he was trying to prevent O from choking.  All these were occasions when O was in real distress.  Given his likely bone condition, injuries may have occurred without carers realising. </span></p>

It was thoroughly foolhardy of Mr H to have left O in an unsafe position.  The mother's wilful lies have complicated matters and made it more difficult for the doctors and the lawyers to get to the truth.  However, in the end this is a case where the person who was present is probably telling the truth about what happened, while the one who has lied was not there at all.</span></p>
