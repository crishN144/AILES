The mother, US, has applied for summary return of the children and has sought protective orders in relation to a younger child, MS, who was born on 27 September 2013.  MS, I should say, remains in her mother&#8217;s care in the UK at an address which is not to be disclosed to any party without leave of the court.</span></p>

His Honour Judge Heaton also recorded and confirmed in his order that consideration, including but not restricted to any representation by the father as to whether, in the light of matters relating to jurisdiction to the welfare interests of MA and ME, the order of Sir Peter Singer dated 5 September 2014 requiring the return of the said children to England should remain in force and be complied with if necessary.</span></p>

It appeared, following the father&#8217;s arrest on 14 October 2014, that whilst the diplomatic protection the father enjoys is in effect full immunity from the criminal jurisdiction and in the civil and administrative jurisdiction, it was limited to acts performed </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-size:14pt">only</span><span style="font-size:14pt"> within the course of his duties.

Mr. Setright and Miss Chaudhry, in their helpful position statement filed for today, set out the history of the father&#8217;s non-compliance and non-attendance at this court.  Mr. Justice Moore considered the matter on 14 October and ordered that the father file a statement by 17 October.  The matter was relisted for 20 October.  The father was ordered to attend and the father was served with the order of Mr.  Justice Moore on 15 October.  The father did not attend the hearing before His Honour Judge Heaton QC on that day.  The matter was then relisted for further consideration today.  The father has been ordered to attend today and again has been personally served with the order of His Honour Judge Heaton.</span></p>

That is the entire extent to which the father has involved himself in the process.  I should say that when I refer to his &#8216;statement&#8217;, it is a document that does not appear to have been drafted by a lawyer and is not in the correct format for the proceedings.</span></p>

Either that I make directions for the mother to file a response to the father&#8217;s vastly differing account of events in the statement to which I have referred.  Secondly, that the orders should stand with liberty to the father to apply or, thirdly, that I should hear oral evidence from the mother to establish an account of events in order to bring a conclusion to these proceedings. The third option seemed to me to fit most logically with the children&#8217;s timescales and the general philosophy of this jurisdiction.</span></p>
