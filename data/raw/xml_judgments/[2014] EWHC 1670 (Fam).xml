At a hearing on 15 April I granted that application and the local authority&#8217;s application for a reporting restrictions order (&#8216;RRO&#8217;).

They had not met the mother and, given she had been assessed in February 2014 by her treating consultant psychologist as lacking the capacity to litigate, they could not act without the benefit of a litigation friend. There was no representative from the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office present at court. The local authority&#8217;s solicitor kindly made contact with the Official Solicitor&#8217;s office. In consequence, Ms Clift attended the hearing at very short notice. I am very grateful to her for doing so. </p>

That is no adverse reflection on them; it is a result of the real potential for a conflict of interest to arise. In those circumstances and in the absence of any other suitable candidate, the Official Solicitor consented to act as LW&#8217;s litigation friend and was so appointed. </p>

She further reported that the mother&#8217;s &#8216;mental health deteriorated gradually during the pregnancy&#8217; and that given she was pregnant her prescribed medication had had to be reduced to a relatively low level. </p>

A further complicating factor was that the foetus was in the breech position and unless it could be turned by the elective cervical inversion (&#8216;ECV&#8217;), it was most likely the baby would have to be delivered by caesarean section (&#8216;CS&#8217;). </p>
