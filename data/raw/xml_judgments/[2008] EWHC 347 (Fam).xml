For the reasons I then gave I decided that W should pay H &#163;670,000 on a clean break basis, and that he should pay each of their two children periodical payments of &#163;7,500 p.a. (subject to index-linking). This now is my judgment in relation to the costs of those applications, which each sought against the other. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">W's position until part-way through the hearing had been that she did not seek payment of the award which she argued I should on the figures make against him, but that she should pay H nothing. By the end of the main hearing W had accepted the premise which underlay H's case: that there should be a capital adjustment in his favour to achieve equality. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But they remained apart on the assets to which that should be applied and their value. W contended that the value of her inheritance from her father (which had been received after the parties' final separation but while they remained intertwined in property transactions here and in Italy) should be disregarded. Until a late stage her case was that her inheritance (with a value of about &#163;1.55M) should be entirely excluded. By the time of final submissions she accepted that equalisation should take into account a part but not all of the assets derived from her inheritance. I found against W on that major issue. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H's open case had throughout been put on the basis that equalisation of their capital situation should be applied across the board. For this purpose he was prepared to have taken fully into account the value of the assets which he brought into the marriage and to the acquisition of which W that therefore never contributed; and his pension fund CETV of &#163;197,416 notwithstanding its illiquidity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H's final quantification at trial of what he claimed should be the right equalising amount was about &#163;950,000. But in addition he launched and sustained a major attack on W's credit, asserting that she had both dissipated and concealed funds, and that the award in his favour should also reflect W's litigation conduct. This assault failed. I found that W had indeed, as she admitted, for a period some six months until May 2005 sought to conceal her ownership of one of the inherited properties in Italy by deliberate and false statements, her motive being 'to protect part of my inheritance'. Since then, as I found, she had done her best to deal with massive requests for information and documentation which resulted in about three ring binders prepared for the hearing. I set out my findings on this substantial part of H's case at [66] to [70] of the judgment. There was thus not even the 'slight shading' in H's favour to which by final submissions this barrage of claims and criticisms had reduced from earlier suggestions that a further &#163;700,000 to &#163;1M should be added to H's award to compensate him. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In arriving at the capital award I had regard to the very considerable disparity in the costs each had run up in the course of the litigation to that date (&#163;265,000 on W's side, and &#163;486,000 on H's) and decided to adjust the assets subject to division by, in effect, writing back &#163;225,000 of' H's costs. I gave my reasons at [24] of the judgment which is in these terms: </p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-size:11pt">According to information I was given during the course of the hearing W had paid her solicitors all but &#163;2,500 of the full amount of her costs then estimated at just under &#163;265,000. Of H's total costs estimated at &#163;486,000 he still owed &#163;65,000. He suggests that the appropriate course would be to deduct that balance from his side of the assets Schedule. While that might in some cases be acceptable, the &#163;221,000 disparity between the costs each has incurred is so marked that the preferable course seems to me to be to 'equalise' costs for the purpose of the Schedule by treating each as having depleted their assets by the amount of W's costs, &#163;265,000, before the award is made.  This involves ignoring his unpaid liability and adding back on his side &#163;160,000. That is intended as an entirely neutral adjustment and is subject to the submissions I will no doubt hear about costs. At this stage I can only attempt to mitigate the distorting effect on my award of the unequal costs burden, as the reasons for this very large difference between the liabilities incurred on each side have not been fully explored. </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The case had been bedevilled at various stages of its development by controversy over the taxable status of each party for CGT purposes. At one stage it appeared that W might have no liability on English property sales because of her residence in Italy: at another that H might have none because of time he spent abroad. By the time of the hearing on the available (and extensive and expensive) accountancy evidence amassed by each side it seemed that both would carry liability for CGT, and that is reflected conventionally (albeit subject to the serious reservations which I expressed) in my overall net worth assessment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These anxieties were rehearsed again at the two days of hearing which took place post-judgment, on 3rd May 2007 (when submissions were not concluded), and (after another hearing date had to be abandoned because of a preceding overrunning case) on 10th July 2007. I then reserved this judgment, but before I could conclude it fresh developments were brought to my attention at the beginning of October. It seems that at the beginning of September 2007 W informed H by email of her intention that their daughters should leave their London school and that she and they would vacate their London home at 22 S St and move to Italy. It would seem she had put these decisions into effect by the date of her email. H's solicitors protested on his behalf. His counsel by email invited me to revise the capital award in the light of H's belief that W would thus escape any CGT liability on the two English properties in her name which remain unsold. He awaited tax advice. At the beginning of November I was sent an Italian tax lawyer's advice to the effect that she has no liability to Italian tax in relation to any of the relevant property sales, past or prospective, and that the position is the same whether she is treated as resident or non-resident in Italy. Assuming that to be correct, therefore, her move to Italy did not give rise to any liability to Italian tax which would affect her net worth or the calculation of it which I made. I have no information whether, when and to what extent her potential liabilities to UK capital gains tax would alter the propositions applied in the judgment. </p>

In December H's solicitors informed me of his decision not to apply to reopen the judgment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I recount these matters to illustrate the continuing complexities of this case.

They may affect the manner whereby W will meet her liabilities to H and the form of the order to provide for that, which I will have to decide if the parties cannot reach agreement. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Cayford, leading counsel for H, contended strongly at the May and July hearings that I had led myself into error in discounting &#163;225,000 of the costs his client had expended, so as to achieve parity of costs expenditure in the manner described in [24] of the judgment. Put at its simplest, he points out that if I had made full allowance for H's total costs of &#163;486,000 his side of the assets schedule would have been &#163;225,000 lighter, and that a further &#163;112,500 would have been payable by W to achieve parity. Thus, he says the award should have been &#163;782,500 rather than &#163;670,000. A similar result would have been achieved if I had written back nothing in relation to costs, and had allowed unpaid costs on each side (&#163;65,000 on H's, and about &#163;2,500 on W's) to be deducted from the assets before division. Taking off all the costs was, he points out, the approach adopted by both sides when drawing the assets schedules prolifically produced as the case progressed, both during its gestation and throughout and after the final hearing. </p>

A number of arguments were advanced for why this might be, such as the higher charging rate of the solicitor dealing with his case. Beyond that, says Mr Cayford, it is speculation arrived at without analysis, and one which bears unfairly on H. Well I have listened to what has been said, and I have looked again at the scale of the disparity, and I have come to the conclusion after hearing the costs debate that I was right in the main judgment to suspect 'that for some years he has regarded this litigation as his principal activity', and indeed that his approach to it has verged on the obsessional. He directed huge analysis to the bewildering detail of which party (on his case, W) and which party's properties (on his case, those in W's name) benefited more from monies released from the sale or refinancing of the other's. This was unfathomable, and should have been seen to be so from an early stage, given not least that the attempt at such a tracing exercise itself engendered myriad issues as to the accuracy of their assertions, and that there for the most part was no documentary or other satisfactory evidence to establish these issues one way or the other. The considerations advanced (whether in isolation or in combination) do not explain the disparity, that his total costs to the end of the main hearing are almost double hers. The ratio is 97:53. </p>

Between the June and November 2005 letters W had moved back to live in London so that her continuing immunity from CGT was in doubt. The December offer was made after leading counsel were instructed on both sides, and arrived but a day or two before what was then envisaged as the final hearing before a district judge at the principal registry. That hearing was adjourned because the time estimate (4 days) was manifestly inadequate, and because of the complexity of the issues which were essentially the same as those fought when the case came before me. It matters not whether the adjournment decision emanated from suggestions made by Mr Scott or from the district judge herself: it was clearly correct. The case called for the decision to be by a judge of the Division, and four days was an unrealistic estimate to include (as it should have done) judicial reading time and judgment preparation. The effect however was to delay the hearing for a year. </p>

On that basis W's offer fell significantly short of 50 per cent of what I have found should be included in the pot. I take that view even though the June 2005 FDR schedules assumed W would bear no liability for CGT (which was probably correct), but that H at that time was potentially liable (which was probably incorrect)! If H's potential CGT liability is taken out of the schedule (and, for parity of calculation, liabilities and the pension fund included) the percentage result of W's offer increases to about 56 per cent to her and 44 per cent to H. </p>

If H had accepted her offer shortly after the abortive hearing he would on the valuations have achieved, a year and a year's costs earlier, a slightly better result in valuation terms than at the final hearing. But that ignores what emerged only a few months later, that the Italian property achieved on sale &#163;105,000 to &#163;110,000 less than the Savills valuation of the Italian property W offered and upon which that calculation is made. I do not believe I can ignore that within so short a time the true value of W's offer would have emerged as in the region of only &#163;570,000 to &#163;585,000, significantly below my award. </p>

The reality is that both parties by then if not earlier knew or suspected that an offer at or near the &#8364;1,150,000 valuation was highly unlikely to materialise, and: so H would not in any circumstances regard it as in fact worth the valuation figure: nevertheless (as W's letter observed) that was the valuation to which he held for the purposes of computing W's wealth at that time. In fact it was by a letter dated 5th April 2006 that her solicitors first indicated in correspondence her intention to sell that property for only &#8364;900,000 to &#8364;950,000, &#8364;250,000 to &#8364;200,000 less than the valuation upon which the parties were working when she made her March offer. In correspondence H alleged (but did not establish) that W deliberately sold the property at an undervalue, or that the true (higher) consideration was concealed. The obvious alternative suspicion, supported by the history of long attempts to sell at or near the higher valuation set by the ultimately agreed joint valuer Savills, was that when W offered to transfer the property she and H both knew it was unlikely to be worth as much as that valuation. This letter cannot affect the attribution of costs. </p>

During the following year his costs almost doubled, increasing by &#163;240,000, and thus by more than twice the &#163;109,000 increase in W's.

Clearly the bulk of the &#163;240,000 he incurred from the date of the aborted hearing in December 2005 would have been in the last nine rather than the first three months of that period. The only clue I have bears that out: there was a pre-trial review on 19th October 2006 when H's costs were put at &#163;348,711: a &#163;109,000 increase since December 2005, with a colossal further &#163;137,000 yet to come to the end of the main hearing just one month later. </p>

I have now determined that H's costs were in fact excessive, and particularly so during the last nine months to the hearing. H should therefore not by my costs award recoup more than it is reasonable for W to pay in respect of that period including the final hearing over which the Calderbank correspondence affects what would have been my conclusion (based on the way the case proceeded openly) that each side should bear their own costs. </p>

Perhaps that was because they took the view that neither party could achieve much mileage over the other. Whether or not that is a fair assumption, I agree with that conclusion. </p>

The case proceeded before me on that basis, and each party affirmed their acceptance of that sum. At [72] of the main judgment I fixed on the figure of &#163;7,500 per child. I was wrong to do so. My jurisdiction to make any order at that time arose solely because the parents consented. H had never consented to pay more than &#163;6,000 index-linked. That will be the amount of the order, and it would be quite wrong of me to adjust the capital award to reflect the fact that, left to myself, I would have made a higher order. Nor would it be right now to adjust the capital order or to make some other provision to reflect the higher figure because the children are now resident abroad and the Child Support r&#233;gime no longer inhibits the court's jurisdiction. </p>

They will also have to consider where the costs of the costs application should fall, as to which for all I know there may be further Calderbank correspondence. To cover the eventuality that agreement cannot be reached a further hearing date before me should now be fixed, although I very much hope that the parties will not need to incur further costs in resolving these outstanding issues.</p>
