Litigation is so often corrosive of trust and scars those who may need to collaborate and co-operate in future to parent children. Furthermore, family resources should not be expended to the betterment of lawyers, however able they are, when, with a proper appreciation of its benefits, the parties&#8217; disputes can and should be resolved via non-court dispute resolution. Going forward, parties to financial remedy and private law children proceedings can expect &#8211; at each stage of the proceedings &#8211; the court to keep under active review whether non-court dispute resolution is suitable in order to resolve the proceedings. Where this can be done safely, the court is very likely to think this process appropriate especially where the parties and their legal representatives have not engaged meaningfully in any form of non-court dispute resolution before issuing proceedings.</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> [para 16]</span></p>

Both counsel agree with the Court that the wording of the order leaves something to be desired but this is a detail that can easily have been rectified without an appeal being issued. The appellants mother&#8217;s issue is with the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of the order. She is of the view that C should live with her and have contact with his father at defined times. Since the parents separated, 19 months before the order was made, C has lived with his mother; there has been in place (at the instigation of the mother) contact arrangements with the father along the following lines which is accepted is accurately recorded in the magistrate&#8217;s reasons was:</span></p>

It is clear from all the evidence that the parents are unable to put their antipathy for each other aside for the sake or parenting C; this is very sad. It is the duty of parents to exercise their parental responsibility in a manner that serves the welfare of their child. I feel very sorry for C; if the parents continue the way they are doing, he will grow up in the middle of a toxic environment. This will cause him emotional harm and lead to all manner of developmental issues in the future. Meanwhile his parents will lose out. Instead of being able to enjoy all the benefits that co-parenting can bring, they will be trapped in a cycle of acrimony resulting in parenting becoming increasingly traumatic as C grows older. I intend to do all that I can to break this cycle in the way that have indicated I will treat the parents claims for costs arising from this appeal, the aggregate sum of which is around </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#163;20,000.</span></p>

The order directs that the child shall spend time with his mother on alternate Saturdays, a day on which she works and is therefore unable to spend time with the child. As the order stands the child only spends 2 days per month at weekend (sic) with his mother, by way  of contrast the child spends 4 weekend days with his father. The mother seeks a variation to the order so that the child is returned to her each Sunday morning at 1000am to allow the child and her to attend Mass.

The parent who dispute with one another or with the local authority over their children&#8217;s future do generally love their children dearly and want the nest for them as they see it. Although the proceedings are adversarial in form, they have many inquisitorial features. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">[22]</span></p>

The automatic  availability of non &#8211; means- tested and non- merits &#8211; tested public funding for parents at first instance in care proceedings has masked the issue. It has only surfaced on appeal. As here, or for interveners, where public funding is means-tested. But the question of whether it is just to make an order for costs should as matter of principle be determined irrespective of whether any of the parties arse publicly funded.  </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">[25]</span></p>

They lead to the conclusion that costs orders should only be made in unusual circumstances. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In essence, there are two stages when making an order for costs in circumstances such as the present case 1) has a party&#8217;s conduct been reprehensible, another which is exclusive 2) has a party&#8217;s stance been beyond the band of what is reasonable? So, at this point, I go back to my judgment in the appeal. In my judgment I was very clear that the decision of the Magistrates was unassailable It was a decision that they were entitled to make; they took great care in making and it fell well short of a decision which was appealable. I recorded the fact the decision was not truly on all fours with what the father wanted but he decided to live with it and to do his best to make it work. The mother on the other hand, took issue with details of the order and formulated her appeal on two grounds, neither of which had merit and both of which supported a reasonably held belief that the mother simply did not like the order. In my judgment bringing the appeal and taking the stance that she did was unreasonable: it continued the litigation, it continued the uncertainly for the child, it created a long period of time during which it would have been very difficult for the parents to co-parent. For those reasons I am satisfied that this is a situation which gives rise to the court having the option of making an order for costs in respect of the appeal against the mother. </span></p>

In my earlier judgment I deliberately and carefully went to great lengths to try to help the parents break the cycle of resorting to the court and to assist them in the parenting of their child. I explained in my judgment my reasons for doing so. I also explained the law and the current legal thinking by referring to recent cases supporting my enthusiasm for helping the parties to mediate and I warned the parents that I would decide the question of costs and that their demonstrated input into furthering negotiation would go some way to informing my decision. </span></p>

Father has filed a statement dated 30.09.24 which supports a finding that virtually immediately following the handing down of judgment in writing he instructed his solicitors to assist him to find mediator. On 14</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> June the father&#8217;s solicitors proposed 2 mediators.

I am informed that this session remains in the diary, and I hope the parents attend it. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The father&#8217;s concern is that he says when discussing matters with mother it was referenced that all sessions would have to work around her work schedule when arranging mediation which means once every 6 weeks, I am satisfied those discussions took place. The father&#8217;s solicitors wrote to the mother&#8217;s solicitors on 13</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> September expressing concern but again took a sensible approach by saying a better way would be to book 4 or 5 sessions. Block booking is a common practice of mediation as it avoids delays, I pause to say that treating mediation as a session by session process is not always the best way forward, mediation often takes 2 /3 meetings, agreeing to pay for them is normal practice. If it works in the first meeting then its worked, it may have taken 3 or 4 but its worked, so I entirely endorse the father&#8217;s approach to try and secure a sustainable process, however, the mother&#8217;s solicitors confirmed that it was not possible. The father says he has done all he can to make mediation work.  </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I turn to the mother&#8217;s statement dated 30.09.24, she says she initially agreed Maura McKibbin but learned on the day of the first session that the likely total fees would be in the region of &#163;2500 and this was not something that she could afford. The obvious question is why the mother, or her solicitors, did not make any enquires before agreeing that as an acceptable choice? The mother says that she immediately then contacted Tracey Winstanley, there were some difficulties arranging a first meeting and one was eventually arranged for 21.10.24. The mother expands in her statement, giving reasons why she could not engage before then: she had a new job</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#FF0000"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">in education and she was on a probation period; it was a job for which she had studied. At paragraph 9 of her statement, she says that Tracey Winstanley said that she could offer zoom sessions after the session on 21</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman'">st</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> October and matters can move more swiftly, that would suggest that things were moving swiftly anyway which it is clear they were not. The mother explains in paragraph 11 why she could not agree to block booking, then she goes on to explain new difficulties the child has had which she says at paragraph 15, mediation is vital to work on matters as indicated by myself and for educational purposes and medical treatment. I cannot agree more, and it is unfortunate that it has taken 6 months for any real progress in that endeavour.</span></p>

Mr Smith, on behalf of the mother, confirmed that it was not a formal application to the court and confirmed his understanding accords with mine that it was not the intention to adjourn until mediation has concluded, it is a fluid process and parents often return to it once they have established ways of communicating with each other and agreeing matters.</span></p>
