The second part of the application goes well beyond administrative convenience and affects the rights, obligations and financial position of many individuals. It is not sufficient to exhibit a list of &#8216;Court of Protection involvements&#8217; to the application as a substitute for naming and notifying or serving those directly affected by it. In the first place, the rules provide for notification or service unless dispensed with by order. Secondly, the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> provides that a decision-maker must, so far as reasonably practicable, permit and encourage the relevant person to participate as fully as possible in decisions affecting them. Thirdly, the decision-maker must have regard for their wishes and feelings and any other factors they would be likely to consider. Fourthly, the rules of natural justice require that people are informed of applications and proposed decisions that affect them. Fifthly, each incapacitated person is an individual with their own interests and financial circumstances. It is not be assumed that what is in the best interests of people generally, or has a general benefit in terms of cost or administrative simplicity, is in the best interests of any particular individual. Sixthly, the approach is difficult to reconcile with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</span></p>

The person affected, and anyone else notified, may then object if they wish.

The effect of that would be that each affected individual is suddenly liable to pay an additional deputy fee for each year the deputyship has been in force &#8212; the additional annual fee being the difference between that permitted by order actually in force at the time and the order now deemed to have been in force. Or, lastly, was the deputy asking the court in an indirect way to relieve it from any liability it has or may have incurred in the past on account of charging fees in excess of those permitted by the orders in force at the time, i.e. an application similar to that made in unauthorised gifting cases?</span></p>

Furthermore, as will be seen, the practice direction leaves the issue of whether to extend its provisions to not-for-profit organisations at the court&#8217;s discretion. The best a non-solicitor deputy can hope for is that, when making a deputy order, the court will exercise its discretion to allow a non-solicitor deputy fixed costs at the solicitor rate.</span></p>

In other words, the court&#8217;s order may at its discretion provide that a not-for-profit organisation deputy or &#8216;other professional&#8217; shall be entitled to fixed costs at the solicitor or local authority rate. To my mind, it is impossible to read that paragraph as saying that not-for-profit organisations are &#8216;entitled&#8217; to fixed-costs at the solicitor rate or are to be treated as if they were solicitors.</span></p>

In general I would group accountants just below solicitors on the basis they are professionally qualified and carrying out a professional function in a similar manner to solicitors, albeit they are not legally qualified. In practice I find accountants tend to charge lower rates than solicitors and they also engage a range of junior staff to carry out routine tasks at much lower rates than Grade D fee earners in a solicitors firm. It is not unusual to see juniors in an accountants firm charging at perhaps &#163;30 to &#163;70 per hour, whereas the lowest guideline rate for a Grade D fee earner is &#163;111 per hour.</span></p>

We see very few bills from such organisations, possibly because they have been tied to fixed costs and the court has been reluctant to make orders for detailed assessment. Because of the scarcity of such bills there is insufficient evidence to specify an average rate and each case has to be decided on its individual merits, taking into account the status of the fee earner (including any legal or other relevant qualifications), location of the work and other factors such as the size of the estate and overheads, which are likely to be much less than a solicitor.</span></p>

One was X, who was an ex-receivership officer at W Council. X&#8217;s charging rate started out at &#163;52 per hour and ended up at &#163;88 per hour before he retired a few years ago, when his work was taken over by [a firm of solicitors] at much greater cost. Another was Y, an organisation promoting empowerment of disabled people in Essex. I cannot now recall their specific charging rate but I am sure it was significantly lower than a solicitor&#8217;s rate and I think about &#163;100 per hour.</span></p>

I do not see any problem however allowing them to elect for detailed assessment in appropriate cases, on the basis it would then be left to the Costs Officer to make a judgment as to the appropriate rate.</span></p>

I suppose it may be possible to fix a rate by comparing industry standard rates for other relevant groups such as independent social workers, will writers, licensed conveyancers, etc. I think in any event any rate should be fixed significantly lower than the guideline rates for solicitors, which start at &#163;111 per hour &#8230;.</span></p>

Solicitors are routinely entitled to higher fixed costs than public authorities. This is because they commonly manage higher value or more complicated estates, have greater legal expertise and higher professional and staff costs than local authority deputy departments. Since 1948 the nature of a local authority&#8217;s statutory duties has meant that historically they are deputised to manage lower-value estates which local solicitors would be unwilling to manage for economic reasons.</span></p>

However, it was the court which advised The Friendly Trust to make the application in this way and the application was up-and-running by the time it reached me. The trust is now in an awkward legal and financial position and it is in the best interests of its deputy clients to see if something can be salvaged which avoids the need for an entirely new set of legal proceedings.
