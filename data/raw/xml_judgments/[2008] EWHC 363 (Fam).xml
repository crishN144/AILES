The mother&#8217;s proceedings under the Children Act were the first in time but they, and the father&#8217;s Children Act proceedings, are stayed by reason of the Hague Convention proceedings. </p>

These issues relate to what was agreed between the parties and acquiescence.  A defence was raised under Article 13(b) but correctly this has not been pursued.  I will of course return to these issues and others relating to the Hague Convention proceedings in more detail later.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This hearing was set by the Court of Appeal who clearly envisaged that I would hear evidence on all matters relating to the Hague Convention, the inherent jurisdiction and the Children Act proceedings, and thus hold a full hearing on welfare.  The Court of Appeal did not address the issue as to what I should do if I concluded (a) that I was bound to order the summary return of E to Mexico, or (b) that as a matter of discretion I should do so.  Such decisions would have the result that apart from interim issues, decisions as to E&#8217;s welfare should be taken by the Mexican courts.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I raised this with the parties at an early stage and it was common ground that, as envisaged by the Court of Appeal, I should hear all the evidence.  This took considerably longer than the time estimate given by the Court of Appeal and it is fair to say that I heard a great deal of evidence during which &#8220;many stones were turned more than once&#8221;.  This sadly put both parents through a very emotional and unenviable experience, but one flowing from their inability to agree on the way ahead.</p>

The mother was born in England on 25 August 1969.  Her family moved to Canada in 1971 and in 1974, after the death of her mother, she and her family moved in Canada to Quebec.  As a teenager she went to a convent school in England to do her A levels and still has some friends in England from those schooldays.  She did her first degree in Canada and in 1994 she started a masters in curatorial studies at B College, New York State.</p>

In 1986 he started "community service" in Mexico, which as I understand it is a substitute for Belgium national service in the forces.  He had by this time qualified as an architect. After his arrival in Mexico the father began to concentrate on work as an artist.  It is now common ground that he is an artist who enjoys a high reputation worldwide. His reputation has been developed over a number of years.</p>

For this purpose I have prepared a schedule based on a chronology prepared by those representing the mother with some additions, omissions and alterations.  It starts in 1999 and in my view provides a helpful framework for the consideration of the evidence.  It is Schedule A to this judgment.</p>

In general I prefer the father's account of this.  In my judgment they did not go to London in November 1999 with a view to making it their home, rather (a) the purchase of the flat in the residential area of Mexico City, (b) the fact that the father had lived and worked in Mexico for a number of years and (c) the fact that the mother had no professional or other reasons for being in London at that time are all clear and compelling pointers in favour of the conclusion, which I reach, that the common understanding was that that they would be starting their married life in Mexico City.   In my judgment for separate reasons they were both unhappy in London.  The mother&#8217;s unhappiness was not with London as a place but flowed in large measure from her views as to the medical treatment she was receiving during her pregnancy.  As the mother accepts the father&#8217;s unhappiness was because he did not like London and found that living here had an adverse effect on his work.  I accept his evidence that they came to London so that the mother could benefit from medical care here.  In my view, but for the mother&#8217;s unhappiness relating to her pregnancy and care, the father would have stuck out the stay in London on the basis that after E&#8217;s birth they would all be returning to the new flat in Mexico City, where they would, live.  They in fact returned before all the work on that flat was completed.</p>

Indeed in my view it would have been self centred of the mother if she had held a different view because the father was established in Mexico (although not then with a wide international reputation or large earnings) and she had no need, other than a preference as to where she would prefer to live, to be elsewhere.</p>

As to this in my view they are both giving me an account with the benefit of the history since then.  This includes the fact that after, or at the time that, the three year agreement or understanding was reached the family returned to Mexico as the father wanted and therefore under it they both accepted that he had had the first choice.  In my view that has coloured both their recollections of what should happen after the second choice.</p>

In my view this was part of the discussion leading to the three year agreement or understanding and its implementation.  In my view that agreement or understanding was made or finalised on the first choice being made.  That choice also made sense from the perspective of the mother&#8217;s work because her teaching post was at an end and she had no immediate substitute post, or plan to further her career.  In contrast, the father was working and developing his base in Mexico.  </p>

This created its pressures in a number of ways including the time he spent in Mexico City and it seems to me that, although the mother did not begrudge him his success, it was happening at a time when she was not developing her own career and this did not help.  She also I accept at times felt lonely and unfulfilled in the country house and village.  She was not in the work and social arenas she would have liked, or in a country she liked.  However in my view the arrangements that came into existence namely that she and E would be at the country home with the nanny during the first three or four days of the week, and the father would come out there at the end of the week and the family would spend the week ends together often in Mexico City could not fairly be regarded as a breach of the agreement or understanding reached on their return to Mexico.  It was a natural result of the father&#8217;s success and work load.  However I accept that from time to time the mother was upset by it.</p>

For example he was not saying that now we are again living apart the agreement does not survive.

The father was understandably concerned about this, as was the mother.  However the mother was expressing a wish for a move by the end of the year in this knowledge.  So far as I am aware no suggestion was made that she was suggesting, or thought, that the move should take place as soon as possible as a way of addressing the problems relating to E settling, and it is not easy to see why it would.</p>

The mother and L deny that this conversation took place.  I prefer the evidence of YS.  So in my judgment in July YS was present when the mother had a telephone conversation in English and, after it was over, YS heard what the mother told her friend L in Spanish about it and is doing her best to give me an accurate account of what was said.  In her written and oral evidence she recounted that the mother told L that the conversation in English had been with a lawyer dealing with her divorce paper work, that she wanted E to be with her and that she should have complete custody so that the father could  not see him or have anything to do with him.  In my view that recollection of YS is probably not completely accurate.  As to that, I agree with the mother and L that YS is not well educated, or particularly bright, and probably does not have a very good memory.  I also suspect that she would tend to exaggerate or dramatise such a conversation when remembering and recounting it.  But I reject the evidence of the mother and L that such a conversation could not have been, and was not, overheard by YS because no such conversation took place after the mother had been talking on the telephone in English, or at all.  In my judgment such a conversation did take place following a telephone conversation in English and its subject matter was that in that telephone conversation the mother had been talking about divorce and custody and the mother was making it clear that she wanted full custody so that she was in control of E&#8217;s upbringing.</p>

Mr L and his wife helped in discussing schools and housing in respect of the move to London which he understood to be temporary and in accordance with the three year agreement or understanding, which he thought was fair.  The tenor of his evidence was however that he understood that the father had a close connection with Mexico and would be returning there.  It is fair to say that he would in the main have got his understanding from the father rather than the mother, but he also observed the shared care arrangements because, as he described, he had to plan his work meetings with the father around them. </p>

Indeed some of her contemporaries on the course are working and based abroad and they come to England for the seminars.  However, most if not all of these are based in Europe and I accept that travel on a regular basis from Mexico would be burdensome.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It runs directly contrary to a funding application that the mother made to a Mexican organisation in which she states she will be travelling to London for the first year, then staying on in London for the next two years and then returning to Mexico after three years.  She also links her thesis closely to Mexico.  The mother says that this did not reflect her true intention at the time, particularly as to returning to Mexico but also, and in any event, as to the length of her time in London.  She did not accept the funding offered which was not large and its terms required a return to Mexico.  She seeks to explain the differences between what she says in this application, and what she says she told the father and he agreed to, by asserting that she told the funding organisation what they wanted to hear.  I do not accept that.  In my view what she told the funding organisation accorded generally with what she was telling, and the impression she was giving to, others including the father at the time.  Namely that her thesis had a link with Mexico and that she would be away for two to three years.  It also accords with what she did in early 2006, when she visited London and in mid 2006 when she came to London.</p>

I therefore accept (as I understood her to assert) and in any event find that when she applied for the PhD course in her mind there was both a possibility that she would be away for longer doing her PhD, and that she may never return to Mexico to live, and this is reflected in her refusal of the offered funding.  But I do not think that at this stage the mother had formed any final plans or reached firm intentions.  So, for example, I do not accept that at this stage she had completely ruled out a return to Mexico after three years.  In that context I do not accept that she had ruled out her further active participation in the course she had started up particularly if it was incorporated into, or made, a course run by the University.  </p>

This was evidence he volunteered in the course of his oral evidence that had a real ring of truth to it.  But he did not put a time on this exchange, save that his acceptance that he did not pursue the point indicated that it was early on.  This conversation goes both ways on the issue of the length of the period in England because it does not link it to the start of the course (other than perhaps the start of the academic year in 2006) but to the start of the period in England, but it does limit it to three years. </p>

Indeed, if as I think was the case at this stage, the mother had formed no firm intentions on such matters, in my view she would have avoided make a clear commitment to the time she would stay in England.  I am of this view because she was well aware of the father&#8217;s reluctance to go to England, that her main negotiating point or entitlement was the three year agreement or understanding and that if she went beyond that the father might well be very angry and awkward (as she says and I agree he had been in the past) and this would jeopardise her leaving Mexico with E.</p>

The missing detail included holiday arrangements, whether they would rent or buy properties in the longer term and financial arrangements generally.  The mother said that in an earlier argument the father had said that he would not support her financially in England and the father&#8217;s position is that he had told her that he would not support her financially but would pay E&#8217;s school fees.  I do not accept that clarity was reached as to the financial arrangements and the extent of any financial support the father would give the mother in England.  In Mexico they had been largely self supporting and had financed their own homes in Mexico City although they both used the country property which had been bought by the father.  </p>

This indicates that the mother had an intention to seek financial support from the father which supports the view that she regarded a divorce coupled with a claim for ancillary relief as a possible option, if the financial support was not volunteered.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The relationship between the mother and the father had had very low points before but divorce proceedings were not commenced by either of them.  In my judgment it is a fair and almost inevitable inference that the fact that they were now in England was a significant factor behind the decision of the mother to say she wanted a divorce, and then to issue proceedings for divorce here.  The mother has asserted that the father&#8217;s reaction to her announcement that she wanted a divorce, and then the divorce proceedings, was focused on money.  A mirror image of that would be that her proceedings were primarily motivated by financial considerations.  In my judgment this assertion about the father was unfair and it would be equally unfair to say that the mother&#8217;s decision to seek a divorce was primarily focused on financial matters.  However I accept and acknowledge that they both raised financial matters as a result of the mother&#8217;s announcement that she wanted a divorce; this is a natural reaction and a necessary and inevitable consequence if one of the parties is seeking ancillary relief.  As such a claim was pursued by the mother in England through her solicitors, who set up a financial mediation very shortly after the service of the petition, financial matters must have formed part of her thinking and the father&#8217;s reaction.</p>

In my view the fact that, as she had wanted for some time, she and E were no longer in Mexico and she had no intention of returning there, was a significant factor in the decision to divorce, as was her asserted need for financial support in England.  So in my judgment although I accept that when she left Mexico the mother had not finally decided to seek a divorce, and the separation and financial provision from the father and the issues relating to E&#8217;s care that that would bring, it was something that she then appreciated was a real possibility.  She was very keen to leave Mexico, as her email of 5 April 2006 shows, for a variety of reasons relating to her emotional and social needs and as she must have appreciated these could well lead her to deciding to divorce the father once they were out of Mexico and she was leading, or starting to lead, the independent life she wanted or might want.  </p>

So this was an enormously important factor in the father&#8217;s acceptance and support for the period in England on the basis he understood it to be taking place.  Also it is enmeshed in, and an enormously important part of, the mother&#8217;s range of plans.  It follows, as I have said, that her intention never to return to Mexico (a) must have included an intention never to agree to E returning there to live as a child, and (b) indicates that her more general and inchoate  plans,  options or possibilities for the future included ones that would have a result in which she would be the main carer of E if, for example, she and the father were not living in the same country and, on her case, even if they were, because she has asserted that she is and always has been E&#8217;s primary carer.</p>

I fully accept and acknowledge that looked at generally (and in this case) there are arguments that support the proposition that a child&#8217;s welfare is promoted by him having it made clear that his home is with one parent even  though he has long periods of contact with the other.  Also generally and in this case there are arguments, supported by recent authority in the Court of Appeal, that shared residence orders which recognise that a child has two homes (although he may not spend equal periods of time in them) promote a child&#8217;s welfare.  </p>

Although this accords with what the father told his solicitors when he instructed them in early December 2006 I do not accept that this was the case in the sense that there was no prospect of an improvement at least to a continuation of the relationship as it had existed for the last few years.  However it is clear that they both knew that the relationship was in a deep crisis and, in my view correctly, it was not suggested that the father would have agreed to E coming to England to save his relationship with the mother.  Rather what is suggested is that he agreed to move from the country where he enjoyed living, where his work was based had flourished and with which it is associated, where he had sought residency and where he thought E was happy and would flourish appreciating that the mother never intended to return and therefore:</p>

The father agrees that his reaction to being served with the petition was one of anger.  In my judgment that was understandable and I have concluded that before then the father had been angry and did threaten to take the proceedings and E to Mexico.  As I have mentioned in my judgment it was and is unfair of the mother to assert, as she has, that his reaction related to or was focused on financial matters.  In my judgment the father&#8217;s reaction included both anger and confusion and was not so focused, rather it ranged over a wide range of emotional and financial issues and the mother knew this. </p>

Also I accept the father&#8217;s evidence that he was expecting to raise matters relating to, and tried to raise matters relating to, E at the mediation in November but was told, as was the case, that the mediation had been arranged by the mother&#8217;s then solicitors to deal only with financial matters.  I also accept his evidence that in exchanges with the mother before service of the divorce petition she had also made the point to him that divorce had nothing to do with E.  I therefore find that it was the mother, and her then solicitors, who were pressing for information about financial matters and pushing her financial claims forward.  That is not a criticism because it flows naturally from the mother&#8217;s decision to seek a divorce in England and claim ancillary relief here against the background of a lack of agreement as to the financial arrangements between the mother and the father in England. </p>

In my view it is plain that he was and the mother knew that this was what he reasonably believed.  Even looked at from the basis of the mother&#8217;s narrative (as she described her account in evidence) the announcement that she wanted a divorce would have been a change and something that would be an unwelcome shock to the father in a number of ways, including the financial claims being made by the mother after such a short time in England following a long period in Mexico during which their relationship had had ups and downs and they had lived apart.</p>

It was also therefore the start of a period of considerable emotional turmoil for the father which continued for many months and which the mother must have appreciated was likely and was something she knew was happening.   In my judgment this turmoil was not focused on money, or the money claims, made by the mother.</p>

But, as already appears, in my view the contradictions, and that argument, do not found or lead to a conclusion that the father knew that the mother intended never to return to Mexico (and thus to agree to E living there as a child) when they all came to England in the summer of 2006.  Rather they demonstrate and confirm that he was upset, confused and in the later stages coming to terms with the fact that he had been misled. </p>

It is also clear from the proceedings issued in Mexico in early December 2006 that this was appreciated by the father by then.  Further at a meeting in Kensington Gardens on 7 December there is common ground that the mother made it absolutely clear that she would never come back to Mexico, by telling the father that it would take an act of nature to bring this about.  That statement stuck in both their minds because it was followed by thunder and a downpour.  It was made in response to a question from the father whether she would consider returning which, on both their accounts, indicated that the father knew when asking the question that the mother was not intending to return and he was trying to see if this was possible.</p>

I do not accept, as the mother has suggested, that his stance in this litigation flows from a realisation that he does not like living in England.  He knew that was likely before he came.  His stance flows from the points that what he understood the agreement to be is not being honoured by the mother, her failure to inform him of her intentions on leaving Mexico and his view as to what will best promote the welfare of E. </p>

I add that I accept his evidence that although he had told his solicitors on 5 December 2006 that there was no hope of a reconciliation one of his purposes in having the meeting on 7 December 2006 was to see if he and the mother could agree a way ahead, which had been prompted by him subconsciously drawing her.   Such a hope seems to me to be natural in the light of the mother&#8217;s change of the ground rules as he had understood them to be.  Also it is in line with the long period during which their relationship had had its ups and downs.  It was in this conversation when he was trying to find a solution that he asked whether the mother would agree to return to Mexico with E after six years, where he would stay for the next six years.  This was a proposal made in an attempt to reach an agreed solution, it was not an agreement or acceptance that E could remain here for 6 years. In this exchange the mother made it very clear that she would not agree to this, or any arrangement that contained a commitment to return to Mexico, and that from her perspective the relationship was over, she wanted a divorce, she was staying in England and she would not agree to E going back to Mexico to live.</p>

The petition in the Mexican proceedings however makes it plain that the father did not agree to E (and the mother) remaining in England and asserts a lack of good faith by the mother because she had waited until she and E had left Mexico to tell the father she intended to stay and live in London.</p>

As to that I was referred to  a number of cases including <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re F (A Minor: Child Abduction)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 FLR 548" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 FLR 548</ref> (in particular at 551/52), <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re R (Abduction: Habitual Residence) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] 1 FLR 216" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] 1 FLR 216</ref> (in particular paragraphs 32-39, 42-43, and 48).  I pause to note that in both those cases a finding was made as to what the settled and common intention and purpose was, and no issue arose as to one of the parents having been misled.  I was also referred to <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Al Habtoor v Fotheringham</span> [2001] 951 (in particular at paragraphs 23 and 37) which I accept shows that habitual residence can be acquired after a short time, and on the basis of residence for a settled purpose that might be for a short time or subject to a condition.</p>

It was said that that overlap of intention and understanding between the parents, or the father&#8217;s agreement to that, notwithstanding that the mother had a different intention and purpose as to the length of her stay and a return to Mexico, established a core or common settled intention or purpose that after a period of time in England would found a change in E&#8217;s habitual residence, and established that his removal and/or later retention was not wrongful.</p>

More generally issues relating to habitual residence in this context are usually focused on jurisdiction and thus on whether a court has jurisdiction to make welfare decisions. The Hague Convention and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/60" uk:canonical="1985 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985</ref> are specifically directed at, and provide a summary remedy in respect of, the issue as to which courts should determine welfare issues.  It follows in my view that they have primacy over a more general approach to a finding of habitual residence to establish jurisdiction.  Additionally the mother accepted, as she was bound to, that it was not all cases where there was some common ground, or overlap of intention, that could establish the relevant settled purpose or consent and that if, for example, there was an express misrepresentation that went to the heart of what one parent was happy to consent to (and did or would have consented to) then there would be a wrongful removal.  In my view this introduces into a summary process unnecessary complications and stages.  </p>

In my view, having regard to the purpose of the Hague Convention that approach would apply in the consideration of whether a removal or retention was wrongful even if that is isolated to, or first considered under, Articles 3 and 5.  I do not see how, in the context of the Hague Convention and more generally there is not a breach of rights of custody when a consent is obtained to course A when the parent seeking that consent in fact has course B in mind, when the two are materially different.  </p>

Additionally, as appears below, in my view on the facts this possibility does not assist the mother in this case.</p>

Further, and in any event, in my view the father was misled and in my view, looked at generally and by reference to its broad and non-technical meaning, there was no true agreement or common ground based on the three year agreement or understanding and its implementation, or on an agreement or understanding reached at the end of 2005.</p>

So, for example, if there had been a genuine meeting of the minds of the parents in this case that they should move here and share E&#8217;s care for three years, the issues arises whether there could be such a wrongful retention say after two years, having regard to either (a) the point that the possibility of a change of mind is inherent in the initial agreement, or (b) the point that by then the child would, by reference to the cases on habitual residence, be habitually resident here.  It seems to me that in such a situation there may be arguments that for the purposes of the Hague Convention a child should be treated as not having lost habitual residence in the requesting state, or as not having acquired it in the requested state, or as having two places of habitual residence (and that there may be a difference between a change of mind within and outside a year).  However I recognise the difficulty in respect of a genuine change of mind after a period of time here, particularly when the child has settled.  It may be that it is in this context, rather than in the argument advanced by the mother on consent to removal, that the inherent jurisdiction could resolve the problems.</p>

It is not sensible for me to try and give a general definition of what would constitute such a misunderstanding or nondisclosure.  For the purposes of this case, in my judgement such a misunderstanding or nondisclosure (and thus the deception asserted by the father) would exist if the mother knew that the father was proceeding on the basis of a misunderstanding, or she had not told him something, and in either case she knew or ought to have known that such misunderstanding, or non-disclosure, would, or would be likely to, affect the father's decision to consent to her taking H to England (whether that consent was given on the basis she alleges, or on the basis the Father alleges).

This is because distinctions between (a) a subjective mindset not to seek a summary return under the Hague Convention, and (b) agreeing to a child remaining in this country for a limited or indefinite period knowing (amongst other things) of a right or a possibility to seek a return under the Hague Convention are fine, and no doubt often artificial.  In both the subjective intention of the wronged parent is that the child can stay here, even if that stay is not for an indefinite period and is on the basis that the child might be returned by agreement, or order by an English court based on the test that the child&#8217;s welfare is the paramount consideration.</p>

It was argued that therefore he was not a wronged parent who was properly informed, or to borrow Lord Browne-Wilkinson&#8217;s phrase, he was not a wronged parent who took decisions &#8220;knowing of his rights&#8221; because he was told he did not have any.</p>

As I have said no oral evidence was given by any of the advisers.  The focus of the father&#8217;s evidence was on his turmoil and confusion.

In my view a lawyer who remembered the test set out in <span style="font-style:italic">T v T </span>(and the cases referred to in it) would have concluded that in those factual circumstances there was a real prospect of the father being able to show that for the purposes of the Hague Convention he had not consented to E&#8217;s removal from Mexico, and therefore that he could seek and get an order for a summary return of E to Mexico.  As turned out to be the case, if proceedings had then been launched the arguments on consent that I have heard would have been put in play, but those on acquiescence would not.</p>

In many cases whether that view (with or without legal advice) would have been shown to be right or wrong, if proceedings had been issued, would be a very open question.  Again it seems to me that an assessment of how good any advice was, or whether the view of an unadvised parent was right or wrong, should generally not form part of the consideration.  Rather generally that consideration should be confined to whether there is sufficient knowledge of the Hague Convention and a decision not to rely on it founded on knowledge of enough of the relevant facts.  In that context in this case a problem does not arise on the basis that the advisers did not know enough of the facts.</p>

In fact the point favours the view I have reached, but I record that if in all the other circumstances it had not, this general view would not have altered the balance in this case in favour of an order that E&#8217;s welfare would be best promoted by him returning to live in Mexico. </p>

The relevance of such a finding would be that by analogy with, or applying the reasoning underlying, the leave to remove cases weight should be given to the effects on a child of his primary carer being disappointed and therefore distressed and unhappy. This &#8220;knock on&#8221; effect is in many cases a strong factor in favour of an order being made that enables the primary carer to carry out his or her reasonable wishes relating to the country in which the child should live.  </p>

As I have mentioned, in my judgment her evidence in her May 2007 statement to support this assertion was misleading.  I accept that in terms of time the mother has spent longer with, and thus caring for, E than the father and that this is clearly so if all of his life is taken into account.  If only the period following the shared care arrangement starting in 2003 is taken into account, I suspect that the flexibility of that arrangement resulted in the mother spending more time with E than the father, although (as I have already indicated) a detailed exercise on the days so spent with E was correctly not pursued.  But the mother did not dispute that the father has always taken a very active role in E&#8217;s day to day care in the USA and Mexico, and that from 2003 the arrangements in Mexico were shared care arrangements.  The mother gave no convincing evidence to rebut the evidence of the father and third parties that this was a true shared care arrangement that continued in England and had the result that E had two homes, and in my view two parents who for some years have been taking an effectively equal part in his upbringing and care.</p>

I reject that evidence and much prefer the father&#8217;s evidence (supported by written evidence from others) that an extended period away form Mexico would be likely to have a damaging effect on his creativity, his productivity and industry, his ability to find good collaborators in his work, and his reputation.  The well reasoned and emotional views expressed by the father of the connection between his work and Mexico were in my view convincing and found the real risk that if he abandons a base in Mexico, to enable him to continue to share the care of his son in England, his career and reputation will suffer greatly. I therefore agree and find that the &#8220;three year standstill&#8221; in his work and career away from Mexico that he was prepared to agree to is at the limit of such a period away from Mexico as his base if he is to avoid or minimise that risk materialising in the long term.  It would also now be very difficult, if not from the perspective of his work foolish, for him to plan his work and career on the basis of being away for three years, if, as would be the case, he would know that E would not, or might well not, return to Mexico at the end of it.  The emotional and general impact of that on the father would be considerable in relation to his work and generally, and it would remove the main incentive for him taking the risks that flow from a temporary &#8220;standstill&#8221; in respect of his work.</p>

As I have said the PhD course is designed for people who are working.  Although I accept that it would be inconvenient and tiring for her to travel to England for the purposes of seminars, and other aspects of her course, in my view it would (subject to the provision of finance) be easier and more practical for her to do the travelling for the purposes of her course.  She could not do this to continue her part time teaching job, but the disadvantages flowing from that do not compare in the short or long term to the potential disadvantages relating to the father&#8217;s work and career.  Also, although I of course accept that there is easy access to reference books in English in England, I do not accept that the mother could not do effective research when based in Mexico.  Finally there is the point that the mother&#8217;s work in teaching, or in curating, does not have an existing or on the evidence a convincing connection to England in the short or long term save for the point that the PhD course she chose is here.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the respective dislike of the mother to living in Mexico and the father to living in England, the balance goes the other way.  I accept that the father does not like living here for a range of reasonable reasons looked at from his perspective but, absent the problems related to his work, in my view he would be able to adapt.  The mother has never liked living in Mexico she now, with some justification, feels that she would be more isolated than before if she returned to Mexico, and would be ostracised by a number of people in Mexico both socially and in respect of her work.  In my view, she is probably exaggerating the problems, and the antipathy towards to her of people in Mexico both socially and professionally, and it seems to me that if she was able to commit fully to it she could build an independent social and professional life in Mexico.  However I accept that this would not be at all easy for her in a number of respects and that she will find it very hard to commit to living in Mexico and building a life there in which she feels happy and fulfilled socially and professionally.  As to that the CAFCASS officer makes the point, and I accept, that if the mother returns to Mexico her emotional health and situation would be uncertain, and that in this respect she is fuelled by frustrations of life in Mexico and her perception that she has been, and continues to be, controlled by the father whilst also pursuing her independence.

In my view the descriptions given on behalf of the mother in the document I asked for setting out what her position would be in relation to the consequences of different findings of &#8220;almost unbearable to contemplate a return to Mexico&#8221; and &#8220;unable to contemplate a separation from E if he was to return there&#8221; set the degree of distress for both parents.

But this did not lead me to think that one result would be better than the other.  They are both loving parents.  In their position statements as to what they would seek if they were not successful they have both, if they were the disappointed parent, suggested a continuation of shared care if they live in the same country as E.  As I have said it is difficult for them both to fully think this through and to make decisions at this stage.  Looked at non-emotionally the issues are complicated by the point that &#8220;shared care&#8221; of the type I have found to have existed in the past may bring with it problems for a number of reasons, both now and in the future as E gets older and has different school and other commitments.  For example, if the disappointed parent remains committed to living out of his or her country of choice, arguments may arise that it is that parent who should be the main carer of, or have more time with, E because of his or her commitment to E and the ability of the other to more easily adapt to the changes that would cause.  That would however introduce issues as to whether that might lead to a change of country in the future and whether that would promote E&#8217;s welfare.  If however the disappointed parent cannot remain away from his or her country of choice it is clear that the present &#8220;shared care&#8221; cannot practically continue.</p>

As appears earlier in my judgment that is not wholly accurate.  She also says that the father has been managing being in London for the past 18 months.  Again in my view that assertion is not wholly accurate.  I do not of course criticise the CAFCASS officer for making these assertions and on the information before her they were reasonable ones.  But they have not been supported by the evidence. It is unclear how much weight the CAFCASS officer put on this understanding of these aspects of the history.  In any event, in my view correctly and properly she did not make a recommendation but highlighted problems and factors to be weighed by the court.</p>

I also agree with her that what she has reported, and what I have heard and read, show that this conflict has been played out over a long period, and if E does not start to feel more positive and settle it will have a long term impact on his emotional health.  This is because he is the child of two emotional parents, who is sensitive to their emotions and needs, who feels under pressure and responsible for both of his parent&#8217;s well being.  I agree that this is potentially extremely harmful for him and puts him at serious risk of experiencing depressive illness in the future.</p>

In her report under the heading &#8220;Recommendation&#8221; she made no recommendation, save as to contact on the two alternatives and that there should be a therapeutic package of support.  At that stage of her report, she deals first with the position if the court decides on a return of E Mexico.  But that ordering does not indicted any preference.

In my judgment the intensity of the conflict and the distress it has caused has been exacerbated by the dispute as to whether the mother misled the father as to her intentions when she came to England.  I have found that she did and to my mind it is only human nature for the father to react angrily to this, for it to cause him distress and for it to make it more difficult for him to accept that E should remain in England and for E&#8217;s sake to support this.  He is an emotional man and is suffering this range of emotions.  The mother does not agree that she misled the father and, unless she was to do so, these reactions of the father to him having been misled would be likely to continue and add to the difficulties for the father in accepting and adapting to E remaining, and going to school, in England.</p>

But harmony between his parents as to the length of the stay, and as to their longer term intentions would have made it much easier for E settle and in my view he would have done so against the background of a common purpose of, and the harmony that would have brought to, the two most important people in his life.</p>

Her past has not been very settled, and she has not spent a long enough period of time in England as an adult to confirm a long term personal or professional commitment to England.  Also she has not before made a similar commitment to a country, or a course and career, albeit that she spent a long time in, and I understand did her degree in, Canada.  Part of that past has included a failure by the mother, for a range of reasons focused on her own needs, preferences and ambitions, to commit on a long term basis to a married and family life in Mexico where her new husband was well established and became more successful, and which to the outsider would seem to have been the obvious place for that life if the overall welfare of the family was given priority.

In my view, as with the mother concerning the father&#8217;s ability to adapt, he underestimates the difficulties the mother will have in overcoming her intense disappointment if he is given permission to take E to Mexico, and in adapting to and supporting the move for E&#8217;s sake, whether or not she returns to Mexico.</p>

In this respect life in Mexico will not be the same for him and E may be disappointed with it in a number of respects by reference to his memories of it, and by comparison with things he has enjoyed in England, even though he can return to his old school and his old friend O, who he has kept in touch with, is in Mexico.  It would be very understandable if, and in my view it is likely that, part of E&#8217;s present thinking is based on an approach that the &#8220;grass is greener on the other side&#8221; given his present problems.  He has historically found change difficult and it is likely that this will be the position again.

He has a long standing and proven commitment and desire to live there for a number of reasons.  When compared to the rival position offered by the mother in England in my judgment the comparison is therefore between:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to Point (B), the comparison is more difficult and more intangible but in my view the points that he clearly was, and still sees himself as, a Mexican child, in the adult sense of a child of mixed heritage who lives in Mexico, gives Mexico an advantage over England in all the circumstances of this case.  In my view his present wishes will be likely to ease the immediate distress and problems of the move back to Mexico (whatever course his mother decides to take) and there is a good prospect (a) that he will fit back into his life in Mexico and build a circle of friends in surroundings that will be familiar to him, and (b) that, in the longer term, he will enjoy and relish being based in Mexico, as his father does, and in part because of the widely based and deep attraction and long term commitment of his father personally, emotionally and professionally to Mexico.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to both points (A) and (B) my conclusion that E is far from being settled in England is, of course, an important factor and in my view, even if the father remains here in the short or long term, the conflict between his parents, and his present wishes, are likely to make it difficult for E to settle here.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In short I have concluded that E&#8217;s chances of settling and having a base that in the medium to long term provides him with support, security, certainty and stability are better if he returns to Mexico now, notwithstanding that this entails a further change and carries its own risks.</p>

Another such comparison is between the issues relating to contact if the disappointed parent decides not to live in the same country as that in which E goes to school.  In my view at present both parents can arrange their lives to accommodate lengthy holiday contact, and visiting contact during term times.  The father&#8217;s proposals contain provision for this if E goes to school in Mexico. I acknowledge that this might become more difficult for the mother when she takes up full time employment, but this potential future difficulty has not caused me to conclude that E&#8217;s short, medium and long term welfare would be best served by him staying in England if the mother was to decide not to return to Mexico.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view the understandable difficulties and uncertainties relating to that decision make it premature for me to consider making orders relating to contact, or shared care, or provisions for mirror orders, or to consider undertakings or imposing conditions to my permission to the father to take E to Mexico.  I will do this when handing down this judgment, or later, in the light of the positions of the parents then.  </p>
