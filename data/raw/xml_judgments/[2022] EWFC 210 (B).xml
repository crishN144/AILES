In 2010 they moved from Country Z to the UK, and then in 2012 they were divorced in Country Z although they did not separate. In July 2012 the police were called after an incident outside the children's school in which the Father was said to have hit the Mother.

This came from a disclosure by DR to his school and an anonymous report. Country Z social services became involved and removed the Mother and C to a women's refuge while the other children were accommodated by social services. The Mother made an application for the children to live with her, but in 2017 the family returned to the UK. The Mother returned to Country Z multiple times during 2017, and during one of those visits withdrew that application. </span></p>

However, on their return to the UK in 2017, Country Z social services contacted the London Borough to make a referral due to concerns that the family had relocated while the case was still open and without informing Country Z social services, or the women's refuge where the Mother and C had been staying, or the children's school, of their intentions. LB began a s.47 assessment which was closed in summer 2017 on the basis that there was no recent evidence of domestic abuse.</span></p>

In my judgement, it requires none. The term is unambiguous and needs no embellishment. Understanding the scope and ambit of the behaviour however, requires a recognition that 'coercion' will usually involve a pattern of acts encompassing, for example, assault, intimidation, humiliation and threats. 'Controlling behaviour' really involves a range of acts designed to render an individual subordinate and to corrode their sense of personal autonomy. Key to both behaviours is an appreciation of a 'pattern' or 'a series of acts', the impact of which must be assessed cumulatively and rarely in isolation.</span></p>

For example when he was asked about his allegation that the Mother attacked him while he was driving, he was unable to describe exactly what had happened beyond saying that life was like this and that she would choke or hit him in the car, before diverting the evidence into a description of the Mother's mental health and attributing it variously to childhood trauma and / or a termination of pregnancy.

I will turn to the statements of X and Y in due course but I am satisfied that A's statement is too similar to that of his father to have been made without a degree of collaboration.

The Father followed this up with an email from DP, then a partner and Head of Family at his solicitors, the relevant part of which reads &#8220;I have amended A's statement to deal with the incident in September 2020.

When asked to speak from recollection instead they were both able to do so. I accept X's account that when his father discovered that he had been smoking, he was beaten for it, in a manner that exceeds reasonable chastisement. He was evidently sad when he described his father calling him a &#8220;fat piece of shit&#8221; as a child or belittling him for his stammer, and realising as he got older that his weight and stammer were beyond his control. X candidly admitted that in his late teens he &#8220;liked to party&#8221; but denied that he had a drug or alcohol problem. I accept his evidence on this point and find that he did drink alcohol at house parties but that was well within the parameters of what is considered normal for a young man in his late teens.

Possibly connected to this was his poor recall of dates and he had to refer back to his statement for these. I did not find that this affected his credibility: giving evidence should not be a memory test. In my view Y is a deep thinker rather than a quick thinker. However, once he was comfortable in the court setting, I felt his evidence was careful and in some ways the most nuanced of the three brothers, although he supports his mother in these proceedings.

He stated in his initial application that he had tried to &#8220;rehabilitate&#8221; the Mother by taking her to mental health clinics. He has asserted that X has a drug and alcohol problem and that DR too has mental health problems. The effect here is not just of gaslighting these members of the family into believing that they are the problem, but also the chilling effect on A, B and C, who will consciously or otherwise have received the message that they too will be accused of such behaviours if they depart from the Father's narrative.</span></p>
