	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is another case where an audit of a licensed clinic has discovered that the relevant forms have not been completed, resulting in uncertainty about the parental legal status of a child born to individuals undergoing fertility treatment. Whilst it is right to note that the evidence of the medical director from Herts and Essex Fertility Centre (&#8216;the Clinic&#8217;), Mr Ogutu, is that the audit revealed 99.18% compliance, the ramifications of non-compliance, on even a limited number of individuals, is far reaching. X and Z describe in their joint statement on being informed by the Clinic of the difficulties regarding the forms that they were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;shocked and upset, particularly because we had been through such a long journey&#8230;We couldn&#8217;t believe that at this stage, after all we had been through, we were being told that our baby might not be our baby anymore.&#8217;</span>  This demonstrates the need for clinics who undertake this type of treatment to take every step to ensure they have robust systems in place to avoid what happened in this case occurring again.</p>

They sought specialist fertility advice and underwent four unsuccessful cycles of IVF treatment using their own gametes. They were advised to use donor eggs and donor sperm and Z became pregnant following the second embryo transfer of a donor egg/sperm embryo at the Clinic, which is licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (&#8216;HFEA&#8217;). Y was born in June 2023.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This application has been issued due to the Clinic discovering upon an audit that Form PP was not part of X&#8217;s medical notes. The Clinic notified X of this error and initially sought that he re-sign the PP Form before realising that this would be ineffective as it was being signed after the embryo transfer. The Clinic advised X sought legal advice and this application was issued. The Clinic accepted full responsibility for what occurred and agreed to fund the legal advice.</p>

The evidence is unclear whether the PP Form was signed prior to conception and was deleted or completing it was overlooked. Mr Ogutu&#8217;s statement suggests it was signed in July 2022 and then deleted but there are no records to verify this. X and Y&#8217;s statement is less clear. They could not  recall specifically signing the PP Form, they signed all the forms they were asked to sign and relied on the Clinic to furnish them with the correct forms. They do recall seeking explicit confirmation that X would be their child&#8217;s father at the consultation with Mr Ogutu in August 2021, supported by the checklist that was completed following that consultation.</p>

In summary, each parent must give a notice in writing to the licensed clinic, prior to the embryo transfer which leads to the conception of the child, of their mutual intention that the non-birth parent be treated as the child&#8217;s father. The HFEA Forms which are normally required to be completed, according to the HFEA Code of Practice and licensing requirements, are HFEA Form WP and HFEA Form PP.</p>

		    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">The first question is whether, as a matter of its content and construction, a Form IC is apt to operate (a) as a Form WP and/or (b) as a Form PP.  This involves a comparison between the structure and language of the Form IC and the structure and language of the Form WP and Form PP, assessed in the light of the requirements of sections 37 and 44.  </span></p>

So far as concerns sections 37 and 44 and the content of the Form PP, there is, in my judgment, no difficulty. What sections 37(1)(a) and 44(1)(a) require is a "notice in writing" by, as the case may be, M or P "stating that [M or P] consents to being treated as ["the father" or "a parent" as the case may be]." That statutory language is tracked in the Form PP formula, "I consent to being the legal parent." The Barts Form IC uses the words "I acknowledge that &#8230; I will become the legal father of any resulting child." This has to be read in conjunction with the "NB" reference to "the legal parenthood of the child." The MFS Form IC uses the words "I acknowledge that &#8230; I intend to become legally responsible for any resulting child". This has to be read in conjunction with the "Note" reference to "consent &#8230; in the interest of establishing the legal parenthood of the child."</span></p>

But for my part I have no difficulty. Both the Barts Form IC and the MFS Form IC make clear that what is in issue is "establishing &#8230; legal parenthood" by W's partner and that this is why the Form IC is being signed by W's partner. In the MFS Form IC the word "consent" is used. Indeed, the phrase "partner's consent" appears immediately below the space where the partner has to sign. True it is that the word "consent" does not appear in the corresponding place in the Barts Form IC, but what the partner is signing is an acknowledgement &#8211; "I acknowledge" &#8211; that he or she "will become" a "legal" parent and acquire "legal parenthood." It is said that Casement was hanged on a comma, but I cannot accept that everything here turns on the use of the word "acknowledge" rather than "consent" when the purpose and effect of the words used in the Form IC is obvious. Why, after all, is W's partner being asked to sign the Form IC at all, if not to make sure that he or she becomes a parent? By signing the Form IC, W's partner is acknowledging in terms that he or she will become a parent and, by necessary implication, that this is something he or she wants. Taking the Form IC in context and having regard to its content and language, even a black-letter lawyer in Lincoln's Inn would struggle to deny that what is being signed is a consent. In my judgment, this Part of the Form IC &#8211; both the Barts Form IC and the MFS Form IC &#8211; is, as a matter of content and construction, apt to operate as a Form PP and complies with the requirements of sections 37(1)(a) and 44(1)(a).</span></p>

The alternative documentation must be in writing and signed by both W and P before conception and must demonstrate informed consent&#8230; I have already found that the applicants received information and counselling prior to treatment and the seven documents can be interpreted in that context. The applicants' expectation was that the signing of these forms, and for the present I am assuming the alternative case that the WP and PP forms were not signed, had the desired effect; the effect they had been counselled about and given information about and which they plainly wished to bring about of making them both legal parents. It is fair to note that the documentation does not spell out consent to legal parenthood explicitly, but I am satisfied that, taken together, that is the effect of the seven documents. </span></p>
