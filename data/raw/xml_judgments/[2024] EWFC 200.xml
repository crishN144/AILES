Having graduated that summer, with an MsC Masters in Business Finance, the husband took a job in Hong Kong, where the wife soon joined him, transferring her place at a business school in Hong Kong from late 1997 or early 1998. The parties were cohabiting from this point. The wife graduated with an MBA in 1998, and began working in Hong Kong. The couple agreed to marry in early 2000. In March 2000 the husband gave notice in relation to his job with the bank, leaving in June that year to start &#8211; his first venture as an entrepreneur. </span></p>

Meanwhile, the husband&#8217;s new venture did not flourish, and by March 2001 it was clear that the company was in trouble. The husband says, and I accept, that it had become clear by then that he would need to close it down. It was eventually closed in the following July, and the husband went back to work at the investment branch of a different bank.</span></p>

The one issue which will have most impact is the extent to which the outcome of the wife&#8217;s application for financial remedies should be impacted by the &#8216;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Contrat de Mariage</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">&#8217; (&#8216;the contract&#8217;) which the couple signed in Hong Kong before returning to France for their wedding.

B was born in July 2002. In January 2004, the wife returned to work, with a new company as an international strategy consultant, although she reduced her working week from 5 days to 4 in July 2004, ahead of C&#8217;s birth in August of that year. The company relocated their team abroad in 2005, and the wife was unable to follow them. Instead, the family bought their first home in London and the wife took a job in a different field which she was to continue until 2013.</span></p>

Whilst the levels of profit appear to have plateaued or fallen recently, the company had enjoyed substantial success during the intervening years, which has led to the amassing of a substantial fortune, the detail of which I will consider later. The parties are however in agreement that, aside from the impact of the contract, all of the assets now held by them, including the husband&#8217;s business assets and a significant holding in trust, would all otherwise be accounted as matrimonial and so subject to the sharing principle.</span></p>

She says that she does not believe that they talked about it &#8216;other than in the most brief and insignificant way&#8217;, because she does not remember any discussion. She says that she thinks if it had been important, she would have been able to remember. She goes on that she is &#8216;almost certain&#8217; that it was the husband who first suggested that they sign it. The only context she gives is that the impetus was linked to the husband&#8217;s desire to be an entrepreneur. By electing </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">separation de biens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, as the couple did, she says that it was &#8216;a way of protecting assets in the name of your spouse&#8217;. She also thought that the husband did not wish to consult her or get her signature ahead of investments as might otherwise have been necessary. She says that she cannot remember having a discussion with anyone about what it might mean on divorce.</span></p>

She accepted that when she met the husband, in addition to a home in the Paris suburbs, her parents had also owned a summer holiday home bought in 1995, as well as 2 studios in the mountains. She described how her paternal grandparents were not wealthy after her paternal grandfather, also an entrepreneur, had become bankrupt in the late 1960s. She accepted that her mother&#8217;s parents had more than those of her father, such that although one of six children, her mother had still received an inheritance of some &#163;1,000,000 in 2013. The overall impression which she gave, and which was confirmed by her parents who both also gave oral evidence to me, was not one of great wealth, but of a comparatively comfortable and well-heeled middle-class family, who were certainly able to enjoy the good things in life without financial concern. However, it is clear that the wife&#8217;s parents were not so wealthy that their lifestyle could withstand unscathed their divorce in 2003.</span></p>

Her mother recounted 3 lengthy telephone conversations with her daughter expressing concerns about the wife&#8217;s father placing joint funds into accounts in his sole name, to deprive her of her share under the terms of their contract. She also recalls the wife telling her of a conversation she had had with the husband triggered by her concerns about her father&#8217;s behaviour. She says that she was told that the husband had reassured her that he would not behave in the way that her father had. She recalls a further conversation at their holiday home in the summer of 2004, when the parties were staying with her, when the wife reassured her that she felt that the husband would be respectful and make sure that assets were put into her name. She has not spoken directly to the husband about these things.</span></p>

This was not challenged. He drew a contrast with the relative affluence of the wife&#8217;s family, and said that he found this initially intimidating. I do accept from what I have read and heard that there would have been an appreciable social gulf between the families, which may be as important for these purposes as any financial detail. Whilst it may be that the wife&#8217;s paternal grandfather&#8217;s bankruptcy had an effect on the value of his estate, which might have led to her maternal grandfather insisting that her father sign a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">separation de biens</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> contract as he said, the overall impression which the evidence gives is that the wife&#8217;s family are far more used not only to having money, but also to protecting it and to the risks of losing it over the course of generations. </span></p>

Despite her father&#8217;s denial, it is on balance likely that some such conversation would have taken place. In circumstances where the wife&#8217;s own parents had such a contract, where her own paternal grandfather had suffered bankruptcy as an entrepreneur, and where her maternal grandfather had required her father to sign their contract, it is clear that the risks and benefits of the arrangement were well known to the family. Whilst the opportunity to transfer assets to the wife or into joint names for their protection in the event that the husband&#8217;s future businesses proved unsuccessful may have been the primary motivation for the family, I cannot accept that they did not also understand in 2001 that any such contract would also have consequences in the event of a subsequent divorce, at least under French law.</span></p>

In May 2001, the husband&#8217;s finances were precarious. He had a business venture in the process of failing, whilst the wife was in reliable employment. Neither then had any inherited wealth to protect, but the wife&#8217;s prospects would have been rather stronger than the husband&#8217;s. Thus, the contract would offer her a measure of protection and security going forward, in the hope perhaps that the husband would do the decent thing and put property into joint names. Indeed, if anything, the wife&#8217;s initial lack of recollection about what happened would suggest that she really had few concerns at the time about what was being arranged, rather than she did not have any understanding of what the contract meant.</span></p>

She describes it as a &#8216;tick in the box for the contract to be signed (as part of the many items on the wedding to do list)&#8217;. It is notable that she appears to have been unconcerned, notwithstanding that she is a woman of education and intelligence.

That the wife was having conversations with the husband then, during which she was reassured that he would place properties into joint names, and would not take funds from joint accounts and place them into his own name as her father had, makes it clear that she was under no illusion at that time that the contract which she had signed would be effective in the event of a divorce. It is equally striking that there is no suggestion by her mother that she the wife was taken by surprise to learn that this was its effect.</span></p>

But on her own account the conversations were around reassurance that the husband would not behave as her father was doing, not that he would not enforce the terms of the contract at all. At this point, in 2003/4, the husband had not yet set up his investment vehicle, and thus placing the homes that they owned into joint names once acquired would have been the extent of any discussion. </span></p>

It is therefore believable for the wife to state as she does that it had not occurred to her that the French contract would be important in England, but noticeable that she distinguishes this from her realisation that in France, the contract would be important on divorce. And it is in that context that her conversations seeking reassurance from the husband that properties would be placed into joint names, and that he would not behave like her father, must be seen. She knew that the couple had elected for French law to govern the terms of their marriage.</span></p>

Within months, however, in September 2007, the husband had lost his regular banking job, and in the next year was to embark on his new investment venture. Thereafter, he did continue to acquire homes for the couple in joint names &#8211; a flat in Paris in 2008, the holiday home in 2013, and the family home in London in 2015, but the various business ventures were kept separate.

It is certainly the case that there is no hint in that document of what by then were already non-binding but very well-advanced negotiations for a third party to buy into the club.

Doubtless in some cases its presence or absence will be critical. In the present case, the judge was fully aware that the wife had not received legal advice but, having seen her give evidence, made the clear finding that the wife knew &#8216;full well&#8217; the effect of the agreement. The judge said that he was able to &#8216;reach a firm and clear conclusion&#8217; and to &#8216;find as a fact that throughout the marriage the wife has known and understood the impact of the PMA&#8217; (J1, at para [183]).

Of course, the fact of the contract of itself has a significant bearing on fairness, as does the fact that, throughout the length of this marriage, there is evidence that the wife has understood the consequences of the regime that this couple adopted, and whilst she has sought to ameliorate its impact in the past, she has never apparently sought to alter it.

Equally if the devotion of one partner to looking after the family and the home has left the other free to accumulate wealth, it is likely to be unfair to hold the parties to an agreement that entitles the latter to retain all that he or she has earned.</span></p>

But whilst such an outcome may be considered to be more likely than not, that does not prescribe the outcome in every case. Even where there is an effective prenuptial agreement, the court remains under an obligation to take into account all the factors found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/25/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25(2)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 1973</ref>, together with a proper consideration of all the circumstances, the first consideration being the welfare of any children. Such an approach may, albeit unusually, lead the court in its search for a fair outcome, to make an order which, contrary to the terms of an agreement, provides a settlement for the wife in excess of her needs. It should also be recognised that even in a case where the court considers a needs-based approach to be fair, the court will as in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">KA v MA</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11pt">, retain a degree of latitude when it comes to deciding on the level of generosity or frugality which should appropriately be brought to the assessment of those needs.&#8217;</span></p>

There, the fact of agreed constraint was relevant to the outcome.

They made the fair point that it was the husband&#8217;s case that the wife should not receive both of the parties&#8217; principal homes, and also that her budget was significantly overstated. The husband&#8217;s position at trial was that the wife&#8217;s needs should appropriately be met at the level of &#163;14.66m &#8211; a housing fund of some &#163;7.5m to be split between a home in London and another home in the same place as their holiday home, and a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Duxbury</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> fund of &#163;7.16m. This was calculated to provide for her &#163;287,692pa &#8211; or her Form E budget after an exchange rate correction. The current product of a capitalise calculation for this amount, fully amortising but assuming a state pension for the wife, would be a lifetime net income without step-down of &#163;298,743pa. On the same basis, the &#163;9m offered by the husband&#8217;s final withdrawn open offer would produce for her &#163;370,743pa. </span></p>

These parties have had 3 children and have amassed a significant fortune. The wife should not be subject to any too rigorous &#8216;needs&#8217; assessment in these circumstances. I acknowledge that the husband has recognised this in the quantum of the offer that he has made. If I find that the contract should be effective to prevent the wife from seeking to make good a claim on the sharing basis, then I see no reason why in budgetary terms I should seek to make any further cuts or downward adjustments to that figure which the wife provided as her final budget in March, and an appropriate income fund would then be not less than &#163;7,850,000 (rounding up).</span></p>

I&#8217;m sure that that is the case, but in the context of this marriage, and the value of the matrimonial assets available, if not for sharing then to meet the claim for appropriate housing that the wife should have, I can see no reason in fairness why she should be put in a position where before too long she would be forced to downsize from one or both of the properties of which she has had the use during the marriage. There is no issue but that she should retain the London home, and I am satisfied that the husband&#8217;s open offer to redeem the mortgage on that property for her was appropriately made. There is no question here of proportionality or affordability. </span></p>

Rather, the question is as to which party should retain that particular property. I am sensitive to Mr Marks&#8217; arguments about the obvious fairness of the &#8216;crown jewels&#8217; of a marriage usually being divided between the parties at its end. That argument has particular force where the assets of the marriage are being shared. Here, however, fairness has a broader horizon in circumstances where he also argues that the contract should disentitle the wife to her otherwise substantial sharing claim. In those circumstances, depriving her of the property as her holiday home, proximate as it is to the property that her parents have occupied for many years, would I consider detract from the overall fairness of any outcome calculated on this basis. To have her ex-husband owning the property next door might foreseeably also impact on her ability to spend time with her parents and siblings in the next-door property.</span></p>

He points out that such an arrangement has to date worked for the wife&#8217;s parents, since their divorce which began 20 years ago. It was, however, clear from the evidence that they gave that whilst they have made the arrangement work, it has not been by any means ideal, much less so now that the property has become the wife&#8217;s father&#8217;s main home. I consider that this is the sort of arrangement which the parties can certainly put in place if, when these proceedings are concluded and behind them, they can agree to do so. This, however, would not be an arrangement that I think it appropriate to impose on them at the conclusion of these hard-fought and contentious proceedings. It is also of course the case that the husband can, in the absence of a sharing outcome, certainly afford if he wishes to buy an equivalent property nearby.    </span></p>

I anticipate that, if ever there were to be a case for such an outcome, it would be in a case with a background such as this where significant assets have been built up during a long marriage, but that by reason of an agreement at the outset the right to a sharing outcome at the dissolution of the marriage has apparently been waived. However, after careful thought, I am satisfied that this is not a case where an element of sharing is required to achieve a fair outcome. </span></p>

As a proportion of the whole pot, which I accept by nature is entirely matrimonial, it is somewhere between 20% and 26% of the assets. Whilst this is certainly less than a sharing outcome would have produced, it nevertheless is an amount that does properly reward the wife&#8217;s contribution. At that level, I am satisfied that no compensation arguments arise, for she could not have hoped for a more secure financial future by her own efforts if she had not made the significant career sacrifices which I acknowledge that she has, both in following the husband to Hong Kong at the outset of their relationship, and then in giving up her job in London when its continuation would have required a relocation to Germany. </span></p>

This is especially if those resources would otherwise have been classed as matrimonial. I do not suggest that this would be suitable in the majority of agreement cases. However, taking such a course may in an appropriate case prevent the need for involved accountancy and tax arguments such as have arisen here, in an attempt to achieve extensive and precise cash equivalent valuations of every asset, in circumstances where that level of precision ultimately has not proved to be a requirement of achieving a fair outcome in this case. </span></p>
