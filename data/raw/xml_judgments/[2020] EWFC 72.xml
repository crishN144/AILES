The recited aim was to achieve a broadly equal division of the assets, as one would expect after a long marriage. A number of properties were transferred to the wife; a number of properties were transferred to the husband; and a number of properties were to be sold and the proceeds split. A mechanism was agreed for the wife to receive a lump sum deriving from a liability owed to the husband from a company with which he was involved.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.51in;margin-right:0.03in">&#163;6m. A mechanism was devised for the wife to receive payments upon the sale of these properties consistent with the overarching agreement for equal division of the assets. Those payments were referable to the husband&#8217;s return from the sale of the properties. That return was dependent upon a number of factors including the costs of financing, the time taken to achieve a sale and the eventual sale price. In addition, it was agreed that there would be a &#163;1m payment on account. In the event of a failure to sell by May 2012 the matter was to be restored to court in the absence of agreement between the parties. The determination by the court was facilitated by the wife&#8217;s claims to a lump sum order being left open for the sole purpose of &#8220;enabling regulation of and the implementation of the orders, agreements and undertakings in respect of RH and BH.&#8221; </p>

In 2012 the wife issued applications for enforcement and implementation of the 2010 order. There were matters outstanding under the terms of the original order in addition to the sale of the two development properties. The husband intimated a cross-application. I do not know exactly what relief that cross-application sought, or even if it was issued. I have deduced from a supplemental submission of Mr Feehan QC that it related to the timing provisions of certain lump sum and property adjustment orders. The applications were compromised on 7 August 2012. On 14 April 2013 I directed that the dispute about the unsold development properties and the realisation of the wife&#8217;s share in them should be determined by a District Judge with a two-day time estimate.  </p>

Various obligations were assumed by the parties including the husband paying the wife two lump sums of &#163;250,000 and &#163;410,000. The order was expressed to be in full and final satisfaction of the parties&#8217; respective claims. A clean break was ordered. No claims were left open. The dismissal of the parties&#8217; claims was conditional upon payment of the lump sum of &#163;410,000 and compliance by the wife with an undertaking to complete the transfer of a property in Portugal. These terms were complied with, as were all the others. The clean break therefore took full effect.  </p>

The husband argues that this has had a catastrophic financial impact on him leaving him with net worth of only around &#163;1m. He says that he has been left in dire financial straits after this long marriage because of the late and disappointing sale of the properties. By contrast he suggests that the wife has been left with what he guesses to be about &#163;8.5million (the wife not having given voluntary financial disclosure in these latest proceedings). Whether this figure is correct or not is not relevant to my decision. </p>

The way it has been argued before me is that the orders should be set aside, and the court should undertake <span style="font-style:italic">de novo</span> the section 25 exercise. The figure of &#163;3,528,500 is calculated by the husband as the balancing payment needed to give him essentially half of the matrimonial pot as he says it has now turned out to be.  </p>

		    <p style="margin-left:1.01in;margin-right:1.04in">&#8220;What meaning should be given to the words in County Court Rules 1981, Ord. 37 may need to be further argued. It seems to me to be more advisable for me today to lay down an exhaustive test than it was for the Divisional Court when they first considered the Matrimonial Causes Rule. It should not be difficult to show that no error of the judge at the hearing could be alleged if he has endorsed a consent order. When the order has been opposed and the very issue has been in dispute, then the matter is more uncertain. To seek a rehearing simply because fresh evidence has become available is probably a matter for appeal. I am concerned with non-disclosure of material information which it was the duty of a party to place before the court. In that case it should be possible to construe Ord. 37 widely enough to allow the rehearing in the county court even though there may be a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. The substance, as opposed to the form of the allegation being made in such a case, i.e. the essential ground on which the rehearing is sought, is not that the court erred, in the sense that it made an incorrect selection of conflicting testimony or drew an erroneous inference therefrom, but that the court was misled by a party whose duty it was to give full and frank disclosure. It would not be open to that party then to allege that the court erred in reaching that conclusion.&#8221; </p>

If a court orders a rehearing of a financial remedy claim then the original order may be rescinded in whole or in part. Or it may be varied. There may be good reasons for the original order, or part of it, to continue but for it to be varied. Under the RSC an appeal to the Court of Appeal was always a &#8220;rehearing&#8221;. When an appeal was allowed sometimes the first instance order was rescinded and a new order made; sometimes the first instance order was varied. Plainly, on a rehearing the court&#8217;s dispositive powers are not fettered. A rehearing encompasses rescission and variation.  </p>

It did not usher in a brave new world. It was no more than a banal replication of a power vested in the divorce county courts from the moment of their creation in 1968. That power had been confined by the law to the traditional grounds for decades. Interpreting <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>F(6) purposively and with regard to its historical antecedents leads me to conclude clearly that in the field of financial remedies its lawful scope, or reach, starts and ends with the traditional grounds. Mr Feehan QC is not able to point to any kind of emanation from law reformers, or from Parliamentarians at the time that the Crime and Courts Bill was being debated, urging that the time had come to push back the frontiers and to allow far more financial remedy orders to be capable of challenge. Were anyone to have done so I am quite sure that there would have been a chorus of objections that such a reform would open the floodgates to speculative litigation years after the implementation of a clean break and would completely subvert that key principle. </p>

The husband remarried in October 2015. A set aside of the orders would leave the original claims to be adjudicated. The wife certainly made a claim originally, but did the husband? </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">This problem was not argued before me, although it was touched on in the skeleton argument for the wife. I raised the issue after submissions were concluded and received some succinct supplemental written submissions from Mr Feehan QC and Ms Ward. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">First, Mr Feehan QC tells me that a search of the old files by the husband&#8217;s solicitor has not located a Form A filed on behalf of the husband. However, Mr Feehan QC submits that in circumstances where the husband&#8217;s claims were dismissed it would have been conventional for a Form A to have been filed on his behalf for dismissal purposes only. The court file has not been examined to see if there is such a document on it. However, it seems unlikely that such a document was filed on behalf of the husband; if it had been it would surely be on his solicitor&#8217;s file. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Second, Mr Feehan QC tells me that the application made by the husband referred to in paragraph 10 above, was for revision of certain property adjustment and lump sum orders. I deduce that the revisions related solely to timing since any other revision would have been prohibited by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Matrimonial Causes Act 1973</ref>. That application, he argues, would have constituted a valid pre-marriage application for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/28/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 28(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>. I have to say I am not convinced by this argument. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Third, Mr Feehan QC argues that the power of the court under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18/section/31" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 31</ref>F(6) and rule 9.9A is not confined only to an order for set-aside; it extends explicitly to a power to vary. That variation power can be exercised without requiring the husband to issue a fresh application. Put another way, the bar on the husband issuing an application does not prevent the court from varying the orders in his favour. Again, I am not convinced by this argument. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">Fourth, Mr Feehan QC argues at that the very least the wife&#8217;s claims could be retried, and inasmuch as lump sums were awarded in her favour they could be set aside with a consequential order for repayment to the husband. Again, I am unconvinced. Those cases, such as <span style="font-style:italic">Simister v Simister</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1987] 1 All ER 233" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1987">[1987] 1 All ER 233</ref>, which say that a husband can apply for the wife&#8217;s claims against him to be determined surely would not apply where the husband is seeking a payment in his favour rather than vice versa.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.03in">In view of the primary decision I have reached I do not need to decide this problematic question. However, if a higher court were to decide that my primary decision is wrong, and that the husband is entitled to have his application determined on its merits, then the question whether he is statutorily barred from doing so will have to be looked at very carefully.</p>
