It is AW&#8217;s case in these proceedings that BB is her former husband&#8217;s nominee and that the beneficial interest in C Ltd and its corporate subsidiary holdings belong in reality to AH. That case is disputed by each of the respondents and has informed one of the significant areas of forensic enquiry which this court has been asked to undertake. </p>

I hope in doing so, I cause no offence to either.  It is intended as no more than a convenient shorthand.  The reality is that decree nisi in respect of AW&#8217;s petition for divorce was pronounced in May 2017, and the parties have been living apart since the early part of 2011. Thus, for more than eight years they have been living an independent existence from one another, albeit that the financial arrangements which were put in place at the time of the separation continued to preserve an infrastructure which underpinned to an extent the manner in which they have arranged their lives over the years since their separation. The husband was declared bankrupt in July 2011, a few months after the demise of the marriage.  At that time, he owed some &#163;33 million to unsecured creditors. He was subsequently discharged a year later although his trustee in bankruptcy, a wellknown firm of accountants with international experience, spent the next five </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in;text-indent:0in">years investigating his financial affairs. That lengthy enquiry cost over &#163;500,000 and led to the recovery of no more than a negligible sum of less than &#163;20,000.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">At the heart of this case lies an allegation on the part of the wife and her legal team that the husband has failed to make full, frank and complete disclosure of his past and present financial circumstances. Whilst he presents the court with a narrative which, on its face, appears to show a spectacular financial fall from grace and an ongoing position of near personal insolvency, the wife claims that he has, or should be treated as having, financial resources at his disposal.  Her open proposal at the start of this case included a claim for a sum of &#163;2 million or, in the alternative, an adjournment of her lump sum claims.  In her closing submissions, Miss Bangay QC accepted that she is unlikely to be able to demonstrate on the evidence which is presently available that such undisclosed resources as may exist will be sufficient to meet her client&#8217;s ongoing needs for a secure home and an income. By the conclusion of the case it is now her case that the wife&#8217;s lump sum claims should be adjourned to await what it is hoped will be the husband&#8217;s financial renaissance.  </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Thus, at the heart of this case lie the two central issues of computation and needs.  If the husband is presenting to this court a broadly true and accurate position of the current financial landscape, neither parties&#8217; needs can be met at the present time. If the wife is right and there is substantial value retained for his benefit in offshore assets, as yet undisclosed to the court, there may nevertheless be significant hurdles to surmount in future before the court can be satisfied that her needs will have been met through the full enforcement of an English award in these proceedings. </p>

He has four daughters who are now in their mid-twenties and thirties. His first marriage ended in 1980, some forty years ago. He married his second wife in 1991. That marriage was a short one which ended some four years later during the course of which his youngest child was born. </p>

His relationship with the applicant began shortly after the demise of his second marriage. By the early part of 1997, their relationship appears to have been sufficiently committed for the wife to state that they were more or less living together. After a brief hiatus at the end of 1997, and by the summer of 1998 on his own case, they were living together at his home in St John&#8217;s Wood. They married in October 2001. No children were </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.54in">Throughout the next decade, their marital standard of living was extremely high, if not exorbitant. In March 1998, at or shortly after the time when they began to live together, the husband sold the majority of his shares in an international business which he had spent many years building up.  That sale realised a sum of just over &#163;86 million. At the time he was 41 years old and had doubtless worked hard through many years to reach that position of significant financial security.  Their wedding in 2001 was celebrated with an expensive party costing several million pounds at which guests were entertained several famous musical performers. It was followed by ten years of more or less unbridled expenditure on property, yachts and discretionary lifestyle choices. This statement is not intended as any form of criticism or judgment: it is simply to state the facts.  The husband himself describes it as &#8220;a hugely lavish lifestyle&#8221;. In 1999, the husband bought what has been described as a &#8216;super yacht&#8217; for US$20 million. Some three years later, he took possession of a second yacht which had been built to his specification. The annual cost of the upkeep of the two yachts was in the region of US$3 million. In 2005, he purchased a substantial property in the Luberon region of </p>

I shall come to these in due course.  However, at this juncture it is right to record, as the husband accepted, that a significant part of their lifestyle was funded from capital.   </p>

He made a number of different introductions through his networking activities as a result of which members of that inner circle and others saw significant financial returns on some of their investments. I heard, for example, from WG, the husband&#8217;s accountant, that he or his firm had benefitted to the tune of several millions of pounds over the years as a result of business contacts introduced by the husband. That he was a significant &#8220;mover and player&#8221; in that international world I have little doubt. I am also persuaded that he made significant donations to various philanthropic causes and he has during the course of this litigation produced testimonials from several individuals commending his work in this field.  I want him to know that I have read this evidence carefully, as I have all of the evidence in this case. I accept that, when he has been in a position to do so, this husband has supported a number of worthy causes which have brought benefit to those whose personal circumstances were very far removed from his own at that time. He has been a passionate supporter of education and is rightly proud of the current success of a school in London which he supported and financed. This aspect of his former generosity to friends and causes is attested to by both WG and GN, from each of whom I heard oral evidence. In my judgment it is reflective of the complex character and dynamic of the husband&#8217;s personality.   </p>

I am in no doubt that through the years of the marriage he was a generous host and a loyal friend to his inner circle. In turn, he appears to have attracted both a loyalty and a confidence in his financial abilities from those individuals. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that through his core runs (or ran) a determination of steel to drive through the enterprise on which he was engaged. I am persuaded that he brooked no dissent. He is clearly a risk-taker in many senses of that word.  The wife has described him in the context of their personal relationship as &#8220;a bully&#8221;. WG told me <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;you do not say no to AH&#8221;. </span>I am in no doubt that, both in a personal and in a business context, the husband had a ruthless streak when pursuing his objectives. That much is demonstrated by the steps and arrangements which he put in place both at the time of the parties&#8217; separation and during the currency of their voluntary financial arrangements over the next four or five years. Yet that impression of the man has to be tempered by the steps which I find he took in the aftermath of his bankruptcy to recover his financial position for their mutual benefit. Those steps may have involved the reckless dissipation of significant sums invested on the equity futures markets. Objectively, these cannot possibly be seen as a prudent use of funds which were so obviously required to restore a measure of financial security and equilibrium into their respective financial positions. They speak to me of an element of arrogance in this man&#8217;s personality and a refusal to accept that life could no longer continue as it had done before. Nevertheless, I accept that, just as the wife told me she trusted him and wanted to give him the space and means to rebuild financially, he had initially made a commitment to her financial support and future security. I accept that he hoped and expected to deliver on the terms of their agreement at the point of separation that he would ensure she had the French Property on a mortgage free basis at the end of the five years of respite which she offered him.   </p>

He became overextended. It is apparent from the agreed chronology that in the summer of 2007 he lost some &#163;40 million on his spread-betting account. By 2008 he began to experience serious financial difficulties. Through C Ltd, he maintains that he had invested over &#163;1 million in a Chinese investment which failed. He maintains that those funds had come from FD, one of his close circle of friends and business colleagues, who had purchased some of his assets. Whilst his personal friends and business acquaintances were showing some restraint in enforcing loans they had made to keep him afloat, the banks to whom he was significantly indebted were taking a more aggressive stance.  The company which owned the public house portfolio had been liquidated owing its banks in excess of &#163;50 million. Assets were sold (including the yachts and the substantial property in St John&#8217;s Wood) although it is apparent that even at this stage the husband had sufficient self-belief in his own abilities to retrench and recover to justify incurring a liability for rent at an apartment in Mayfair which was then costing &#163;136,000 per annum.  </p>

I am satisfied that this was not an unreasonable aspiration on her part given that she had never truly felt that the property in St John&#8217;s Wood (as beautiful a property as it may have been) was her own home. It was a place which was, I find, special to the husband in a number of respects. It no doubt represented the material success of all he had achieved in many years of a career in business. He had designed its internal specifications to reflect his own taste and aspirations. It represented not only a significant financial investment but an emotional investment in terms of his sense of place and belonging. I accept that its sale in July 2011, as part and parcel of his personal insolvency, represented a significant loss to him, just as the eventual sale of the French Property was a devastating blow to the wife.  However, her move to Monaco in April 2011 was to prove to be, as I find, an important piece of the financial infrastructure which the husband set up in anticipation of his financial insolvency. Whilst I accept that he fought that inevitability for several months, formal bankruptcy followed in July 2011 some three months after the parties had separated. He was declared bankrupt from the foot of his own petition which recorded his personal insolvency as having been triggered by the loss of one of the companies he owned in the sum of &#163;20 million plus over three years. That corporate failure had resulted in the banks calling in the loans and personal guarantees which they held. The directors&#8217; loan accounts which he then held in various companies were said to be worthless and/or unenforceable, there was no equity in the French property<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

The most significant creditor in the bankruptcy was Kaupthing Bank (the major Icelandic bank based in Reykjavik which subsequently collapsed in the financial crisis which occurred between 2008 and 2011). That bank was owed over &#163;24 million with an English Bank, Lloyds, calling in just over &#163;7.7 million of the husband&#8217;s loans. </p>

It was also important to him, as I find, that the wife was offshore and in a position to act as a potential financial conduit for many of the business dealings which he undertook in that post-separation period. At the end of 2010, through the husband, she had secured a loan from HSBC in the sum of &#8364;350,000 which was paid into her S bank account to secure a non-working resident&#8217;s permit in Monaco.  With everything collapsing around him in terms of his ongoing corporate and spread-betting losses, the husband had in August 2010 invested in a new company called F Ltd. It is clear to me that he and his fellow investors in that new company hoped and expected that its future success would be significant in terms of a financial return.

At that stage he did not have the funds to invest himself but he approached two of his personal friends, JJ and BB, with a view to securing some financial backing for the new company. That approach resulted in others across his network of friends and business associates agreeing to make similar investments/loans to fund the start-up company. Initially there appear to have been seven front end-investors, including C Ltd and his daughter (SH), who &#8211; as I shall explain &#8211; received a gift of &#163;500,000 from her sister, who had been put in funds by JJ through a loan in a similar sum. I accept that the rationale for adopting this arrangement was to enable his daughter&#8217;s investment to flow into F Ltd together with the tax reliefs available under the EIS scheme.    The husband was both a director and CEO of F Ltd. [Description of company.] Two subsidiary companies were set up as separate corporate entities.  For the next few months the husband was commuting to the United States on a regular basis in an attempt to inject commercial value into this enterprise.

It appears that it did not trade, it had no assets and its principal function lay in the tax efficiency which it delivered. Through this structure the husband was able to draw a tax-free income. This arrangement was beneficial to both parties since it was out of those untaxed earnings that he was providing voluntary financial support to the wife in the sum of some &#163;84,000 per annum.

This needs some explanation and formed a significant part of the forensic trawl which was undertaken over several days during the course of this hearing.  The returns generated by the realisation of this investment were, as I find, central to the arrangements which were put in place at the time to provide two things. The first was the means by which the husband was intending, in part, to ensure the financial support which the wife was to receive during her period of residency in Monaco. The second was the provision of a platform of financial liquidity which would give him access to the capital he needed to begin the process of re-establishing his financial fortunes free from the restrictions which his English bankruptcy might otherwise bring. Whilst the husband has been anxious to stress during this period that everything was properly disclosed at the time to his trustee in bankruptcy, which I accept in terms of his legal entitlement to assets, this court is engaged on a different exercise which involves a consideration of the underlying reality of beneficial entitlement.

He had made a personal investment of some &#163;500,000 and secured a further &#163;2.5 million as a line of credit from Lloyds Bank. He was both chairman and a shareholder when, in 2010, he transferred all his shares (then just less than a 30% stake) to the wife for a nominal consideration. The company had been very successful in its trading activities. However, at the time of the transfer the company&#8217;s borrowings of some &#163;6 million exceeded the then share valuation by some 100%. By this means he was able to make the inter-spousal transfer on the basis of a nominal cost to the wife. At the same time, the husband and wife entered into a formal agreement with HSBC whereby the value of the future income stream from Z Ltd would be assigned to the Bank and charged as security for its willingness to advance to the wife a sum of &#163;6 million plus. For obvious reasons given his impending bankruptcy, the loan was taken in the wife&#8217;s sole name. </p>

Whilst the husband had committed personal funds of &#163;6 million, he had been anxious at the time to increase his equity stake in the business. That opportunity was provided by CR&#8217;s willingness to lend the husband &#163;6 million in addition to his own investment in the business in a similar sum. HSBC agreed to provide funds to repay that overdue loan to CR in return for an assignment of, and charge over, the sale proceeds of the Z Ltd shares. In the context of the bankruptcy, HMRC accepted that the sale of the shares was to the wife at a nominal consideration despite the value of the charge secured on the sale proceeds.   </p>

For reasons I have explained, I am entirely satisfied that, in accordance with their separation agreement (with which I deal below) he derived a very significant benefit from those funds.  In essence, a sum of &#163;1 million was made available to him as effective &#8216;working capital&#8217; for his investments on the futures market. He lost that sum and I am satisfied that the wife derived no benefit from that lost investment although she continued to receive the element of deferred consideration from the sale of the shares which supported, in part, her income needs in Monaco.

It was a clear condition precedent of the proposed agreement that if she did not receive the property unencumbered by debt within five years, the agreement was to have no further effect or consequence and she would be released from its terms. Given that the property has since been sold because of the husband&#8217;s inability to transfer the property &#8216;debt free&#8217;, it follows, and is accepted by both parties, that the remaining provisions have no traction on the outcome of these proceedings and the formal application which the wife now makes for financial remedy orders. </p>

She was to retain the income stream of &#163;200,000 per annum over five years from the Z Ltd deferred consideration. That entitlement was to continue regardless of whether or not she had any other forms of financial support which was external to the agreement between them. She was to receive a sum of &#8364;120,000 for furnishing out her new rented flat in Monaco. The husband offered to maintain the interest payments to the Bank in respect of the loan they had taken out to purchase the additional land next to the main property the French Property. That undertaking was to subsist for a maximum of five years. In the event that this land was sold, the wife would retain the net proceeds of sale.   </p>

Whilst the terms of this particular aspect of the proposal are not entirely clear, it seems that the wife was to pass on to the husband 90% of any such receipts until from her 10% entitlement she had been paid a total of &#8364;350,000. Thereafter, her entitlement to any remaining receipts was to reduce by a margin of 3% to 7% (leaving 93% of the benefit of any such receipts in the husband&#8217;s hands) up to a further &#8364;350,000 (i.e. a total of &#8364;700,000 in the wife&#8217;s hands).

These would be notionally fixed at &#8364;350,000 per annum to mirror the share which she was to retain from receipts flowing in from dividends, capital of tax free income.

I have no doubt at all that the wife&#8217;s move offshore to Monaco earlier in that year together with the financial infrastructure he was proposing in that agreement were designed to ensure that, in the event of bankruptcy, the family&#8217;s assets (which he saw primarily as &#8220;his&#8221; in terms of the value in the companies and other financial structures) would be preserved from his unsecured creditors in that bankruptcy. The wife would benefit because she would continue to be supported throughout the five-year period which had been proposed. It was no doubt the husband&#8217;s hope (and probably his intention) that he would be able to reverse his financial fortunes during that period, pay off the mortgage on the French Property and deliver on his promise to sign it over to the wife unencumbered. In the meantime, they would both be living on the income generated by the Z Ltd deferred consideration and he would be free to deal with all the companies (the ownership of which he was to retain) confident in the knowledge that corporate assets would not be attacked by his creditors and/or the trustee in bankruptcy. He would be free to rearrange internal structures as and when needed through the blank share transfer forms which the wife was to sign. The day to day operation of the company books and accounts would be left to either PS or SA who would continue to be guided by him as to how funds were to be applied albeit through the churn of funds coming into and going out of the wife&#8217;s personal accounts with Bank S in Monaco. </p>

It reflects more or less what was going on on the ground in terms of how the companies were being operated and the means by which funds were being channelled through the wife&#8217;s designated Monegasque account.  Given the currency of his bankruptcy at that point in time, there may well have been a very good reason why he did not wish to disclose the precise contents of that document to his solicitor but I cannot and do not speculate further on that. In contrast, it was obviously important that his executor was aware of the arrangements which were then being proposed in the event either one of the parties should predecease the other and which the wife, by signing, had apparently accepted.  I am satisfied that there was indeed a meeting with HR in the afternoon after their lunch together and I am equally satisfied that he was made fully aware what those arrangements were.</p>

I am reinforced in my conclusions about the May 2012 email by a much more recent admission which the husband made during the first two days of this hearing. He had been cross-examining the wife on her general credibility.  For the purposes of trying to establish that she had not taken a particular flight with a well known international carrier, he produced in court copies of her online airline account showing her flight itinerary. Unbeknowst to him, she had but a few days before reported to the airline that her online account had been hacked and her email address for that account had been changed without her permission. He further produced in court copies of redacted emails written by an unknown party to the London branch of her Bank in Monaco seeking to ascertain that some missing credit card statements should be readily available to her as a customer of the bank notwithstanding her previous explanation that the Bank was unable to produce them.

Whilst no money changed hands, Mr Moodie said to the husband that he trusted he would be looked after for his services. During their exchanges the husband also asked if this individual could assist with the matter of the missing credit card statements and the Monaco Bank&#8217;s ability to produce them. The husband maintains that he gave to him individual details of the wife&#8217;s bank but not her name. The emails which were produced as a result of these exchanges show that this individual subsequently posed as a customer and made contact with the London manager of the wife&#8217;s Bank in Monaco.</p>

I do not accept that proposition. In my judgment it reveals the lengths to which this husband is prepared to go in order to achieve the ends he seeks to put in place. I am left in no doubt that all of the arrangements which were put in place in the months leading up to his bankruptcy and thereafter were intended to enable him to carry on with his business and commercial activities with minimal disruption.  That he did so with the intention of trying to restore some financial traction in respect of their future going forward I do not doubt but his covert tactics over this period and the years which followed have placed very significant obstacles in the path of the wife&#8217;s legal team in their efforts to establish what, if anything, remains available in the context of the current proceedings.</p>

Prior to the financial year 2012/2013 I have nothing more than a composite set of figures for November 2007 (being the date of its incorporation) to 31 December 2012. That balance sheet records a significant loss from a figure of just under HK$4 million to minus HK$25,181. The most recent set of accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016 show that the company was not generating any revenue and was carrying a loss of some HK$11,760 despite long term investments of just under HK$9.5 million.</p>

There is no reflection of the loan which was paid by the husband to C Ltd in 2008 for what he maintains was a failed investment in China. Nothing has been produced by BB in the context of these proceedings to support the existence of that loss which the husband explains in part as some form of computer crash.  Further, there is no record in the accounts of some &#163;882,000 flowing from C Ltd to F Ltd between May 2011 March 2012 which included the HH and NM investments of &#163;200,000 each.</p>

These have been withheld by BB on the grounds of third party confidentiality. Whilst this may well be a legitimate basis for asserting such confidentiality where it exists, BB&#8217;s absence from these proceedings as a witness has left the wife&#8217;s and the court&#8217;s hands tied. In stark contrast to that position is the apparent ability of the husband to engage BB by telephone or email whenever he requires from his friend some written confirmation of a position or information about a point in issue. The husband relayed to me at a late stage of the hearing BB&#8217;s continuing unwillingness to assist the court even when I offered to have video conferencing facilities made available between the court and Hong Kong so as to enable him to give his evidence without the inconvenience of travelling to this jurisdiction. The husband acknowledges the long-standing and close nature of their personal relationship. He invited BB to attend the wedding of his daughter in London but a few months ago. He accepts and maintains that there has been a fracture in that relationship as a result of BB having had to become involved in his divorce proceedings over the last two years but also speaks of a rapprochement since he reached out to his friend at the end of last year.</p>

To understand the context, I need to turn to a proposal which the wife made to the husband in October 2016 in terms of a final resolution of their financial affairs. The wife has accepted that she was co-operating with the husband to the extent that she wanted to give him some time to restore his financial position in the years which post-dated his discharge from bankruptcy in 2012.  He had been maintaining her financially throughout that period as I have described earlier in this judgment. After four years of treading water in this manner, it appears that she instigated a meeting between them in London in an attempt to resolve matters. They met initially at the home of her close friend, SD. There followed a series of telephone conversations during which the husband promised to speak to his accountant, WG, in order to come up with a proposal which would provide her with a measure of financial security.  He once again refused to reduce any such proposal to written form and accordingly they arranged to meet once again in London at the home of another mutual friend Ms T. That meeting took place on 26 September 2016. The wife says that he came to that meeting with nothing in terms of any clear proposals as to the way forward.</p>

I know not whether he gave the husband any specific advice about the transaction or whether this was a scheme devised by the husband.  It is simply not credible in my judgment that there was no discussion at all between them during their meeting on 17 November when these arrangements were put in place and that nothing was said about the reasons for the patriation of English assets to an offshore entity. WG himself had made a direct &#8216;investment&#8217; of just under &#163;53,000 in C Ltd via a Mauritian entity in May 2013, some eighteen months earlier. The husband had personally guaranteed that loan/investment (whatever it was in reality) and I have no doubt that he did so on the husband&#8217;s recommendations about the substantial potential to be realised in F Ltd which was then under his personal stewardship as a director and CEO of the company. I make it clear that I am not making any specific findings of collusion between WG; I accept that the instructions came from the husband.

There may have been other practical benefits for the husband which flowed from this arrangement (such as his ability to reduce his own liability to BB).

Any such surpluses would be offset against his principal debt of &#163;650,000. It became apparent during the course of cross-examination that the husband was also in receipt of bonuses from time to time from F Ltd and these fell into the debt repayment programme he had agreed with BB. It hardly needs me to say that without the attendance of BB at this trial and in the absence of any written evidence of these arrangements, there is little, if any, reliable evidence to feed into a forensic analysis apart from the husband&#8217;s sayso. It is the husband&#8217;s case that when he lost his job and found himself without an income from F Ltd, BB simply transferred the shares in S Ltd back to him because it was serving no further useful purpose. He accepts that a sum of just under &#163;300,000 was paid to BB during the period when he owned the S Ltd shares by way of a reduction in his debt.</p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.54in">In this context, I need to say something about the husband&#8217;s demeanour during the course of this trial. He has conducted the two week hearing without the assistance of lawyers since he says he does not have the means to pay for his own representation. I have been told that the estimate given by forensic accountants to the wife in respect of the costs of a full report tracing the various movements of funds and shares was in the region of &#163;30 - &#163;35,000. I am not surprised given the complexity of the analysis which had to be undertaken both before and after the evidence was heard. I have no doubt that the husband was exhausted by the process of assimilating the presentation of the case advanced </p>

The absence of a forensic report in advance of the hearing has inevitably made the task of the lawyers, the court and the husband much more demanding than it would otherwise have been but I was told that the wife had to borrow the costs of this trial and was only put in funds very recently. At the pre-trial review in December last year, I cautioned the parties to think carefully about the spiralling costs of this litigation in circumstances where the husband was continuing to maintain that there was nothing to salvage from the collapse of his fortunes. </p>

At others, and particularly when he was speaking of his fall from grace, I had the impression that much of his distress and the many long pauses from which he struggled to recover were played for my benefit. What I do accept is that for some considerable time, this husband has been living a fairly precarious &#8216;hand to mouth&#8217; existence. That much was confirmed by WG and I detected a genuine sense of embarrassment in the husband whilst he was asking questions of WG and NN, two of the individual friends and business associates to whom he owes money. His partner, with whom he shares a rented apartment, declined to appear as a witness at this hearing. I was told that she had family obligations and was spending time in Italy with her sister&#8217;s family. Apart from her absence from these proceedings in circumstances where I accept she was validly served with a witness summons, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that she is concealing funds on behalf of the husband and Miss Bangay does not suggest that she is. Is this all a contrived &#8216;front&#8217; erected by him for the purposes of this litigation as a defence to his wife&#8217;s financial claims? Are others, on his behalf or for his benefit, holding significant funds or assets which he will recover from their safe-keeping after this litigation comes to an end? </p>

In total they are owed just over &#8364;504,000 (some &#163;446,000) although they have previously agreed to accept a significantly discounted sum to clear the debt.

The smaller fund with James Hay has a residual value of &#163;135,452. This pension was retained by the husband following his discharge from bankruptcy. It had been worth some &#163;743,000 during the currency of this litigation but was reduced by &#163;543,474 as a result of two withdrawals which he made in order to pay back debt. He maintains that he was justified in reducing his liabilities in this way as the wife did not seek to preserve this asset through a freezing order. His other pension with Zurich Assurance was declared in his bankruptcy with a value of just over &#163;250,000. It now has a value of just over &#163;306,000. The husband maintains that it is entirely non-matrimonial having been built up prior to his marriage to the wife. This appears to be borne out by the disclosure accepted by his trustee in bankruptcy.  The five policies which make up the pension fund were taken out and funded between 1979 and 1991 almost a decade before the marriage. Whilst the husband sought to suggest during the course of his oral evidence that this fund might produce a retirement income of &#163;70,000 gross from the age of 70 in 2027, he accepts that this figure is completely inaccurate in terms of a likely return on fund value. </p>

The husband is about to travel to the Far East to spend some time in Vietnam where he hopes to regain his health and mental wellbeing. He told me that he is travelling on air miles and can live extremely cheaply in some form of retreat whilst he recovers.  I accept that, at the age of nearly 64, he is unlikely to find remunerative employment in any field in the financial or business sector which would pay him the sort of income he was earning as the CEO of F Ltd. He does not appear to have the means at the present time to make any effective contribution to the ongoing income needs of his former wife. The wife has not been in paid employment for many years and has no qualifications which enable her to enter the employment market and secure the sort of income which would make her self-sufficient in terms of her income needs going forwards.  She has for many years enjoyed a very high standard of living. Throughout the years of the marriage when the parties were living what they both accept to be a lavish lifestyle, they had very significant capital resources from the sale of the husband&#8217;s former business together with whatever flowed in from his business deals and spread-betting. Following their separation, he was able to maintain her to a reasonable, but reduced, standard because of the tax-free arrangements which he put in place and which survived his bankruptcy in 2011. I am satisfied that the ongoing generosity of her friends (who have been in a position to lend funds and subsidise her Monaco life through their many invitations and kindnesses) has to an extent preserved around this wife the trappings of a lifestyle she herself is quite unable to afford.

That opportunity is no longer open to her although the realisation that she is going to have to generate income from somewhere in the future has crystallised her thoughts around some sort of online business venture connected with the world of beauty or fitness.

I do not repeat those principles here but I have them well in mind. In particular, I accept that the court must not be led into some form of &#8216;knee-jerk reaction&#8217; which says that, simply because of evasiveness of the lack of a coherent narrative to a party&#8217;s disclosure, there is some vast sum salted away.

In particular, his forays into spread-betting (or speculating in the equity futures market) has resulted in a net loss of some &#163;3 million over and above the &#163;40 million which he accepts he lost earlier in the marriage.  He was then perhaps in a position to afford those losses without any discernible impact upon their living standard or lifestyle. Despite suffering ongoing losses over the years of their separation and after his bankruptcy, and until about 2016/2017, the husband continued to risk significant funds in this way at a time when he knew, or ought to have known, that his financial position was becoming increasingly precarious. It is not without significance that the pension drawdown which was not disclosed to the wife at the time was used to repay a debt to NN. That debt had been incurred in connection with his spread betting activities. I accept that the husband was not using these funds to spend on his lifestyle or to fund discretionary expenditure at an unrealistic rate. I bear in mind that he was supporting the wife financially throughout albeit at a reduced rate in the latter stages of their separation. Nonetheless, he used the offshore structure which he set up and the BI monies in a manner which gave rise to a significant loss and that loss cannot, in part, be laid at the feet of this wife. </p>

That case concerned a husband whose financial infrastructure was underpinned by the existence of very substantial assets which were not available to him when the case was decided. He claimed to be &#8220;at the economic nadir&#8221; of his finances albeit it that he had not disposed of any of the &#8220;building blocks of his commercial empire&#8221;.  Everything remained in fact in terms of his pre-existing capital base and his evidence to the court was that he was confident his financial endeavours would come to fruition in the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, Mostyn J took the view that it was unrealistic to assess the wife&#8217;s needs award on the basis of a snapshot of the finances as at the date of hearing. In that case, neither party was asking the court to adjourn the wife&#8217;s claims and the judge proceeded to assess them on the basis that the husband was given time to pay (some two years) on the basis of his liberty to apply for an extension of time should his fortunes not revive as forecasted. The crucial finding which informed the judge&#8217;s approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Haskell </span>is set out in paragraph 57 of his Lordship&#8217;s award in these terms: </p>

He may not see the return of the sort of wealth which will enable him to enjoy in retirement the lifestyle he once took for granted in earlier years but I am satisfied that there is a reasonable probability that he may entrench sufficiently to provide both himself and his former wife with a modest home and the means to sustain a reasonable standard of living. </p>

I bear well in mind that the loans she has secured from friends might be seen to be soft in the sense that they will only be recovered from assets she recovers in these proceedings. SD has accepted that in clear terms. I know not whether these friends will seek to enforce their loans in the event that any sums recovered will need to be applied in the first instance to meeting her immediate housing and income needs.  However, what has been singularly lacking in this case is a clear and coherent narrative to support the many hundreds of pages of paper disclosure which have been provided by the husband and others to date. It is true that the wife has not succeeded at this juncture in identifying the existence of assets or the means to pay which would justify a defined lump sum award at this stage but I am satisfied that the husband&#8217;s litigation misconduct which I have outlined above requires reflection in a costs award in her favour. I bear in mind that it has been his case for some time now that there is no current value in the companies and no individual has been &#8220;warehousing&#8221; funds on his behalf such as to enable him to draw on those funds to meet a capital award.

In circumstances where she has been able to secure litigation funding from alternative non-commercial sources where at least one of those lenders accepts the possibility, if not the likelihood, of non-recovery, I regard a liability for just over half of the wife&#8217;s costs as properly reflecting the court&#8217;s disapproval of the husband&#8217;s conduct. Secondly, I take into account the volume of disclosure which he has provided in the latter stages of this litigation and the consistent explanation he has given in relation to his 50% interest in F Ltd (were any value to materialise). For these reasons, and in the context of the generous discretion I am given in relation to costs, I am prepared to limit his exposure to 60% of the total costs incurred by the wife which I am told amount to just under &#163;545,000. In order to avoid a lengthy and expensive assessment process in which the husband may well be a reluctant participant, and in the light of the allowance I have already made for his benefit, I propose to assess his contribution to those costs in the sum of &#163;327,000. These costs will inevitably attract interest for so long as they remain unpaid and I can only encourage both these parties to reflect carefully on where they stand in the light of my award. The adjournment of the wife&#8217;s capital claims in the unusual circumstances of this case does not preclude the parties from further negotiations at any stage in the future. I can only hope that the bruising and painful experience which this litigation has been for them both will lead to sensible discussions at the earliest opportunity whatever trajectory the recovery process takes in relation to the husband&#8217;s future efforts. </p>

A number of detailed directions were made in relation to third party and other disclosure.  In relation to the wife&#8217;s LSPO application, he gave further directions providing for the inspection of the wine collection by the prospective purchaser.  The order for sale of the wine was confirmed.  In addition to confirming the July order for the payment of &#163;90,500 to the wife, he increased the reach of the LSPO by awarding the wife a further &#163;60,000 which he found she required in order to cover the costs of the forthcoming FDR hearing.

The FDR in March 2019 was unsuccessful in resolving the issues.  As I have outlined above, the wife was subsequently obliged to borrow from friends to put her solicitors in funds to enable the final hearing before me to proceed to its conclusion.  As I have found, there were no further liquid assets which could be realised to meet these costs. </p>
