	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an application made on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian in which I am invited to recuse myself from further hearing this matter which concerns the welfare of three children, &#8216;J&#8217; (born [DOB] 05), &#8216;L&#8217; (born [DOB] 06) and &#8216;LS&#8217; (born [DOB] 10).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the opening of today&#8217;s hearing at 10.30am Miss Baker, who appears on behalf of the guardian, invited me to deal simply with the directions arising in the proceedings which were almost all agreed. I asked whether she had any other application to make to which she replied that she did not. Time was sought and granted to the parties to discuss the directions being sought.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At about 12.10pm Miss Baker informed me that she had taken instructions as to whether she should make any further application, concerning my recusal, and that she would make her decision in consultation with the guardian and her instructing solicitor on that question after the hearing. I indicated that that would not be an appropriate way to proceed and that if she did not then know whether she was to make the application she should have further time to take specific instructions. Thus, at 2.15pm, the parties having largely agreed the directions for which they would seek my approval, Miss Baker first informed the court that she wished to make an application, namely, that I might consider recusing myself from further hearing these proceedings.</p>

	  <num>4.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Baker explained that the basis of her application was in light of an exchange which I had had with her instructing solicitor, Miss Tierney at the previous directions hearing on 8 December 2010. That is, the exchange in question, it was submitted, might lead to the perception of bias on my part in that I might be seen not to accept that which the child may be reported as having said to the guardian in these proceedings hereafter. That is, as I understood the submission, that I might be perceived as having been biased against the guardian, Miss Cross, in that I might not accept what she reported as having been said by the children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The legal question is whether in light of the relevant circumstances which have a bearing on the suggestion of bias as explained or asserted by Miss Baker those circumstances would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility that the judge, that is, me, was biased against the guardian or, presumably, the children also.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That question necessarily requires the Court first to ascertain the circumstances which have a bearing on the suggestion that the judge was biased.  The Court must then ask whether those circumstances would lead a fair-minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility that the judge was biased.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Baker has put the basis of the application thus: that the Children&#8217;s Guardian, Miss Cross, in her initial written report to the Court dated 3 December 2010, at paragraphs 48 and 49, indicated that she had received a material disclosure from the eldest child, &#8216;J&#8217;, in response to her questions (only): Question, &#8220;Do you know &#8216;A&#8217;?&#8221; (meaning &#8216;AH&#8217;).  Answer (at paragraph 49), &#8220;Yes, he hurts me.&#8221;  Question, &#8220;How does he hurt you, &#8216;J&#8217;?&#8221;  Answer, &#8220;He picks me up and it does just hurt.&#8221;  Question, &#8220;Can you show me how it does hurt?&#8221;  The report states, &#8220;&#8216;J&#8217; looked very seriously down the front of himself and then put his hand down the side of his trousers and pointed.&#8221;  Question, &#8220;Where is &#8216;A&#8217;?&#8221;  Answer, &#8220;He is not there any more.  They are at the beach.  He is not ever allowed at the beach any more.&#8221; </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_8">
	  <num>8.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Baker explained that I had then asked questions of Miss Tierney about that disclosure as to whether or not Miss Cross had sought any further detail from &#8216;J&#8217; before setting in motion the investigations which were activated by her. </p>

	</paragraph>
	<paragraph eId="para_9">
	  <num>9.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Baker developed her submissions on behalf of the Children&#8217;s Guardian on the basis that the Children&#8217;s Guardian&#8217;s primary duty is to the child and the paramountcy of the child&#8217;s welfare and that having had such disclosure made to her she considered that she had no discretion other than formally to report it and to invoke the Child Protection Procedures which resulted in an investigation by social workers and the police. In consequence &#8216;AH&#8217; was arrested, formally interviewed and subsequently bailed.  I was informed that there was no disclosure by &#8216;J&#8217; to the police and that no further action has been taken. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_10">
	  <num>10.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Baker expressed the concern held by the Children&#8217;s Guardian that during my exchange with Miss Tierney I had wrongly put to her questions to the effect that the Children&#8217;s Guardian did have a discretion to ask questions to ascertain whether there was in fact any disclosure which did require action. I explained to Miss Baker, as I had to Miss Tierney, that I wished to know what in fact was the gravamen of the allegation which was derived from that short discussion in her report and whether any other detail had been sought at the time. </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_11">
	  <num>11.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I wished to know because it did not appear in the report, for example, whether there was a suggestion of some form of sexual abuse. I had dealt with this suggestion (that &#8216;AH&#8217; had sexually abused &#8216;J&#8217; according to the local authority&#8217;s Schedule in these proceedings) at the hearing before me in these proceedings on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2010 and which was dealt with in my judgment of that date.  I also wished to know what the position was thereafter as between &#8216;J&#8217; and &#8216;AH&#8217;.  For example, whether &#8216;AH&#8217; was suddenly prevented from having contact with, for example, &#8216;J&#8217; and vice versa given the fact that he would regularly take &#8216;J&#8217; to/from school.  These were legitimate questions put by a judge whose duty also concerns the paramountcy of the welfare of the children.  I wished to know whether there was more detail about the disclosure and report beyond that shown in the few questions and answers in the report, and if not, why not.</p>

	<paragraph eId="para_12">
	  <num>12.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the schedule of findings of fact, originally submitted by the local authority there was an allegation that the children had suffered significant harm by reason of sexual abuse perpetrated by &#8216;AH&#8217;.  For the reasons given in my earlier judgment I explained why that bald assertion was unwarranted on the evidence.  The evidence was confined to two paragraphs in the initial statement of the allocated social worker who had been allocated to this case since early 2008.  That evidence as such was limited to an unidentified assertion by someone that &#8216;AH&#8217; had an indecent photograph of &#8216;J&#8217; on his mobile phone, an assertion which was specifically denied by the mother. That suggestion was made in October 2008.  In the subsequent paragraph of the initial statement it was explained why the social workers, whose paramount duty also concerned the welfare of the children, and not least in this case &#8216;J&#8217;, had determined, no doubt with all of the available information before them, by no later than February 2009, that &#8216;J&#8217; could appropriately and safely be taken to and collected from his school, alone by &#8216;AH&#8217;.  The local authority subsequently amended the schedule and removed the allegation of harm caused by alleged sexual abuse.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That is the background and circumstances which gave rise to my questions. I recall Miss Tierney being in difficulty in answering those questions. She sought instructions from Miss Cross behind her. It transpired that she was unable to provide any further information after taking instructions beyond those in the report which I have recited.  </p>

	  <num>14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Those are the circumstances in which I indicated that whilst those who engage in this work have difficult tasks to perform and there is a limit to the information which should be sought from the child, nevertheless there exists a discretion to determine what questions are put and a discretion which had to be exercised also in determining whether there was anything of real substance or disclosure which triggered the need for further steps (such as invoking the Child Protection Procedure, reporting to the police and all that which therafter necessarily follows, including, for example, the arrest of a person,  interview, bail and so on).  </p>

	<paragraph eId="para_15">
	  <num>15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Tierney had raised with me the existence or not of any discretion and submitted on behalf of Miss Cross that she, Miss Cross, had no option but to report what she had heard and set the protection procedures in motion.  I do recall indicating that all I had in mind was that in this difficult area there was a point at which there is a discretion, which must be right, to determine whether or not any further question is put or further fact sought from the child before deciding whether it is in fact necessary to set in motion the Child Protection Procedures.   </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Be that as it may, Miss Baker&#8217;s application is not directly based upon my questions put to Miss Cross through Miss Tierney concerning the adequacy of the information elicited by questions put to &#8216;J&#8217;. Rather, it is submitted by Miss Baker that, having regard to the nature of that exchange, it is suggested that there could be a perception of bias in the sense that I would not give weight to that which a child might hereafter (in these proceedings) be reported as having said to the Children&#8217;s Guardian in circumstances not yet known, but which might, for example, concern the ascertaining of the child&#8217;s wishes and feelings and which, it might be perceived by the fair- minded and informed observer, I would not somehow take into account or accept.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am bound to say that taking Miss Baker&#8217;s submissions in their most favourable light or at their highest there is no real basis to suggest bias against the guardian, or anyone, on my part.  From my questions put to Miss Tierney, even if they were taken by Miss Cross to be critical of her, it is not possible reasonably to conclude that any fair-minded and informed observer, not least a professional on behalf of whom the suggestion is made, that the Court was in some way biased, against the guardian or anyone.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It may well be that Miss Cross took offence at the nature of my questions. It is also true that for the reasons explained in the judgment I had not followed Miss Cross&#8217; original opinion and recommendation (expressed orally only) which was for the immediate removal of the children from the care of the mother. At that time the guardian had not seen the mother or the children or their home conditions. During my exchange with Miss Tierney Miss Cross had made a facial expression demonstrating dissent or disagreement with something I had said and I do recall informing Miss Tierney that Miss Cross&#8217;s expression was inappropriate.  It seems that Miss Cross also took offence at that rebuke. Incidentally, I stand by my response to such an expression made to a judge in court. If dissent or disagreement with the judge is appropriate or necessary then it should be articulated appropriately by the advocate and not otherwise by pulling a face in court.  </p>

It is true that when Miss Cross gave evidence without a report or any other documentary support at the hearing on 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October I did not prefer her evidence to that given by the allocated social worker, Miss Pinnock-Ouma but I gave my reasons and my reasons were based on the evidence before me. </p>

At the very least in those circumstances those representing the Children&#8217;s Guardian could make their submissions and indicate to the Court the correct approach in relation to Miss Cross&#8217; duties and ensure the correct approach is in fact understood and taken on board by the judge. However, to make good the suggestion of bias the guardian must go further and show that it is a real possibility that the fair-minded and informed observer would or might think that the judge, having made such an error in understanding as to the role of the guardian, in light of the exchange complained of was or would be biased against the guardian (and to the detriment of the children).</p>

On 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2010, essentially by agreement between the parties, directions were given and embodied in an order which provided for, amongst other matters, an interim report to be filed in relation to the parenting assessment of the mother, and her current partner, to be filed by 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> of February 2011. It was also ordered that (today) there shall be a re-consideration of the issue concerning the identity of the designated local authority.  This is an important matter on the facts of this case given the history, which I do not propose to reiterate, save to say that that history could be found in the judgment, if necessary, which I gave on the determination of this question on 8<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2010 and in my judgment of 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> October 2010. </p>

Mr. Payne arrived in court with the two social workers who travelled from Lancashire to find that the application could not properly proceed in light of the arrangement made by the guardian that the question be postponed to a later date and that the other parties had attended court on the basis that the issue would be put off to another date. </p>
