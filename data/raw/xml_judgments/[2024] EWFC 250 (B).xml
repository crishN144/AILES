Controlling behaviour is a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources for personal gain, and depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance, and escape, regulating their everyday behaviour. </span></p>

From early 2021 to August, F admits behaving in a way that is disinhibited towards M. Over a few months, there were two incidents of F being physically violent towards M, and a further two episodes of threats made with the ambition of manipulating a reconciliation. The cheese grater comment is one example of a humiliating comment, made to the parents&#8217; mutual friends, about a deeply personal experience. The admission of an affair is the first time which F has acknowledged something which haunted M for much of their relationship. </span></p>

They would have long telephone conversations in the evening, regularly more than an hour. They would spend the long summer holidays together at the family caravan in Wales. Crucially, M told me that F never sought to stop this. M told me that F&#8217;s means of control would be to tell the maternal grandmother that M was unavailable if she called on the phone and asked for her, but M was elsewhere. In fact, M told me that F paid not only for M&#8217;s phone bill to allow this communication, but for the maternal grandfather&#8217;s bill too. Against this context, I am simply not satisfied that F sought to control M&#8217;s interactions with her own family.

The limit on the calls being free was an hour; thus, for example, Denise could call Dave for 59 minutes and 59 seconds for free, but if the call went on for two seconds more, the whole call would be chargeable. If Denise put the phone down on 59 minutes and 59 seconds, and immediately re-dialled Dave&#8217;s number, this would count as a new call and would be free for the next 59 minutes 59 seconds.</span></p>

Again, there is divergence from M&#8217;s written and oral evidence. In oral evidence, M told me that she had her own money from working one day per week in her own account, a joint account where F was paid into and she had access to, and a credit card which F paid for. In her statement, M told me that there were times that she was left with &#8216;no money&#8217; when F was away. I am frankly unsure as to what more F could have done to ease the financial pressure on the family. F was working full time, in dangerous circumstances, to provide for M and the children. The fact that the credit card was regularly at its limit is evidence of the financial pressure which the family felt, and which F shouldered. I simply cannot decipher what about this situation M alleges is controlling. </span></p>

She told me that she felt &#8216;forced&#8217; to take out a loan by F to pay for the wedding. In M&#8217;s second statement, she outlines the financial pressure. She was critical of F for spending money on golf and tattoos when the family needed it. She told me that there were times when the family ran out of money. In her live evidence, M told me that F&#8217;s income was the family&#8217;s lifeline. M told me that the lump sum which F received was burned through by the family &#8211; for example they would buy takeaways at the weekend. For reasons I do not need to determine, the money ran out and the parents agreed to take out a loan. Although she said in her written evidence that she felt &#8216;forced&#8217; to take out the loan for the wedding, as I have set out in evidence, she explained that she very much wanted to get married, and that the couple had no other options. Although I understand that M &#8211; and indeed F &#8211; may have felt forced by the circumstances, having no money to do something they both wanted to do. But I unhesitatingly reject the suggestion that M was forced to take out this loan &#8211; her own evidence was that she wanted to do it, notwithstanding her reservations about debt.  It is a pressure felt by families up and down the country daily. I am unwilling to conflate, as M has, the state of being under financial pressure, and being financially controlled. </span></p>

She was asked to explain what she meant, and she told me that she felt vulnerable in the relationship because she would have sex with F, and he would then leave the room. She told me she felt pressure from her (correct) suspicions that F was engaging in extra marital sex elsewhere. She told me that although she was not &#8216;forced&#8217; in the conventional sense, this pressure made her feel forced. She said that F was persistent: &#8220;when someone is constantly pressuring you or asking for oral sex, I felt like I had no other option.&#8221; When asked if she had raised this worry with F, she told me that she had asked him not to do this once. M accepted that she had raised this allegation late in the day, and it was not covered in her first statement, nor in her conversations with the police, nor to Cafcass.

I also bear in mind that F sought sexual contact outside of the marriage because of his unhappiness. Such an attitude gives the court an invaluable snapshot into the sexual relationship.

In my view, she was feeling insecure as a direct result of F&#8217;s own behaviour. M told me in her evidence of the lengths she went to confirm her suspicions &#8211; meeting up with a mutual friend who has access to F&#8217;s Facebook messages, and ultimately looking at F&#8217;s Apple watch to find messages from another women. A significant number of M&#8217;s emotional energy went into worrying about the safety of her relationship.

She told me in oral evidence and in her statements that F pursued her on a country lane, but she did not tell the police immediately about this and when asked to describe what happened by police, made no mention of F pursuing her. F accepts that he saw the children, and pulled alongside M to blow kisses. I make this finding limited only to F&#8217;s account. M&#8217;s own account is so internally inconsistent that I cannot safely rely on it. There is no satisfactory explanation as to why these inconsistencies exist, and I formed the view that M had exaggerated a quite anodyne encounter, embellished with detail of dramatic U-terms and pursuits. Given M&#8217;s propensity in this case to embellish or to omit content which adds balance, I cannot prefer her evidence on this point. For all of F&#8217;s lack of insight, he has been usually candid about the events he was asked about. I find that </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">on 16 October 2021, F saw M and the children in a motorcar. He pulled alongside them and tried to attract their attention. He blew kisses to do this. </span></p>

As Ms Armitage noted in her submissions, the continuum of answers to the last question goes from intentional influence to the children&#8217;s rejection of F because of his behaviour, to a combination of all of the above. </span></p>

They will have felt the pressure from F&#8217;s disinhibited behaviour.

Unquestionably, as I have set out, I am of the view that the girls would have associated F with a regimental parenting style, and physical aggression.

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">In conversation recently with my husband B asked Grandad "what are you frightened of?" Keeping it light my husband replied "nothing frightens me." He then asked "what frightens you?" B said "Daddy. Daddy kidnapping me or killing me." My husband told B that "nothing will ever happen to you. You are safe here with us?"</span></p>

		<p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This seems to me to be a remarkable response by the grandfather. The proper response would have been to reassure B that her father would not kidnap or kill her, and that she was safe from that. Instead, such outlandish fears have gone unchallenged, and have added legitimacy I am sure in B&#8217;s mind to these fears. The maternal family&#8217;s view of F is unquestionably tainted by their experience of F&#8217;s behaviour at the point of separation, but also the fact that F stopped paying the mortgage and bills soon after separation. Much of the maternal grandmother&#8217;s evidence relates to her instinct or suspicions being confirmed, which I am afraid leads me to conclude that her own view of F is a negative one, and on her own evidence she does nothing to correct the children&#8217;s unreasonable fears about F. </span></p>

This is emblematic of a home environment that is at least disapproving of F. It is in my view the only explanation for B&#8217;s positive experience of contact with F and paternal grandmother being followed by B, in the presence of the headteacher, telling M that she was scared of F. Indeed, when asked by CG about her time with F and the grandmother, B&#8217;s only memory was a horse bucking on the farm. She has no apparent living memory of F in a negative way. Indeed, she told CG that she wanted to see F. </span></p>

Much of their present presentation is however, in my judgement, as a direct result of the negative influence which M and her family have caused or allowed to permeate.

They have experienced emotional harm because of M&#8217;s and the maternal family&#8217;s actions in allowing them to develop beliefs that F is a danger to them. Those unchallenged beliefs will be acutely distressing to hold and are harmful in that they are presenting as a barrier to the children wanting to see their father. M asks me to endorse the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">status quo</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> by making an Order for indirect contact, and in the process endorsing the children&#8217;s wishes. In my view, such an approach would further entrench the children&#8217;s negative feelings about their father, it would vindicate M&#8217;s false view of F that he is a danger to the children, and in the process the children would be irrevocably harmed.</span></p>

Their wishes are sadly rooted in their genuine experience of conflict but have since snowballed. There is now a significant disconnect between the children&#8217;s perception of F and his family, and the reality of the situation.</span></p>

This work needs the support of both parents, and their families. Only then can the children begin, in their own minds, to bridge the disconnect between the narrative they have been given by their mother and maternal family, and reality. Only then can a meaningful intervention take place to repair the broken relationship between F and his children. The picture, as I have found, is nuanced &#8211; there has been destructive behaviour on both sides. Both examples of bad behaviour in my view represent an egregious failure by the parents to put their children before themselves. </span></p>

I am cognisant of the corrosive effect of delay on the family thus far and in the future. I am likewise cognisant of the fact that the children have had enough. On one side of the balance comes the harm and emotional pressure from further delay. This is a family that is emotionally depleted. On the other hand, at present the children have a false belief system about F that has damaged their relationship with F. If allowed to continue, I have every confidence that this damage will become irreparable, given how entrenched M and her family are in their negative views of F. The effect on the children of such a scenario are life-long and will be destructive to their emotional wellbeing now and in the future. I simply cannot see that it is in the child&#8217;s best interests to risk such an outcome for the sake of bringing the proceedings to a close. </span></p>

That is sadly not possible. I asked Ms Hawkins to make enquiries as to F&#8217;s finances, and sadly he cannot foot the bill. M is impecunious and in receipt of public funding. CG legal aid certificate would cover only assessment, but not fund any intervention because of the assessment, if that was needed. It was suggested that I should give some thought to a further psychological assessment. I do not see that this is a necessity. CG in this case has a clear view of what is required in this case, and my findings do not change that. My findings are simply the narrative basis for the work as identified. </span></p>

It will be obvious by now that I do not at present believe that she could do this, although I believe that she wants to. M needs assistance in moving forward in a way that is sensitive to the findings of domestic abuse, and her own experiences. Likewise, F told me in evidence that if the children continued to shun him, he would &#8220;most likely give up.&#8221; This would be a devastating consequence for the children. </span></p>

As an intervention it would assist the children in understanding their life story, and assist the parents in beginning to find ways to co-parent in the children&#8217;s best interests. It is not by any means a perfect solution, but frankly it is the only show in town. I am not prepared to let the perfect be the enemy of the good, when I consider the harmful alternatives that I have available. </span></p>
