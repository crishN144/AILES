The boat in which the mother and children were travelling was intercepted by UK Border Force, and she and the children were taken to the asylum processing centre in Manston, Kent.  For some weeks prior to her channel crossing, the mother had been on the move with the children across Europe from Germany.  Their journey was undertaken without the knowledge or consent of the children&#8217;s father; he remains in Germany.</span></p>

The mother indicated her opposition to that application, asserting (among other arguments) that the father did not possess &#8216;rights of custody&#8217; (as a required pre-condition for a claim under the 1980 Hague Convention) in Germany.  For reasons which I more fully discuss at &#167;31 below, the father has now chosen not to pursue this application at the final hearing and I have given leave for him to withdraw it. He has instead pursued his later-issued application (30 November 2023) for the children&#8217;s return to Germany under the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction.</span></p>

The mother has issued an application for judicial review of that decision, which is now at an early stage of its process.  I address the issues relevant to this in a little more detail at &#167;34 below.  The mother is living in temporary accommodation, at an address not known to the father, with the children. </span></p>

For completeness, I should make clear that the children had originally been joined as parties to the proceedings by Poole J on 27 September 2023 at a time when the mother&#8217;s asylum claim was unresolved.  Their joinder at that stage had been properly directed in accordance with paragraph 9 of Appendix 2 of the Practice Guidance Case Management and Mediation of International Child Abduction Proceedings of March 2023, (&#8220;the President&#8217;s Practice Guidance: March 2023&#8221;).  </span></p>

In considering their welfare, I have had regard &#8211; as far as it is possible to discern these factors on the papers &#8211; to their ascertainable wishes and feelings, their physical, emotional and educational needs, and the relative capabilities of the adults around them to meet those needs. I have had regard to the effect of change on them, and their own characteristics and background, including their ethnicity, culture and religion.  In this case, I have of course paid close attention to the harm which they have suffered, or are at risk of suffering in the future: see generally in this regard <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/1/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> (&#8216;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40" uk:canonical="1989 c. 40" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1989</ref>&#8217;).

She further states that by the time the marriage was allegedly registered in Iran (2019), she and the father had converted to Christianity and had been baptised in that faith in Germany.  The mother nonetheless accepts that she was to some extent complicit in the lie to the German authorities about the parties&#8217; status, albeit (she says) that her conduct must be seen in the context of her coercive relationship with the father (see &#167;21 below).</span></p>

Y&#8217;s reaction to discussion of her father (observed by the Family Court Adviser) lends some credence to the mother&#8217;s account that her daughter had indeed been exposed to the abuse; it was the Family Court Adviser&#8217;s view that &#8220;[Y] would have been anxious for much of the time&#8221; while in the care of her mother and father.  There can be little doubt that the trauma of life in what appears to have been an abusive household would have been materially exacerbated for Y (as for the mother) by the experiences of the long, difficult, and extremely dangerous journey from Germany to England over a number of months in 2023, culminating in the perilous cross-channel voyage.

She has little, if any, support in Germany; she has little, if any, support in England.  She speaks only rudimentary German and very little English. She has relinquished her accommodation in Germany, and were she to return there it appears that she would be allocated emergency accommodation at best; she has no secure accommodation in England and faces a probable further move in this country.  It is common ground that the family lived a financially modest life while they were all in Germany; the father&#8217;s proposal for financial support in the event that the mother returns contemplates much reduced provision for the children from him.  It is apparent that in England the mother is currently financially in a similar (albeit marginally worse) situation than when she was living in Germany in 2023.  The Family Court Adviser referred to the mother as somewhat &#8216;isolated&#8217; currently in this country; the father himself reported in 2020 and again in 2022 that the mother was &#8216;isolated&#8217; while living in Germany &#8211; he told the YWO that the mother&#8217;s social isolation in Germany &#8220;was putting a strain on her psyche&#8221; and causing her &#8220;stress&#8221;.</span></p>

The mother points to the apparently surprising observation of the YWO in early 2023 (in the context of counselling sessions in Germany) that &#8220;[the mother] always emphasised that she was very worried about her children. From our perspective, this cannot be fully understood&#8221; (cited in the Family Court Adviser&#8217;s report). While it is clear that on at least two occasions the police investigated the mother&#8217;s allegations of abuse, she felt that the police took no effective steps to protect her and the children, simply excluding the father from the home on each occasion for ten days.   Her lack of confidence in the ability or willingness of the authorities in Germany to protect her and the children from a repeat of the abuse she had earlier suffered would, in my judgment, materially impact on her personal emotional well-being and on her capabilities as a mother should she return.  </span></p>

The mother and children have accommodation in this country albeit it is temporary; were they to return to Germany they would be not be returning to much that would be familiar and certainly would not be returning to their former &#8216;home&#8217;.  The mother is reported to have been able to access various forms of support from the agencies in the area where she and the children are currently living.

Y&#8217;s presentation, when mimicking acts of domestic abuse in response to her father&#8217;s name being raised in conversation, appears to me to reflect strong negative associations with him in her mind.  The Family Court Adviser was circumspect about the re-introduction of contact between the father and the children at this stage (&#8220;there should be no direct spending time arrangements implemented between the children and their father until a welfare and risk assessment are undertaken&#8221;), and advised that only supervised contact could be considered in any event.</span></p>

I am concerned that this is a manifestation of her trauma and/or distress, for which she could or should receive some help.  I am aware that Y was being assessed in Germany by a paediatric developmental consultant, but there is no evidence that a re-referral could be any more quickly reinstated for examination of this issue in Germany than a referral in this country.  I have a concern that in returning Y to Germany, to an environment which was for present purposes accepted to have been abusive, and in the care of a mother whose emotional state would I am sure be exceedingly fragile, this may in itself compound the evident traumas experienced by Y.</span></p>

That said, the areas in which there remain differences between the parents are not insignificant.  The mother is I find genuinely fearful of the risk of prosecution; I am satisfied that the father has taken the steps available to him to withdraw the criminal complaint, but this may well do little to assuage the mother&#8217;s anxiety that she will not face criminal penalty and will play upon her mind if she returns, adding to her already high levels of anxiety.  It seems likely that the father&#8217;s meagre financial support for the children will impact directly on the mother&#8217;s ability to meet their physical needs; a return to Germany is likely to lead to several moves of emergency and temporary home for the children.  Moreover, and generally, I harbour doubts about the father&#8217;s good faith in offering these measures as a means to secure the children&#8217;s return; while protective orders can of course be made here (which would be effective temporarily in Germany) under the 1996 Hague Convention, it is a source of considerable concern to me that the father appears, even as recently as last week, to be pursuing a wholly false claim in the Iranian court that the parties were indeed married in that country in April 2014.  I am troubled that he is doing so in order to attempt to secure some legal advantage over the mother (rights of custody or otherwise) in Germany.</span></p>

But there are clear mechanisms under the 1996 Hague Convention for the proceedings to be transferred to this country in the event that the German Court considers that this court is &#8220;better placed&#8221; (Article 8 or 9 ibid.) to deal with them.  It seems likely that the mother would have linguistic and practical difficulties in pursuing or defending child arrangements applications in the German court; in this country she would have the benefit of continuity of legal representation.  While I am unclear as to the availability of public funds for family litigation in Germany, I am confident that the father would also have the benefit of non-means, non-merit tested legal aid to pursue an application for contact with his children under Article 21 of the 1996 Hague Convention in this country.
