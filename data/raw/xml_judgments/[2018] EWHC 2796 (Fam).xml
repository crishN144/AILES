On 1 December the local authority made an application for an emergency protection order which was granted.  It also applied for care orders in respect of both children and the local authority was granted  interim care orders on 4 December last year.  The children have remained in the care of the local authority since November.</p>

The children&#8217;s guardian supports the local authority&#8217;s application and the care plan for the children.   The mother opposes the same and seeks the return of the children to her sole care.  The father, having been arrested, as I shall describe in a moment, he has absconded.  His whereabouts are unknown and he has played no part in these proceedings.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">The father is an Afghanistani national, the mother is Latvian and speaks Russian with some limited English.  She has been assisted ably, if I may say so, through these proceedings by a Russian interpreter.  In about 2006 the parents met in London.  In February 2009 Child A was born.  In 2010 the father sustained serious injuries in an attack which left him disabled and a wheelchair user.  On 4 June 2011 the parties married and later that month Child B was born.  In 2012 the father was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a violent disorder offence.  In 2013 the family became known to the Local Authority A Children&#8217;s Services.  In November of that year Local Authority A completed a children and family assessment.  There were concerns about Child A&#8217;s poor behaviour and attendance record at school but no further action was taken.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">In late 2016 and/or early 2017 the Local Authority B Children&#8217;s Services became involved with the family.  Child A had not been attending school for some period of time and it was believed that the family were homeless.  In February 2017 the NSPCC made a referral to Local Authority B in respect of alleged physical abuse and/or neglect of the children.  On 26 October last year as a result of a joint investigation by the Home Office and the National Crime Agency into people trafficking into the United Kingdom the mother and father were arrested and their mobile phones were seized.  An examination of the father&#8217;s phone revealed that there were five videos of indecent images of sexual activity with children.  Four of those videos related to a man, confirmed to be the father,  having sexual intercourse with a twelve year old girl.   These were first generation images meaning that they were filmed on the father&#8217;s mobile device.  There was one video of a young boy around eight years of age being masturbated by a woman.  </p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">On 22 November last year the father, in the presence of the mother, showed the social worker Mr W the video of the eight-year-old boy being sexually abused.  It was shown so as to demonstrate, it was said, that the child was not Child A.  Upon being received into local authority care, the foster carer noted that both children exhibited sexualised behaviour.  On 27 November Child A told his foster carer that he had been sexually touched by a man when he was six or seven years old.  He said he told his grandmother, the maternal grandmother, who told him not to speak about it or to tell anyone else.  On 29 November the Home Office advised the local authority that there was credible intelligence that the mother and father planned to leave the United Kingdom as soon as possible with the children.  The following day, the father requested of his GP three months&#8217; medication telling him that he was planning to take a holiday for three months from 5 December.  The GP referred that request to the local authority.  </p>

Since then, his whereabouts have been and remain unknown although he has either directly or through third parties sought to make contact with the mother.  On 6 December when speaking to the social worker, Mr W, the mother confirmed that the grandmother had told her of Child A&#8217;s allegations of sexual abuse and she confirmed that nothing was done and no report was made.  On 5 February this year the then social worker, Ms Z, spoke to the mother about the videos.  She was so disturbed by the mother&#8217;s reaction, as I shall elaborate in a moment, that she gave the mother time to reflect and arranged a further meeting on 23 February 2018.  </p>

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;One highly important aspect of the <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span> decision, and indeed the approach to lies generally in the criminal jurisdiction, needs to be borne fully in mind by family judges.  It is this: in the criminal jurisdiction the &#8216;lie&#8217; is never taken, of itself, as direct proof of guilt.  As is plain from the passage quoted from Lord Lane's judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Lucas</span>, where the relevant conditions are satisfied the lie is &#8216;capable of amounting to a corroboration.&#8217;  In recent times the point has been most clearly made in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Middleton </span>[2001] Crim.L.R. 251.  &#8216;In my view there should be no distinction between the approach taken by the criminal court on the issue of lies to that adopted in the family court.  Judges should, therefore, take care to ensure that they do not rely upon a conclusion that an individual has lied on a material issue as direct proof of guilt&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;It is my opinion that both children presented with evidence of significant disorder attachment development.  There is evidence of heightened anxiety in their narrative about each of their parents.  Both children have made allegations of physical abuse against Mr J and they have repeated those allegations to me.  There have also been concerns that the children experienced physical neglect and possible emotional abuse and neglect in the care of their parents.  I have other concerns about Child A&#8217;s presentation.  There is some evidence of neuro developmental issues, in particular, social communication issues.  He may have some inherent learning difficulties.  I am recommending a child psychological assessment of him to clarify these problems.  However, within the context of what I believe to have been the dangerous parenting he has experienced throughout his childhood, it will be difficult to say any developmental difficulties are purely due to inherent developmental issues.&#8221;</p>

She described him as a man who was repeatedly unfaithful to her and was often violent.  He suffered an injury in a fight sometime between Child A&#8217;s and Child B&#8217;s birth.  According to her, he was in a wheelchair as a result.  It was difficult to get a clear picture of the extent of his disability.  Ms T described Mr J as constantly irritable and she would avoid questioning him about things to avoid confrontation.  Even when he was in the wheelchair he would throw things at her if he could not hit her but she denied that the children would have witnessed any of this and said that they barely had heard raised voices.&#8221;</p>

When I challenged her about her level of responsibility this placed on a young child, she said she would only want the children to be happy and what they decided was what would happen.  In my opinion, it is likely that Ms T was dependent on the children to guide her in various situations in life.  I have little sense that she understood the impact that Mr J&#8217;s behaviour would potentially have had on the children; in particular the sexual abuse.  I would be concerned if she was collusive in whatever deviant behaviour that was going on in the family home because she seemed to be unable to challenge him at any level.&#8221;</p>

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;We spoke about concerns in relation to sexual abuse.  Ms T has spoken about the videos of the twelve-year-old girl saying she knew he was unfaithful but he was not that low.  In my opinion, this is a minimisation of what was actually found on the phone.  She seemed unable to understand or accept the seriousness of her husband&#8217;s behaviour.  Similarly, the video of the eight year old boy, she initially said that somebody sent it to him by Facebook but when I questioned what kind of friends did he have that would see that as acceptable behaviour, she talked about telling him to delete it and he said that it was sad and horrible.  However, she really struggled to think about what that might imply about his behaviour and the risk the children would have been exposed to in his care.  She told me Child A was never really left alone with his father. However, when I challenged her she then said he had been on holiday with his father.  She said he did go to Afghanistan alone with him but said she was on the holiday to Bulgaria dismissing that it was a concern.  She said she would never have left him on his own except when they went to a mosque.  Later, however, she talked about Child A sleeping in the bed with his father so that he could look at the father&#8217;s phone.  She said that they did watch videos together.  Either this is a gross minimisation of the risks that the father posed to Child A or she is too frightened to say anything about the father as she is still at risk from him.&#8221;</p>

In particular I think the allegations he has made about sexual abuse by neighbours are very concerning.  If Mr J is involved in some sort of paedophile group whereby he is receiving sexually explicit tapes of the abuse of young boys, Child A&#8217;s allegations may indicate his father&#8217;s involvement in what happened.   At the very least they were living close to predatory adults.&#8221;</p>

In the end, it was the social worker who had to stop Child A throwing balls out of the ball pit or bringing food into it.  In the end, when the children were leaving, it was very chaotic and she had no control over the situation.  She found it difficult to tell them it was over, that they had to leave in a way that could have reassured them.  It was the social worker and I who had to step in.

		      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.98in">&#8220;In my opinion, there is a significant risk that Child A has been sexually abused in the care of his parents.  His father was in possession of child pornography including pornography depicting the abuse of a young boy by a woman.  My concern is that Child A was at the very least being groomed in some way by his father given that he would spend time in bed with him and they would watch videos on his phone.  Child A and his sister are sexualised with each other.  The foster carers are vigilant to that and keep them separate and/or fully supervised.  The foster carer told me that she is now of the opinion that Child A is the one who tries these behaviours and would watch them for some time.  </p>

Children who develop this attachment pattern do so in the face of persistently unavailable care.  It also develops when children have to managed unpredictable but repeated danger.  They learn that it is best not to present their needs or distress to adults as at best it may not elicit any response or at worst it can provoke attack.  Children develop the strategy of being pleasing and helpful as a means of being closer to their carer even though the focus is on the carer&#8217;s needs not theirs.&#8221;  </p>

The children have, I am satisfied, suffered physical, emotional, psychological and sexual abuse and are at risk of doing so in the future were they to be returned to the care of their mother.  They have suffered that harm most especially at the hands of their father but also, I regret to find, at the hands of their mother.  The father is a dangerous man.  He has been domestically abusive to the mother, he has been physically abusive to the children and he has exposed them to sexual activity and abuse.  </p>

That may be so but the father during the course of their relationship demonstrated a degree of control over the mother and she suffered a degree of fear that she was not able to protect herself, that I have very real concerns about what the future will hold in either there being a relationship between the mother and the father and/or the father forcing himself upon the mother.  I note that notwithstanding having had the benefit of legal advice, the mother has taken no steps to initiate court proceedings against the father nor has she taken any steps to move from what is the family home.  </p>

The children would be at very real risk of suffering serious physical, sexual, emotional and psychological harm if they were returned to her care.  If the father reappears in their lives the risk of harm to the children may properly be characterised as grave.  There is no prospect of this mother making sufficient or sustained changes so as to be a safe parent in the foreseeable future commensurate with the needs of the children.  I am wholly satisfied that the only safe necessary and proportionate outcome in this case in the welfare best interests of the children is that they are made the subject of care orders and remain in the long term care of their current foster carers.  </p>

I approve the plan of the local authority for both children to remain in long term foster care.  I have been told that the matching process of the children with these foster carers will not be complete for about twelve months so as to ensure that the children are truly settled in placement.  I express the hope that the local authority at the end of that process will approve the match so that the children who have settled so very well and who are so very happy and so very well cared for by these foster carers may remain living with them.  I approve the plan but make no order, as I am requested not to, in relation to contact.  The contact will take place directly six times a year.  In the intervening time there should be safe Skype and/or telephone contact between the mother and the children.  </p>
