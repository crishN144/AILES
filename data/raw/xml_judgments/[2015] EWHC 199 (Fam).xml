		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8220;The allocated social worker was inexperienced with regards to care proceedings and the decision was taken for her to be supported by a social worker with more court experience. Unfortunately this did not happen until August 2013.</p>

		      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">It is accepted that the lack of progress as a consequence of pre-proceedings discussions should have promoted a more immediate response to initiating care proceedings. This failure was the initial cause of drift and delay in determining DS&#8217;s future. This situation has been compounded by a number of changes at a managerial level in which the progression of the care plan has been undermined through lack of consistent oversight. In addition different managers held differing perspectives in terms of how the plan should be progressed and did not provide sufficient direction. </p>

With regard to the Parenting Assessment which should have been filed on the 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> February 2014 it would appear the failure to file in a timely manner is as a result of ineffective communication between the social workers and managers. The various parties involved failed to co-ordinate and prioritise this piece of work to ensure that the filing date was adhered to. The assessment of the paternal grandmother (due to be filed on 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2013) was delayed due to a number of unforeseen circumstances. The first social worker was identified relatively quickly to undertake this task but the planning of this piece of work did not adhere to Northamptonshire&#8217;s financial policy and procedural requirements or inform senior management of such. Consequently, at short notice the excursion was postponed by senior management. </p>

It is wholly inexcusable for a local authority to take three months to decide to issue care proceedings in respect of a very young baby and then a further five months to issue care proceedings. The fact that the parents are Latvian and that close family members lived abroad, provides no explanation less still an excuse for the extraordinary delay in this case. </p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.18in">Let me spell it out. An order that something is to be done by 4 pm on Friday, is an order to do that thing by 4 pm on Friday, not by 4.21 pm on Friday let alone by 3.01 pm the following Monday or sometime later the following week. A person who finds himself unable to comply timeously with his obligations under an order should apply for an extension of time <span style="font-style:italic">before the time for compliance has expired</span>. It is simply not acceptable to put forward as an explanation for non-compliance with an order the burden of other work. If the time allowed for compliance with an order turns out to be inadequate the remedy is either to apply to the court for an extension of time or to pass the task to someone else who has available the time in which to do it.Non-compliance with an order, any order, by anyone is bad enough. It is a particularly serious matter if the defaulter is a public body such as a local authority. And it is also a particularly serious matter if the order goes to something as vitally important as Judge Barclay's order did in this case: the right of a parent facing the permanent loss of their child to know what case is being mounted against them by a public authority.</p>

In addition to email and telephone conversations, a meeting took place 24/09/14 with counsel, the Local Authority solicitor for the case, the social worker, the team manager, the senior practitioner, and myself. The concerns were addressed, and it was agreed by all that the current plan for DS to go to live with his grandparents in Latvia was the most suitable option. A schedule of actions was agreed at the meeting. At that point, it was anticipated that the Local Authority would still have sufficient time to meet the court deadlines, although it was recognised that the work would need to be prioritised. Unfortunately, some of the tasks took longer to complete than anticipated, in particular, the liaison with the Orphan&#8217;s Court in Latvia, although we have now made a good contact there and gained valuable advice. </p>
