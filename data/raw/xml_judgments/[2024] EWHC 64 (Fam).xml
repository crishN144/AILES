The application concerns a child, XZR, born in the United Kingdom in April 2018 and who is now 5.  The respondent is the father, (&#8216;F&#8217;), who unlawfully abducted XZR to the United Kingdom in October 2023.  M seeks XZR&#8217;s return to Lithuania.  Following the order of Poole J dated 15 December 2023 summarily dismissing F&#8217;s defences based on the child&#8217;s objections (on the ground he is too young to express any objection) and settlement under Article 12, the only issues in the case are F&#8217;s claim that (a) there is a grave risk that XZR&#8217;s return would expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation under 13(b); (b) in any event, the court is not bound to order XZR&#8217;s summary return and should not do so in its discretion.</p>

M&#8217;s pregnancy was unplanned and their son, XZR, was born in the UK in April 2018. The parties have never been married but F is named on XZR&#8217;s birth certificate so shares parental responsibility with M.</p>

F had disclosed that he had previously been in prison following an assault on a previous partner and he pressured M to leave the jurisdiction so that the criminal proceedings in the UK against him would be discontinued.  M has remained in Lithuania ever since, save for a few days in July 2019 and until this hearing.</p>

On 3 September 2021 the Lithuanian court made a further interim order [<span style="font-family:Garamond-Bold">395</span>], on F&#8217;s application to vary the April 2021 order.

That application was refused on 10 August 2022 by the Lithuanian court [<span style="font-family:Garamond-Bold">408</span>], on the basis that: (1) although XZR had been habitually resident in the UK at the time of his removal in 2019, F had consented to his return to Lithuania and therefore there had been no wrongful removal or retention by M (2) XZR had been living in Lithuania with his mother for nearly 3 years and was settled for the purposes of Article 12(2).  In any event, (3) XZR would be at grave risk of harm if he was returned to the UK, so return would be refused in any event on an Art. 13(b) basis.  The Vilnius Regional Court found that: &#8220;The evidence in the case therefore confirms that the Applicant, who is requesting the return of the child to his country of origin, has a tendency to be violent towards others. It should be noted that the Applicant has been found to use violence in the presence of his minor son.&#8221;  In reaching that conclusion the Court took into account the following at [89-91]:</p>

The reason for his aggression was that M did not go outside the yard gate when he brought the child home but asked him to hand over the child when he was brought to the gate. F kept the child in the car for two hours with the window open (a video is attached to the file) in the rain, which made the child ill the next day and prevented him from seeing his father for that reason. </p>

F then chased the child and caught him, forcibly put him in the car, and kicked and scratched [M], who tried to help the child.&#8217; A pre-trial investigation had been brought against F under Article 140(1) and (3) of the Lithuanian Criminal Code in connection with the incident, due to the violence he used against M and the child. </p>

On 5 December 2023 [18] the matter came before me for an inter-parties hearing. F attended in person. The judge listed the matter for a final hearing on 17 January 2024; listed a further short hearing to consider any further directions that are necessary in light of F&#8217;s Answer (to be filed on 13 December 2023) and directed that F make the child available for indirect contact every at 4pm UK time for 20 minutes. On 15 December 2023 the matter came before Poole J [22], F having only filed his Answer the evening before. The judge summarily dismissed F&#8217;s defence based upon settlement and upon the child&#8217;s objections and made directions for final hearing, including special measures for M&#8217;s benefit. He continued the order for indirect contact between M and XZR, with an order that F not be present, or speak to or engage with M during indirect contact.

First, F had instructed her that he would not comply with any return order that the court may make and would not allow the child to be returned to Lithuania.  Second, when asked about XZR&#8217;s location he said &#8216;he is not at school; he is unwell&#8217;, and when mention was made of police involvement F said they &#8216;wouldn&#8217;t be able to find him&#8217;.  He later contradicted this by saying that XZR was at home with his paternal grandmother.  Third, he made some further generalised threats against the mother.  In the light of those threats I informed F he may be in contempt of court and ordered his arrest to prevent him from taking any further steps that might lead to him frustrating any court order by the child being hidden or further removed.  I also made a collection order for XZR&#8217;s immediate collection by the tipstaff.  In the event the child was found by the tipstaff and brought to court shortly before the hearing had ended.  I return to the contempt issue at the end of this judgment.</p>

The Lithuanian courts are failing in their obligations to promote a relationship between F and XZR contrary to Article 8 ECHR because they not allow face to face contact.  The court should disregard the Lithuanian court judgments, in particular the final decision of 5 December 2022, because he hadn&#8217;t been notified of that hearing and it was therefore made without him having an opportunity to make representations.  He invoked Article 23 of the 1996 Convention (non-recognition) which provides that measures taken by the authorities of a contracting state shall be recognised in other contracting states except, materially, &#8216;on the request of any person claiming that the measure infringes his or her parental responsibility, if such measure was taken, except in cases of urgency, without such person having been given an opportunity to be heard&#8217;.</p>

It is intended to provide a swift, summary procedure for a left-behind parent to secure the return of a child wrongfully removed to or retained in another country by the removing parent.  Where the procedure is triggered the courts of the requested state are required to &#8216;act expeditiously&#8217; (Article 11), if possible within six weeks of the request being made.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">

M (Abduction: Zimbabwe)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 251" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 251</ref>, giving a speech with which the rest of the House of Lords agreed: [43].  The underlying purposes of the Hague Convention are relevant to the exercise of the discretion, but should not always be given more weight than other considerations, which may include wider considerations of the child&#8217;s rights and welfare: [43].  The exercise of discretion will be determined by the court&#8217;s findings as to why there is no obligation to return the child.  For example, where the decision has been taken under Article 13(b) that there is a &#8216;grave risk&#8217; of harm to the child if they are returned it will be &#8216;inconceivable&#8217; that the court will nevertheless in its discretion order their return: [45].  Different considerations may apply in consent cases, although as a general principle &#8216;the further one gets from the speedy return envisaged by the Convention, the less weighty those general Convention considerations must be&#8217;: [44].</p>

The proceedings must be determined swiftly and, if possible, within six weeks of their commencement.  The judge does not conduct a fact-finding exercise such as that under PD12J.

The claimed risk does not come close to the necessary threshold of &#8216;grave risk of harm&#8217; for Article 13(b) purposes.  The Lithuanian Courts in their final decision of 5 Dec 2022 imposed restrictions on F&#8217;s contact with XZR because of his own violent and abusive behaviour towards M, the child and his paternal grandparents.  That was also the basis for the Lithuanian Court&#8217;s dismissal of F&#8217;s Hague Convention application in August 2022 on Article 13(b) grounds.   The restriction is not total; the order allows for indirect contact on a regular and frequent basis.  In any event it is not final for all time; if F&#8217;s behaviour changes then the court may vary its own order.  I am bound to give effect to the Lithuanian Court orders other than in circumstances provided for by Article 23 of the 1996 Hague Convention or Article 20 of the 1980 Hague Convention.  No such circumstances arise here.  In particular I reject the suggestion that F was not notified of the hearing; the judgment and order record he was present and made representations through his lawyers.  Lithuania is a contracting state of the ECHR and there is nothing to suggest that the order made on 5 Dec 2022 is incompatible with F&#8217;s convention rights.  I also reject the other bases advanced by F that there is a &#8216;risk&#8217; for the reasons given by M.</p>

In those circumstances I concluded that F may be guilty of contempt in the face of the court, namely &#8216;conduct that denotes wilful defiance of, or disrespect towards, the court or that wilfully challenges or affronts the authority of the court or the supremacy of the law itself&#8217;: <span style="font-style:italic">Solicitor General v Cox </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2016/1241" uk:canonical="[2016] EWHC 1241 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWHC 1241 (QB)</ref> ('Cox'), [67].  I was also concerned that he would take steps to implement a pre-arranged plan to remove XZR to Kosovo if I made a return order.  He has made such threats in the past and, of course, abducted XZR from Lithuania to the UK in October of last year.  I formed the view that the threat of further abduction was real and imminent.  I had also been informed that he was behaving in and outside court in an aggressive and intimidating manner which was making M extremely uncomfortable.  I arranged for the tipstaff and for security officers to be present in court and then notified F, in open court, that his expressed refusal to comply with any court order, and his stated intention to frustrate any order if made, might constitute a contempt of court and that he was under arrest.  I ordered him to surrender his phone to the tipstaff so that he could not contact anyone else who might frustrate the court&#8217;s order.  F was permitted to remain in court during the hearing but I remanded him to the cells between the end of the hearing and the giving of judgment shortly after 3 o&#8217;clock.  When I returned to court to give judgment I was informed that the tipstaff had been able to locate XZR and was on her way to the RCJ and would be arriving shortly.  In due course XZR was reunited with his mother who plans for them both to fly to Lithuania on January 18.</p>

F submitted, through counsel, that his legal representatives had &#8216;misunderstood&#8217; his instructions and that <span style="color:#000000">he had, and has, every intention of complying with any order of this court and it was always his position that XZR was always at home in the care of the paternal grandmother or nearby.</span>  I do not accept this as his earlier defiance was consistent with his attitude to the Lithuanian courts as expressed in video calls that I have seen and given his willingness to lie when it suits him (as witness his denial that he had threatened to remove XCR to Kosovo in a video call to F, a lie exposed in the 17 seconds that the video was then played in court).  I conclude his &#8216;new&#8217; instructions were a fabrication and I remain concerned that F will take steps to disrupt XZR&#8217;s removal if he possibly can.</p>
