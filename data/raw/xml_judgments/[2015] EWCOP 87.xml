It relates to the part, if any, that the Court of Protection must play in the finalisation of an award of compensation under the relevant scheme that the Second Respondent (CICA) has decided and the applicant has agreed is to be held on trust.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Official Solicitor, as the Appellant&#8217;s litigation friend, has appealed because he is of the view that the issue is one of general importance.  I agree and CICA did not demur.  It is however puzzling why the issue had not been resolved a long time ago.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Director of Social Services, Newcastle City Council (the Deputy) who has not taken any active part in this appeal made the application to the Court of Protection.  By it he raised other points which were decided by Senior Judge Lush and have not been appealed.  However, it appears to me that my analysis of the point that was appealed raises points that the Deputy and the court should consider but were not argued before me.  I return to these at the end of this judgment.  They relate to:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the issue that was appealed the Official Solicitor argues that the Court of Protection need take no part after it has appointed a deputy to make the claim under the relevant scheme whereas CICA argues that it must make a further order in every case before CICA can pay the award to the trustees of the trust.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Senior Judge Lush found that CICA was right and that the Court of Protection must set up the trust on the basis that the applicant for the award is the settlor and so, if the applicant lacks capacity, an application must be made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/18/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s. 18(1)</ref>(h) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (the MCA) for an order under s. 16  thereof settling P&#8217;s property.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">CICA&#8217;s position and the conclusion reached by Senior Judge Lush clearly involve additional expense and although such costs can be added to an award the Official Solicitor is concerned that they should be avoided in case they are not and, in particular, when the award is capped because there is no provision that enables costs to be paid by CICA over and above the cap.  So, and I agree, the Official Solicitor points out that CICA&#8217;s position and the decision of Senior Judge Lush may not be in P&#8217;s best interests. </p>

This is clearly correct and is not disputed.  Indeed the same can be said of the point made that in exercising its functions CICA will not be aware of issues that are relevant to the application of that test.</p>

Clearly, if the deputy wanted directions from the Court of Protection on whether he should or should not agree to the terms of an offer (including conditions that the money must be paid to trustees on trusts that include provisions that CICA asserts it can require in the exercise of its powers) the deputy can do so.</p>

But the question whether the award and the money representing it is ever the applicant&#8217;s property can be tested by asking:  If CICA did pay the sum awarded to the applicant could he lawfully do what he wanted with it?  The answer is &#8220;No&#8221;, because the award and the money is impressed with an obligation (which can be described as a constructive or purpose trust) which means that the applicant is never entitled to treat it as his property.  </p>

A convenient and sensible way is that adopted in practice by CICA when the applicant has capacity (i.e. a declaration of trust by original trustees setting out the trusts over the award which will start to operate on payment).  No doubt trust lawyers could set up other ways to give effect to the terms and so the trust created by the finalisation of the process of an application for compensation to CICA under the relevant scheme.</p>

This is because it has to make its decisions on a correct interpretation of the relevant scheme and its exercise of discretion under it is subject to challenge applying public law principles.

Later schemes do not contain the same wording, but their wording &#8220;no likelihood that an assailant would benefit&#8221; (the 1996, 2000 and 2008 Schemes) and &#8220;no award will be made if an assailant may benefit from the award&#8221; (the 2012 Scheme) give rise to similar issues.</p>
