There have been at least five reported decisions on the subject in Australia, but the statute there is different to ours, both in its framing and in its judicial interpretation, although there are obvious similarities. To my knowledge there has been no reported decision on the subject here. In <span style="font-style:italic">Cowan v Cowan</span> [2001] 2 FCR 331, CA Mance LJ (as he then was) stated at para 160:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">There are many perplexing situations that may one day require examination. What, for example, of the individual spouse who each week invests a small part of his or her spare cash in the National Lottery, and one day wins &#163;1m, or &#163;10m? Should this asset be viewed like any sudden accretion to the value of the joint home or other matrimonial investment, due to market movements? Or might it, in some circumstances at least, be more analogous to property brought into a marriage or inherited property? Would it for example make any difference, if the other spouse was opposed to all gaming as a waste of money, or if the very limited money expended came from inherited property? There appears to have been a quite extensive jurisprudence in this area in Australia, including <span style="font-style:italic">Zyk v Zyk</span> (1995) FLC 92-644, 19 Fam LR 797 (referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">Lynch v Lynch </span>(26 October 2000, unreported) (Full Court of the Family Court of Australia), cited to us). In the circumstances there, a husband's lottery win was equated with a contribution by the husband to the joint assets, and the final award, based on the spouses' respective contributions, was tailored accordingly. I mention<span style="font-style:italic"> Zyk's</span> case not to suggest that the same approach to or use of contributions would necessarily apply under the English statute&#8212;but simply to illustrate some of the problems and considerations that may one day need to be addressed in this jurisdiction.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My task has not been made any easier by the fact that neither party is professionally represented. When I walked into Court on Monday 10 October 2011 I had only been given three documents relating to the case namely a letter dated 19 September 2011 from the Applicant&#8217;s former solicitors explaining that they were no longer instructed; a Notice of Acting in Person; and a copy email from the Royal Mail purporting to show that the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> Respondent had been personally served with a freezing injunction. Beyond that I knew absolutely nothing about the case. I encountered the Applicant Husband (H) and the Respondent Wife (W) each accompanied by a McKenzie friend, Mr Ison in the case of the former and Mr Caceres in the case of the latter. I allowed Mr Ison to explain the background briefly. He had some bundles which had been professionally prepared for a hearing in July 2011. He explained that the parties were both Columbian and that while his client&#8217;s command of English was limited that of W was non-existent. Mr Caceres explained that his would be a dual role of McKenzie friend and translator. It was agreed that the bundles would be copied and that each of Mr Ison and Mr Caceres would prepare a short statement of issues and orders sought. On that basis the matter was adjourned until the following day. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On Tuesday 11 October 2011, of my own motion, I granted each of Mr Ison and Mr Caceres rights of audience pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/29/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ss12</ref>-19 of and Schedule 3 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/29" uk:canonical="2007 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Legal Services Act 2007</ref>. I am fully aware that special circumstances are needed to justify such an order: see paras 18 &#8211; 26 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Practice Guidance: McKenzie Friends (Civil and Family Courts)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 2 FLR 962" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 2 FLR 962</ref>. However, I was convinced that the case would soon develop anarchic aspects were I not to make such an order. The prospect of each of H and W cross-examining the other with translation at each end by Mr Caceres was an alarming vision indeed. In the event both Mr Ison and Mr Caceres conducted themselves impeccably and performed very creditably. Their cross-examinations were performed with moderation and civility and were, up to a point, effective, although neither, of course, was steeped in the intricacies of the applicable law. Equally their submissions were perhaps less acutely focussed than would have been the case had counsel been instructed. That said they enabled the case to proceed in an economical and efficient way and I am grateful for their assistance.</p>

Such is a quotation from the speech of Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Miller v. Miller, McFarlane v.

Thus, <span style="font-style:italic">on the facts in White</span>, the importance of the source of the contribution of &#163;11,000 diminished over time.

As by his presentation he intended, a first glance at the schedule identifies three awards of as much as 40%.

To be fair, a further perusal of the schedule does identify at any rate one case in which the award was made solely out of non-matrimonial property. It was the decision of Baron J in <span style="font-style:italic">NA v.

But, in that the respondent's assets there had a value of &#163;40m, rather than, as here, of &#163;57m, and in that the applicant's needs were there estimated at &#163;9.2m rather than, as here, at (say) &#163;5.3m, the amount of the award to the applicant, which was no more and no less than the estimated amount of her needs, was bound to bear a much higher ratio to the value of the assets than in the present case. That it there amounted to 23% demonstrates nothing. What was much more interesting was the moment during the hearing when we asked Mr Pointer to show us a reported decision in which the assets were entirely non-matrimonial and in which, by reference to the sharing principle, the applicant secured an award in excess of her or his needs. He confessed to be unable to do so. Such a decision will no doubt be made &#8211; but not in this court today. </p>

The receipt of a substantial lottery prize may in general be referred to in that way. However, we doubt whether, for the purposes of the exercise under s.79, that is the correct analysis. The parties purchase a ticket and expend part of their earnings or capital for the express purpose of winning the prize or a prize. Whilst the chances of winning the major prize are remote, the reality is that somebody does and it is the expectation, or at least hope, of each entrant that he or she may be that person. It is not the product of any particular skill but it is the product of the chosen expenditure of a small sum of money. Contributions is, we think, the preferable description within s.79 because an acquisition of a prize contributes to the property of the parties. If it or part of it still remains in existence at the time of the trial or is represented by other then existing assets that will constitute part of the property to which s.79 will apply. If it has been disposed of in the meantime in other ways that may or may not have been a contribution to property or the family depending on the circumstances. The use of the term "windfall" creates conceptual difficulties within s.79 and can lead to inconsistent outcomes (see later). The approach of treating it as a contribution is consistent with the treatment of gifts from family as a contribution by or on behalf of that party: see <span style="font-style:italic">Kessey </span>(1994) FLC 92-495.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, the critical question in such cases is - by whom is that contribution made? In the ordinary run of marriages a ticket is purchased by one or other of the parties from money which he or she happens to have at that particular time. That fact should not determine the issue. Where both parties are in receipt of income and where their marriage is predicated upon the basis of each contributing their income towards the joint partnership constituted by their marriage, the purchase of the ticket would be regarded as a purchase from joint funds in the same way as any other purchase within that context and would be treated accordingly: see <span style="font-style:italic">Anastasio</span>. Where one party is working and the other is not the same conclusion would ordinarily apply because that is the mode of partnership selected by the parties. The income of the working member is treated as joint in the same way as the domestic activities of the non-working partner are regarded as being for their joint benefit. In the essential sense this analysis is similar to that provided by the Full Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Hauff</span> [1986] FamCA 16; (1986) FLC 91-747 in discussing the rationale for treating superannuation benefits of one party, including contributions by the employer, as the product of joint contributions. </p>

Whilst there may be some superficial attractions in this, we do not think that it is correct. The only relevant point of distinction is that the party to the marriage purchases not the whole ticket but a share in a ticket (or group of tickets) with other persons. That share would ordinarily be treated as coming from joint funds with his or her married partner, and any resultant prize would be a joint contribution by them to the property of their marriage. Similarly, a distinction is sometimes sought to be drawn in cases where the purchase is the continuance of a pre-marriage practice by one party. However, in ordinary circumstances the above approach would apply, because from marriage the purchase would usually be treated as coming from their joint incomes.  </p>

As I have stated, the result is highly fact specific, and does not depend centrally on the origin of the trifling amount to purchase the ticket. If the parties are in effect operating a syndicate, whether formal or informal, where both are aware that tickets are being bought and where both have agreed tacitly or expressly to their purchase, then it is easy to see the prize as a joint venture and therefore as matrimonial property, normally to be equally shared. On the other hand if one party is unilaterally buying tickets, from his or her own earned income, without the knowledge of the other party, then it is equally easy to see the prize as a receipt by that party alone akin to an external donation, and therefore as non-matrimonial property. This case will be fortified if the party in question is buying the ticket as part of a syndicate with others, and more so if the marriage has become troubled and unhappy with the parties drifting into separate lives socially and economically (as I will find to be the case here).</p>

On 18 June 2010 the GP of H and W Dr S wrote &#8220;I can confirm that Mrs P and her ex-husband Mr S, who was a patient had both registered at my surgery in 1993.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment H&#8217;s present income and housing needs are met. However, H has an urgent need to make provision for his old age.  I assume that H will retire at age 65 and will receive a full state pension.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A Duxbury calculation on &#163;11,250 per annum for a 65 year old gives a capital requirement of &#163;82,080 when allowance is made for a full state pension. Of course I recognise that H is 10 years off retirement and that he will invest his lump sum and achieve growth. But meantime inflation will take its effect. If I assume an inflation rate of 3% H will need to have &#163;15,119 per annum to have the same standard of living as he has now. I think it is reasonable to assume that net investment growth will exactly balance the effect of inflation over the next decade. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I now state my conclusions. The first port of call is to apply the needs principle. This was a long marriage and both parties have needs, particularly to provide for themselves in old age. I judge that H has a need for a lump sum to be paid now of &#163;82,000. On that basis W would be left with a capital base of just over &#163;350,000 (&#163;425,918 + &#163;6,700 (Cali) &#8211; &#163;82,000 = &#163;350,618). By downsizing her home at the point of retirement W and her new husband will have ample funds to provide for their old age.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I now turn to the application of the sharing principle. I judge the initial receipt of the lottery prize to be non-matrimonial property. This is a case that clearly falls into the second scenario described by me at para 15 above. However, when W purchased 108 A Road she converted that part of her non-matrimonial assets into matrimonial property. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Given that the source of this matrimonial property was not joint endeavour but rather non-matrimonial property of W&#8217;s, and given the relatively short period that H actually lived in 108 A Road,  I do not believe that H is entitled to an equal sharing of it, or anything like it. I judge that a sharing of 15% - 20% would be fair. The value of the property after costs of sale (but ignoring the mortgage) is &#163;480,150. My assessment of the application of the sharing principle gives a range of award to H of &#163;72,000 - &#163;96,000.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Both parties have raised conduct. It is a common feature of many financial remedy cases where parties represent themselves. Although both parties behaved poorly towards each other, H perhaps worse than W, the very high threshold mandated by the authorities (<span style="font-style:italic">Miller and McFarlane</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">S v S</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"> McCartney v Mills-McCartney</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 1 FLR 1508" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 1 FLR 1508</ref>) for conduct to be capable of being reckoned is not crossed.
