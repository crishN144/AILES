	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in">The background facts can be summarised as follows.  The parents were married in England but separated when S was only a year or so old. The parents were divorced in May 2003. The father remarried (Mrs RI) in around 2004 and continues to live in England with his second wife and their two children, aged 8 and 6.  The mother lives with the three children in Mexico, and is reported to have a new partner.  S is said currently to have a somewhat difficult relationship with her older brother D, but she and her older sister (M) regard each other as &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">best friends</span>&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In 2008, the mother applied through the English courts for permission to remove the children permanently to her native country, Mexico, and following a contested hearing was given permission by the court in the following year. She actually relocated the children in 2010.  The children have therefore been living in Mexico for 4 years.  There has been no direct contact between the father and the children for the whole of that period, though he has had indirect contact. The father himself told me that he had not had much contact with the children in the years since they have been in Mexico. It now appears that during the spring and early summer of 2014 (and possibly for a period even before that) S and her father were in regular contact.</span></p>

The father told me that after a year the children went to a Spanish speaking state school; I am unclear whether this was because the mother could no longer afford bilingual education though I note, and it is not disputed, that the father has paid little by way of maintenance for the children since 2010. </span></p>

In the afternoon of 8 July 2014, the mother received a message from S via Facebook stating that she was in London and she intended to remain here permanently. History now reveals that the father had assisted S (both practically and financially) to leave her home, and leave her country by crossing the border to the United States and flying to England. This was done clandestinely, without the mother&#8217;s knowledge, let alone her consent. The father informed his wife that S was coming to England for a holiday. </span></p>

S reacted to this scene (commendably in my judgment) by calling the police; however her actions in doing so provoked an extreme and inexcusable reaction from members of her paternal family; first, her grandfather allegedly assaulted her, grabbing &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">her by the neck and arm and push[ing] her down onto the floor</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">&#8221;.

She is a bright, articulate, intelligent, able young person, who has, in many domains of her life, displayed considerable emotional and intellectual maturity; the events over the last two months have been extraordinarily testing for her, and she has reacted with a reasonably high level of maturity and responsibility in dealing with them. While she may not yet display the rounded and more complete maturity of many (but by no means all) fully-fledged adults (and I note that even her father described her as immature in some respects), I would be placing the bar too high if I would to search for such a sophisticated level of development. In summary, and on the evidence taken overall, I conclude that she is a mature 15 year-old.</p>

He applied for a school place for S at both schools but only after S had been in this country for some days or weeks; in my judgment this was probably only after 22 July (he told me that the school term had ended by the time he applied). Both schools have rejected her application for a place, and both schools are notoriously over-subscribed. That rejection is the subject of an appeal (though there has been no date given for the determination of the appeal).  Until the appeal is determined, S is out of school. Term started earlier this week.  If the appeal is dismissed, there is no clear or meaningful &#8216;Plan B&#8217; for S&#8217;s schooling. When I asked the father about this, he told me that there were two other schools locally, but could not remember the name of one of them.</p>

In his written evidence and oral submission he appeared himself to accept that private education in Mexico may well compare favourably to education in this country (see his &#167;36).  S can thereby continue her studies there, and would be moving on from High School to study A level equivalents in two academic years time (i.e. no material disadvantage in terms of time than if she were starting her two year GCSE syllabus here now). </p>

I struggle to imagine the pain, and distress, which S must have felt at that time as a consequence of her father&#8217;s actions, and consider that while she may be able to conceal her pain now (and dismisses it as simply something in &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">the past</span>&#8221; in her discussions with Ms Bennett-Hernandez), that wound will take time to heal.  She speaks of making her own home here as soon as she is 16.  In the meantime, relations between S and the paternal family are difficult (as their recent visit to the father&#8217;s home demonstrated), and are not likely to become easier while the paternal uncle faces criminal process as a consequence of S&#8217;s (entirely proper I emphasise) engagement of the police in the alleged incident in the grandparents&#8217; home. If relations with the paternal family do not improve, S faces a degree of isolation, and likely tensions in her relationship with her father. He has no recent experience of parenting or taking responsibility for her; his limited role in that respect in the last few weeks has been fraught. </p>

I am conscious that S has spoken in less than favourable terms about life in Mexico with her mother, but that life appears on the evidence before me (for instance, her comments about life at home are not borne out by her sister and brother) to be more settled than that here. Moreover, I rely on the fact that if returning to Mexico, she would be physically and emotionally close once again to her older sister M whom (as I indicated above) she has described as her &#8216;best friend&#8217;.</p>
