In the course of the next three years many statements and expert reports were filed, leading ultimately to various declarations and orders being made as to the best interests of ED in relation to, amongst other issues, where she should reside and contact with her family.  The relevant order is dated 22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> November 2010 and it effectively stayed the proceedings for a period of 12 months, although liberty to apply for permission to restore the proceedings, if supported by evidence, was permitted.</p>

Permission was granted although, as far as I can detect, there was limited evidence before the Court in the form of witness statements from each of ED&#8217;s parents.  In reality, the Order granting such permission proved to be an &#8216;open-sesame&#8217; for the re-litigation of a great range of issues across the board.  In addition, the parents raised a further issue in stark form, namely: whether or not ED&#8217;s pubic hair should be removed for cultural/religious reasons.</p>

By the time the case came before me in February 2013 (listed as a final hearing) the quantity of paper generated in this phase of the proceedings can only be described as inordinate.  A brief glance at the index indicates that there have been over 200 pages of preliminary documents (including position statements of the Official Solicitor on behalf of ED, and the other parties).  There have been approximately 250 pages (leaving aside the orders generated at the conclusion of this hearing) of applications and orders.</p>

It had already occupied the best part of five days in February this year.  That hearing was (in part) de-railed by the late provision by the relevant Police Force, of material relating to members of ED&#8217;s family.  Limited evidence was given in the course of that five days, leading to my interim judgment.  However, it could not proceed to a conclusion as the parties needed time to reflect on the material, and their positions in relation to it, and it became necessary to instruct an expert into the religious/cultural reasons for the shaving of a moslem woman&#8217;s pubic hair.  I record in passing that the expert evidence obtained (which was unchallenged by any party) was that, whilst there was a duty to remove such hair, (both for religious and cultural reasons) there is an exemption for those incapacitated such as ED.  Returning to the subject of the current 10 day listing before me, there were a number of reasons for this apparently luxurious time estimate, including the great morass of paper, the anticipated number of witnesses, the fact that a number of the witnesses required interpreters, submissions and to take account of judicial reading time and judgment writing time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At a Directions Hearing on 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August 2013, the Court was informed that the parents no longer sought that ED be returned to live in the family home.  No explanation for this volte-face was then provided.   Instead, the parents sought to re-focus the case by requesting that at least five alternative potential residential homes near to the family home be considered.  I permitted them to put forward two, and the documents filed subsequently cast very considerable doubt on the suitability of either.  Neither of the two put forward amounted to more than prospectuses for the possible future establishment of such an alternative residential home for ED.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the course of exchanges with counsel for the parents, I required that I be informed of what factors in particular had changed the mind of the parents in the summer of this year, such that they abandoned their main request (namely the return of ED to their home); and what led them, in more recent times, to agree the Local Authority proposals (supported as they were in essence by the Official Solicitor on behalf of ED).  The only clue provided to me on this subject appears in a recital at the foot of page one of the main Order and reads as follows:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Mr. D and Mrs. D no longer seeking a declaration that it is in ED&#8217;s best interests to reside at the family home, to reside at an alternative placement or to have staying contact at the family home, because Mr. D and Mrs. D acknowledge that ED needs to be cared for by people with BSL, that an alternative placement closer to the family home is not currently available, but that the Local Authority will keep the option of such a placement under regular review, as well as arrangements for contact between ED and her family&#8221; [BSL equals British Sign Language].</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I emphasised to Miss Hewson (Counsel for the parents) that I was NOT seeking to go behind the veil of legal professional privilege in requiring explanations.  It is difficult for me to understand how it comes about, having taken full account of the content of that recital, what is said to have led to the parents change of view.  Both parents filed statements on 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> August and on 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September 2013.  The August statements do not make any such concession.  Indeed it has been a clear part of each parent&#8217;s case throughout that the family communications skills were more than adequate to the job of caring full-time for ED, let alone during staying contact and that remained so until a late admission to the contrary in the statement of 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> September, and then only to the effect that they (the parents) do not speak BSL. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I requested information as to the costs incurred by each party since November 2011.  The Local Authority&#8217;s costs amounted to approximately &#163;138,000 since October 2011, the costs on the parents to &#163;82,000, and the costs of the Official Solicitor to approximately &#163;130,000.  This is an astonishing sum of money to spend on one case.  ED, Mr. D and Mrs. D have all had their legal expenses met from public funds.  Particularly when one considers the nature of the case for the parents, and that the ultimate resolution of this phase of the proceedings (now, I emphasise, ended, save as to the issue of publication) is that the parents have, ultimately with their own &#8220;consent,&#8221; agreed to Orders which dismiss any hope of ED coming to live with them and a significant reduction in her contact to them.</p>
