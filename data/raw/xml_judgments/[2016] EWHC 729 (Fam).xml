In fact, and as a result of what is accepted to have been errors by the clinic, Y completed and signed a Form PP and X completed and signed a Form WP. A similar mistake was made in relation to the Form IC signed by both Y and X. These mistakes seem to have arisen, although nothing turns on the point, because of confusion on the part of the clinic resulting from the fact that X was not merely Y&#8217;s partner but also the child(ren)&#8217;s biological mother.</p>

That, in my judgment, is quite clear. What is not so clear, and has been the subject of interesting argument, is whether that is a conclusion I can properly come to simply by a process of <span style="font-style:italic">construction</span> or whether the proper form of order is a decree of <span style="font-style:italic">rectification</span>. Miss Fottrell and Miss Sprinz submit that they can succeed on construction, without having recourse to rectification, though acknowledging that rectification is an appropriate remedy. Miss Grey is agnostic, though accepting that rectification is a remedy available to the applicant.

However, it is by no means simply an academic issue of categorisation. If it is a question of interpretation, then the document in question has, and has always had, the meaning and effect as determined by the court, and that is the end of the matter. On the other hand, if it is a question of rectification, then the document, as rectified, has a different meaning from that which it appears to have on its face, and the court would have jurisdiction to refuse rectification or to grant it on terms (eg if there had been delay, change of position, or third party reliance).&#8221;</p>

There can, as I have already said, be no basis for refusing relief by way of rectification on any discretionary ground, and, as Lord Neuberger made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Marley v Rawlings</span> (para 66), rectification operates retrospectively. There is, therefore, no need for me to decide the construction point and it is better that I do not. The matter is best left for determination in a case where the issue both arises and cannot be avoided. Prudence indicates that the President of the Family Division would be unwise to go where the President of the Supreme Court declined to tread.</p>

It is the entirely unsurprising &#8211; in lawyer&#8217;s language, the reasonably foreseeable &#8211; consequence of the kind of incompetence to which the parents in all these cases have been exposed. If ever there was a situation calling for empathy, understanding, humanity, compassion and, dare one say it, common decency, never mind sincere and unqualified apology, it is surely this. </p>

They have an obligation to be open and transparent &#8211; most particularly with those whose parenthood was potentially disturbed by administrative incompetence. The parents were (and are) the individuals in most need of advice and assistance; they are entitled to and should have been treated with respect and proper concern.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The parents in the present case acknowledge the sympathy and understanding with which they were treated by the clinic&#8217;s senior infertility counsellor after the clinic&#8217;s error was revealed, an approach which was reflected in both the tone and the phraseology of her witness statement in June 2015. The attitude of the clinic&#8217;s solicitors is another matter. Their opening letter, dated 6 February 2015, was cold and impersonal. The writer ended with the comment that &#8220;I would encourage you to obtain your own legal advice <span style="font-style:italic">if you are able to do so</span> (emphasis added).&#8221; There was, as Miss Fottrell pointedly observes, no offer of funding, though that is a matter which Y had, in my judgment entirely reasonably and appropriately, raised with the clinic in a letter dated 7 January 2015, suggesting that the burden of costs should fall on the clinic given its &#8220;gross negligence.&#8221; </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other letter from the solicitors was dated 17 April 2015. It referred to the fact that Y was in a civil partnership and said that &#8220;If staff had been aware of the civil partnership, it would have prompted further discussion at the time and you would have been made aware of the legal implications for your family.&#8221;<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1">
		<p class="FootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><span/><marker name="tab"/>The implication, whether or not intended, that this somehow provided the clinic with a &#8216;let out&#8217; was wide of the mark. Ultimately, as we have seen, the question was not what the clinic was told but whether there had been &#8220;consent&#8221; by Y&#8217;s civil partner, CP. Perhaps the solicitors, like the clinic, were labouring under what can now be seen to have been the inadequate understanding that, as the clinic had put it in a letter dated 2 December 2014, &#8220;if your civil partner was aware of your treatment <span style="font-style:italic">and did not object</span>, she may be deemed to be the legal parent &#8230; by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2008/22/section/42" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42</ref> (emphasis added).&#8221; Be that as it may, the best the clinic could offer, in the witness statement by its quality manager, responding to what X had said in her witness statement, was the lame explanation, not accompanied by any indication of regret or apology, that, in raising the question of Y&#8217;s civil partnership, &#8220;It was not intended to cause distress or anxiety, or to cause any delay.&#8221;    </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Miss Fottrell and Miss Sprinz with studied moderation characterise this letter as &#8220;insensitive, insulting and inappropriate.&#8221; I agree, but go further. The letter was crass and insensitive, though even to describe it in this way is understatement on the grand scale. X described the offer as &#8220;a pathetic financial gesture&#8221; which made her feel &#8220;extremely insulted.&#8221; Y said that &#8220;It was just insulting to think that the clinic regarded the position they had put our whole family in, could be corrected by a mere financial offering &#8230; there was no offer in any shape or form to help correct the situation &#8230; there was a complete disregard for the impact their error had on our [children&#8217;s] lives.&#8221; I am not surprised. To use the phrase &#8220;this episode&#8221; to describe what this family had gone through, and were still going through, was grossly insensitive. The phrases &#8220;very distressing&#8221; and &#8220;much anxiety&#8221; were little better than formulaic and stand in stark contrast with the language used by X and Y to describe how they felt. </p>

It was put forward as being &#8220;in full and final settlement&#8221; &#8211; I can only trust that it was not in fact set as a trap, in the hope that, if accepted, it would set a derisory cap to the clinic&#8217;s potential exposure to costs. And, if an offer of financial compensation was appropriate at all, the idea that &#163;1,000 began to approach a realistic figure was so wide of the mark as to be not merely insulting but almost offensively so.</p>
