The local authority&#8217;s submissions are by reference to a detailed micro analysis of the judgment. It criticises the Judge for not giving appropriate weight to the evidence from Ms Verity about the changing attitudes to post adoption contact, placing undue weight on the concerns that direct post adoption contact was unlikely to be forthcoming which may limit the pool of available adopters if an order for contact is made thus erring in the application and interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/26" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 26</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.  Furthermore, the Judge was wrong to infer that the more recent deterioration in K&#8217;s circumstances and presentation would make adoption a less likely option if the Child Permanence Report were updated to include his current circumstances.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The local authority further submits that the Judge&#8217;s reliance on broad understandings and analytical data about the stability of an adoptive placement compared to long term foster care is flawed and that she was duty bound to make further enquiries about the same. She was wrong to assume that adopters were likely to need additional training to meet K&#8217;s needs and she was wrong to conclude in the absence of evidence that the local authority was unable to conduct a parallel search for the two types of placements. Furthermore, she failed to attach sufficient weight to the permissive nature of a placement order. She was also wrong to assume that there would be less delay in finding a foster placement than an adoptive placement. Moreover, she erred by placing too much weight on the consequences of an adoptive placement breaking down.  Whilst I do not intend to rehearse the entire list of criticisms, I note that the local authority&#8217;s criticism also include the Judge&#8217;s failing to address all the criteria under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/1/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s1(4)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and more generally wrongly preferring the evidence of the guardian over the witnesses on behalf of the local authority. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.75in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The mother and the guardian each argue that the criticism levied against the Judge are ill-conceived and that not only was she entitled to reach the conclusions that she did, but she was correct to do so on the evidence before her. They each argue that in the circumstances of this case adoption was not a realistic option. It was the local authority&#8217;s failing to adduce the necessary evidence that it now seeks to use to highlight the evidential difficulties that erode the integrity of the Judge&#8217;s reasoning. Finally, the local authority&#8217;s application and proposed appeal is founded on nothing more than a disagreement with the Judge&#8217;s decision and the appeal has no merit whatsoever.</span></p>

The thread that binds the plans for the children is their contact during their minority. Following this thread, she recognised the importance of the sibling relationship for both children and continued to consider the plan for K.</span></p>

Indeed, there were ongoing discussion about the timing and funding of a foster placement being kept open should one be found before a suitable adopter is identified. On the evidence before the Judge, she was bound to separately consider the merits of the two options. Indeed, the structure of the evidence followed this path.</span></p>

The concurrent plans that were before the Judge were each of a vastly different nature with significant differences in their suitability to meet K&#8217;s long term needs. The essence of the local authority&#8217;s argument is that the Judge should have left both options open as a suitable outcome for K and to permit the local authority to explore both notwithstanding significant difference in the two options and the properly founded concerns of K&#8217;s guardian. In my judgment, the premise of local authority&#8217;s case on appeal is manifestly flawed, presenting a fundamental misunderstanding of the judge&#8217;s reasoning and the positive duty that is placed upon her to engage with the issues that I have set out above. Furthermore, not only was it properly open to the Judge to reach the conclusion that she did, but it was also the only proper conclusion that she could reach on the evidence that was before her. </span></p>

However, I take this opportunity to address some of the more pertinent issues that arise in this case. There is some evidence of a welcome sea change in the professional and social attitudes to adoption and the preservation of the appropriate familial links in the post adoptive landscape. These changes are at their infancy and I have no doubt that there is a great deal more that we should learn going forward. In my judgment, when  dealing with such cases, judges are entitled to take into account of the broader social and professional barometer. However, each case must be decided on its own unique facts and general assertions about  social norms serve no more than to provide some relevant background. Where the more precise statistical data is relevant to the facts of a particular case, it is the duty of the party who seeks to rely on those to bring those to the court&#8217;s attention. Where a judge identifies the importance of such data, the judge may invite the parties to address the court on those issues. There is nothing in this case that would have placed such an expectation on the Judge. She was entitled to observe the broad well known differences between the two proposed plans. Her refusal of the local authority&#8217;s application for a placement order was based on a number of factors that she weighed into the balance which included the importance of the links between the siblings and their mother.</span></p>

The challenges for those who work in the family justice system can also be its reward. The expectations of the professionals are high. They are called upon to find solutions to highly complex human and social conundrums. As this case illustrates, when planning the future of a child, it is crucial that the care plans are clear, concise and readily understandable. Care plans must address the details of the necessary steps and expected time scale for implementation of each of the options and must be unambiguous about the status of its proposals by identifying if these are parallel plans, alternative plans or plans for contingencies. It is also crucial that care plans and the evidence that informs them are provided to the parties on sufficient notice so that any ambiguities or other issues can be identified and addressed before the court begins to hear evidence. Parents, guardians and the court should not for the first time hear such details of the care plan during oral evidence of the social worker.  Where the care plan provides for alternative or parallel plans in the same document, at the conclusion of the hearing the court may consider ordering a fresh draft of the care plan that the court has approved so as to avoid any misunderstandings about the document that will accompany the child for the reminder of his or her minority. </span></p>

Sadly, this is the inevitable consequence of delay in many cases. Although, I am grateful to the local authority for confirming that it has implemented the approved care plan and has continued its searches for a long term foster care placement for K, this case highlights the need for appeals in such circumstances to be dealt with swiftly. Ordinarily, applications for permission to appeal are dealt with on the papers with a right  by the applicant to seek an oral hearing when permission to appeal is refused. When applying for such permission, the applicant must provide the court with an approved transcript of the judgment that has been obtained expeditiously or a note of the judgment that has been agreed by the parties and approved by the first instance judge. The other parties do not ordinarily respond to the application unless the court has directed them to do so.  Finally, where the respondents to the application speak in unison, unless the court directs otherwise, there is no requirement for them all to be present at the hearing. These are important procedural steps that serve to avoid unnecessary delay and costs. </span></p>
