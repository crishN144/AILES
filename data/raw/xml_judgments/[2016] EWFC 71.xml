This hearing has been, of course, conducted in public, in accordance with the 2015 Practice Direction.  No application has been made for a reporting restriction order.  I have nonetheless considered it appropriate to anonymise this judgment in the interests of the two girls; this means that unusually the two adult respondents are not named.  No formal written application for committal has been filed, under the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">part 18</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> procedure (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">CPR 1998 Part 18</span><span style="font-size:12pt">).  I understand that the case was originally brought before the court for enforcement of the court&#8217;s own motion, once it had been made known that there were alleged breaches of the court&#8217;s order.  Since the restoration of the case, it has been case managed by Her Honour Judge Hallam, who, I am advised, indicated at the first of the case management hearings on 30</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">th</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> September 2016, that there would be no need for a formal application provided there was a schedule of the alleged breaches, supported by evidence.

SF lives very nearby in [address not given].  They are all in the same vicinity.  Their local shop is local to them all.

The court (His Honour Judge Taylor) made a supervision order and approved a plan for the rehabilitation of the girls to the care of their mother.

Given the close proximity in which the family members live, this would be, conceded Ms Beattie, unrealistic.  It was designed, suggested Ms Beattie, to cover that situation where the mother, or SF, initiated, or instigated contact or sought the children or either of them out.  </span></p>

The mother is recorded as having been absent from the hearing when the orders were made; but is recorded further as having had knowledge that the court would be considering such orders and, of course, she has been in a relationship with SF for the whole of the period since March 2016.  I have not, in the circumstances, investigated in any detail whether the orders were in fact personally served upon them.  (See </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">rule 37.5</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">rule 37.8 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010</span><span style="font-size:12pt">).

L has denied being asked by anyone to write the letter.  However, the social worker considers that the language is not L&#8217;s own; this is not the sort of language she would use.  The local authority has, in its closing submission, invited me to conclude that this is not the language of a thirteen year old.  As I observed in the course of submission, I do not have any comparisons of this letter with any of L&#8217;s other work.  </span></p>

SF told me that he went down to the police station to see M.

He said that he brought it sealed to the court.  The envelope read &#8220;For the Judge&#8221; and he gave it to either Judge Matthews or Judge Hallam.

SF told me in oral evidence that he has spoken to the children often since the March 2016 order.

He views contact as something that is arranged.  He believes that the grandparents should not be caring for L and C, he wishes L and C to be returned to the care of their mother and believes that the children have &#8220;been stolen&#8221; by the grandparents.  </span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:-0.02in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The social workers themselves have a responsibility in this case to assist this family to achieve relationships which are free from discord, in the girls&#8217; interests.  Nobody doubts, nobody disputes, that this is an exquisitely difficult situation, with people who feel very strongly about the current situation.  But the injunction that was made in March and the injunction that I have made today are not the best way of dealing with this family.  It is certainly not the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12pt">only</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> way of dealing with this family, and I encourage the professionals involved with the family to do what they can to reduce the tensions in the family, in such a way that the girls can enjoy their lives with their grandparents and enjoy a relationship with their mother.  I do not say what I say to be critical of anyone in the case and I hope it does not come across that I do.  I realise how difficult it is, but injunctive orders and applications for committal are not the optimal way of trying to regulate this family&#8217;s difficult set of relationships.  </span></p>
