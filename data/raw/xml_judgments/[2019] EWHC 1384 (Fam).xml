The risks identified by the local authority stem from KS&#8217;s alleged involvement with gang activity.  That involvement is said to include involvement in so called &#8216;County Lines&#8217; drug dealing, alleged involvement in knife crime and a recent shooting, with the associated risk of reprisals, and continuing possession of or access to firearms.   </p>

The information provided by the police in this case states that between 2017 and 2018 there has been an unprecedented increase in firearm discharges and related organised crime in the south of the city in question, resulting in deaths and gunshot injuries to gang members.  The police consider that this activity places the public in considerable danger. </p>

KS lives with his mother in the south of the city.  Since 2017 KS has been considered to be at risk of criminal exploitation.  The police assessment is that KS is an active member of a named OCG.  That OCG is believed to be involved in violent feuds grounded in attempts to take control of drug trafficking activity in identified areas of the city, further exaggerated by racial tensions.  Police intelligence indicates that KS is presently in dispute with other members of the criminal community in the south of the city.  The </p>

Police exercised their powers of protection pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/46" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 46</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  In September 2017 KS was said to have witnessed a gang related stabbing in the south of the city that took place that month when a young male was stabbed in the neck.  Also in September 2017 KS was found to be carrying a baseball bat and a brick and was arrested for a racially aggravated assault having allegedly threatened a female with a baseball bat and thrown a brick at her.  In October 2017, KS was made the subject of a child protection plan by the City Council.    </p>

No charges were brought on that occasion.   In July 2018 KS was arrested at a festival in possession of a quantity of cocaine on suspicion of selling drugs.  Later in July police received intelligence that KS had been involved in a street altercation in which he wounded a person with a knife.  In October 2018 KS was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon and assault occasioning actual bodily harm arising out of the incident in September 2017 and was made the subject of a Youth Rehabilitation Order for 18 months. </p>

He stated he did not know his attackers and would not make a complaint.  A month later a male from a rival OCG suffered severe knife injuries following a window being broken at KS&#8217;s home address whilst his younger siblings were present.

In March 2019 KS was arrested following a knife attack that Police intelligence indicated was a targeted attack by members of the named OCG. A search of the family home revealed two large knives, one under KS&#8217;s bed and one under the sofa.  Following a strategy meeting, it was agreed that KS could return home on condition that the mother work openly with the local authority.  In April 2019 KS was served with a &#8216;Gun Crime Nominal Notice&#8217;.  This is a &#8216;disruption notice&#8217; designed to alert a person that their activities have generated Police attention and that advice and support is available should they choose.  The Police identified KS as a &#8220;Gold&#8221; gun crime nominal and as being one of &#8220;top six gun crime nominals in the police force area&#8221;.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Thereafter, KS was identified by Police as a suspect in the shooting of an adult male who had been shot in the leg in broad daylight in the presence of members of the public.  KS was arrested on that date on suspicion of attempted murder and bailed.  A search of his property recovered an axe.  Within this context, the police considered that KS&#8217;s life was under threat from reprisals following the shooting.  However, KS rejected advice that he leave the area and reside in alternate accommodation, and refused to accept that he was at risk.  As the result of a Strategy Meeting, the mother was advised to leave the family home with KS&#8217;s two younger siblings and to stay outside the area.  She has done so.  A secure panel meeting concluded that the risks to KS and to other&#8217;s from KS were so high as to warrant an application for an order authorising his secure accommodation. </p>

Indeed, the order made under the inherent jurisdiction purports to delegate to the police power to enter any premises, detain and restrain KS and thereafter transport him to a placement that will deprive him of his liberty.  This part of the order appears to be an attempt to replicate, under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court, the terms of a recovery order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/50" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 50</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

KS was deprived of his liberty pursuant to the order of HHJ Sharpe on 27 April 2019 and placed at a non-secure unit.  However, he absconded from the same on 1 May 2019 and has not been located to date. The local authority has now identified a secure placement, which placement is being kept open and funded pending the location and recovery of KS.  I note that immediately before he absconded, KS had told the social worker that he was willing to remain in the non-secure unit and would adhere to the court order.  He also told the social worker that he was not involved in the shooting in April, was not involved in gangs and did not possess a firearm nor have access to one.  Prior to absconding from the non-secure unit, KS was noted to be a well mannered and pleasant young man, respectful to staff and compliant with the rules and guidance of the unit. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Within the foregoing context, Ms Spencer further submits that it is not open to the local authority to rely on the inherent jurisdiction as the vehicle for obtaining the court&#8217;s authorisation to place KS in secure accommodation.  Mr Spencer argues that this can be the only proper conclusion in circumstances where (a) the use of the inherent jurisdiction in this manner is prohibited by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100(2)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref> as to make the order sought by the local authority would be to require KS to be accommodated by or on behalf of the local authority and (b) the use of the inherent jurisdiction to place KS in secure accommodation would be to cut across a statutory regime that excludes children in KS&#8217;s situation (i.e. children who are not &#8220;looked after&#8221;) from the statutory scheme governing secure accommodation and in respect of which children there is, thus, no lacuna.  Within this context, Mr Spencer argues that the instant case is plainly distinguished from those cases where <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1989 Act</ref> is available but the inherent jurisdiction is invoked in place of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> due to a dearth of secure placements (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re T (A Child)(Secure Accommodation Order) </span>at [1] to [6]).   </p>

As I have noted, the nub of Mr Spencer&#8217;s second submission is that the statutory regime excludes children in KS&#8217;s situation (i.e. children who are not &#8220;looked after&#8221;) from the statutory scheme governing secure accommodation, thus clearly indicating the intention of Parliament in this regard. </p>

First, the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100(2)</ref> do not appear to have been the subject of detailed argument before the court.  Second, whilst the court appears to have entertained doubts about whether the child could be said to be accommodated at [9] to [14], and to have perceived the significance of an answer in the negative, no final conclusion appears to have been reached by the court on that issue.  Third, and importantly, before coming to its decision the court does not appear to have been referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Child)</span>.

With respect to the Art 2 right to life, as pointed out by both Mr Bagchi and Mr Spencer, it has long been established that Art 2 imposes a positive obligation on the State to protect the right to life.  This positive obligation is engaged where the State knows or ought to know that there is a real and immediate risk to life.  In such circumstances, the State must take measures within the scope of its power which, </p>

The positive duty also extends in appropriate circumstances to a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual from another individual or, in particular circumstances, from himself (see <span style="font-style:italic">Mikayil Mammadov v Azerbaijan</span> (2010) Application No 4762/05).  Art 6(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines the child&#8217;s right to life and also embodies a positive obligation to protect the right to life.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has made clear that that positive obligation &#8220;includes protection from violence and exploitation, to the maximum extent possible, which would jeopardise a child&#8217;s right to life, survival and development&#8221; (Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No 6 CRC/GC/2005/6 p 9, para 2). </p>

In the circumstances, this is not a case where a declaration under the inherent jurisdiction is sought by the local authority in order to render lawful a non-secure placement for a looked after child that amounts to a deprivation of liberty due to a lack of suitable secure beds preventing an application under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/25" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 25</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.

In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the effect of the order sought by the local authority under the inherent jurisdiction would be to require KS to be removed from his mother&#8217;s care and be accommodated by the local authority. This course of action is prohibited by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/100/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 100(2)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.   </p>

That end can only be achieved by satisfying the requirements of the statutory regime for accommodating children provided by (amongst other provisions) <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/20" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s 20</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  For the reasons I have given that outcome cannot be achieved in this case under the statutory regime.  In such circumstances, it is clearly established that the High Court cannot exercise its inherent jurisdiction to grant authority to the local authority to accommodate a child where the local authority would not otherwise be able to do so under the statutory scheme (<span style="font-style:italic">Re E (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1773" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1773" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1773</ref> at [16] and <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Jurisdiction: Wardship) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2016/937" uk:canonical="[2016] EWCA Civ 937" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWCA Civ 937</ref> at [39]). </p>

However, the authorities that articulate this positive obligation make clear that it is to be discharged by the relevant public authority through taking &#8220;measures within the scope of its power&#8221; (see <span style="font-style:italic">Osman v United Kingdom</span>).  For the reasons I have given, the orders sought by the local authority lie outside the scope of the court&#8217;s power under the inherent jurisdiction. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">As Mr Spencer points out in his careful and comprehensive Skeleton Argument, any reader of the local authority documentation in this case would be struck by the immense seriousness of this case, involving as it does references to attempted murder, criminal gangs, firearms and &#8216;County lines&#8217; drug dealing. Whilst this court has made no findings in respect of these matters, on its face it is a situation that embodies the seemingly increasing tragedy of vulnerable young people for whom involvement in Organised Criminal Groups is perceived as a means of protection, of belonging, of mattering to an apparently indifferent world and who, in consequence, grasp for these things on a path that ultimately offers nothing but futility, pain and sometimes even death.  As I noted at the conclusion of the hearing, in these circumstances the local authority cannot be criticised for seeking to explore the outer boundaries of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction in an effort to protect KS from the risks it has identified.   </p>

The principle of separation of powers confers the remit of economic and social policy on the legislature and on the executive, not on the judiciary.  It follows that the inherent jurisdiction cannot be regarded as a lawless void permitting judges to do whatever we consider to be right for children or the vulnerable, be that in a particular case or more generally (as contended for here) towards unspecified categories of children or vulnerable adults.&#8221; </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Finally, KS has emphasised through Mr Spencer that he considers that he has been driven away and into hiding by the fear of secure accommodation.  He further indicated through Mr Spencer that if he knew that secure accommodation had been &#8220;taken off the table&#8221; he would co-operate with the police and the local authority and would move away with his family from the area in which he is at risk.  Indeed, if secure accommodation was &#8220;taken off the table&#8221;, KS went so far as to indicate that he would contemplate a voluntary return to the residential unit from which he absconded in May of this year.  KS should now be informed that the risk of secure accommodation has been &#8220;taken off the table&#8221; by operation of law.  It is my hope that, in these circumstances, KS proves to be a person who honours his word and that, in consequence, he will now re-engage with those professionals who, with his best interests at heart, are working so hard to keep him safe and to help him on to a more meaningful and fulfilling path through life. </p>
