That was not the first referral concerning the household in which this mother grew up. She has two brothers who are now 14 and 12 or thereabouts. The decision has been taken by this LA to bring proceedings with a view to safeguarding the children still in the household and there is to be a contested hearing with this LA seeking their removal next week in Portsmouth. </p>

However, this mother is a member of that household and the needs of this minor mother have to be considered. The Guardian and social services have heeded the concern I voiced in that regard and will be providing support and assistance to this mother. I am grateful for that. I am by no means convinced the mother would cope without such help. </p>

I do not propose at this point for me to go through the concerns of the LA which are set out in a threshold document - the basis on which the LA says it can lawfully interfere in this family. Although there are some challenges to the contents of that document, it is not in dispute that this is a case in which the threshold  is crossed and there is no doubt about the lawfulness of the LA&#8217;s involvement and intervention &#8211; which was inevitable in the prevailing circumstances - and it would be idle to pretend that the material before me fails to provide justification for the  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.39in;margin-right:0.08in">I have heard the evidence advanced in support of the local authority&#8217;s case which has very properly been thoroughly tested by Miss Mather.  The evidence is compelling: the witnesses were sympathetic towards this mother &#8211; as am I &#8211; but I have no doubt at all that the orders sought are the only ones which will achieve the statutory aim of securing J&#8217;s welfare throughout his minority and throughout his life.  It gives me no pleasure to reach this conclusion as children should live with their families, if at all possible.  That it is not possible in this case is something for which the mother cannot in any sense be blamed.  I am satisfied that she was set an appalling example and so is ill-equipped to shoulder this responsibility at this stage in her life. </p>

It looked as if it might be possible for him to be with his mother. Later, the professionals concluded that if he were to remain with his mother, there needed to be full time 24 hour supervision. My assessment of the evidence, including the circumstances of the termination of the placement is both that the professionals were right about the level of surveillance and that the placement had to end. This was a stressful and difficult time for the mother.  She was very young, she had had no proper preparation for life, let alone motherhood, her experience of childhood was pretty dire, the engagement required was necessarily onerous, she had had no opportunity to acquire discipline or resilience. In those circumstances, of course her commitment wavered and crumbled </p>

But the evidence of the professional witnesses is completely compelling and I have to prefer the evidence of those who saw her at other times when she did not prioritise her son&#8217;s needs and did not respond appropriately to oft-repeated advice from different sources. </p>

I am sure there are things she has learnt but importantly, although I have huge sympathy with her, there were a number of steps which she could and would have taken to assist her in this task. However, she did not take advantage of the advice she was given and show she was able to plan, to cope and make arrangements for her safely to care for him. </p>
