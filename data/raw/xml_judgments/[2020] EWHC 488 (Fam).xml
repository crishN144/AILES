This is the third judgment that I have given regarding the child. The child was also subject to a judgment of Mr Gupta QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge. </p>

The mother, who is a litigant in person, seeks an order that the child lives with her in England and spends time with his father. In the event that I decide that the child should live in India the mother has indicated that she would return to India to co-parent the child with the father there, but she would not be in a position to do this immediately. The father who is represented by Mr Bennett, counsel, seeks an order that the child lives with him in India and spends time with the mother in England and in India. If he is unsuccessful in that, he seeks to spend time with the child in India and in England.  </p>

He appears to have issued a petition on 4 July 2018 for the restitution of conjugal rights which was followed by a habeas corpus petition in the High Court of Madras on 14 August 2018. The High Court decided to exercise its <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction and took Custodianship over the child. Subsequently the father issued further petitions in respect of the child&#8217;s continued treatment at AIISH and seeking custody. On 10 September 2018 the High Court ordered that the child should remain in the care of the maternal grandparents but be produced for treatment at AIISH; that treatment having ceased on 4 May. This involved travelling for up to 18 hours from the maternal grandparents&#8217; home. </p>

This commenced in January 2020 and is expected to be completed in April 2020. The consequence of the completion of the EHCP will be that the child&#8217;s needs are clearly identified along with the resources which will address those needs. At present it is not known whether the EHCP will identify that the child needs schooling in a special school or not but even if it does not it will identify the level of support that he will need in another school. Having read the various reports about this child it seems more likely than not that the EHCP will accept that he needs to be placed in a special school. </p>

The child&#8217;s needs are quite specific and whilst the mother narrated the routine in a way which emphasised the positives it was clear that it is also demanding. The maternal grandmother came to the UK on a visa which has now expired. An application has been made to extend her Visa to enable her to remain to assist with the child&#8217;s care. She is clearly integral to the current arrangements and indeed has been caring for the child since the mother returned from India to England in July 2018.

She says she has done all that she can in order to access the education, health and social welfare services in this country. The child has been seen by the community paediatrician and an educational psychologist. His EHCP is well underway. She proposes that he moves to Redgate school on the assumption that the EHCP identifies that he needs such provision and a place is available. She and the maternal grandmother undertake a lot of occupational therapy at home and she is seeking support from the local support group of the National Autistic Society. She hopes that speech and language therapy will be provided as part of the EHCP. She may be able to access this through private healthcare if it is not made available otherwise.

The significant negative is the further disruption that it would cause for the child in relation to the change of living arrangements, separation from the mother and maternal grandmother and the change from his current schooling. The assessments from India are not of the same sort of detail as those which have been undertaken in England. Moving the child to India would separate him from his mother who could not move immediately and even if she were able to it is not clear whether there would be further ongoing proceedings in India which would impact on the arrangements for the child.

There is thus no lead application and to approach relocation cases in such a way is to fall into the linear approach trap, which the authorities now clearly disapprove of.  The essential task is to weigh up two or conceivably more competing options as to the country in which the child should reside and the parental care framework, in which the child will live.  That requires a comparative evaluation of the options available.  Such evaluation may be by a balance sheet, but of course one has to be wary of then following a map without contours, which of course can result in a misleading picture and the arrival at an unexpected and probably wrong end point. </p>

Her account of the incident with the burn to the child&#8217;s face was clear and supported by the evidence. The GP&#8217;s conclusion that the burn was consistent with the child falling into the radiator was supported by his having seen photographs of the radiator at the time he saw the child. I&#8217;m satisfied that this was an accident. The only question mark that I was left with was whether the radiator had been off for as long as the mother believed. It is of course conceivable that the maternal grandmother had left the radiator on whilst it was in the living room with her and this might account for the burns being of the nature that they were. The grandmother was not cross-examined on this but in any event it would not change my conclusions as to the mechanism for the accident. The mother&#8217;s account of routines with the child was detailed and insightful and full of affection for her son. She is clearly very highly aware of his needs and attuned to them. I have no doubt that she is an effective advocate of his best interests but also that she is (insofar as a mother can be) realistic and objective in what she considers is best for him. Her distrust of the father and her antipathy towards him were evident both in what she said about him but also in their exchanges when she cross-examined him. However these facets have not prevented her promoting the relationship of the child with the father both through indirect contact, direct contact and through providing information. </p>

He has been diligent in putting together an alternative package which reflects the child&#8217;s needs. However I do not consider he is as objective or as well attuned to the child as the mother. For reasons which I was unable to understand the father had not provided the educational psychologist&#8217;s report or the community paediatricians report to the identified centre in India  and in fact had not been in contact with them since August 2019. Although the information from the identified centre in India suggests that a child with this child&#8217;s needs would not be unfamiliar to them it would surely have been appropriate to disclose those reports to them in order to doublecheck that they were able to meet the child&#8217;s needs. The father said that he thought a transfer of the child&#8217;s care from the mother and maternal grandmother to he and his family would be no more challenging than the transition from India back to England. In my view this is wishful thinking and illustrates the father&#8217;s inability to be objective about the reality. When the child returned from India he came with the mother and maternal grandmother and was returning in effect to the primary care of his mother in England. He was also accompanied by the maternal grandmother who had been a constant feature for the previous 15 months and his primary carer for a year. The father has </p>

The two are so radically different that the father&#8217;s attempt to equate them can only illustrate either his lack of appreciation of the real difference or a desire to minimise for the purposes of this process. Neither is child-centred. The father also was clear in his continued denial of the finding that he stranded the mother and the child in India. He sought to draw a parallel between those findings and the finding in the local district court in India  that the mother had abandoned the child. Of course the finding in this court was the result of a process of oral and documentary evidence which was tested before a judge by advocates on both sides. The finding in India was an <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span> determination and in any event the order was subsequently set aside. Again this illustrates the father&#8217;s lack of objectivity. When the mother was crossexamining him his irritation at being challenged by her was apparent. He sought to dominate the process at times and I got the impression that he was deeply unhappy at being challenged by the mother. Both the mother and the Guardian suggested that the father liked to keep his options open and when he was challenged about the ongoing Indian court process he said that he wished to bring it all to an end. However he was unable to explain why he had not approached the local district court in India at any stage to invite them to discontinue the process. He said that it was not up to him but the court. Even if that were so an application to that court to discontinue on the basis that the English court was now determining matters could still have been made by the father. Although Mr Bennett submitted that there was no evidence that the father had breached any English court order it is plain that the father had resisted the return orders enforcement in India and by maintaining the proceedings before the local district court in India sought to obtain substantive orders in India contrary to my conclusion that England was best placed to determine welfare. In the course of closing submissions the father instructed Mr Bennett to invite the court only to make an order for contact in England were the child to remain living here. The father said that he did not think it would be in the child&#8217;s interests to see the father in India. I was unable to understand the logic behind this and I&#8217;m afraid I gained the impression that the father was responding petulantly to a dawning realisation that the case was likely to move against him. Having said that I would not hold him to that position I later received an email confirming that indeed the father did wish to pursue contact with the child in both India and in England. Although only a vignette this illustrates the father&#8217;s inability at times to remain focused on his child&#8217;s needs and allows his own emotions to cloud his judgement. </p>

The report from AIISH is dated 3 May 2019. It confirms that speech and language, clinical psychological, and autistic spectrum disorder evaluations were carried out. The provisional diagnosis was a spoken language disorder secondary to ASD. Some progress was noted and home training was given. The therapy supervisor recommended discharge from speech and language therapy with advice to continue it at available centres from qualified professionals and to carry out intensive home training. Dr Alu&#8217;s report seems to confirm the diagnosis of autism. She made several recommendations in relation to education and managing frustration. She notes that the child has a stronger liking for routine and predictability than most children of his age and that he may experience distress when things are changed. She noted that it was not always easy to notice how he is feeling. The report of the educational and child psychologist is detailed and thorough. She concludes that his learning is delayed for </p>

The results of her assessment placed the child in the lowest centile in many areas of functioning including difficulties and additional needs (including adaptive behaviours) communication and language skills, daily living skills, socialisation and low scores in fine and gross motor skills. She notes he is showing difficulties in receptive and expressive language, social communication skills, academic progress, following routines and keeping himself safe, expressing and managing his emotions, and motor skills. They are likely associated with his diagnosis of ASD, but also some suspected learning difficulties and negative early life experiences. She makes extensive recommendations in respect of strategies to improve outcomes for the child. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Each of the parties&#8217; proposals clearly contained positives and negatives. Both on their face appeared to be potentially realistic or viable proposals. What emerged in the course of the hearing which in my view fundamentally undermined the father&#8217;s proposal was the lack of any realistic means of implementing it in the short to medium term. Given that the father has only been spending two hours with the child in a supported environment, a substantial extension of the relationship would be required before one could contemplate the child living permanently with the father. This would be so for any four year old but for a child with ASD and a particular need for security and structure the need for a solid relationship based on full-time care is particularly pronounced. Realising this, the father suggested that he remain in England for three months or so and that over that period the relationship be extended. He also suggested that the mother and maternal grandparents could move to the identified local area in India  and that a transition could take place there. However given that the mother is not prepared to do that or indeed financially in a position to do that, and given that there is no evidence that the maternal grandparents are willing to move to live in a city four hours away from their hometown, this would not be realistic. Were the father to remain in the UK for another three months and a transition to be implemented this would involve the child continuing to live with his mother and maternal grandmother, him continuing at school, the EHCP continuing to be developed, and an assessment of the impact on the child of the effect of making changes to his relationship with his father. Thus, in three or four months&#8217; time the court would be faced with reviewing whether it was then feasible for the child to move to India. At the same time as assessing whether the father was then capable of caring full-time for the child and whether the child was capable of making the move to full-time care with his father the court would also be faced with progress in the care arrangements for the child in England. There was no evidence before me of the father&#8217;s home arrangements and whether it was practical to implement a transition here. At present the mother does not know where he is living and the Guardian has not carried out any assessment either of the living arrangements, the others living there or how its location would fit with the child continuing to live for significant periods of time with the mother and attending his school. In addition there is of course no guarantee that the child would be able to manage the transition from the care of the mother and the grandmother into the father&#8217;s care over that three month period and so that &#8216;experiment&#8217; all might come to nothing. In order to explore it further there would have needed to be a further adjournment to explore the practicalities and a clear potential benefit to justify both the delay and disruption. Thus, there was a significant obstacle facing the father&#8217;s proposal. Whilst in the medium to long term it might be a viable solution the route through the short-term to achieving the medium to long term was extremely difficult to discern.  </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">The child is unable to express his wishes and feelings in relation to such a complex issue as with whom he lives and in which country. This would be the case for many if not most children of this age but for a child with the complex needs of the child it is particularly so. I have little doubt that he is content living with his mother and with his maternal grandmother and given the progress he appears to have made since his return to this country, as evidenced by his being able to sit for a snack or his mother&#8217;s recognition of Tamil words that he uses, and the schools and educational psychologist view that he is content at school, he is currently in general terms happy with the current arrangement. Equally it seems from the father&#8217;s account and from that of Ms Magson that he is content seeing his father. It does not appear that seeing his father has had any adverse impact on him but rather he has been content to see him. Given that his mother was his primary carer from birth until July 2018, that his maternal grandmother was his primary carer for the following year and that since July 2019 his mother and grandmother have been his primary carer&#8217;s I think it is reasonable to infer that the child would wish this position to endure. However of course that inferred wish is of relatively limited weight in the overall exercise. I&#8217;m equally prepared to infer from the positive contacts that have taken place with his father that the child would wish these to develop into a more fulfilling relationship. </p>

The diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder with possible developmental delay or learning disability makes him as both parents describe him a special child. The report of Dr O&#8217;Riordan, the educational psychologist concluded that in those areas where he could be assessed the child performed in the lowest centile. His cognitive functioning was not susceptible to assessment given his presentation. The fact that his school consider that his needs can only be met by 1-to-1 support in a separate environment to the other nursery children, and their reports of his limited interaction with other children or indeed even his awareness of others, support the opinions of the community paediatrician and the educational psychologist along with the views of the parents and the report of AIISH that the child is a child with very significant additional emotional and educational needs together with a degree of additional physical needs (albeit these may be a product of ASD rather than any physiological condition).  He will plainly need a very high level of support from his carers, his school, and health services.   </p>

He has been cared for by his mother and grandmother as his primary carer for the entirety of his life. Since April 2018 he has had very little contact with the father, limited to occasional meetings at AIISH, indirect contact and some supported contact. Given that his father is not as attuned to the child&#8217;s needs presently as the mother is and he suggests that the child would manage the change in the same way as he managed the move back from India that suggests to me that the impact is likely to be even more pronounced as the father will fail to appreciate the full extent of the impact on the child and cater for it.  The evidence from the community paediatrician and the child psychologist identify that he may be particularly susceptible to harm around changes in his environment. </p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:0.04in;text-indent:0in">The father&#8217;s plan in India appears to me to be a viable plan. Care has been taken over it and although there are some uncertainties in relation to it the totality of the evidence suggests to me that it would be capable in many respects of meeting the child&#8217;s physical and educational and emotional needs. In India the child will primarily be exposed to Tamil language which may make some aspects of the plan more beneficial. He will be in an environment with a wider network of family support. This would be of benefit to him as well. If his father were able to implement his plan to care for him full-time that would also be of some benefit although I note that the letter from the identified centre in India   identifies that the child would be at their centre for six days per week and so the father&#8217;s presence may be less significant. I also wonder whether the reality would in fact be that the father would dedicate himself fulltime to the care of the child in the medium to long term. He was content to delegate care to the mother and grandmother from the child&#8217;s birth through till April 2018. Two particular areas of concern are firstly in respect of the impact on the child of making the transition into that framework and secondly the nature of the relationship that would be sustained between the child and the mother, or indeed the wider maternal family in India. </p>

When the mother returned to England I do not believe she contemplated such a lengthy separation would ensue. Whilst the maternal grandmother has undoubtedly stepped into the breach the reality for this child is that neither of his parents were caring for him for a significant period of time. This was a consequence of the father&#8217;s actions. I doubt that he contemplated those consequences when he stranded the mother and the child in India. Having been reunited with his mother a further permanent separation from her would I have little doubt be distressing for him and could potentially be significantly harmful.  </p>

However I do not consider that the mother will seek to exclude the father but rather will promote his involvement. </p>

Not only is there the obvious loss simply arising from the fact that the child would be living in a different country to his mother, unless and until she were able to join him, but more importantly is the risk that the father will seek to relitigate matters in India and that the child will find himself in limbo yet again only this time perhaps in the care of his father and with little or no relationship with his mother. The father&#8217;s stranding of the mother and his continued litigation in India together with the degree of antipathy which he still holds towards the mother leads me to conclude that this is a real and present risk if the child lives with the father. </p>

However I am satisfied that the mother&#8217;s contingency plan will enable her to continue to meet the child&#8217;s needs. I&#8217;m also satisfied that she is sufficiently objective in her evaluation of her position and that of the child that she would move to India if that were the best way of promoting the child&#8217;s welfare. </p>

The father&#8217;s appreciation of the child&#8217;s needs is also to some extent clouded by his emotions which are still powerfully hostile to the mother. Notwithstanding his statements that he would promote the relationship with the mother his emotional lability and his enduring hostility to the mother and perhaps her success in securing the child&#8217;s return to England lead me to conclude that there is a real risk of him being unable to meet the child&#8217;s emotional need for a relationship with his mother and the maternal family, were he to be living with the father. </p>
