It is not a long-term therapy, given its slow, continuous nature, the time taken and the anticoagulation requirements to prevent the blood from clotting in the circuit. It is however seen as a very efficient ICU-based therapy, compared with standard haemodialysis, given its slower, gentler nature with less cardiovascular side-effects.

Recourse to the Court is rare. It is, however, uncommon for agreement to be reached once a case has commenced litigation. In that respect, this case is unusual. I have handed down a judgment for two reasons. Firstly, the transparency of the process requires that once the applications have been placed in the public domain, the outcome should be made known, as well as the underpinning reasons for it. Secondly, protracted litigation at the end of a child&#8217;s life can be deeply scarring for all involved and where it can be avoided, it should be. It may be that there are lessons here which may have positive resonance in future cases. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel have considered what factors may have enabled this case to move forward collaboratively. Before I turn to those matters however, it is important that I record that Ms Taylor properly took time, in her submissions, to emphasise that which M particularly wanted to convey. J is far more than the raft of medical problems that this judgment has inevitably had to focus on. She is an immensely determined personality. M reports that she is <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;not a quitter&#8221;</span> and has <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a very strong will&#8221;</span>. She has shown resolve to prove others wrong. When it was said that she would not be able grasp things, she found her own unique way to do so. Similarly, when she was assessed as unable to clap, she found her own way to do that too. She has a subtle sense of humour; her smile reveals three dimples on her cheeks.  I was told that she loved to give <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;high fives&#8221;</span>. Though J has received a great deal of love and care from her family, Ms Taylor signals to me, that they wish to emphasise that she has given them a great deal back. </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">Applications of this nature made late in the day, on short notice, are inherently undesirable. The opportunity to reflect and absorb evidence in this case led to an outcome which is manifestly beneficial to J and in her best interests. Whilst some urgent applications will be inevitable, they can frequently be avoided by careful and sensitive planning; </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">The sensitivity and skill of the doctors and nurses here reflects the reputation of this hospital and its vast experience of these desperately sad cases. Dr K took great care to make herself available to M and to give M space to absorb the extent and significance of her daughter&#8217;s decline. She also helped M marshal and articulate her thoughts at a time when it was difficult for her to do so. The extracts from Dr K&#8217;s conversations with M, set out above, are to my mind, a paradigm of good practice;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">The extant care proceedings meant that M already had her own experienced family lawyers in place, who have greatly assisted her. I have no doubt that has been invaluable and has been a significant factor in achieving this outcome for J and her family. Though such circumstances will rarely arise, it is illustrative of the very considerable benefit to be gained by timely access to independent and impartial lawyers, familiar with the issues and who can help parents navigate them in a way which respects their own parental autonomy. I recognise that the restriction on access to legal aid will not always make this possible;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in">Allied to (iii) above is the fact that M has been positively enabled to examine, absorb, and reflect upon the evolving evidence and to consider the detail of the palliative options. She has not drifted into perceiving the competing alternatives as a &#8216;battle&#8217;, nor in any way led to misapprehend a change of position on her part as &#8220;giving up&#8221;;</p>

It strikes me that such resources might also be utilised in helping parents to evaluate the medical options and particularly so where they do not have access to their own independent lawyers. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are a number of other factors that have been important here but are by no means unique. M has had immensely thoughtful and kind family support. The independent expert, Dr Wallace, provided a report of conspicuous quality. Its thorough and sensitive chronology of J&#8217;s deterioration, the careful identification of the escalating and intrusive nature of medical intervention, and the cataloguing of the extent of the medication generated a clearer understanding of J&#8217;s present predicament by setting it in the context of her medical history. I have a strong sense that all this was helpful to M as she carefully identified where her daughter&#8217;s best interests lay and, unselfishly, distinguished them, as she said, from what she herself would have wanted. I found the care Dr Wallace had taken to paraphrase complex medical language in simple and accessible terms to be very helpful to all concerned and would strongly encourage such practice. </p>
