It has six floors, five bedrooms, an indoor underground swimming pool and access to both a private and communal garden. In total, its area is over 700 square metres. The parties historically employed a retinue of staff: two rota chefs, a house manager, two or three housekeepers, and a laundress in addition to contractors (gardeners, pool maintainers, builders, plumbers, electricians, and handymen). The husband asserts that the property is worth &#163;30.2 million and is subject to a mortgage of &#163;21.5 million. When in the UK, the husband lives in a relatively modest apartment owned by the parties which is located near to the West London property. </p>

Both parties made disclosure of their financial circumstances prior to the execution of the PNA. The husband&#8217;s net worth was said to be $1.064 billion and the wife&#8217;s was said to be $4.471 million. Both parties had advice from, and were represented by, distinguished lawyers. No suggestion has been made that there was any deficiency or pressure within the process leading up to the execution of the PNA. </p>

The MA increased the financial provision that was made to the wife pursuant to the PNA.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The husband seeks to hold the wife to the terms of the Agreements. In simple terms, he says that the effect of the Agreements, if implemented, would be to provide the wife with net capital of &#163;23.5 million plus 18 years of rent-free accommodation at the West London property. The husband says that on any objective view this provision meets the wife&#8217;s needs. Notwithstanding the terms of the Agreements, the husband accepts that he will need to provide interim financial support to the wife pending the determination of whether or not the Agreements should be upheld. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">It is common ground that during the marriage the parties enjoyed an extremely high standard of living. They had the use of properties around the world (including a property located in the heart of the Cap D&#8217;Antibes, to which I will return later in this judgment). The parties employed a significant number of staff at the West London property, as I have described above, and in their other properties. It is agreed that the parties would spend a great deal of time travelling, typically by private plane or first-class commercial flights, and staying in high-end hotels or villas at significant cost. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Following separation in March 2020, the wife complains that the husband, in effect, almost immediately reduced the provision he was making for her. She claims that, prior to separation, the husband had transferred &#163;10,000 per month to her HSBC account and &#8364;20,000 to her Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale account (if not more in some months). He stopped making those payments in April 2020 and, upon being invited to reinstate the transfers in June 2020, declined to do so. The wife says that in December 2020 the husband limited expenditure on her American Express card to $20,000 per month (although this was later raised to $25,000 per month). The wife makes various other complaints about the husband&#8217;s failure to make payment of other outgoings on time (including payment of staff salaries). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The husband&#8217;s response to the wife&#8217;s complaint is that she had been spending at a profligate level and that the time had come to impose some financial discipline. He has said, for example, that the wife spent $273,000 in October 2020 and $185,000 in November 2020 on her American Express card and that that is why he imposed the limit on it. He also denies the allegation made that he has failed to make the payment of various outgoings on time. </p>

The figure for the cost of staff in those properties is &#163;1,113,994, and the husband has calculated that a further sum of household costs of &#163;497,672 is payable giving a total amount for these overheads of &#163;2,781,469.

The reality is that the husband and wife in this case belong to a tiny percentage of the world population who have control and management and entitlement to huge sums of money. The husband in his substantive affidavit in the proceedings has said that for their purposes he is willing that the court should treat him as having now and in the foreseeable future capital assets of not less than &#163;150m. The wife says, although it is in issue, that in marriage he told her that their annual expenditure amounted to &#163;4m.</p>

Thus I conclude that it would be wrong in principle to determine the application on some broad conclusion that if the wife cannot manage at the rate of a quarter of a million a year, she ought to be able to. I think that it is necessary to establish a yardstick that more nearly reflects the standard of living which has been the norm for the wife ever since marriage and for the husband for considerably longer.&#8221;</p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">(i) The sole criterion to be applied in determining the application is 'reasonableness' (<ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18/section/22" canonical="1973 c. 18 s. 22" type="legislation">s.22 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973)</ref>, which, to my mind, is synonymous with 'fairness'.</p>

	  <content>

This is not to say that the exercise is merely to replicate that standard (<span style="font-style:italic">M v M</span>).</p>
	  </content>
	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">(iii) In every maintenance pending suit application there should be a specific maintenance pending suit budget which excludes capital or long-term expenditure, more aptly to be considered on a final hearing (<span style="font-style:italic">F v F</span>). That budget should be examined critically in every case to exclude forensic exaggeration (<span style="font-style:italic">F v F</span>).</p>

	</level>
	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">(iv) Where the affidavit or Form E disclosure by the payer is obviously deficient, the court should not hesitate to make robust assumptions about his ability to pay. The court is not confined to the mere say-so of the payer as to the extent of his income or resources (<span style="font-style:italic">G v G, M v M</span>). In such a situation, the court should err in favour of the payee. &#8230;&#8221;</p>

In the present case, for example, it was not necessary for the wife to provide a specific maintenance pending suit budget. Her income needs as set out in her Form E matched her needs for the purposes of her application for maintenance pending suit. Further, not all budgets require critical analysis. The extent to which a budget or other relevant factors require careful analysis will depend on the circumstances of the case. I return to this below but, in summary, the wife's budget in this case did not require any particular critical analysis; it was a straightforward list of income needs which were easily appraised.&#8221;</p>

Sometimes, as here, enormous sums turn on the decision and it seems to me that just as much care should be taken in reaching it as would be applied to a claim, for example, for an injunction or interim damages. In this case, as mentioned above, the parties have in the financial proceedings already run up costs of over &#163;900,000. For the maintenance pending suit application alone the wife has run up costs of &#163;110,000; I assume that at least that amount has been incurred by the husband. The application was made on 13 September 2021; it is not as if it has come before the court in great haste. It therefore seems to me, given the sums at stake, that the court should try to paint its decision with a fine sable rather than a broad brush, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">where it has the ability to do so</span>. Of course, in most cases the court will not have either the time or the material to conduct an exhaustive investigation and so the exercise will perforce be rough and ready. In this case, it will be seen that the court has not been equipped to conduct the sort of detailed investigation that the costs expended and the time available suggest should have been possible, and so, regrettably, there will be rough and ready aspects to my decision.</p>

Mr Bishop QC contended that the phrase &#8220;costs include insurance costs, charitable donations, entertainment and furniture costs&#8221; meant that the overall total exclusively comprised these elements, and that of these elements only entertainment was relevant for maintenance pending suit purposes. I have to say that I did not read the phrase that way. The use of the verb &#8220;include&#8221; clearly suggests that other items made up the sum in question. More significant was the inexplicable failure of the husband to specify the actual numbers making up the elements which Mr Bishop contended were completely irrelevant for maintenance pending suit purposes. It was striking that Mr Bishop&#8217;s advocacy about this issue was cast in generalities when his client was at all times in a position to instruct his financial advisers to provide the necessary breakdown. I agree with Mr Cusworth&#8217;s submission that the likely reason that no breakdown was supplied was that it would not have been helpful to the husband.</p>

Therefore, the first payment of &#163;71,300 will be on 1 March 2022 and the payments will continue until determination of the substantive proceedings. However, I do not close the door on the wife&#8217;s backdating claim. It will be adjourned and, if the wife chooses to pursue it, determined at the substantive hearing.</p>
