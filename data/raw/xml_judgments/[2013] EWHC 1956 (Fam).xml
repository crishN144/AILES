He is the only child born to the relationship of the mother (hereafter &#8220;the mother&#8221;), and the father (&#8220;the father&#8221;); the mother has two other children: one older, one younger. The parents met in 2006 and cohabited for a period of time; they finally separated in or about February 2012 when the father moved out of the mother&#8217;s home.  In March 2012, the father did not return OB to the mother after an agreed contact visit; this perhaps inevitably provoked court process.  The mother made a &#8216;without notice&#8217; application on 20 March 2012 before DJ Parker at the Croydon County Court and obtained a specific issue order to secure OB&#8217;s return.  She further sought a <span style="font-style:italic">section 8</span> residence order.</p>

In doing so, he raised a number of serious allegations about the behaviours of the mother which, he said, were relevant to the determination of the issues of residence and contact.  I summarise the principal contentions (the list of specific findings was much longer) as follows:</p>

At the fact-finding hearing, I made clear that I did not consider it appropriate to use a label to describe the alleged behaviours of the mother; however (as will become apparent) the use of the term is relevant to the instant application insofar as it is used within the applicable guidance for social workers undertaking assessments, namely the <span style="font-style:italic">Supplementary Guidance to Working Together to Safeguard Children: Safeguarding Children in whom illness is fabricated or induced</span> (<span style="color:#000000">supplementary to </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Working Together to Safeguard Children</span><span style="color:#000000"> (2006)).

Again, I have the notes of the evidence, and Mr. Calway again acknowledges the fairness of the summary (see &#167;29 below).  Following that evidence, the parties entered into discussions which led the Local Authority to indicate a wish to hold a legal planning meeting urgently to consider the case. The parties agreed that the hearing could not proceed, let alone conclude effectively, and given the complications and the difficulties of listing the case quickly in Croydon, the case was transferred to the High Court for urgent directions on 14 December.  The position of the Local Authority was recorded in the face of order, thus:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I regard a local authority in a private law case in which a <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref></span> direction has been given as being sufficiently &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">closely connected</span>&#8221; with the litigation to justify the order; by such a direction the court is expressly inviting consideration of the issuing of public law proceedings.  It should be noted that when a <span style="font-style:italic"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/40/section/37" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 37</ref></span> order is made, the court also has the power (if the relevant &#8216;threshold&#8217; is established under <span style="font-style:italic">section 38(2)</span>) to make an interim care order: see <span style="font-style:italic">section 38(1)(b)</span>.  Although this did not happen here, this power illustrates in my judgment the extent to which the court can, if it considers it appropriate, draw a local authority directly into private law process of this kind and underlines its &#8216;close connection&#8217; with the subject matter of the proceedings.  </p>

The consequence of the Local Authority&#8217;s failure to comply appropriately with the direction of the Court was the inevitable abandonment of the fact-finding hearing in December 2012, the requirement for a further directions hearing, and the consequent delay (with its financial and emotional cost to the parties) in re-listing it in March 2013.</p>
