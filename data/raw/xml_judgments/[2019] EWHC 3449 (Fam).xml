	    <intro>
	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I am concerned with two children, K aged 31 months, and J, aged 11 years. K is J&#8217;s niece as her mother is C, the older sister of J, now aged 24 years. I will refer to C as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the mother&#8221;</span> in this judgment. These proceedings commenced because, in August 2018, the mother was interviewed by the police and alleged that she had been the victim of female genital mutilation [<span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;FGM&#8221;</span>] at the age of 17, her own father and mother [hereinafter referred to as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the maternal grandmother&#8221;</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;the maternal grandfather&#8221;</span>] having arranged for her to undergo FGM during a holiday to Kenya in the summer of 2013. The mother also said she had been a victim of forced marriage. Those allegations clearly raised safeguarding concerns in respect of J who lives with the maternal grandmother and in August 2018 the local authority [LA1] issued proceedings in a county court seeking a Female Genital Mutilation Protection Order </p>

	      <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">In September 2018 the mother issued an application to protect K from female genital mutilation and an application in wardship to prevent K&#8217;s removal from the jurisdiction in order to subject her to FGM. She also sought orders protecting herself from further forced marriage and FGM. The respondents to those applications were K&#8217;s father </p>

K was living with her father and her paternal grandmother at the time the applications were issued. Mr Justice Baker (as he then was) granted the applications sought on 12 September 2018.

Both children are parties to the proceedings, represented by the same CAFCASS Children&#8217;s Guardian. One of the mother&#8217;s younger brothers, F, has also participated in this hearing as an intervenor since the mother alleged that he sexually assaulted her in childhood and assaulted K when the mother and K were living with the maternal grandmother in late 2017. LA1 and the local authority in whose area K resides [<span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;LA2&#8221;</span>] have also been parties to these proceedings. </p>

They asserted that they had not wanted this to happen to their daughters and had fallen out with the maternal great-grandmother in consequence.

The provisions of Part 3A were intended to maximise the ability of those deemed vulnerable to give their best evidence to the court and participate as fully as possible in proceedings. Though there is no definition of <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;vulnerability&#8221;</span> in Part 3A, they are individuals, the quality of whose evidence is likely to be diminished by reason of their difficulties, as opposed to <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;protected parties&#8221;</span>, namely those who lack capacity to conduct the proceedings. The measures set out in Part 3A - such as the deployment of special measures, the use of intermediaries and so on &#8211; address the form of the evidence or, as Mr Bagchi QC put it, the procedural framework in which evidence is given. However, they do not address the substance of the evidence given by a vulnerable person. In this case, the mother has made very serious factual allegations which, if true, would have life changing consequences for those accused, but because of her disabilities (and despite a raft of special measures), it was suggested that she was unable to give either a coherent account of events or an account which had some of the hallmarks of credibility. What allowances, if any, can and should the court make for this? Can evidence from a vulnerable and emotionally labile witness, without independent evidential support, provide a firm basis upon which to ground serious findings such as marital rape, forced marriage and FGM?    </p>

I observe that many vulnerable witnesses are just as likely as anyone else either to tell the truth or to lie deliberately or misunderstand events. It would be unfair and discriminatory to discount a witness&#8217;s evidence because of their inherent vulnerabilities (including mental and cognitive disabilities) and it would be equally wrong in principle not to apply a rigorous analysis to a witness&#8217;s evidence merely because they suffer from mental, cognitive or emotional difficulties. To do otherwise would, in effect, attenuate the standard of proof when applied to witnesses of fact with such vulnerabilities. </p>

First, it is simplistic to conclude that the evidence of such a witness is inherently unreliable. Second, it is probably unfair to expect the same degree of verbal fluency and articulacy which one might expect in a witness without those problems. Third, it is important not to evaluate the evidence of such a witness on the basis of intuition which may or may not be unconsciously biased. Finally, it is important to take into account and make appropriate allowances for that witness&#8217;s disability or vulnerability, assisted by any expert or other evidence available. I have taken all these matters into account in reaching my decision. </p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record-keeping or recollection of the person hearing and relaying the accounts. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person hearing accounts given by others.

Among the longer term consequences are genital scarring, genital cysts and keloid scar formation, recurrent urinary tract infections and difficulties in passing urine, possible increased risk of blood infections such as hepatitis B and HIV, pain during sex, lack of pleasurable sensation and impaired sexual function, psychological concerns such as anxiety, flashbacks and posttraumatic stress disorder, difficulties with menstruation, complications in pregnancy or childbirth, and/or increased risk of stillbirth and death of child during or just after birth.

All three girls and the maternal great-grandmother lived in a refugee camp on the Somali/Kenyan border where conditions were harsh. In October 2003 A, B and C rejoined their parents in England on a family reunion visa. Other than the facts recorded above, there was considerable dispute as to what happened to the mother and her sisters whilst they were living with the maternal great-grandmother. For example, in August 2016, the mother told her GP that she had been the victim of repeated sexual abuse by a family member as a child aged 5/6 years. This would have occurred whilst she was living with the maternal great-grandmother. One matter was certain: both A and B were subject to FGM at that time which was arranged by the maternal greatgrandmother.  A key issue in this case was whether the mother had FGM alongside her sisters or whether, as she alleged, she had FGM in Kenya whilst on holiday as a young woman of 17/18 years.  </p>

She travelled to Kenya with her mother and married him, but then returned to England for a while. She seems to have visited her husband once more in Kenya before the marriage broke down some months later. It was an odd feature of this case that A denied in her oral evidence that she had been married twice though the statement she gave to the police said clearly that she had been married in about 2015. Confirmation of an earlier marriage by A emerged later in the proceedings when her young cousin Q was cross-examined and was later confirmed by the maternal grandmother and grandfather in their oral evidence. Very shortly after A married, B also is said to have met a man on Facebook who lived in Germany. She married him very shortly thereafter and went to live in Germany. Their marriage ended because of his violence to her and B and her two young children now live with the maternal grandfather.  How A and B came to be married are matters relevant as to whether the mother was a victim of a forced marriage. </p>

Her brother, F, was expelled from his secondary school in December 2013 for attempting to strangle a teacher. This happened when he lost his temper after a fight with another pupil. The evidence about his behaviour in school thereafter demonstrated that his school career was fraught with problems. Indeed, F also had substantial behavioural problems which were evident in the family home. He got into fights with his older brothers in the family home to which the police had to be called in 2014, 2015, 2016, and twice in 2017. Neither the maternal grandmother nor the maternal grandfather appeared able to exercise any restraint on the behaviour of their sons and on F, in particular. Though the family were at pains to stress that the home was generally harmonious, I do not accept this. These incidents were, in my view, the tip of an iceberg and I am satisfied that there were many arguments and rows. That was unsurprising given F&#8217;s own problems with temper and the tendency of the brothers to pick fights with each other when even slight disagreements arose. It was also unsurprising as these were small properties &#8211; no larger than four bedrooms with only one bathroom and toilet - which had to accommodate the maternal grandparents, their ten children and the female cousins, P and Q. </p>

She told me that she had a boyfriend and spent a night away from home with him which she said had made her parents very unhappy. She described her mother monitoring her behaviour much more vigorously thereafter.  </p>

How the mother and father came to meet and marry was also a matter of intense dispute as the mother asserted that she had been forced into marriage by her parents. The mother moved to the father&#8217;s home which he shared with his elderly parents on 26 August 2015 where the couple lived on the upper floor of the house separate from the paternal grandparents who lived downstairs.  </p>

He lived with his family in Somalia until he was about 11 years old when they moved to Kenya. The family had a comfortable lifestyle and in 1996 they moved to this jurisdiction. The father went to university and obtained a degree; travelled abroad on holiday; had a variety of jobs until about the time K was born; and enjoyed a wide friendship network. His mother, the paternal grandmother, described him as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;Westernised&#8217;</span> though he told me that he did not like this label.  It was obvious that his life experiences were radically different from those of the mother. The father has one half-sister from his mother&#8217;s first marriage who lives in Canada with her children.  She is separated from her husband. Like all the adult women on the mother&#8217;s side of the family, the paternal grandmother and her daughter have also experienced FGM.  </p>

She became pregnant very shortly thereafter and, at the end of 2015, her medical notes recorded another miscarriage. In April 2016 she was advised by her GP not to become pregnant whilst she was under follow up for the molar pregnancy. The mother&#8217;s medical records showed that she experienced what seems to have been an episode of depression in 2016 when she was prescribed citalopram and the father told me that he had had to take three months off work to care for her. He reported her to have had a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;breakdown&#8217;</span>. Unsurprisingly, it was evident to the paternal grandmother that all was not well in the marriage as, despite her deafness, she heard rows and shouting in the family home coming from upstairs where the mother and father lived. </p>

In December 2016 the father assaulted the mother during a row about whether he should go out to see friends or spend his evening with the mother.

The father admitted this incident to professionals involved with the family.  </p>

Her pregnancy was not an easy one as she was seen in hospital on several occasions with difficulty passing urine and lower abdominal pain. In January 2017 the mother told hospital staff she was very stressed due to financial pressures and debts. At a hospital consultation on 22 February 2017 for abdominal pain and cramps, the mother said she had experienced FGM at the age of 13. Though the notes recorded that the mother declined an internal examination using a speculum, she was described as having had Type 3 FGM. Some discussion was had with the mother about undergoing an FGM reversal surgical procedure and appointments on at least two occasions were made for her to discuss this. She did not attend any of these appointments. On 12 April 2017 the mother told the midwife that she had had Type 3 FGM as a teenager and that her family, in particular the paternal grandmother, were pressurising her not to have the reversal procedure. She said both the maternal grandmother and paternal grandmother were supportive of FGM and that she was scared for her unborn baby girl. The paternal grandmother was said to be giving her a lot of information about FGM, including that her FGM would be reinstated after the mother had her baby. The mother again said she had had FGM at age 13, having been taken to Somalia by the maternal grandmother.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">On 24 April 2017 the mother attended hospital in the early stages of labour and was admitted. During discussion with the medical staff, the mother said she wanted to have a reversal procedure for her FGM but was anxious that her family wanted her to be re-sutured. The medical staff spoke to the father in order to emphasise to him that re-suturing was illegal and that it would be illegal to take the baby abroad for FGM. Labour was prolonged and medical staff wanted to administer an epidural. The mother consented to this but was seen to be upset, telling the medical staff that the maternal grandmother was advising her not to have an epidural as both she and her baby would be disabled. Medical and nursing staff reported the family to be very controlling. The mother eventually had the epidural and K was born although the mother suffered a third-degree tear and episiotomy. The medical records described the mother saying, after K had been born, that she had experienced FGM aged 17. I also note that the medical records stated the mother was seen by a perinatal psychiatrist some three days after K was born. That consultation concluded that the mother had recurrent anxiety in the context of childhood trauma, neglect and recent forced FGM by her parents when she was aged 17. She did not appear to be suffering from depression but had occasional panic attacks arising from K&#8217;s recent difficult birth. She was not thought to be suicidal and was described as having <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;good support&#8221;</span> from the father and the paternal grandmother which meant she was fit psychiatrically for discharge. It is very unfortunate that the psychiatric records concerning the mother have not been available to me during this hearing. The concerns about the extended family&#8217;s behaviour and the mother&#8217;s experience of FGM prompted the midwives to make a child protection referral to LA2. Informed by LA2 of the risk of FGM to J, LA1 conducted an assessment in respect of the risk of FGM within the maternal family but closed the case on 26 September 2017 as both the maternal and paternal family were said to be aware that FGM was illegal in this country.  </p>

By early June 2017 the records showed that the mother had begun to live something of an unsettled existence with K, moving to the maternal grandparents&#8217; house in June 2017 to flee alleged domestic abuse and then, later that month, returning to live with the father before moving into temporary accommodation in early July 2017. By late July 2017 the mother was once more living with the maternal grandparents in LA1, apparently once more fleeing domestic abuse but she was then seen with the father in August 2017. This chaotic lifestyle cannot have been conducive to either K&#8217;s or to the mother&#8217;s overall wellbeing. In August 2017 the records noted professional concern that the mother might have learning difficulties.  </p>

At a GP appointment on 31 October 2017, the father was seen to speak over the mother and the mother was described as looking emaciated. The couple&#8217;s relationship was not explored as they had attended the appointment together. On 18/19 November 2017 the mother moved to a refuge with K and reported domestic abuse from the father. Shortly before moving to the refuge, the mother had been staying in the maternal grandparents&#8217; home where there was an ugly incident during which she and B, her older sister, were assaulted by F. On 1 December 2017 the mother was evicted from the refuge after she brought a man back there and she was then placed in temporary accommodation with K. Before her departure, the mother told the refuge she had been forced into marrying the father by her family.  </p>

Whilst the mother went to the shops, the father reported to the police that he believed K had been sexually abused as he thought her vagina looked <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;big&#8217;</span> and red. It is noteworthy that this observation was not shared by the paternal grandmother who thought K had a sore bottom because she had been wearing a dirty nappy for too long that day. The police found no evidence of abuse, but an ambulance was called and K and her mother were taken to hospital where the father&#8217;s concerns were found to be unsubstantiated. By 23 January 2018 the mother and K were reported by a social worker to be in foster care. On 6 February 2018 the local authority then involved held an initial Child Protection Conference which decided to place K&#8217;s name on the Child Protection Register under the category of neglect. Immediately after the conference, the social worker held a meeting between the parents during which the father said he wished to have the care of K. The mother became very upset and left the meeting, leaving K in her father&#8217;s care. She has remained with him ever since.  </p>

She has lived with one ever since. I have little doubt that her physical problems have been a source of significant pain and emotional/psychological distress for the mother. By June 2018 the mother was living at the maternal grandmother&#8217;s home. She had contact with K from Monday to Wednesday in an arrangement which had been brokered by LA2. Throughout this time, the mother seems to have complained to various professionals that her family were emotionally abusing her and, by the end of June 2018, she was living in temporary accommodation in LA1. This move resulted in the breakdown of her contact with K for many months.  </p>

She attended Accident and Emergency on at least five occasions between 23 July and 2 August 2018 with, variously, chest pains, vaginal bleeding and urinary symptoms. It was notable that, when she attended hospital, she made allegations against the father and her family. On 23 July 2018 the mother had also been allegedly assaulted by another resident at the refuge where she was then living. She reported feeling unsafe in her accommodation because her attacker was also abusing her in the street. On 1 August 2018 the mother initially refused to leave the hospital following a psychiatric assessment. She was said to have suicidal thoughts though had not acted on these. The following day the mother became aggressive to hospital staff when told she would have to go home if her blood pressure was fine and later that evening, after an ambulance call-out, there were concerns she had taken an accidental overdose. Contemporaneously with these events, the mother made allegations against her family and her husband. Thus, in July 2018 the mother reported to ambulance staff who had taken her to hospital that she had had an arranged marriage and had experienced FGM. Amongst other matters, she alleged rape by the father and claimed he had been talking to his mother about taking K to Africa. The mother made similar allegations to the Psychiatric Liaison Service on 1 August 2018. On 10 August 2018 the mother reported to police in LA1 that K and her youngest sister, J, were at risk of FGM and three days later alleged that she had been a victim of FGM in 2013 and had been forced into marriage. Thus began the police investigation into the mother&#8217;s allegations and, consequential upon those allegations, the application by LA1 for protective orders in respect of J and her older cousin, Q then aged 17 years, and the mother&#8217;s own applications seeking protective relief on behalf of both K and herself. </p>

First, she has significant physical problems seemingly consequential on the birth of K, in that she has a urinary catheter which triggers frequent urinary tract infections and abdominal pain especially during menstruation. Second, the mother&#8217;s early life experiences were, on any analysis, traumatic. Together with A and B, she was separated from her own mother at a very young age and left in the care of her maternal great-grandmother. That separation took place in the context of a civil war in Somalia and these three very small girls lived something of a peripatetic existence with their grandmother, eventually ending up in a refugee camp on the Somali/Kenyan border. The mother told me that, whilst in that refugee camp, she was sexually assaulted by older men who came to visit her maternal grandmother. That account was gravely concerning even though I have reservations about whether, had such a finding been sought, I could have made a finding that the mother suffered such profoundly damaging and destructive abuse. If her account is true, the damage to the mother would be incalculable.  </p>

The mother effectively joined strangers in an alien country and her adjustment to them and to life here was very likely to have been fraught with difficulty given what is now known about her cognitive limitations. The family moved house on numerous occasions and the mother reported changing schools very often. It was accepted by her family that the mother had problems communicating at school and, though I had no education records about her available to me at the hearing, I am satisfied that her experience of education left much to be desired.   </p>

This learning disability and its impact on her functioning appears not to have been fully appreciated by her family or the father until these proceedings began. They told me, and I accept, that they had no knowledge of the extent of the mother&#8217;s learning difficulties and it seems clear that neither the mother nor her parents were ever offered help with this issue whilst she was at school. It is noteworthy that some medical and social work professionals involved with the mother also thought she had learning difficulties though no assessment of these was undertaken until LA2 undertook a cognitive assessment of the mother in April 2018. The outcome of that assessment was almost identical to the conclusions of Linda Jeffes. LA2 shared the conclusions of that report with the mother in June 2018, but, unfortunately and unhelpfully, those conclusions were not more widely shared with the family or acted upon by professionals prior to the commencement of the proceedings.   </p>

Her report caused me to invite the Official Solicitor to act as the mother&#8217;s litigation friend. The mother was subsequently assessed by an intermediary, Amy Harrison, who made detailed recommendations as to how the mother might participate in the proceedings and how she might be assisted in giving oral evidence to the court. On 2 October 2019 the Official Solicitor was discharged from acting as the mother&#8217;s litigation friend following a further capacity assessment from Linda Jeffes which concluded that, with the assistance of an intermediary, the mother did indeed have capacity to conduct the proceedings. </p>

Her verbal comprehension abilities were in the Borderline range; her perceptual reasoning abilities were in the Extremely Low range; her ability to process simple or routine visual material without making errors was in the Extremely Low range as was her ability to sustain attention, concentrate, and exert mental control. Thus, her capacity to comprehend information presented visually and verbally was significantly limited and her working memory was also restricted, making information processing more time-consuming and tiring for her than the average person, as well as resulting in frequent errors on a variety of complex tasks. These results also suggested that the mother might experience difficulties multitasking and managing a complex environment outside of the home. Though the mother said she was able to read and understand simple text, she had difficulty understanding and retaining information read to her. She was unable to manipulate numbers reliably beyond 10 and had not grasped the concepts of multiplication and division. She was able to tell the time using a digital clock but her ability to calculate time for planning purposes was poor. Though she was able to recognise coins of various denominations, her ability to add and subtract coins was limited to small sums. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Linda Jeffes concluded that the mother fulfilled the criteria for learning disability. The onset of that disability was likely to have begun before she was 18 years old and her overall functioning was below 70, with impairments in adaptive functioning. The mother was a vulnerable individual who required a high level of protection and support from a Learning Disabilities team and a specialist resource centre. It was possible that the mother&#8217;s intellectual functioning had been compromised to some degree by both mental health problems and a lack of opportunity to access formal education, but Ms Jeffes was of the opinion that her intellectual potential was, nevertheless, likely to be within the Extremely Low/Borderline range. She observed that there was a remarkable discrepancy between the mother&#8217;s presentation and her cognitive ability in that she was an articulate young woman who was able to express her thoughts and feelings, often with clarity. It was however when the mother was required to provide a coherent account of events or to process and retain complex information that her cognitive difficulties became apparent. Miss Harrison&#8217;s report in February 2019 underscored Miss Jeffes&#8217; conclusion in this way: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230; [the mother] is able to use her social skills and the rules of social communication to mask the difficulties she may experience in following conversations around her&#8221;</span>. </p>

She found the mother to be struggling to cope with pervasive psychological and emotional difficulties and she thought it likely that the mother met the DSM 5 criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression and General Anxiety with panic attacks. Linda Jeffes stated that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230; During any assessment situation, it is important to understand [the mother&#8217;s] agitation and hostility in the context of her fragile mental health. Given time, patience and clear boundaries, [the mother] is able to calm herself and re-engage.

Her cognitive abilities fell significantly below the average range, indicating that she had significant difficulties and was likely to struggle to process and make sense of information more than others would. She was also likely to struggle to think in an abstract way and to manage non-verbal thinking and perceptual organisation. Those issues would be further affected by her problems with memory and speed of processing. Though the mother performed better at verbal comprehension, her ability to process verbal information would still be affected by her difficulties with memory and processing in addition to her comprehension of the English language.   </p>

However, the mother had many more breaks in her oral evidence than had been expected. When asked questions in cross-examination she found painful to answer or when she perceived her answer might put her in difficulty, she would leave the witness suite, abruptly forcing a break in the proceedings.

It was painfully apparent that, even between her account and that of her husband, there were significant inconsistencies. Her account for example, that she had left the mother and her sisters in the care of the maternal great-grandmother when the mother was about a year old and had not seen her again until she was eight, was incredible. It was flatly contradicted by the evidence of her husband, namely that his daughters had lived with their parents until about 2001. Additionally, the maternal grandmother&#8217;s failure to acknowledge the frequent and sometimes serious rows in her home even when confronted with the contents of police reports also undermined her credibility. </p>

In his first statement to the court, he said that the mother&#8217;s marriage had been arranged but then told me in the witness box that his statement was inaccurate. He sought to cast doubt in this one matter on those who had prepared the statement yet relied on the remainder of the statement as being accurate. I suspected that he was altering the narrative in order to bolster the case advanced by the father as to how he had met the mother. One significant aspect of his oral evidence caused me to have real doubts about his credibility. For the first time in his oral evidence, he told me in cross-examination on behalf of the mother that, during the family holiday in Kenya in 2008, the maternal great-grandmother had apologised to his daughters for having subjected them to FGM. He simply could not explain to me why he had never mentioned this to anyone before. None of his daughters mentioned this event when all were at ages when they might have been expected to recall it as being significant. I am afraid that I did not believe the maternal grandfather and considered it noteworthy that he gave this account when being pressed to explain why the family had maintained contact with the maternal great-grandmother (it being his </p>

His account of how he came to meet the mother was contradicted by other witnesses and I formed the view that he was being less than frank about the circumstances of their marriage because it would not show him in a good light. </p>

Her evidence appeared to me to be tailored to support the account given by her parents and to protect them and her younger brother, F.  She lied to me about her first marriage even when asked specifically if she had married a man of Somali origin. Her denial of being married to a man other than her present husband was contradicted by her own parents, her brother F and her cousin P. Though embarrassment at a marriage breakdown might have played some role in shaping her evidence, I considered that unlikely given that she told me of a sexual relationship outside marriage before she married her second husband.

That contradicted her statement where she said that the girls went in one by one (a detail with which B agreed).

She had shared a bedroom with the mother and claimed to have witnessed the mother talking to the father on the telephone many times late at night.

He was of the opinion that it would be difficult for a lay person to give a precise description of what had occurred to them in any FGM procedure.

That assessment noted that the mother presented as if she might have learning needs, but no action was taken to explore what these might be.

Though the mother was assessed quite quickly, the outcome of the assessment was not available to the local authority save in outline form until 6 June 2018.

New details were added, most strikingly in respect of alleged oral sex. The inconsistencies in the mother&#8217;s evidence as to where the abuse took place and the alleged details of the act or acts complained of were difficult to explain by reference to the mother&#8217;s cognitive difficulties, emotional vulnerability or poor memory. Miss Henke QC submitted that the mother clearly stated in her police interview that the abuse happened in her bedroom and indeed drew a plan of the bedroom showing where she and F were at the time. In cross-examination, having said that she shared a bedroom with J at the time, she switched the location of the alleged abuse to the toilet. Miss Henke QC submitted that the only logical inference to be drawn from the location switch was that the mother had been caught out in a lie. It was only when the inconsistency between what was said in her oral evidence and what was said in her police interview was drawn to her attention that the mother stated the abuse<span style="font-style:italic"> &#8220;did happen in my room but also in the toilet as well, most of it was in the toilet&#8221;</span>. Miss Henke QC relied on this as an example of the mother adapting her evidence to fit her story rather than telling the truth. Likewise, her reasons for the failure to mention being asked by F for a blow job until she gave her evidence in chief appeared unconvincing. She claimed that she had told the police in November 2017 and did not know why they had not put it in her statement. Later in her oral evidence, she told me she had omitted any reference to the blow job in her March 2019 police interview because she had been too scared. I found it difficult to understand why the mother had withheld the allegation about the blow job from her March 2019 interview given that, on her evidence, she had already told the police about this in November 2017. However, I note that in her November 2017 statement and in her March 2019 police interview the mother made clear although different allegations of sexual abuse against F. Fear of the consequences of sexual abuse being revealed provided no proper explanation for the mother&#8217;s earlier failure to mention alleged oral sex. </p>

It was accepted by F that he pushed B on the sofa, lost his temper and slapped her. He also accepted that he had slapped the mother. He denied slapping K who was in her mother&#8217;s arms when he slapped the mother. Though F accepted that he could sometimes be overcome by anger during a row and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;lose it&#8221;</span>, he did not accept in his oral evidence that he had, either in the past or now, any difficulties with anger management.  </p>

B reported that F had used an open palm and struck K on the forehead and the mother reported that <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;when he slapped me I was holding my baby girl, when he slapped me he also slapped my baby in the face&#8221;</span>. In his statement in these proceedings, F said that the mother and he were arguing and <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;She kept saying &#8216;why don&#8217;t you hit me&#8217;, &#8216;come on hit me, &#8216;why don&#8217;t you hit K&#8217;. She repeatedly tried to provoke me but I could see K was in her hands. When she provoked me to hit K, I approached K, touched her face with my palm and said &#8216;why would I hit K, she&#8217;s just a little baby&#8217;. I told [the mother] &#8216;I would never hit my niece&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;</span>. On F&#8217;s account, this encounter took place before he hit B and then later hit the mother as he was leaving the house. In his oral evidence, he told me that he had slapped the mother when K was in her arms as he was leaving the house but he did not resile from the remainder of his account.  </p>

Though police statements were made by B and the mother later that day and both left the maternal grandmother&#8217;s home with their children to live elsewhere at least on a temporary basis, both B and the mother visited the police shortly thereafter and withdrew their complaints about F&#8217;s behaviour. Despite concerted efforts to obtain the relevant disclosure from the police, I did not have either the retraction statements or the record of the interview given by F about a month after the incident took place. The absence of that material hampered my assessment of the weight which could be given either to the allegations or to their retraction.  </p>

She was simply unable to explain to me why she was saying this. As I indicated earlier in this judgment, I found her to be neither credible nor reliable in her evidence to me on this issue &#8211; I suspect she was desperately trying to achieve what she thought was a good outcome for F and to support the family narrative that the mother was a liar. I thought carefully about whether B&#8217;s police account can corroborate that of the mother and vice versa, but decided that such a conclusion was not open to me. B&#8217;s evidence in the witness box about this issue was simply incredible and I reject it. Given that I have my doubts about the mother&#8217;s evidence on this issue, it would be unsafe for me to conclude that her evidence corroborates that of her sister. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I was left relying on the evidence of the mother and I took into account in so doing the caveat from Linda Jeffes about the mother&#8217;s ability to provide a coherent account of events. There were some difficulties with the mother&#8217;s evidence. First, there were telling inconsistencies in the police statements given by both the mother and B on the day of the incident itself.  The mother claimed to have been slapped three times in the face by F at the same time that he slapped K. B did not mention witnessing this but only recorded seeing F striking K with an open palm. She stated that both she and the mother were slapped in the face as F was leaving the house. Second, both sisters clearly discussed the events of the afternoon before giving their police statements as B spoke of being told by her sister that F had injured B&#8217;s young son, causing him to have a nosebleed. Their accounts were thus likely to have been contaminated by each other&#8217;s recollection. Third, the mother&#8217;s account that, when B was herself present, B&#8217;s young son was kicked by F causing him to have a nosebleed was unsupported by any of the police documents available to me. Had that occurred, I consider it very likely that B would have taken her son to be medically checked and that it would have been recorded by the police. Fourth, in her police statement made about this incident, the mother made allegations of sexual assault against F which I have found were not established to the requisite standard.  </p>

The evidence before me, about incidents in the family home involving F to which the police had been called, was that once F <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;lost it&#8217;</span>, his rage was uncontained and he had no apparent regard for anyone else in the house at the time, let alone for younger children. I do not accept his evidence that he had no problems with his temper or with anger management &#8211; the largely unchallenged evidence about his behaviour (including his own admissions) painted a very different picture. F&#8217;s suggestion that he touched K&#8217;s face with his palm gently in the middle of a heated row with the mother seemed implausible. I remind myself, however, that I found his oral evidence to be a more genuine attempt to tell me what was really going on in this family than the evidence, for example, of his own parents though I acknowledge that his loss of temper might have some bearing on his reliability as a historian.  </p>

Indeed, in cross-examination on behalf of the father, the mother strongly denied that she had ever alleged to professionals that the father had been violent to K. However, during that part of her evidence, the mother alleged for the first time that the paternal grandmother had shaken K violently and demonstrated this to me.  She said the paternal grandmother had also been violent to her. The mother claimed to have told social workers from LA2 about the paternal grandmother shaking K and being violent to her and said they had omitted this from their statements. Both social workers who gave evidence to me confirmed that the mother had never made any allegations to them that the paternal grandmother had hurt K or hurt the mother herself. All the other evidence before me was that both the father and the paternal grandmother had a close and loving relationship with K. </p>

Shortly after her arrival the mother went to the shops, leaving K with her father and the paternal grandmother. The police record stated that the paternal grandmother had <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;allegedly gone to give the baby a bath, noticed a rash on the baby&#8217;s chest and thought the baby&#8217;s vagina was more open than normal and a bit red in colour&#8221;</span>. The paternal grandmother was said to have told the father of her concerns and he then called the police. The mother returned to the father&#8217;s home and the police and an ambulance arrived thereafter to the mother&#8217;s total surprise. K was examined by officers and by ambulance staff and her vagina was found to be normal. The rash was said to be either a teething rash or was caused by K&#8217;s clothes rubbing. The mother told police the allegation was malicious and the father said he did not think the mother would hurt K, but he was concerned about the mother&#8217;s mental health. The CRIS report generated by the police recorded the father&#8217;s allegation as malicious. Officers at the scene were under the impression that both the mother and the father were making allegations about each other as each wanted to have care of K.    </p>

Nevertheless, it must be noted that the father took over K&#8217;s care shortly thereafter on 6 February 2018 following a Child Protection Case Conference. After the conference had taken place, the social worker facilitated a meeting between the parents and the father said, at that point, he wished to care for K.

The evidence pointed away from him having alleged that the mother had sexually abused K. The revised finding sought by Miss McKenna QC &#8211; that he alleged the mother had permitted K to be sexually abused by others &#8211; had no purpose unless the allegation was maliciously made.  The father&#8217;s own behaviour following this incident did not accord with him carrying out a concerted plan to take over K&#8217;s care. Had that indeed been the case and had he pressed his concerns about the mother more strongly, he would have found a ready audience since the local authority then involved had real concerns about the mother&#8217;s mental health, her possible cognitive problems and her lack of support. I suspect that his statement in the meeting on 6 February 2018 that he wished to care for K was made having been present at the case conference and having heard the concerns about the mother discussed at that meeting.  </p>

I note that the father has made an admission of physically assaulting the mother in about December 2016 when she was some 3 or 4 months&#8217; pregnant. This involved him grabbing her by the throat, throwing her into a wall and then onto a bed. This occurred during a row about the father going out to see his friends and leaving the mother at home.  I will return to this allegation in due course as a specific finding is sought about it. During the initial assessment by social services in January 2018 the mother alleged there had been constant verbal abuse from the father and that she was controlled by him. She made further allegations of domestic abuse in March 2018, saying that this began when she was pregnant when the father would become aggressive at the slightest thing and that he was very controlling of her and would not let her visit her family.  In June 2018 the mother told a health visitor that the father was financially, verbally and emotionally abusive to her. In her police interview dated 23 February 2019 the mother described the father slapping her on the shoulder, pushing her and sometimes threatening her that he wanted to snap her neck and leave her for dead.  In her oral evidence to me, the mother said the father shouted at her and called her <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;mental</span>&#8217; or <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;stupid&#8217;</span>.

The paternal grandmother thought this was because the mother was shy and would try to prompt her to go outside. She told me that she could not leave the mother at home alone and took her everywhere with her when she left the house. The father told the paternal grandmother that he argued with the mother because she did not want to leave the house and the paternal grandmother told me that after the mother and father rowed, she would try and calm the mother. She thought both were to blame for the rows.  </p>

With the benefit of hindsight, he had asked himself whether he might have done more to make the relationship work. There was some acknowledgment that he had had little insight into the mother&#8217;s vulnerabilities (though he told me that he had accepted her account of being raped as a child), but he maintained his denial of habitual violence within the relationship. He admitted to me that he did not know in advance of his marriage that the mother had been the victim of FGM but <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;assumed&#8217;</span> she had been. Though he professed abhorrence of FGM and a knowledge of its devastating physical and psychological effects on a woman, the father told me that he had never discussed </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Any analysis of this relationship must be shaped by an understanding of the differences between the mother and the father. As Miss McKenna QC pointed out, almost the only thing they had in common was their Somali heritage. The father was about 15 years older than the mother at the time they married; was educated to degree level as opposed to the mother who had no education until she was eight years old and was then educated in religious schools where she clearly struggled. Her childhood experiences &#8211; life in a refugee camp, her report of rape aged 5 or 6 years, life with 9 other siblings in an overcrowded family home, no social life established outside the family home &#8211; were in total contrast to those of the father. Above all, the mother&#8217;s significant learning difficulties would have affected this couple&#8217;s relationship. Though the paternal grandmother denied the mother was like a child in need of constant supervision, the picture I had of the mother was of a childlike young woman in need of supervision and protection. Even though the father did not have the contents of Linda Jeffes&#8217; cognitive assessment available to him at the time of the marriage, I am satisfied that, despite his denial, the mother&#8217;s evident vulnerabilities and cognitive limitations would have been all too apparent to the father very shortly after they married. The mother&#8217;s need for loving, supportive care was simply not met in this relationship. The lack of common ground, coupled with growing unhappiness and disappointment in each other, was, in my opinion, a potent driver of the marital rows in this relationship. </p>

Once the excitement of the marriage ceremony had worn off, neither the mother nor the father had their needs met in the relationship. Both were responsible for initiating rows though I consider the father, with his intelligence and maturity, could and should have demonstrated more understanding and forbearance of the mother&#8217;s anxieties and vulnerabilities. I consider there was a ring of truth in the mother&#8217;s evidence that the father insulted her intelligence, threatened her with taking another wife and argued with her about her apparent failure to do enough of the domestic chores though I make no specific finding about such verbal abuse. However, I was not satisfied that the evidence permitted me to extrapolate from one admitted incident of domestic violence and, given all the difficulties with the mother&#8217;s evidence, find that the father was habitually violent to the mother in the manner pleaded.    </p>

I had little doubt that this was not a marriage in which there was mutual sexual satisfaction. Within their sexual relationship, the father had no regard for the physical and psychological consequences of the FGM suffered by the mother and I detected little understanding of the emotional and psychological consequences for the mother of her alleged childhood rape. This careless disregard by the father was however a long way from habitual rape.  </p>

The inconsistency could not be explained away and I suspected the mother recognised this at some level when she was cross-examined on behalf of the father, in that she became upset and left the witness suite.  There were also inconsistencies in the mother&#8217;s accounts of what had occurred during the alleged rapes and no account from her in her police interview that she had said to the father on each relevant occasion that she did not consent to sex with him (though she had earlier alleged she had tried to push the father off).    </p>

As Miss Kothari submitted, the mother was plainly in crisis. Her hospital attendances for various symptoms in a period of about a fortnight proved to be occasions where, often as not, the mother made serious allegations. At the time the mother was estranged from all sources of family support; was fearful of assault in the place she was living; desperate for help and comfort; and having no contact with K. Whilst all these events might well have played a role in the making of the rape allegations, I am not persuaded this is the only explanation for what occurred. These difficulties could also be consistent with the effect on a victim of reporting rape and other serious matters to professionals, but they indicated an additional need for a degree of caution when assessing the allegations made by the mother at that time.  </p>

All the men to whom the girls were married were about 8 to 15 years their senior. There was nothing unusual about these matters in the Somalian community. Second, I was sceptical about how each of these couples were said to have met. The maternal grandmother told me that, if her children did not arrive home at about 5 or 6 pm, she would begin to call them to find out where they were. In stark contrast, she claimed to have had no concern about any of her daughters or P meeting men on Facebook and then deciding that they wished to marry them. No evidence of any messages from Facebook between these young women and their respective matches have been produced when it might have been expected that such messages would support the family narrative that these marriages had been love matches. P&#8217;s account of how she had introduced the mother and the father to each other was not one on which I could rely given the difficulties I have outlined with respect to her evidence. The father&#8217;s evidence about how the couple came to meet relied on P&#8217;s account for support but I prefer his earlier statement to the social worker about meeting the mother at a wedding. I also consider it far more likely that the maternal grandfather&#8217;s original written statement that the marriage between the mother and the father had been arranged was far more likely to be an accurate description of what occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, the date on which the maternal and paternal families met at a wedding was not a matter of significance in my view. The maternal grandfather was simply unable to explain to me why that one matter in his written statement was incorrect whereas the rest of the statement, allegedly not properly interpreted to him at the time it was made, was correct. His original statement also, I note, accorded with the oral evidence given by his wife. Third, even allowing for cultural differences, it was difficult to see how A&#8217;s marriage to a man in Kenya and B&#8217;s marriage to a man from Germany could properly be described as love matches. A&#8217;s denial that she had been married before meeting her present husband suggested that her first marriage to a man she had never met was an experience she was at pains to excise from her life story. At the very least, B&#8217;s own evidence was that she reluctantly married her husband following family pressure to do so. </p>

That submission also accorded with evidence that the mother and the father spoke regularly on the telephone and had got to know each other a little better prior to the marriage ceremony even though they had only met a very few times. I watched the mother&#8217;s and the father&#8217;s wedding video, but I was cautious about drawing any conclusions therefrom. </p>

However, I was not satisfied that this was a love match entirely free from family influence as was suggested. Rather, this struck me as a consensual arranged marriage brokered initially by the maternal grandparents after they met the paternal family at the wedding of P to her husband, the father&#8217;s cousin. That the mother&#8217;s marriage was arranged rather than forced fits more neatly with the evidence that the mother and father got to know each other on the telephone and met on a couple of occasions before the marriage ceremony. It was also consistent with the submissions made by Mr Bagchi about the reasons why the mother might have rushed into matrimony. Incidentally, if the marriage was arranged, this might explain the lack of common ground for this couple and, given their respective life experiences and personalities, might also have contributed to their mutual unhappiness once they had been married for a little while. An arranged marriage also accorded with the little that I knew about the circumstances of A and B&#8217;s marriages though I stress I am not making findings about those marriages. The account the mother gave to the police on 16 August 2018 was, in my view, consistent with an arranged marriage.  </p>

Like Dr Markos, I was satisfied that, for all the reasons he gave, the mother would have been an unreliable reporter of the type of FGM she had experienced. Whilst it would have been obvious to her that she had been cut in her genital area, she had no one with whom she could talk about what had happened to her in order either to come to a better understanding or to seek medical help. There was, I am satisfied, a culture of absolute silence about FGM in the maternal family home. Thus, I was less concerned about the inconsistencies about what type of FGM the mother reported to professionals. I also accept Dr Markos&#8217; evidence that FGM did happen to older girls and women although I note his evidence that he had not come across a case involving a woman aged almost 18 years. </p>

This allegation was made to hospital staff on 13 April 2017 and led to a referral to LA2 prior to K&#8217;s birth. The second time the mother made an allegation about FGM was during an assessment by LA2 in May 2017. On this occasion she said she had experienced FGM aged 17 and had been taken <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;back home&#8217;</span> by her father but it was notable that she said the FGM was done without her father&#8217;s knowledge by other members of her family. The third time the mother made the allegation of FGM was on 11 May 2017 during a social work visit when she said she had had FGM aged 13 years. In July 2017 a contact record from LA1 stated that the mother had said she had FGM when she was 16 or 17 years old. She said that her father had taken her to Kenya which was where her maternal grandmother lived, and this was where the FGM was performed. Shortly thereafter, on 10 August 2017, the mother told the social worker that her FGM happened when she was 17 years old. Her father had taken her to Kenya for what she thought was a holiday, but once she arrived, she was told what would be happening. She recalled being in a room with about 10 people during the procedure and that the same thing had happened to her sisters. The social worker noted that the mother initially said she could not speak as she was in the maternal family home and she subsequently called the social worker on the telephone to give her account.  </p>

They held her down and performed the procedure which was Type 4 FGM. Her legs were tied together to stop her from running off. She had stayed in Somalia for six months in total. At the child protection conference held by LA2 on 7 March 2018, the mother alleged she suffered FGM at the age of 18.

She said that she remained in Kenya for one year before she was brought back by the maternal grandfather and then forced to marry the father. The mother gave a video recorded interview to the police on 16 August 2018 explaining what had happened to her. In her court statement dated 11 September 2018, the mother alleged that her FGM took place a few months after she arrived in Kenya in June/July 2013 and said that she returned to England in November 2013 with the maternal grandfather. </p>

Above all, it was prior to the possibility of any legal proceedings being in the mind of any of the parties. At the time when the allegations were first made, the social work records noted that the mother and the father were clear that they did not agree with the practice of FGM.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The police interview given by the mother on 16 August 2018 provided a vivid and detailed account of FGM with little prompting from the officers. There was a detailed description of the building in which the FGM was performed; the description of the ground she was held against (like a beach); a description of the woman who cut her as being very fat and sitting on a chair; a description of the instruments available including a very big needle and a small knife; a description of being held down so that the cutter did not make mistakes or cut her too far, with her head being held back accompanied by the hand gestures of being gagged; a description of the internal pain as the knife/needle went into her; and a description of how her legs were bound and of how she had to be carried to the toilet in order to urinate. One detail added in the mother&#8217;s oral evidence was that she was blindfolded as well as gagged. This did not fit with her description of being able to see the instruments used upon her. The mother has never retracted this allegation or altered it to any significant extent other than as I have indicated. It was accepted that she was taken to Kenya by the maternal grandfather in 2013, arriving on 2 July 2013 and leaving on 13 September 2013.

Third the mother gave different accounts as to how long she spent in Kenya. Fourth, the mother&#8217;s assertions as to having had Type 3 FGM and of being left with only a small hole from which to urinate were at variance with the medical evidence and also with some of her accounts. I have already explained why I was less troubled by the inconsistency in the type of FGM performed on the mother. I was also mindful of her real difficulties with dates and times evident from the report of Linda Jeffes and those differences might well explain the discrepancies as to when, during the trip to Kenya, the FGM occurred. However, the crucial inconsistency, in my opinion, was the age at which the mother said she experienced FGM, an inconsistency which was difficult to explain by reference to the mother&#8217;s cognitive difficulties.  </p>

Putting the inconsistencies in her evidence to one side, the detail given in her police interview suggested lived experience in the relatively recent past rather than a memory of FGM carried out when the mother was a much younger child. It was a more vivid account compared to the accounts given by A, B and P of their own FGM which lacked telling detail and which, in the case of A and B, were contradictory. However, there were very significant concerns about the mother&#8217;s reliability as a witness of fact and it was submitted by more than one of the parties involved in this litigation that the mother had fabricated allegations and had exaggerated and embellished her accounts. </p>

This insistence seemed to me to be entirely at odds with the objective facts, namely the nationality of her parents, their account of having lived in Somalia with their children until forced by war to flee, her own passport and the fact that she herself would have had no memory of life before the refugee camp. Equally odd was her insistence that her parents went to Germany, which is where she said her brothers were born, a matter about which there was simply no evidence to support her assertion. Why the mother might retain these erroneous beliefs was unclear to me but the fact that the mother did underlined the caution with which I had to approach her evidence. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Some examples of what might be said to be fabrication, exaggeration and embellishment by the mother are itemised as follows. First, the mother gave an account of the father hitting and shaking K, but then in her oral evidence said that it was the paternal grandmother who she had witnessed shaking K hard. Second, the mother alleged she was locked in both a closet and in a basement in the maternal family home with no water sometimes for days by the maternal grandmother. I note that this was not an allegation relied upon by Miss McKenna QC in her written submissions given that there was no evidence of the family ever having lived in a property with a basement. Third, the mother for the first time in her oral evidence alleged that F had wanted her to perform oral sex upon him. Fourth, when challenged in her oral evidence with the accounts of others which contradicted her allegations, her response was to make additional allegations against them, for example she suggested that P had seriously physically assaulted her and that her brother, D, had beaten her up and made her lip bleed. Whilst I made every allowance for the difficulties the mother had in giving evidence to me, it was notable how almost instinctively quick she was to make allegations against those who she thought were undermining her. I also bear in mind that the mother&#8217;s significant inability, whether arising from unwillingness or incapacity, to engage meaningfully in the process of cross examination meant that it was simply not possible to explore her account of events, particularly in relation to FGM, in the manner that would normally be expected in a fact-finding hearing. </p>

A was vague in her police statement as to where the mother was when both she and B were being cut. In her oral evidence she said she recalled the mother being next to her face down on the ground and that all the girls had gone into the room where they were to be cut at the same time. That evidence contradicted her statement where she said that the girls had gone into what might be described as the cutting room one by one. She was able to provide pertinent detail about B having been cut badly, bleeding heavily and screaming but she was unable to provide any detail about the mother. B said very little in relation to her memory of being cut when she was a child or as to the mother&#8217;s presence when that took place. In her police interview B gave no descriptive account of the mother being cut but she told me in her oral evidence that she was 100% sure that the mother had been present when she and A were cut. Notwithstanding all the misgivings I had about A and B&#8217;s evidence, it seemed to me that one of the biggest hurdles the mother had to overcome was the inherent improbability that she would not have been cut at the same time as both her sisters.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The evidence given by the maternal grandparents in respect of the mother&#8217;s FGM had many unsatisfactory features. First, the maternal grandmother told me she left the mother when she was one year old and did not see her again until she was eight years old. This was completely contradicted by the evidence of her husband that the family were together in Somalia until almost 2001 when the maternal grandparents left with their sons for Europe via Kenya where they stayed for some time. Second, the accounts given by the maternal grandparents as to where the maternal greatgrandmother was living with their daughters were confused. Third, the maternal grandmother told me that she was opposed to FGM and that she believed the maternal great-grandmother would have been aware of this. This struck me as implausible given the maternal great-grandmother&#8217;s views about FGM and the prevalence of that practice in Somalia even during the Civil War. I note that the maternal grandmother did not however instruct her mother to ask for permission before arranging FGM for her granddaughters. Fourth, in contrast, the maternal grandfather told me that he had given the maternal great-grandmother specific instructions that she was not to have his daughters cut when they were left in her care. This was the first time he had ever said this. This assertion was coupled with an account that he had sent the maternal great-grandmother a cassette tape telling her not to have the girls cut, again something never mentioned before. I consider he was being untruthful about these matters in an attempt to persuade me that he and his wife had not left the girls with a woman strongly wedded to the practice of FGM without trying to restrain her.   Fifth, there were significant discrepancies in the accounts given by the maternal grandparents as to how they discovered that their daughters had indeed been cut. In his oral evidence the maternal grandfather said that they had first been told that the girls had been cut by relatives who had come to this country and then it was confirmed by the maternal great-grandmother on the telephone. The maternal grandmother in her statement said that she found out about the FGM as the maternal great-grandmother had telephoned the maternal grandfather and told him about it. Sixth, the maternal grandparents gave confusing and contradictory evidence about a cassette recording. In her statement, the maternal grandmother said that this cassette recording had been made by the maternal grandfather after they had discovered the girls had been cut. It contained a message from him to the maternal great-grandmother that he would never forgive her, whether dead or alive, for having his daughters cut. The maternal grandfather did not mention this cassette in his statement, but he told me that he had sent a cassette warning the maternal great-grandmother that she should not have the girls cut if she had not already done so. When challenged, he then told me that there had indeed been two cassette recordings, one pre-emptive and one after he knew about the FGM. I consider this evidence was an attempt to reconcile the discrepancy between his evidence and that of his wife and to reinforce his account that he was opposed to FGM. Seventh, the evidence of the rift which was said to have developed between the maternal greatgrandmother and the maternal grandfather was not credible given the family (or </p>

Finally, the maternal grandfather told me in the witness box that the maternal great-grandmother had apologised to him and to all three of his daughters during the trip in 2008. This incident, which would have been very memorable to those present at the time, had not been mentioned by any of the other witnesses and he simply could not explain to me why this significant event had been omitted from any of his own witness statements or from any of the accounts given to professionals involved with the family.  </p>

There was no reference to FGM in circumstances where she was living away from her family and might be thought to be freer to speak out. The mother also had extensive involvement with medical professionals when she became unwell with depression in spring/summer 2016.

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The first mention of a procedure to address the mother&#8217;s FGM was on 19 January 2017 when the mother was pregnant with K. On 22 February 2017 the mother was told that she needed to be seen by a consultant specialising in FGM before she had her baby. The notes recorded the mother had such a <span style="font-style:italic">&#8216;reversal&#8217;</span> appointment on 7 March 2017 which she did not attend. The first account of family pressure on the mother not to have a reversal procedure came from the mother herself who spoke to the midwife about this on 12 April 2017. The midwife noted that there had been three appointments with a consultant in relation to reversal which the mother had not attended <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;because her mother-in-law has told her not to attend&#8221;</span>. The mother told the midwife that the paternal grandmother was isolating her from her family and giving her misinformation about FGM, telling her that FGM was best dealt with in labour and FGM would be reinstated post-delivery. On 27 April 2017, during her labour with K, the mother was recorded by medical staff to be happy to have a reversal of her FGM yet was also reported to be anxious because her family wanted her to be resutured. The medical records noted that the father was spoken to and it was explained to him that it was illegal to re-suture the mother and illegal to take the baby abroad for </p>

The medical records recorded that the family were <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;very controlling&#8221;</span>. In any event the mother had an epidural without incident. On 2 May 2017 hospital records noted that the mother was keen to access the reversal clinic but was prevented from doing so by her mother-in-law who <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;is very controlling&#8221;</span>. Those same records recorded that the paternal grandmother seemed to be very controlling and had attempted to stop the mother having an epidural as it would disable the child. On 3 May 2017 the midwife notes recorded their concerns for the mother that either the paternal grandmother or the maternal grandmother would attempt to have her re-sutured to reinstate her previous Type III FGM. Later, on 3 May 2017, the mother was seen by a perinatal psychiatrist and was reported to have said she had good support from her husband and from the paternal grandmother. </p>

He said that neither the maternal grandmother nor the paternal grandmother accompanied the mother to her hospital appointments. This was confirmed by both grandmothers though the paternal grandmother told me she had been present when the mother had scans during her pregnancy. All three family members denied pressurising the mother not to have FGM reversal and the paternal grandmother and maternal grandmother denied pressurising the mother not to have an epidural. In fact, the maternal grandmother told me she had had an epidural for the birth of one of her children and it was thus nonsensical to suggest that she would pressurise the mother to refuse one. </p>

Miss McKenna QC&#8217;s closing submissions make it plain, however, that the time period in issue ran from about summer 2017 until spring 2018. Her submissions were predicated upon the court being satisfied that the mother had been forced to marry the father and had been the victim of significant domestic violence. She referred me to the mother&#8217;s description of her maternal family having control of her finances and of their constant presence when she spoke to professionals. The finding sought did not implicate the paternal family though I have inferred from the chronology within Miss McKenna QC&#8217;s submission that the behaviour of the paternal family was also alleged to be controlling. </p>

The mother was seen alone and reported that she was happy in the care of her parents. The mother claimed several days later that she was so controlled by her family she had lied to the social worker. I am not persuaded as to the overall case about control of the mother by her family for reasons which I will give below, and this interview did not provide evidence of anything conclusively untoward. First, I am wary of relying on the mother&#8217;s evidence about this interview. Second, any reading of the interview highlighted the detailed discussion the mother had with the social worker about the various ways in which she was being assisted by her family, for example, by making sure she took her antidepressant medication and help with K&#8217;s care. Third, it was notable that the mother was recorded to be able to make decisions without the maternal grandmother&#8217;s intervention when she met with the social workers several days later.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">The chronology attached to Miss McKenna&#8217;s submission does not, in my view, support the finding sought. For example, on 10 November 2017, the health visitor met the mother at maternal grandmother&#8217;s home and was able to speak to her alone. The mother made allegations of domestic violence by the father when she was pregnant but was reported to be happy staying at maternal grandmother&#8217;s home. The next reference by the mother to the behaviour of the maternal family was recorded on 1 December 2017 when the mother had been evicted from the refuge where she was staying. She reported to the refuge that she had been forced by her abusive and controlling family to marry the father. No details were given. On 29 December 2017 the mother said she had tried to live with her parents, but they would not let her out </p>

There were references in the chronology to the involvement of the paternal family with the mother, for example the health visitor seeing the mother and father speak over each other in clinic on 15 November 2017 and the reports made by the mother about domestic violence from the father. I also note that the mother&#8217;s GP rang the social worker involved on 12 February 2018 to discuss the concerns about the mother&#8217;s mental health and learning disability and to express concern about what was said to be her untruthfulness in respect of domestic violence and of her playing one social worker off against another.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">I am not persuaded that the mother was the victim of coercive control by either the maternal or paternal family. Despite what was alleged to be overt control by the maternal family during this period, the mother was able to report the assault by F to the police in mid-November 2017. The maternal grandmother was hospitalised during October and November 2017 having had a kidney transplant and it was thus questionable whether she was able to exercise any effective control over the mother in the manner alleged. The mother left the maternal family home following her assault by F and went to a refuge followed by temporary accommodation. A GP record dated 29 December 2017 noted the mother did not appear to be depressed and was doing &#8220;remarkably well&#8221; given her social history. I observe that the mother told the GP she did not feel threatened by the father despite the history of alleged domestic abuse. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Control by the paternal family during this period is also unsustainable on the evidence before me. The mother had no contact with the father or the paternal grandmother for some time after about mid-November 2017. Indeed the mother took K to see the father at his home on 18 January 2018 so that he might have contact with her. After 6 February 2018 the need for any control over the mother had gone as, put bluntly, K was in the father&#8217;s care with the apparent blessing of LA2. By spring 2018 the mother was, in any event, pre-occupied with her own significant health problems especially those arising from her catheterisation. She had returned to live with the maternal grandmother and complained in late June 2018 that her family were controlling her and taking her money. Nevertheless, she left the maternal grandmother&#8217;s home at that time and moved into a refuge.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.04in">Standing back, the wider evidential canvas suggested that, whilst the mother could be warm, engaging, articulate and calm, she could also be very difficult in her interactions with others. She was not an easy person to help as at times she was happy to accept support and at other times she was adamant she had no problems and did not need help. I note that she attended Linda Jeffes&#8217;s office for a psychological assessment in spring 2019 on two occasions. On the first occasion, the mother was angry and anxious and required much encouragement to even enter the consulting room. She complained that the earlier cognitive assessment conducted by Linda Jeffes had been unfairly critical of her ability to care for herself and her child, but she was able to calm herself and engage for a little while in the assessment. On the second occasion, the mother again arrived in an agitated and unhappy mood. Her manner remained confrontational and hostile for some time before she became tearful and upset about her present circumstances.  The social worker, KP, also experienced the mother as defensive and hostile, describing her ranting at her for about 25-30 minutes. Hospital staff also found the mother to become aggressive when she was told she needed to be discharged in July 2018. Finally, in a telephone call to the children&#8217;s Guardian on 21 October 2019, the mother&#8217;s mood changed rapidly from one moment to another. She sobbed uncontrollably but then became angry, accusatory and agitated to the extent that the Children&#8217;s Guardian did not think a visit from her to the mother would be suitable. Though these observations post-dated the start of the proceedings, my perusal of the social work records supports this reading of the mother&#8217;s personality and interactions with others. She was, despite her real vulnerabilities and cognitive limitations, a young woman with agency who was, by late 2017/early 2018, far from being the passive subject of family control.   </p>

I am however satisfied that, at the point when the three older girls were left in the care of the maternal great-grandmother in about 2001, their parents were not in fact as vehemently opposed to the practice of FGM as they claimed. I find that the maternal grandparents left their daughters in the care of the maternal greatgrandmother in the knowledge that it was highly likely she would make arrangements for all three girls to undergo FGM.  </p>

J&#8217;s unchallenged account that there was a plan by her father to take her to Somalia in December 2018 raises very significant concern given the attitudes of the extended family in East Africa and given the fact that all the adult females in the maternal family have been cut.

However, he submitted that such an order may be unnecessary given what the father told the independent social worker, namely that FGM was repugnant and he would be horrified if his daughter had it. The paternal grandmother accepted in her closing submissions that a protective order in respect of FGM should remain in place subject to provision being made to allow for K to enjoy occasional holidays abroad to non-African countries. </p>

The paternal grandmother filed a statement declaring that she had not been subject to FGM but changed her evidence in the witness box to acknowledge that she too had been cut. The reason for that change in her evidence about this significant matter remains wholly unclear to me. Additionally, the father reported to LA2 in February 2018 that his sister underwent FGM against his mother&#8217;s wishes yet later reported that his sister underwent FGM <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;through choice&#8221;</span> which he was reported to find baffling. In his oral evidence and not entirely convincingly, the father told me that his sister had given him conflicting accounts about her own FGM. As with the maternal family, it was clear to me that the paternal family never discussed FGM between themselves prior to these proceedings. Furthermore, I had little sense from the father&#8217;s or the paternal grandmother&#8217;s evidence they had had any discussion about this difficult issue after the proceedings in relation to K had commenced. </p>
