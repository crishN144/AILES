	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">H, who was born on 31 October 2008 and is 8 years of age was made the subject of care proceedings on the application of Northamptonshire County Council (&#8216;the local authority&#8217;) on 25 February 2016. The final hearing was listed before me on 6 to 8 December 2016. This judgment should be read with judgment I gave at the conclusion of that hearing: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewfc/2016/66" uk:canonical="[2016] EWFC 66" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] EWFC 66</ref> (Fam).</p>

The essential issue in dispute in the care proceedings was whether I should accede to the local authority&#8217;s application for a care order on a plan of long term foster care for H or whether I should accede to the father&#8217;s application for H to be rehabilitated to his care. The children&#8217;s guardian supported the local authority&#8217;s application and care plan.</p>

In the judgment I foresaw a real possibility that in due course H could be rehabilitated to his father&#8217;s care. I expressed the hope that the father would undertake the therapy and courses advised by the social care professionals and abstain from or greatly reduce his consumption of alcohol, so that H could, in the medium term, live with him. </p>

I heard that claim concurrently with the public law proceedings. The Legal Aid Agency (&#8216;the LAA&#8217;) granted a separate public funding certificate to H&#8217;s solicitors to pursue the HRA claim.</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In circumstances which I shall set out in some detail later in this judgment the HRA claim was settled. An issue arose as to whether the LAA would contend that the statutory charge would attach to any damages awarded to H in respect of the costs incurred under the public funding certificate issued in respect of the care proceedings. Ultimately the LAA decided the statutory charge would not apply to any HRA damages awarded to H. The process by which the LAA came to that decision has given rise to the local authority seeking an order for costs against the Lord Chancellor. </p>

The grounds for the claim are set out in the Particulars of Claim and accompanying Skeleton Argument (copies attached) and therefore are not repeated here. My instructing solicitor provides his legal services within the Human Rights proceedings (&#8216;the HR claim&#8217;) under a separate civil legal aid certificate reference number: 300000155379.

Enforcement of the statutory charge undoubtedly would cause grave hardship to H insofar as it would deprive him of the benefits of a monetary award, which the court had decided was necessary to compensate him for State violation of his human rights. I also consider that it may be unreasonably difficult to enforce the statutory charge in relation to a monetary award, which ultimately would be controlled and managed by the Court until H attained majority. It is submitted that this is an appropriate case to realise real benefits to the public at large insofar as it must be in the common good for a victim to have access to a process of restitution when State authorities fail to maintain the highest standards of professional conduct and competence and for &#8216;justice to be seen to be done&#8217;. </p>

However, in this case, there is a clear distinction between the care proceedings and the HR claim. The HR claim was made by freestanding application. My instructing solicitor has been careful to ensure that the services provided under the HR claim legal aid certificate are limited to issues pertaining only to the HR claim. Moreover, the case management and determination of the HR claim is provided for separately to that of the care proceedings and are not dependent upon the outcome of those proceedings. Therefore, in the event that the LAA seeks to recoup costs, it would not in my view be appropriate or proportionate to include the costs incurred under the public funding certificate in the care proceedings. </p>

I note that counsel refers to the Human Rights proceedings being freestanding however I am unable to make a final decision as regards the statutory charge position without the full facts being available to me.

Plainly in the ordinary run of cases where the party is pursuing or defending the claim for his own benefit through solicitors acting as such there is not usually any justification for making someone else pay the costs. But there will be cases where either or both these two features are absent. In such cases it will be a matter for judgment and the exercise by the judge of his discretion to decide whether the circumstances relied on are such as to make it just to order some non-party to pay the costs. Thus, as it seems to me, the exceptional case is one to be recognised by comparison with the ordinary run of cases not defined in advance by reference to any further characteristic.&#8221;</p>

The quantum of any damages awarded in respect of the HRA claim, pursuant to s.25 LASPO and the Civil Legal Aid (Statutory Charge) Regulation 2013 (&#8216;CLA(SC)R&#8217;), is immaterial to a determination of the applicability of the statutory charge in any particular case. </p>

Only in a wholly exceptional case &#8211; and I confess that at present I have difficulty in envisaging such a case &#8211; could it possibly ever be appropriate to follow the procedure adopted in the present case, of treating the human rights arguments as raising a discrete issue to be hived-off for hearing in the Family Division whilst the care proceedings continue in the FPC or the County Court. There is no justification for splitting a case up in this way. If the case really requires to be transferred up then the whole case should be transferred.</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">(3)<marker name="tab"/>Thirdly, there is no basis for transferring a care case up from the FPC to the County Court or from the County Court to the High Court merely because one of the parties seeks to raise a human rights argument or to rely on a Convention right. I dissent entirely from any suggestion that the FPC or the County Court is, as such, incapable of dealing with such points. Of course, a care case may raise some genuinely novel or complex human rights argument that can only be dealt with in the High Court. But that will not be so of the general run of such arguments. Most human rights claims in this area of the law involve no more than the application of principles which are now not merely well established in the Strasbourg jurisprudence but also expounded in the increasing number of reported domestic cases which have analysed and summarised this jurisprudence. The present case is a good example of the point. The FPC is, in my judgment, quite capable of determining by reference to the relevant domestic authorities &#8211; many of which, as it happens, I have referred to in this judgment &#8211; whether, as the mother alleges, the process here was flawed and unfair. Evaluating whether the local authority&#8217;s care plan is wrong, as she asserts, is precisely the kind of exercise that every court hearing care cases &#8211; the FPC included &#8211; has to deal with every day of the week. The procedural issue to which the present case has given rise perhaps needed to be resolved by the High Court; but that I have now done, I would hope for once and all. The substantive issues in the present case are quite within the capacity of the FPC or the County Court. They do not, in my judgment, require a High Court judge. (I note in passing that I have not been referred to a single decision of the European Court of Human Rights.)</p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">(4)<marker name="tab"/>Next I should like to emphasise two practical points. Human rights arguments should be identified and brought to the attention of the court at the earliest possible opportunity; and if a care case is to be transferred up that should also be done at the earliest possible opportunity and as quickly as possible. It is most unfortunate that in this case, where the point arose following a decision taken on 21 November 2002 and embodied in an amended care plan filed on 29 November 2002, and where the mother&#8217;s application was received by the FPC on 24 December 2002, it was not issued by the FPC until 30 January 2003, not heard by the FPC until 12 February 2003 and then not considered by the High Court until 19 March 2003. The National Protocol which is due to take effect later this year is going to require that, save in exceptional or unforeseen circumstances, every care case is to be determined not later than 40 weeks after it has first been commenced. In the present case the choice of what can now be seen to have been an inappropriate procedure has consumed almost four months &#8211; the period from 21 November 2002 to 19 March 2003 &#8211; and that in a case which started as long ago as 11 March 2002. Such delays are quite inconsistent with an overall timetable that requires care cases to be concluded within a little over nine months. I do not in any way criticise those involved in the present case, who were faced with a procedural problem to which the answer was not clear and who can be forgiven for deciding to proceed as they did. I hope that the position is now clear and that similar delays will not be allowed to occur in future.    </p>

There may, of course, be some other reason why it is necessary to invoke the inherent jurisdiction &#8211; for instance if some difficult question of medical treatment arises whilst a care case is on foot &#8211; but the existence of a human rights argument will not of itself require or justify the invocation of the inherent jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I respectfully agree with Munby J&#8217;s general proposition that a court hearing public law proceedings should deal with any associated HRA claim brought by one of the parties to the care proceedings. His concern was to prevent the proliferation of satellite litigation in respect of HRA claims. The judgment should not be read, and was plainly not intended to be read, as requiring a party seeking HRA damages to issue his or her claim within the existing public law care proceedings. On this basis the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re L</span>, and the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Re V</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>may be distinguished from proceedings in which a HRA claim is pursued and damages are sought. Therefore, where the remedy sought in the HRA claim is not limited to injunctive or declaratory relief but includes a claim for damages, it is almost inevitable that those representing the Claimant will be well advised to issue separate proceedings and to seek the issue of a separate public funding certificate because of the potential applicability of the statutory charge in respect of any HRA damages awarded.</p>

Detention by the State is, on any view, a very bad business.  The award of damages - although they are customarily modest - should reflect the fact that it is only in Article 5 (5) of the Convention that compensation is mentioned.  However I do not accept that awards of damages for State detention pursuant to the Convention are a class apart from all other types of damages.  I do not accept that because they are awarded to Mr Faulkner as a victim of human rights violation that they should be subjected to a process of immunisation in the way that perhaps damages for personal injury or an award of damages for, say, the loss of an eye or a leg would not.  Naturally, State detention is a bad business but the consequences of many personal injuries are far more long-enduring than temporary State detention as happened in this case by virtue of delay in convening a Parole Board hearing.  </p>

Public funding in such cases is non means tested and non merits based.
