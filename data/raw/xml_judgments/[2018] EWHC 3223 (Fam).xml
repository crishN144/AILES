The application is in respect of two children, C who was born on 4th March 2010 and is eight years of age and D who was born on 9th&#160;November 2012 and so is five years of age.  The mother of both children is Ms A and the father is Mr B.  They have a third child, E, who was born on 19th May&#160;2014 and so is four years of age, she currently lives in the care of the parents.  </p>

The adoption agency in this matter is Edinburgh City Council who support the making of an adoption order in favour of Mr. and Mrs.&#160;X, as does the children's guardian.  The mother and the father both oppose the application and seek the return of children to their care or, as the father submitted at a late stage in this hearing, there be some form of shared parenting arrangement between the mother, the father and Mr. and Mrs.&#160;X.  </p>

	  <intro>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The early background in this matter as set out in the judgment of Sheriff Corke on 26th January 2016.  In brief the parents are both Nigerian nationals.  The father arrived in this country in 1996 and was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2013.  The mother arrived in 2006 and was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2016.  They commenced a relationship at some time in 2008 or 2009.  This relationship has been punctuated by lengthy separations.  In about 2010 the mother was diagnosed as being HIV positive.  On 18th&#160;September 2012 there was a domestic incident between the parents which led to the police being called.  Subsequently the parents separated and on 24th October&#160;2012 the mother moved to Edinburgh with C when she was heavily pregnant with D.  D, as I have said, was born in&#160;November 2012.  Edinburgh City Council asserted that it had provided support for the mother over a lengthy period of time but, unfortunately, the mother's mental health deteriorated seriously, as did her ability to provide adequate care to the children.  Accordingly, on 23rd&#160;May&#160;2013 both C and D were accommodated by the local authority and have not since lived with either parent.  </p>

	      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his judgment of January 2016 Sheriff Corke described the circumstances which led the children's reception into care as follows: </p>

		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">"On 23rd&#160;May&#160;2013 the mother, C and D were found living on the internal stairwell leading up to their flat surviving on crisps and biscuits.  The stairwell was littered with dirty nappies.  The mother was praying constantly and repetitively in an agitated state and felt she was being terrorised by spirits.  On 23rd&#160;May&#160;2013 C and D were voluntarily accommodated due to the mother's decline in mental health and ability to look after the children.  She was admitted to the Royal Edinburgh Hospital as an in patient on a voluntary basis suffering from acute intransigent psychotic disorder rather than schizophrenia.  This was consistent with a brief psychosis of schizophreniform-type such being very common in the postnatal period.  Low mood and a perception that she was being terrorised by spirits was consistent with depression with an anxiety order as well.  The mother responded well to anti psychotic medication.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thereafter on 10th December 2013 both children were made the subject of compulsory supervision orders.  On 24th August 2014 Edinburgh City Council applied for a permanence order with authority to adopt in respect of both children.  On 15th February 2015 the sheriff made an interim order granting such authority.  On 14th April 2015 the children were placed with Mr. and Mrs. X where they have since remained.  On 26th January 2016 at the conclusion of a long judgment, the application for permanence orders was refused by Sheriff Corke who considered it reasonable for there to be an attempt of rehabilitation of the children to the mother and the father, but not to one or the other.  The local authority appealed this decision to the Sheriff Appeal Court.  On 27th February 2017 the appeal court dismissed the appeal.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, the local authority approached the British Association of Adoption and Fostering to secure the services of a culturally appropriate independent social worker to assess the parents.  Julia Hughes was instructed as the independent social worker and undertook an assessment.  Her report dated 16th May&#160;2017 did not recommend rehabilitation to the mother or to the father, whether solely or jointly.  </p>

An order terminating the contact was made on 20th March 2018.  The father has not had contact since the children were accommodated by the local authority over five years ago.  After her birth E was made the subject of care proceedings brought by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in May&#160;2014.  She was made the subject of an interim care order on 27th May&#160;2014.  There then followed a residential assessment at the Jamma Umoja Centre which ended on 5th December 2014.  Because of what was considered to be the success of that assessment the local authority's plan changed from one of adoption for E, for her to remain living with her mother.  On 5th January 2015 the court made a supervision order for twelve months.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have the benefit of a report prepared for the purposes of these proceedings by Kim Black, a social worker with responsibility for E's case employed by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.  There were issues about the care of E relating to neglectful parenting and the unsettled life of the mother.  The mother decided in late 2017 to place E with maternal family members in Nigeria and she arrived there on 2nd&#160;November 2017.  In consequence the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea closed E's case.  E was returned to this country in May&#160;2018, whereupon the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea re-opened their case and I am told that an assessment is under way which may result in care proceedings being brought once again in respect of E by that local authority.  </p>

Mr.&#160;B lying about his marital status and not providing details of his wife is just one of many examples of this deception and lack of co-operation.  I consider there is uncertainty about the proposed placement with both parents, where the parents' proposal for the children to be placed in a supported relationship is not a secure and stable alternative.  This is a temporary solution in the wake of a relationship that did not work whilst the parents were in a committed relationship.  It is therefore not likely to work now they are separated.  I am therefore not able to recommend the children return to their parents' care either together or separately.  I consider that the children are likely to suffer emotional harm by being removed from their current carers and being moved to their natural parents who they do not have a secure relationship with.  Indeed, both children have no relationship with Mr.&#160;B and D has no emotional relationship with his mother."</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reject the assertion that the social workers from Edinburgh or from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the independent social worker, have lied in their reports, statements or evidence.  I further reject the allegation that there has been a conspiracy by Edinburgh City Council and/or any other professionals to place C and D come what may to adoption.  Neither assertion has any foundation whatsoever.  I accept the evidence of Professor Billington who was extremely measured and persuasive in his evidence that D could not now transfer his secure attachment from Mr. and Mrs. X to mother or the father.  For C it might be possible but it would be a painful process for her.  </p>

First I reject any notion that Edinburgh City Council did deliberately delay matters as alleged.  There was no foundation for this allegation whatsoever.  Second, as I shall explain, whether this adoption application was made six months ago, a year ago or two years after placement, it is extremely unlikely it would have made any difference to the conclusion I have reached.  </p>

Father said he would sacrifice his marriage for the children.  He originally said he would support the mother caring for the children until such time as the local authority was satisfied that the mother could care for them alone when he would return to his wife.  These two positions cannot be reconciled.</p>

This finding is reinforced by the fact that I am satisfied that both are lying to me about the current state of their relationship and living arrangements.  </p>

I am satisfied so that I am sure that the children would suffer very significant physical, emotional and psychological harm if they were in the care of the mother or the father.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst a return to the parents' care is excluded, does it follow an adoption order should be made?  The clear answer is no, unless there are very cogent reasons for doing so.  I accept the parents' case that prospective adopters, albeit Nigerian, are of a different tribe and from a different area of Nigeria and thus they have a different cultural and value perspective from that of the parents.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An adoption order would sever the birth parents' relationship with the children and with their full sibling E and their half siblings, H and G.  I note that H has only met C twice when she was a baby.  She has never met D.  G has never met C or D.  E, of course, has met both when she attended contact with the mother.  Whether E remains in her mother's care is a matter for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, of course, and, ultimately, the Family Court that would be invited to determine any application for a care order.  On the evidence before me I simply comment that there are serious questions to be answered as to whether E should or should not remain in the care of her mother or of her father.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Would a lesser order, such as a child arrangements order or a special guardianship order provide C and D with the permanency and security they need?  The father suggested late in his evidence that a collective parent arrangement with Mr. and Mrs.&#160;X would work for the children.  This suggestion is utterly absurd.  The notion arose at the very end of his evidence.  It was plain that the mother very vociferously did not agree.  In my judgment it would be nothing short of a disaster for the children.  The mother is so viscerally opposed to Mr. and Mrs.&#160;X caring for her children that an order less than adoption will not provide for the permanent future stability and security or to enable them, as Professor Billington put it, to achieve their full potential.  </p>

There can in my judgment be no more graphic illustration of the phrase nothing else will do in the welfare interests of the children than that children are adopted by Mr. and Mrs. X.  </p>

In fairness to the parents neither have yet sought to attend the same or to go to [the place where the adopters live].  The fear, however, which I fully share and understand, that if an adoption order is made, one or both of the parents will seek to travel to [the place where the adopters live] in search of C and D and/or go to the home of Mr. and Mrs.&#160;X.  The risk of them doing so is significant.  The consequence of them doing so would result in grave emotional and psychological harm being caused to both children.  </p>

The parents both refuse to consent to such adoption.  I am satisfied, pursuant to the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/52" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 52</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>, that each child's welfare requires me to dispense with the consent of the mother and of the father and I do so.  I make adoption orders in respect of C and D in favour of Mr. and Mrs.&#160;X.  I will also, as I have indicated, make an injunction against the mother and father under the inherent jurisdiction.  </p>
