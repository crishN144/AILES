Having referred in her first affidavit to the impending implementation of the CPA and the potential &#8220;downgrading&#8221; of her Canadian marriage to the status of a civil partnership under its provisions, she states:</p>

I do not wish my relationship with Celia to be recognised in this way because we are legally married and it is simply not acceptable to be asked to pretend that this marriage is a civil partnership.  While marriage remains open to heterosexual couples only, offering the &#8220;consolation prize&#8221; of a civil partnership to lesbians and gay men is offensive and demeaning.  Marriage is our society&#8217;s fundamental social institution for recognising the couple relationship and access to this institution is an equal rights issue.  To deny some people access to marriage on the basis of their sexual orientation is fundamentally unjust, just as it would be to do so on the basis of their race, ethnicity, and nationality, religion, or political beliefs.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I believe that the argument of &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; is unacceptable because: (a) there should not be separate sets of laws for recognising different&#8211;sex and same-sex relationships; and (b) marriages and civil partnerships are clearly not equal.  They are not equal symbolically, when it is marriage that is the key social institution, celebrated and recognised around the world; and they are not equal practically, when it is apparent that civil partnership is a lesser alternative, which will not be recognised around the world, or even across Europe.  Even if the rights and benefits conferred by civil partnership are identical (at least in practical terms) to those conferred by marriage within Britain itself, this is not so beyond its boundaries&#8230;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">21&#8230;. I want my marriage, and same-sex marriages more generally, to be recognised in Britain, and elsewhere, because I want to be able to refer to Celia as my wife and have that immediately and unproblematically understood as meaning that she is my life-partner with all the connotations and social consequences that using the term &#8220;wife&#8221; or &#8220;husband&#8221; has for a heterosexual couple.  I want our marriage to be recognised institutionally by banks, insurance companies, the tax office, and so on.   This symbolic status of marriage as a fundamental social institution is, in many ways, as important as its formal legal status.  It provides for social recognition of key relationships, and to have our relationship denied that symbolic status devalues it relative to the relationships of heterosexual couples.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Marriage is understood internationally and represents the highest form of recognition for a committed relationship (described by many as the &#8220;gold standard&#8221;).  But this has more than symbolic significance for us.  It has a practical bearing on issues such as whether one of us will be recognised as the other&#8217;s next of kin in an emergency.  Having our marriage recognised in our home country would lend weight to our relationship when we are travelling to places which do not have the same respect for same sex relationships.&#8221;</p>

They also provide for the breakdown of the civil partnership in much the same way as marriage.  The issues before me have been argued upon the basis that the financial and other material rights created in civil partners under the CPA are essentially equivalent to those of married persons.  However, there are express distinctions observed between the ceremonies and processes of the two institutions.  In particular, civil partnership may not be effected on religious premises, or in a religious ceremony and civil partnership is an institution exclusively open to same-sex couples.</p>

Section 3 enables language to be interpreted restrictively or expansively.  But section 3 goes further than this.  It is also apt to require a court to read in words which change the meaning of the enacted legislation so as to make it Convention-compliant.  In other words, the intention of Parliament in enacting section 3 was that, to an extent bounded  only by what is &#8220;possible&#8221;, a court can modify the meaning, and hence the effect of primary and secondary legislation.&#8221;</p>

Assuming incompatibility with the Petitioner&#8217;s Convention rights (which is denied), so-called interpretation or &#8220;reading down&#8221; to the opposite effect is not possible.  Accordingly any remedy of the Petitioner in respect of those statutory provisions is, in any event, limited to a declaration of incompatibility.  However, recognition of the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman does not involve any violation of the Petitioner&#8217;s Convention rights under Article 12 or Article 8 as currently interpreted in European jurisprudence.  That being so, there is no discrimination under Article 14, because Article 14 is not free-standing, and relates only to discrimination which falls within the ambit of one or more of the other Convention rights.  </p>

If, which Ms Mountfield does not accept, the CPA is to be regarded as discriminatory under Article 14 by denying to same sex couples the title and status of marriage, then such discrimination is justified and within the margin of appreciation accorded to individual States under the Convention.</p>

The solution which it reached was that there should be statutory recognition of a status and relationship closely modelled upon that of marriage which made available to civil partners essentially every material right and responsibility presently arising from marriage, with the exception of the form of ceremony and the actual name and status of marriage.  Parliament ostensibly passed <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1973/18" uk:canonical="1973 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, not because it felt obliged to in order to comply with the norms of European law or the rulings of the European Court or the ECtHR, but because it elected to do so as a policy choice.</p>

In that regard, it finds that it is artificial to assert that post-operative transsexuals have not been deprived of the right to marry as, according to law, they remain able to marry a person of their opposite sex.  The applicant in this case lives as a woman, is in a relationship with a man, and would only wish to marry a man.  She has no possibility of doing so.

The court noted the growing tendency in a number of European States towards the legal and judicial recognition of stable de facto partnerships between homosexuals.  The court considered that, despite this there was still little common ground in the Contracting States.  This was an area where the Contracting States &#8220;still enjoy a wide margin of appreciation&#8221;.  The court held that, accordingly, the applicant&#8217;s relationship with his late partner &#8220;does not fall within Article 8 in so far as that provision protects the right to respect for family life&#8221;.</p>

By the reference to &#8220;margin of appreciation&#8221; in this context I do not understand the court to be saying that each Contracting State may decide for itself whether the relationship between same-sex couples constitutes family life within the Convention.  If that were so, the effect would be that, as applied to same-sex-couples, family life in Article 8 would have a different content from one Contracting State to another.  That would be surprising.  Rather, the court was saying that, in the present state of Strasbourg jurisprudence, Contracting States are not required by the Convention to accord to the relationship between same-sex couples the respect for family life guaranteed by Article 8.  For the time being the respect afforded this relationship is a matter for Contracting States.&#8221;</p>

Article 8 is about non-interference of the state with a person&#8217;s private life, family, and home.  In certain situations it implies or imposes a requirement to take some positive steps, where to do so is a necessary inference from the duty to respect a protected area.  However, any necessity to protect the private or family life of childless same-sex couples does not extend to recognising them as married.

It was introduced and has effect as a measure to afford equivalent legal rights to same-sex partnerships as are available to opposite partners through marriage.  By withholding from same-sex partners the actual title and status of marriage, the Government declined to alter the deep-rooted and almost universal recognition of marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman, but without in any way interfering with or failing to recognise the right of same-sex couples to respect for their private or family life in the sense, or to the extent, that European jurisprudence regards them as requiring protection.  Withholding of recognition of their married status does not criminalise, threaten, or prevent the observance by, such couples of an intimate, private life in the same way as a married heterosexual couple and indeed provides them, as so far European jurisprudence does not dictate, with all the material legal rights, advantages (and disadvantages) of those enjoyed by married couples.  Not only does English law recognise and not interfere with the right of such couples to live in a very close, loving, and monogamous relationship; it accords them also the benefits of marriage in all but name.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.62in">Nonetheless, Ms Monaghan argues that, when Articles 8 and 12 are read in combination with Article 14, the failure to accord the status and title of marriage, together with the provision of the CPA which treats a foreign same-sex marriage only as a civil law partnership, there is nonetheless a breach of the non-discrimination guarantee contained in Article 14 sufficient to justify a declaration of incompatibility.  She acknowledges that Article 14 is not free standing i.e. it depends upon there being discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth elsewhere in the Convention.  However she relies upon the fact that Article 14 may apply even if there is no violation of a substantive Convention Article, it can nonetheless be shown that there has been discrimination on any of the grounds (i.e. differences of status) set out in Article 14, if the facts of the case fall <span style="font-style:italic">within the ambit</span> of one or more of the substantive Convention rights.  In this respect, and it is not in dispute, besides the express requirement of Article 14 to secure the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention without discrimination on the grounds of sex, the words &#8220;or other status&#8221; which appear at the end of the Article include sexual orientation: see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v Portugal</span> [201] 31 EHRR 47 at paragraph 28.</p>

Although each of them is capable of extremely wide  application,  the Strasbourg jurisprudence  lends no support to the suggestion that any link, however tenuous, will suffice.  Rather the approach to be distilled from the Strasbourg jurisprudence is that the more seriously and directly the discriminatory provision or conduct impinges upon the values underlying the particular substantive Article, the more readily it will be regarded as within the ambit of that Article; and vice versa.  In other words the ECtHR makes in each case what in English law is often called a &#8220;value judgment&#8221;.&#8221;</p>

In that case, the court held at paragraph 26 that the refusal to grant the applicant a Parental Leave Allowance could not amount to a failure to respect family life, since Article 8 did not impose any positive obligation on states to provide the financial assistance in question.

What sets them apart is one of the very features which Article 14 protects, namely that of their sexual orientation.

She submits that simply to assert, as Baroness Scotland  stated in  Parliament (see paragraph 51 above) that the form and content of the Civil Partnership Bill was dictated by the desire of the Government to continue to support marriage and to recognise marriage as  the surest foundation for opposite sex couples raising children, is to give a vacuous and insufficient reason because , to add same-sex couples to the ranks of those able to be married is unlikely to discourage heterosexual couples in that respect.  Recognising same-sex marriage will not diminish the validity or dignity of opposite sex marriage in anyway. Ms Monaghan submits that the only discernible reason for the refusal to recognise same-sex marriage is that of pre-disposed bias and a negative attitude towards homosexuals, which cannot constitute a legitimate aim: see <span style="font-style:italic">Smith &amp; Grady v UK </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2000) 29 EHRR 493" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">(2000) 29 EHRR 493</ref> at para 97; and <span style="font-style:italic">S.L. v Austria</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2003) 37 EHRR 39" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">(2003) 37 EHRR 39</ref> at para 44; and <span style="font-style:italic">Ghaidan </span>(supra)<span style="font-style:italic"/>per Baroness Hale at para 143.</p>

Neither has the personal or sexual autonomy of the Petitioner been invaded, nor has she been criminalised, threatened, or humiliated in anyway.  So far as the matter is put on the basis of her <span style="font-style:italic">family</span> life, the Convention has yet to recognise a childless same-sex relationship as constituting family life.  However, even if that were not so, the withholding of recognition of the relationship between the Petitioner and first Respondent does not impair the love, trust, mutual dependence and unconstrained social intercourse which are the essence of family life and the matter falls outside the ambit of Articles 8 and 14 combined.</p>

Ms Mountfield&#8217;s submission is straightforward, namely that, since it is clear that Article 12 of the Convention does not apply to recognition of same&#8211;sex relationships at all, but only to the right of a man and a woman to marry, as recognised in the domestic laws of the respective Member States of the Council of Europe, there can be no question, by resort to Article 14, that the  State&#8217;s failure to recognise the Petitioner&#8217;s Canadian marriage as valid in this country, amounts to a failure to secure the right and freedom to marry set out in Article 12.  </p>

However, as pointed out by Lord Nicholls in <span style="font-style:italic">M </span>(at paragraph 14), the more directly a discriminatory provision impinges on &#8220;the values underlying the particular substantive Article&#8221;, or its &#8220;core values&#8221; as described by Lord Bingham (at paragraph 4), the more readily will it be regarded as falling within the ambit of the Article.  As I have indicated at paragraph 86 above, Article 8 is concerned with positive measures and &#8220;de facto&#8221; situations. By way of contrast, Article 12 is concerned with &#8220;de jure&#8221; rights, questions of status, and restrictions imposed on the right to marry and found a family according to national laws.</p>

In this connection it seems to me that the question is whether one treats the core value(s) of Article 12 as being concerned only with restrictions placed on the right of opposite sex couples to marry, or more widely as concerning generally the limitations placed upon the rights of an individual to marry the partner of his/her choice.  I propose to adopt that broader approach by treating the matter on the basis that, although Parliament had no positive obligation under the Convention to take steps to redress the perceived social disadvantages experienced by same-sex partners as compared with married persons, by embarking on legislation designed to alleviate such social disadvantage and passing the measures contained in the CPA which provided for recognition and treatment of a foreign marriage as a civil partnership only, brought the facts of the Petitioner&#8217;s situation within the ambit of Article 12.</p>

The institution of marriage is afforded a particular status within the framework of the Convention, namely as a union between parties of opposite sex.  Challenges to legislative provisions for financial benefits which discriminate on the grounds of marital status have been held in a number of cases (a) not to involve comparable situations and (b) to be justified in any event as not exceeding the margin of appreciation afforded to Governments, see for instance <span style="font-style:italic">Shackell v UK</span> (App No 45851/99):</p>

The Canadian court found that the existing common law definition of marriage violated the equality rights of the applicants under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55/section/5/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.5 (1)</ref> of the Charter and declared the existing common law definition of marriage to be invalid to the extent that it refers to &#8220;one man and one woman&#8221;, reformulating it as &#8220;the voluntary union for life of <span style="font-style:italic">two persons</span> to the exclusion of all others&#8221;.</p>

The last finding was linked to a finding alia that same-sex couples in Canada did not enjoy access to many Government benefits, by way of contrast with the position under the CPA.  Finally, the court was not concerned with, let alone obliged to have regard to, any margin of appreciation accorded to Convention States in relation to these matters.</p>

The judgment of Sachs J in that case is both moving and impressive.  However, the decision of the court was reached on the basis of criteria provided for in a Constitution the provisions and requirements of which were in very different terms from those of the Convention and against a different historical background and social history.  Equally, the court was equally unconcerned with, and manifestly disinclined to recognise, any margin of appreciation in relation to the equality rights guaranteed in the broad terms of the Constitutional provision under consideration.</p>

There was in South Africa no statutory or other provision such as the CPA which recognised, on a basis of broad equivalence, the status of a long term same-sex relationship, upon which the State could rely.  Further, the Constitution granted powers to the Constitutional Court to develop the common law, taking into account the interests of justice (s.173) and expressly provided that, when applying a provision of the Constitution to a natural or juristic person, the court, in order to give effect to rights under the Constitution &#8220;must apply, or if necessary develop, the common law to the extent that legislation does not give effect to that right&#8221; (s.8 (3)).

Again, as it seems to me, this would be an inappropriate and ineffective exercise.  I have already made clear that I do not consider that the provisions of English law are incompatible with the Convention.  In addition, however, to accept Ms Monaghan&#8217;s suggestion would run counter to public policy, as expressed in the provisions of the CPA which require that a foreign same-sex marriage such as the Petitioner&#8217;s be treated as a civil partnership.</p>
