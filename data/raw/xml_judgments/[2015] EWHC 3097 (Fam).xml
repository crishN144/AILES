The tragedy is that any given couple or family tend only to experience such waste and folly on a single occasion, and if they learn the lesson at all, they learn it too late.  </span></p>

The parties and their lawyers first came into court at 10.35 a.m. this morning.  At my urging, they have spent considerable periods of time out of court during the course of the day endeavouring to settle the case, whilst indeed I have been engaged also on another case.  No settlement has been reached and I am now saying these few words at 4.20 p.m. after the mother, indeed, has now already left to return to Paris where she lives.</span></p>

But I do wish by these short words to record the situation that appears to exist in this case and to redouble for the last time today my intense efforts to promote negotiations and agreement, including, very importantly, compromise.  </span></p>

As a matter of fact, the father does not have any current contact or real relationship with the child. </span></p>

Unfortunately he allowed arrears to accumulate.   The mother brought enforcement proceedings against him here in England, in which, in May 2014, Sir Paul Coleridge quantified the arrears as &#163;12,000 and required the father to pay them by instalments.  </span></p>

Ms. Deborah Bangay, Queen&#8217;s Counsel, and Mrs. Rebecca Bailey-Harris, who are both very generously acting free of charge for the father, strongly say that now there are indeed no outstanding arrears and that there may even have been some small element of overpayment.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">As I understand it, Mr William Healing, the solicitor-advocate on behalf of the mother, contends that there is interest due on those arrears and that, taking account of interest, the father still owes something of the order of &#163;3,000 to &#163;4,000.  I mention that so far as I am aware, there is no statutory provision for interest upon maintenance here in England and Wales; but, of course, as the underlying order is a French order, interest may be due under the terms of the French order, or the general law of France.</span></p>

He does indeed have to pay maintenance also for another child aged 10 from a previous relationship, and the essential thrust of his case is that he simply does not have enough net income to go round.  Accordingly, the father has issued an application to the courts of England and Wales for a variation downwards of this underlying French maintenance order.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">Relatively recently, last month, the solicitor on behalf of the mother, who demonstrates considerable expertise in the interlocking web of English, French and European law, has issued an application that seeks that the father&#8217;s application to vary the maintenance downwards be stayed for lack of jurisdiction in the courts of England and Wales.  He has made clear today that the use of the expression &#8220;stayed&#8221; in his formal application is an error, and I will indeed give him permission (effective only from the date of service) to serve an amended application that seeks that the father&#8217;s variation application be struck out and not merely stayed.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">So issue seems to be joined between great experts in European law on both sides in this case, on the issue of whether or not a maintenance order made in another Member State of the EU can be varied here in circumstances in which the mother has already sought the assistance of the English court to enforce the order.  </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">This all appears to turn upon what is meant by &#8220;an appearance&#8221;.  As I understand it, the argument on behalf of the father is that as a result of an agreement by the mother earlier this year to the father pursuing remedies here, she has now, for the purposes of the relevant European law, entered an appearance, thereby vesting this court with jurisdiction.  Mr Healing, on behalf of the mother, does not accept that.</span></p>

Accordingly, there is, essentially, only one listing direction that I can make today, as I do, which is that all remaining applications between these parties are to be listed for final hearing on a date to be fixed on the first open date, with 2 days allowed.  I will also make various directions as to disclosure and discovery, to which it is not necessary to make fuller reference in this judgment.</span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-size:14pt">The underlying maintenance order in this case is for about &#163;10,000 a year.  At the outset today, Ms. Bangay made clear that the father, in any event, offered to pay at the rate of &#163;5,000 a year, a figure increased during the course of the day to an open offer of &#163;6,000 a year.  So, as an annual figure, the underlying dispute here between these parties was as to &#163;5,000 and is now as to &#163;4,000.  </span></p>

That, however, is, in a sense, a discrete matter.  The legal obligation to pay those costs undoubtedly exists, and will persist, independently of the present proceedings.</span></p>

Of that &#163;30,000, the father is, of course, required to pay her &#163;12,000 under the order of Sir Paul Coleridge, of which he is currently in breach.</span></p>

Against that, Ms.&#160;Bangay very strongly says that this is not the scenario of a bullying father.  Rather, it is the scenario of somebody who has suffered a very considerable drop in his income and is now struggling very hard to make ends meet.</span></p>

In discharge of the duties of the court under rule 1.4 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, I have repeatedly today encouraged, urged, cajoled and ultimately hectored these parties to try to resolve these differences.  Despite that, and despite having a considerable amount of time in which to do so, they have been unable to do so.  </span></p>

That is not acceptable to the mother, who has said that she wishes to continue to receive &#163;10,000 per annum under the existing order, and &#163;25,000 in settlement of all outstanding costs, including the &#163;12,000 already owing under the order of Sir Paul Coleridge.</span></p>

Although CPR rule 38.6 does not apply to family proceedings, that particular rule indicates that when a party discontinues an application, ordinarily he should pay the costs incurred up to the date of discontinuance.  </span></p>

They need to remember that once upon a time their relationship was such that they conceived this child.  He is at the centre of the conflict.  Whatever their differences, he clearly needs to be provided for in a way that is fair and just to both parties, but also meets or contributes to his needs.</span></p>
