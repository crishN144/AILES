The father also claims that the mother was aware from a very early stage in the marriage that she identified as being transgender.  The mother does not accept this.  She says that the father suffered from passing bouts of anxiety and depression, becoming worse from 2013 onwards, but that the father could not explain these to her.  In September 2013, the police came to the home after receiving a report that the father had complained to another person of feeling suicidal. </p>

The mother denies this, but explains that, on professional advice, she told the younger children that their father was in London and not well.  A&#8217;s counsellor, Mr R, told him about the changes that his father had undertaken.  A was very shocked and upset, and initially didn&#8217;t believe him.

Local authority children&#8217;s services were briefly involved, but the case was closed.  The issue then belatedly re-emerged during these proceedings, after the mother discussed it with a worker at a children&#8217;s centre in May or June 2016.  She says that at this point D had made a similar statement to her at bath-time.  This led to a renewed investigation and finally in August D, by now aged five, was spoken to by police and social services.  In August, he was interviewed under ABE conditions.  The father was interviewed under caution and strongly denied any improper behaviour towards D or any of the children.   </p>

In September, the local authority completed a Children and Families assessment and closed the case.  The assessment concludes that there are no concerns because the father is not having contact with the children.  If she was, consideration should be given to a comprehensive risk assessment to ensure that the children were not at risk of harm.  Assessments of this kind (ducking the issue) are regrettably common and are of no real value to the children and families concerned.   </p>

It has not played any significant part in the hearing or in the professional assessments.  Such statements as D has made are weak and contradictory and the process of investigation has been unsatisfactory from start to finish.  Having reviewed all the evidence, I conclude that there is no credible evidence that the father has behaved in a sexual manner towards D or any of the other children.

From the age of six she had felt unhappy with who she was, but did not speak to anyone during childhood.  There were some good days, but she experienced a consistent nagging feeling of incongruity that was very painful in the community setting.  She could not expect any sympathy so she kept silent and prayed to God to make it go away.  She had attempted to delay marriage and after it arrived discussed the problem with the mother, but they had both treated it as <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;a stupid, silly issue&#8221;.</span>  She (the father) was ultra-Orthodox and her beliefs would not allow this.  At times she was able to repress the feeling through deep religious devotion.  The prospect of having to leave the marriage came up many times, but the mother would make threats that she would never see the children and would be ridiculed and shunned by the community.  In 2006 or 2007, she called the Samaritans and from 2011 began to speak to people outside the community.  She came to realise that this was her reality, that it was not going away, and that she would have to make decisions.  She twice attempted suicide by taking pills.  Since transitioning, she had not had suicidal thoughts.  In 2014, she began to speak to a therapist outside the community, without the mother&#8217;s knowledge.  In 2015, she contacted the organisation Broken Rainbow and they gave her the confidence to leave.  She described the decision as one that ensured the children would have two living parents.  While this was going on, there were no outward changes, and she continued to perform her religious observances. </p>

Although the mother was already bearing the greater share of the parenting responsibilities, it has been a profound shock to find herself in the socially anomalous position of being a single parent, and not at a time of her choosing, compounded by the unprecedented difficulties arising from the father&#8217;s transgender status. In common with the professional witnesses, I looked for signs of malice towards the father in the mother&#8217;s evidence, but could find none.  Instead, the abiding impression from her evidence and from that of the father was of mutual incomprehension, of parents who had over the years become emotional strangers, and for whom the dramatic end to the marriage acted as a final severance.  The mother, plainly a capable person, has responded to events in a child-centred way within the limited horizons of her upbringing.  Her evidence was as sincere as that of the father.  Although it was given in a more matter-offact tone, the stresses beneath the surface were evident. </p>

An approach of this kind, practically amounting to a belief, raises itself to the surface, usually in worst-case scenarios.  This is a social cultural reality, not a valid Orthodox reason for separating children from parents. There is a lamentable habit of censoring.  Children of divorced parents can be seated separately from other children and he had experience of this, something he described as beggaring belief.  In his view, this should not be accommodated or excused in Jewish or English law.  On the other hand, he had never heard of total ostracism in practice, provided the contentious matter was treated privately within the family, and not paraded before the community.  However, he accepted that ostracism for these children could very possibly happen if the situation was not managed correctly with professional help.  What was needed was psychological support: religious teachers should be kept out of it. </p>

However the loss of contact with children is one that is relevant here and not constrained to this case.  If one partner leaves the community, the community tries to minimise the exposure of the children to the outside world.  The fight to reduce contact can continue for years despite court orders giving the [absent] parent access...

Exposure to the outside world is seen as dangerous for the children, who are educated to believe that the world is hostile to the Jewish community.  It is common for the parents to claim that the children will be shunned by the community if they are exposed to outside knowledge.  In practice, if the courts order access in a conventional way, the community will adapt, as will the children.  Historically, Jewish communities hold the law in high regard and will make contact arrangements work once ordered by the court, though they will expect the family to offer no compromise and be seen to fight tooth and nail.  What is important is that they have not colluded in an agreement. </p>

If the family of the transgender person nevertheless seeks, or indeed is forced, to maintain contact with that person, they will open themselves up to very serious consequences indeed.  The families around them will effectively ostracise them by not allowing their children to have more than the most limited contact with that family&#8217;s children.  The impact on the family in such circumstances in terms of social isolation will be devastating. </span></p>

It will no doubt be argued against this approach that it is cruel, lacking in tolerance, unnecessary and denies the rights of the father.  But Torah law (Halacha) has the same approach to English Family Law in this type of situation, regarding issues of residence and contact, that the interests of the children are paramount.  In other words the father is expected to give precedence to the needs of the children over his own needs." </span></p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">In his statement, Rabbi Oppenheimer had likened membership of the community to membership of the club or political party.  Membership is based on a contract and if a person chooses to leave the club, they must accept the consequences of their actions.  In his evidence, the Rabbi dropped this analogy.  He nevertheless asserted that under the Torah and in reality a person is considered to have a choice, albeit a difficult one, as to whether they become transgender.  If they do, they choose to place themselves outside the embrace of the community.  In Torah law, to be gay or transgender is to be a sinner.  Even though it may be looked on with compassion, and some people may extend the hand of friendship, that does not alter its unacceptability.  The mother could not remain married to a person who made that decision.  She should still seek in a constrained way to promote respect for the father but at the same time to protect the children from the consequences until they are old </p>

He stated that he fully accepts that there is a clash between the Torah and the equality laws designed to uphold the rights of protected categories of person, though he sought comfort in certain more peripheral paragraphs of the DfE Equality Act Guidance for schools [3.29-30], rather at the expense of the central theme of Guidance as paragraphs [2.6-7] &#8211; see paragraph 49 above.  The heart of the issue, he said, is that the norms of society (seen in the protected characteristics) are at loggerheads with the best interests of the children (as seen from his perspective).  As to Rabbi Abel&#8217;s emphasis on respect for the parents, he considers that the obligation clearly falls away where it would cause pain and suffering to the children. </p>

Those challenges will continue, and may increase with the ongoing process of transition.  It is no surprise that the father is, in my view, weighed down emotionally.  Although she looks to the future in a positive spirit, I cannot share her view that she is now emotionally strong and confident.  In my view, the professional witnesses are correct to assess her level of insight as uneven in consequence of other pressures.<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"/>Her decision to co-opt A into her struggles was a serious misjudgement.  The emails to the teachers and others were unwise, seen from the children&#8217;s point of view, whether or not they were in any way justified.  The road to direct contact, even approaching matters with maximum optimism, would be a hard one, requiring a very high level of collaboration.  It is predictable that there will be anxiety on the part of the mother and flare-ups on the part of the father when difficulties arise.  The consequences would depend on the circumstances, but could mean additional problems for the children, either directly or indirectly with other family members or third parties weighing in.</p>

Some witnesses in these proceedings assert that gay or transgender persons have made a lifestyle choice and must take the consequences.  The law, however, recognises the reality that one&#8217;s true sexuality and gender are no more matters of choice than the colour of one&#8217;s eyes or skin. </p>

The currency of the law is the recognition, protection and balancing out of legal rights and obligations.  In this case, to be recognised and respected as a transgender person is a right, as is the right to follow one&#8217;s religion.  Likewise, each individual is under an obligation to respect the rights of others, and above all the rights of the children. </p>

I can see no way in which the children could escape the adult reaction to them enjoying anything like an ordinary relationship with their father.  In the final analysis, the gulf between these parents &#8211; the mother within the ultra-Orthodox community and the father as a transgender person &#8211; is too wide for the children to bridge.  They would be taught one thing in their daily lives and asked to do the opposite on repeated, conspicuous forays into the outside world, which they would have to keep quiet about afterwards.  The mother, a religiously observant person, would be required to sustain something that she has been taught is religiously wrong.  A, aged only 12, is already extremely anxious about contact and now feels protective towards his mother and younger siblings.  Embarking on contact would place him under extreme pressure, which would inevitably have a detrimental effect on his development.    </p>

The likely result is that their individual and collective well-being would be undermined to the point where their ability to remain in the community would be put at risk, or at the very least placed under permanent and severe strain, with (as Ms Henry and Dr Morris put it) &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">a negative impact on how they function in the widest possible sense both now and in the future&#8221;</span>.   </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">It is central to my thinking that this is not a case about whether children should or should not be brought up according to ultra-Orthodox principles.  This was the issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Re G</span>, and it was that which led Munby LJ at paragraph 82 to describe the task of the judge as being to recognise equality, foster aspiration and maximise the children&#8217;s opportunities in every sphere of life as they enter adulthood, taking care not to foreclose on their ability to make future choices for themselves. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.01in">This case is quite different.  These parents decided to bring up their children according to the narrow ways of the community, and they continue to agree about this.  That being the case, the priority must be to sustain the children in the chosen way of life, preserving their existing family and social networks and their education.  It is not to be forgotten that children have the right to preserve their identity (UNCRC Art.8), something that is a matter of particular pride to these children.  Contact carries the clear risk that the children and their mother will become the next casualties in a collision between two unconnecting worlds.  The father has already experienced the consequences of that collision, and no one knows better than she does how very painful they can be. </p>

By my assessment, the opinions of Dr Morris, Ms Henry and the Guardian withstood that scrutiny.  For obvious reasons, they had little previous experience of the circumstances that arise in this case, but they applied coherent principles and kept a steadfast eye on the children&#8217;s welfare.  I found that the Guardian has a sound appreciation of the overall situation, and I rely upon her professional judgement, underpinned by the Anna Freud investigation.  Alongside these witnesses, I have (as required by <span style="font-style:italic">Re C</span>) grappled with all the available alternatives, viewing deprivation of contact as a last resort that can only be contemplated when it is clear that the children will not benefit from it.  </p>

I see no reason why this should not take place four times a year for each child, perhaps coinciding with their birthdays, and with Pesach, Sukkot and Hanukkah: I invite submissions on the detail.  I will make a Family Assistance Order for 12 months, addressed to Cafcass so that Ms Gauden can support the introduction of indirect contact and oversee the process of creating the narrative.  The Anna Freud Centre has offered to advise on the terms of the narrative and I will if necessary postpone the making of the final order to ensure that all these matters are securely in place.   </p>
