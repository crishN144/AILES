	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs Cherwayko (W) applies to commit Mr Cherwayko (H) to prison for alleged breaches of an undertaking and orders.  The context is that H, as he accepts, has failed to comply with payments under a financial remedy order made by consent.  W first applied under the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (&#8216;FPR 2010&#8217;) for enforcement by such method as the court may consider appropriate pursuant to Rule 33. 3 (2) (b) FPR 2010.  W now seeks to commit H for three alleged breaches of, respectively, (i) an undertaking within the financial remedy order, (ii) an order made in the enforcement proceedings and (iii) a further order made as part of a freezing injunction.  This is W&#8217;s second committal application following enforcement proceedings. </p>

He had had a week from service to prepare for the hearing, which Mostyn J plainly considered to be sufficient in the circumstances.  In his judgment ([2014] EWHC 4252) Mostyn J found H to be in breach (&#8216;a blatant and defiant contempt&#8217;) on the basis that he had not attended court as ordered nor provided information as specified in the previous order.  He made a committal order suspended until the payment of a sum of &#163;500,000, in addition to a payment of &#163;510,000 paid the previous day, and a further payment of &#163;552,000 promised on that day, and on condition also that H file  by 17 December 2014 a statement, supported by a statement of truth, setting out why he had not complied with the financial order, his proposals for compliance, and his current financial circumstances, defined to include his shareholding in Mart Resources Inc, and two other named entities.  The sums were paid, and H filed a statement purporting to comply with the terms of the suspension on 17 December 2014.  Mostyn J rejected the submission for W that the contempt was so grave as to demand an immediate term of imprisonment. He reminded himself that a committal order has two elements; namely coercion and punishment, and the two have to be carefully balanced.  He concluded that on balance H&#8217;s defaults at that time did not justify an immediate term of imprisonment. </p>

Computershare issued replacement certificates. Mart claimed no knowledge of these events.

In submitting written commentary on the draft judgment, and in contrast to what was in his position statement, Mr Watson stated that it was impossible to establish whether the draft affidavit was attached to the application notice since it was simply received by email with the application.

He asserts that he does not believe that this is a breach of the undertaking since he used the proceeds to make payments to W.  He does not address the evidence or assertion that he misled Computershare to obtain replacement certificates.  Mr Bowers had not addressed this either in his 22 June affidavit, and this was pointed out to him in court. H claims that he was unable to pay Vardags because of the freezing injunction, notwithstanding that it is subject to exceptions as recorded above.  At the hearing of 22 June Mr Bentham had drawn the court&#8217;s and Mr Bowers&#8217; attention to the provision which permitted H access to funds for living expenses and that W had agreed  in correspondence to increase the allowance for withdrawal for legal fees from &#163;15,000 to &#163;35,000.  H apologises for his failure to attend court on 22 June and file the documentation as provided by the order of 6 May 2015.  He says that he has had to limit his travel as a result of health problems and that he has been unable to attend hearings because he has been required to attend business meetings in Dubai and Africa.  H states that he has demonstrated his current resources.  H repeats the assertion that his ability to raise moneys to pay his solicitors was inhibited by the terms of the freezing order and that Vardags had come off the record due to lack of funds, and thus he had not filed the documentation as ordered.  H does not deal with the breach of the disclosure requirements in the 4 June freezing order. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">FPR 2010 37.10 (3) (a) maintains the important distinction between the contents of the notice which sets out the charges, and the affidavit which provides the evidence in support.  In the standard form printed application notice this distinction is maintained. Question 3 asks &#8216;What order are you asking the court to make and why?&#8217; That question is directed to the pleaded assertions rather than the evidence/ facts relied on, which is governed by question 10 headed &#8216;What information will you be relying on?&#8217; with four boxes to be ticked: &#8216;the attached statement', the petition, the affidavit in support of the petition, and &#8216;the evidence set out in the box below&#8217;.  This is not an idle distinction.  It is purposeful.  The rules are based upon and reflect the underlying principle that the alleged contemnor must know what he/she is said to have done in breach of the order/undertaking with sufficient particularity so as to be able to meet and address the allegation.  I am not suggesting that the Rule or its underlying principle can be disregarded.  I accept that the Rules require particularisation, although do not precisely specify in what manner. I accept that the provision of those particulars in the affidavit in support in this case itself does not comply with the Rules.  I accept also that in this case that although the particulars of breach are contained in the affidavit in support, they could have been provided in the body of the notice.  And the more complex the assertion, the more the need for particularisation: as in this case, where the breaches of the orders are straightforward simple omissions, whereas in respect of the  undertaking, what acts were done, and in what manner it was breached, needs to be set out. </p>

The contents of the orders must be known or presumed to be known to the respondent, or at least be ascertainable by him, and although to avoid dispute it may be advisable to recite at least the themes of the order or undertaking, in order to explain the alleged breach, which may otherwise be ambiguous, it is not a requirement. </p>

It may be helpful however for it to be referred to under the note &#8220;please attach a draft copy of the order you are applying for&#8221; in terms such as &#8220;Paragraphs x and y of the draft order contain the findings which the court is invited to make based on the allegations made by the applicant and the affidavit of evidence in support&#8221;. </p>

It may be prudent however to give some thought to drafting orders/undertakings in such a manner so as to obviate obvious potential breaches and/or make it clear what is the underlying purpose of the provision.</p>
