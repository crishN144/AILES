By his order the Recorder directed the husband (as I&#160;shall call him) to pay to the wife (as I&#160;shall call her) AC, the sum of &#163;1,010 per calendar month backdated to 16&#160;March 2023 until 30&#160;September 2023, and with effect from 1&#160;October 2023, the increased sum of &#163;3,510 per month until the determination of her application for a financial order or other events as set out in the order.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">The finding of the court, as I&#160;understand it, was that the husband was then substantially indebted to the tune of about &#163;600,000.  A small capital award of &#163;42,000 was made, but a substantive order for periodical payments was made for a 10-year term in the sum of &#163;4,000 per month to the wife and &#163;1,000 per month for each child, all index linked.</p>

The order for the son had lapsed as although he divides his time between his parents, his main home was then with his father and remains so when he is not at university.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in">Life for the parties has not gone smoothly.  The wife has had one very harmful subsequent relationship, and she now is on her own with the parties&#8217; daughter.  The husband has re-married, and he has three young children by his second wife.  She comes from a relatively prosperous background.  Within his business life the husband and a colleague set up a financial services business specialising in mergers and acquisitions.  It has had a rough few years.  It ceased paying salaries some time ago and instead, when deals are executed, the company received substantial payments.  I&#160;think the maximum was &#163;1.2m.  Thus it is that his receipts are very lumpy.  There have been no receipts since January 2023.  </p>

They then had to sell the home to avoid bankruptcy, and he says that the net proceeds of around &#163;700,000 were used to pay off some of his debts.  The wife says that she has seen no proof of that, but that is not a matter for me to go into at this hearing.  Thus it is that he now lives in rented accommodation.</p>

By the time of the order under appeal she had paid for one year&#8217;s rental in advance, which period expired in October 2023.  She was then going to be liable to pay &#163;2,500 per month by way of rent, which explains the increase in the maintenance payments in that sum as set out at para.5 of the Recorder&#8217;s order.  However, as the new term of the lease became due, the wife felt unable to commit to pay the new rent from the resources she then had, and vacated.  She and their daughter are now sofa surfing with friends and spending some nights in hotels.</p>

The Recorder calculated the husband&#8217;s net income as averaging about &#163;200,000 to &#163;250,000, and that roughly equalled the cost of servicing and repaying the HMRC and commercial loans.  HMRC require repayment within three years.</p>

Thus, if his income were to be as the Recorder calculated, then payment of his commercial liabilities would swallow it all; and if income does not arrive then his situation becomes even more dire.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">The issue as put before me by Ms&#160;Stewart is whether it was wrong as a matter of principle to order periodical payments which can only be paid by increasing debt.  There is no doubt that the husband is living substantially beyond his means.  In summer 2022 on the sale of his home he and his wife rented a property at &#163;8,000 per month.  His three children by his second marriage are in private education.  There are aspects of his budget which certainly strike me as extravagant, including payments for holidays which are put at &#163;2,500 a month although he says that that is not something that is actually being spent.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">But the lease of his property is for three years, and the husband is contractually bound to pay it and his children are, for better or for worse, in private education.  He says with force, &#8220;How was I&#160;to know that 15 years after separation and 10 years after the order was made my first wife was going to come back for more?&#8221;  I&#160;regard that as a powerful point and certainly a shield against at least some of the allegations of extravagance.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">In these &#8211; and no doubt other cases &#8211; an order for payment of maintenance to be made out of debt can, if the circumstances make it appropriate, be justified.  In my view this is not such a case.  Payment by the husband in this case would or could only be made by driving the husband further into debt.  In this case there is no crock of gold visible at the end of the rainbow; and there is something in the point that the husband makes that since January the only person who has received income in this case, albeit at the rate of some &#163;3,250 per month is the wife, because it is not him.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in">Both parties&#8217; financial positions are dire.  The wife receives &#163;1300 per month from the husband for their daughter and there is no application to vary that, quite rightly.  She receives wages of about &#163;1300 a month and state benefits in a fluctuating sum found by the Recorder to be around &#163;650 a month &#8211; but currently a little lower, the wife says, whilst an adjustment is being made &#8211; albeit that is to some extent counterbalanced by some funds that she is receiving for a second job that she is doing short-term.  So, unsurprisingly, her income is fully consumed.</p>

But she is being pursued by her former solicitors for about the same amount of money.  She and they parted company some time after the April hearing, explaining why she is self-representing at this hearing.  It is a matter for her, but she would be well advised to seek to negotiate with her solicitors to retain sufficient funds to instruct a direct access barrister for the FDR coming up in just over a fortnight and for any final hearing.</p>
