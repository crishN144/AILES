N describes M as a mother who has always used physical chastisement but, upon M discovering N&#8217;s sexuality, M hit N with a belt, described her as disgusting, broke her mobile telephone and said she should die. When N spoke to the CAFCASS officer who reported in these proceedings, N said that M made jokes about &#8216;gays&#8217; and N described her self-esteem as being at &#8220;rock bottom&#8221;. N also reported M saying to her that she should go and live with F, as M was concerned about what people would think of M should they see N in the street with a girl. </p>

That statement supports the account given by N of the events of 28 June 2018, a date when all agree that an altercation took place between M and N. S describes that N began sending her text messages during the early afternoon, expressing fear of M. S collected N from home and they spent the afternoon together. M then made phone calls demanding that N return home. S describes M as being aggressive during the phone call but, despite this, N and S returned to M&#8217;s address. Upon arrival, S went up to the apartment to speak to M but M took the lift down to S&#8217;s car. N and S describe M banging on the car windows, trying to force N out of the car. S tried to intervene but M was able to open the door and pull N from the car. Both S and N describe M being in an uncontrolled rage and having her hands around N&#8217;s throat. S describes that N was eventually released and she took N home with her rather than return to M&#8217;s flat. </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.49in;margin-right:0.04in">Given the summary nature of applications under the Hague Convention, it is, in my judgment, essential that documentary evidence such as this is put before the court in a manner that enables the Court to assess its reliability, in so far as that can be done in summary proceedings. As the messages were not sent to F, but to other family members, those representing F should have produced short statements from those persons exhibiting the messages that F sought to rely upon. Official translations of the statements and messages should then have been provided. In my judgment, it is always of assistance to the court and to the other parties, for the messages to be copied with the date and time identifiable and within the chain of messages from which they arose, to enable the court to see the context within which they were sent. </p>

It is, as Art 13(b) makes clear, the return to the requesting state, rather than the enforced removal from the requested state, which must have this effect. Thus the English courts have sought to avoid placing the child in an intolerable situation by extracting undertakings from the applicant as to the conditions in which the child will live when he returns and by relying on the courts of the requesting state to protect him once he is there. In many cases this will be sufficient. But once again, the fact that this will usually be sufficient to avoid the risk does not mean that it will invariably be so. In Hague Convention cases within the European Union, Art 11.4 of the Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 (Brussels II Revised) (2003) OJ L 338/1 expressly provides that a court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Art 13(b) &#8216;if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return'. Thus it has to be shown that those arrangements will be effective to secure the protection of the child. With the best will in the world, this will not always be the case. Noone intended that an instrument designed to secure the protection of children from the harmful effects of international child abduction should itself be turned into an instrument of harm.&#8221; </span></p>

It was also anticipated that I would hear oral evidence from M and F on the issue of consent. Given the parties accepted that all communication took place by email, text or Whatsapp, and there had been no telephone conversations between them, I questioned the need for the hearing of oral evidence from the parents, save perhaps on the issue of whether F had invented the Facebook and Whatsapp messages that he sought to rely upon. When it became clear that Ms Best was unable to cure the inadequate way in which that evidence had been presented in her client&#8217;s statement, it was agreed that Ms Demery would be the only witness to give oral evidence. </p>

In her statement M says &#8220;J is almost 11 years old. He is well advanced in his education and his unlawful retention in England is having a negative effect on his education and emotional wellbeing. J does not speak fluent English and is also very shy. This together with having no friends in England, a new form of education and being away from his mother (the primary carer) has caused him a great deal of distress. The longer he stays away from Portugal, the more he suffers&#8221;. M does not allege in her written evidence that J has told her, during her many phone conversations with her, that he has said that he wishes to return to Portugal. </p>

J did not express any negative views about Portugal. He was unhappy with M&#8217;s treatment of him and of her choice of school but did not give Ms Demery any information that could lead me to a conclusion that he was unwilling to return to Portugal, had he been content with arrangements for his care once there. Indeed, when asked by Ms Demery how he would feel about returning to Portugal with F and N, he said he was only 4 out of 10 unhappy about that. He does not know why he was removed from Portugal and, on the evidence before me, expressed no desire to leave Portugal prior to his removal by F. I applaud both F and N for not exposing J to information he has not needed to know. As stated by Ms Demery, as a teenager with an ever increasing desire for independence, N was likely to have fallen into conflict with M in a very different way to J and, if N&#8217;s allegations concerning M&#8217;s homophobic abuse are true, N has very good reason for seeking a change of primary carer. However, there is no evidence before me from which I could conclude that prior to his removal, J expressed any unhappiness about the care he received in Portugal or with Portugal itself.</p>

It is, in my judgment, unsurprising that J expresses the desire to stay with his sister and father. However, not wanting to be separated from F and N is not the same as objecting to a return to Portugal. It is F&#8217;s case, as set out in the statement of S, that both N and J spent a great deal of time in the care of S and her mother so there are options available for J&#8217;s care in Portugal away from M until such time that the court in Portugal, that is already seized of an application made by F for a change of child arrangements, is able to make a decision. </p>

I therefore find that the article 13(b) defence fails. </p>

In my judgment, whatever timescale is agreed by the parties, a return needs to take place to ensure that J is settled with MTDG in sufficient time for his return to school in Portugal in January. </p>
