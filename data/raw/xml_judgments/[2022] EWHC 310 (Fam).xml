	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">The parents have been involved in litigation since November 2018 when the mother started proceedings in the Family Division of the High Court seeking the summary return of the children to this jurisdiction, asserting that they had been &#8220;forcibly&#8221; retained in Libya by the father. On 25 October 2019 HHJ Hillier sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge handed down judgment dismissing the mother&#8217;s application. The mother appealed unsuccessfully to the Court of Appeal, <span style="font-style:italic">S (Children)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2020/515" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2020] EWCA Civ 515" court="EWCA-Civil" year="2020" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2020] EWCA Civ 515</ref>. In August 2020 the mother made her current application and applied to set aside the order of HHJ Hillier on the grounds that there had been a fundamental change in circumstances. On 11 January 2021 Mostyn J dismissed the mother&#8217;s applications, <span style="font-style:italic">GC v AS</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2021/14" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2021] EWHC 14 (Fam)" court="EWHC-Family" year="2021" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2021] EWHC 14 (Fam)</ref>. He held that the mother should have advanced an application under the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction before HHJ Hillier, that her application was <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson</span> abuse, referring to the principle derived from <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> (1843) Hare 100, and that the mother had not met the high threshold for the making of a protective order under the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction. Again the mother appealed but on this occasion she was successful, the Court finding that Mostyn J had taken the wrong approach to her set aside application and concluding that he had given insufficient consideration to her independent application to exercise the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction, <span style="font-style:italic">GC v AS</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2021/1223" isNeutral="true" canonical="[2021] EWCA Civ 1223" court="EWCA-Civil" year="2021" jurisdiction="GB" type="case">[2021] EWCA Civ 1223</ref>.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">In my view, what needs to be determined is not the application to set aside the earlier order but, rather, the mother&#8217;s independent application under the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction. It does not appear to me to be necessary at all for the previous order to be set aside. The real question in this case is whether the court should make an order for the return of the children under the <span style="font-style:italic">parens</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">patriae</span> jurisdiction. The issue for the court will be whether the circumstances are sufficiently compelling to require or make it necessary that the court should exercise its protective jurisdiction. That is a matter which can be determined without any reference to the question whether the earlier order should be set aside. It would, of course, be preferable, if possible, for this Court to determine whether the protective jurisdiction should be exercised, but for my part I do not think we are in a position to do so. It requires careful analysis by a judge at first instance applying the legal principles and approach summarised by Moylan LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M.</span></p>

The father obtained a Master&#8217;s Degree in Law from an English university. In 2013 the parties lived in Tripoli for a few months. The parties&#8217; first two children were born in England in 2014 and 2016. In September 2016 the father was granted British citizenship. Their third child was born in September 2017. In December 2017 the parties travelled to Libya via Turkey. HHJ Hillier found that they had agreed to move with the children to live permanently in Libya. The mother returned to England in early 2018 but travelled to and from Libya during the course of that year, spending about four months in Libya, until in November 2018 she started proceedings in the High Court seeking the children&#8217;s summary return to this jurisdiction. Since then she has only had indirect contact with the children.</p>

The mother did not contend that, in the event of those findings, the court should nevertheless exercise its <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction to order return. The Court of Appeal upheld HHJ Hillier&#8217;s findings. I note that HHJ Hillier found that the mother had told &#8220;obvious lies&#8221; and was prepared to &#8220;bolster her case by dishonesty&#8221;. The judge found the father to be an unsatisfactory witness also &#8211; he had deliberately lied to the UK authorities when applying for asylum. Amongst other findings, the judge was satisfied that the mother had been an active participant in the arrangements to relocate to Libya, that the two older children were receiving pre-school and nursery education in Libya, that the father&#8217;s apartment within an apartment block occupied by members of his family was separate and of a good standard, and that the oldest child was receiving medical treatment for her pre-existing asthma condition in Tripoli.</p>

Mostyn J nevertheless gave permission for the mother to rely on the expert evidence but concluded that, &#8220;It seems to me while the situation in Libya is concerning, that things have not got worse and that it could be said that things have slightly improved since that date.&#8221; Mostyn J also noted WhatsApp messages as recent as August 2020 showing the mother negotiating with the father for him to pay travel costs and accommodation for her to visit Libya in order to see the children.</p>

The father disputes this and says that the children will speak to the mother when they are able and that if contact is missed then it is compensated for on another day. The mother notes the father&#8217;s assertions that the children are safe, well looked after, attend school, and have their health needs met, but she has no trust in his assertions.

Once again she did not seek permission to rely on the report before obtaining it but I did give permission at a case management hearing for her to adduce the supplementary report as being necessary for me to resolve the case justly. As he did in his first report, Dr Cherstich states that Libya is in a state of civil war and is &#8220;extremely unsafe&#8221; for &#8220;anyone, but particularly for the three children.&#8221; He does not specify what circumstances make it &#8220;particularly&#8221; unsafe for the three children, but he was aware that they live in Tripoli. He has relied on general information about the country, and Tripoli, rather than information specific to the circumstances of the children. He advises that the &#8220;rule of law is practically absent and the justice system is neither operational nor accessible&#8221;. There is extensive use of drones in the civil war. In 2021, Human Rights Watch reported that throughout 2020 and 2021, &#8220;Armed groups on all sides continued to kill unlawfully and shell indiscriminately, killing civilians and destroying vital infrastructure.&#8221; Dr Cherstich also points to the &#8220;extreme shortage of electricity&#8221;, affecting the water supply as well as communications, and to shortages of &#8220;water, milk, vegetables, bread, and fuel.&#8221; In 2020 the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations indicated that many parts of the country were reporting availability problems for basic food items. Reliable sources, he says, suggest that in 2021 &#8220;children in Tripoli eat on average only one meal a day&#8230; the majority of children surveyed aged 6 to 23 months did not consume a minimum acceptable diet.&#8221; Public hygiene is, he advises, poor giving rise to concerns about the spreading of not just Covid 19, but also cholera. </p>

The housing appears to be comfortable and the children look happy and relaxed. He has produced a school report on the oldest child, describing her as an &#8220;active, organized and distinguished student&#8221;, and a short, hand-written medical report from a Dr Doni, Paediatric Consultant, addressing the treatment the same child receives for her asthma. He assures the court that in the area of Tripoli where the children live and go to school (and pre-school) they are comfortable and safe. His work affords the family a good income and to a great extent they have been insulated from the effects of the civil war. The father points out that Libya is a very large country with a population of about seven million. Violent clashes in a rural area many thousands of miles away would not adversely affect the safety of the children. Whilst others in the population may have suffered the direct effects of conflict, or the indirect effects on their food and other basic supplies, the children have not. There are power cuts and other difficulties, but the portrayal of life in Libya by Dr Cherstich does not reflect the quality of his family&#8217;s life there.</p>

She has a Master&#8217;s Degree in children&#8217;s welfare and psychology. In her capacity as a civil servant within the Ministry she visited the children&#8217;s schools and home in preparation of a report which the father, through his solicitors, had requested of the Ministry. Her opinion evidence is given as an expert and I gave permission for the father to rely upon it, as necessary for me to resolve the proceedings, provided she attended to give oral evidence. Following her cross-examination I have some reservations about the reliability her evidence. She provides reassurance that the children attend school, that their schools provide good facilities and education, that the children are well nourished and clothed, that the home is comfortable, that the family are warm and loving, and that the children appeared well cared for and happy. I accept that these were her impressions and to that extent her evidence corroborates the father&#8217;s assurances, but she has had limited involvement in the family and she appeared to me to accept assertions by the family in Libya at face value without adequate enquiry. For example, she reached the conclusion that the mother had abandoned the children and &#8220;did not exist&#8221; for them. Indeed, she was judgmental about the mother saying that her conduct was, in her eyes, a crime. She did not speak to the mother or ask any questions about the involvement of the mother in the lives of the children. Ms Al-Taher Beshin did not take the steps to inquire as thoroughly I would have expected of an independent expert witness. Accordingly, I disregard her opinion evidence about general conditions in Libya and about the mother&#8217;s conduct and role in the children&#8217;s lives. Nevertheless, her evidence is of some value as a witness who corroborates where the children live, that they attend school, that they appear to be well fed and clothed, and that they appear to be well cared for by a loving family in Libya.</p>

The court must apply the substantive threshold so as to give effect to the Convention rights of the children and the parties. The children are being kept separate from their mother. The mother is being so comprehensively removed from the children&#8217;s lives that Ms Al-Taher Beshin was under the impression that she &#8220;did not exist&#8221; for them. The children have a right to be heard but their voices have been silent. Only return to England will protect them. It would, further, allow for a welfare analysis upon their return. Mr Gupta QC suggested that separation from the mother in this case was sufficient of itself to justify the exercise of the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction but there is a constellation of other factors which compel the court to so act, most especially the security situation in Libya, the danger the civil war creates for the children, and its impact on the availability of basic goods and services such as food and power.</p>

The court should examine the particular circumstances of these children not generalisations about the country. Notwithstanding security issues in Libya, these children are not directly affected.

The mother&#8217;s application also falls into the category of case identified by Moylan LJ that seeks orders that improperly subvert Parliament&#8217;s intention &#8211; the clear purpose of the order sought is to enable the English court to undertake a welfare enquiry for the purpose of deciding who should care for the children. In fact, since the father could not travel to or live in England now, his British national status having been revoked, there would be adverse welfare consequences for the children on being removed from their home and brought to England.</p>

It would be a factor in very many cases where families are separated by borders and the children are habitually resident and present overseas, yet the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction should be exercised with great caution or circumspection and only when the circumstances are sufficiently compelling to require its use, not merely because there exists the much more common situation that its use might reunite a child with a parent.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.50in">Having regard to all the circumstances, in my judgement the court should not exercise the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction in this case. The evidence establishes that the children&#8217;s needs are being met in Libya, they are not living in danger due to the security situation in that country, they are being educated, their health is looked after, and they are well cared for in a loving family. Their circumstances have not led the children to express or imply any wish to leave Libya. The evidence shows that they are apparently happy living there. They have lived in Libya for over four years, for the past three years five months without their mother. The youngest child was aged only two to three months on his arrival in Libya. It would be a major disruption in their lives to be suddenly removed from Libya and returned to England. The security situation in Libya is of considerable concern but the weight of the evidence is that it has not deteriorated since the children moved there in 2017 and, if anything, it has improved somewhat. Whilst the mother&#8217;s own perception of the safety of living in Libya is not determinative of the need to protect the children, I do note that she helped to relocate the children to Libya in 2017 during the midst of the second civil war. She cannot have believed then that she was endangering the children. In fact, during the four years or so since then, the children have not come to harm as a result of the civil war. The mother has not adduced any evidence that the children have been harmed, only that they are in a country in which unrest and civil war has put them at risk of harm. I accept that unrest and violence continue to endanger people&#8217;s lives in Libya, to disrupt the attempts to create a properly functioning state, and to adversely affect power and other basic supplies. To that extent the children are exposed to a risk of harm from conflict but I do not accept that the evidence shows that they are at a high risk of harm. In my judgment the evidence shows that the risk of harm to the children is low - it does not adversely affect their daily lives. The children are fortunate to live within a family of means, in an area which is not disrupted by conflict in the same way as other parts of the country. They have been, and continue to be, largely insulated from the risks of harm due to internal conflict in their country. Their position is not comparable with that of a British citizen contemplating travel to Libya. </p>

Those principles must be applied to circumstances in this and similar applications. In this case, the circumstances fall well short of compelling the conclusion that a protective order for the children to be returned to England is required. It is not the role of this court when determining jurisdiction to carry out a nuanced welfare assessment but in this case the balance might well favour the children remaining in Libya. Where it is not clearly in the best interests of the children to be removed from their country of habitual residence and returned to this jurisdiction, it can hardly be said that the circumstances are sufficiently compelling to require or to make it necessary for the court to exercise its <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction for that purpose. </p>

In very many cases where the jurisdiction is exercised and children are then returned to this jurisdiction, questions as to child arrangements upon or after arrival will arise. In some cases the primary or sole form of relief sought is the return of the child. In others, the jurisdiction is being invoked to avoid the effect of <ref href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/55" canonical="1986 c. 55" type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> by securing the return of a child in order to give the English court jurisdiction to undertake a welfare enquiry and to decide who should care for the child. The applicant cannot otherwise secure that result whilst the child is habitually resident abroad, so they try to use the inherent jurisdiction to achieve the same outcome. The distinction is not always going to be clear, but in my judgement, the present case does manifestly fall within the second category. The fact that welfare decisions would have to be made after the children&#8217;s return would not, of itself, dissuade me from exercising the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction if the circumstances were sufficiently compelling to make it necessary to do so, but it is obvious that the mother&#8217;s application is made in order to enable the English court to make orders for the children to live with her or to spend time with her. Naturally, she wants those outcomes and I am sure that she genuinely believes that they would be in her children&#8217;s best interests, but that is not a legitimate use of the <span style="font-style:italic">parens patriae</span> jurisdiction. </p>
