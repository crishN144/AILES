She was at her solicitor's offices observing the proceedings via video link, on all bar the days when she gave her evidence. When she gave her evidence, I allowed her breaks so that she could check up on and look after Z as necessary. Fortunately, the solicitor's office was but a short distance from the court building.</p>

The children's mother has worked as a sex worker, predominantly online, throughout the children's childhood. It was a feature of her life when her relationship with the three older children's father broke down in 2012. It continued right up until the day of the police involvement with the family when it appears, both from the way she dressed and what she said, that she was due to go online at that moment. She conducted her work both from the family home and externally. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The assessment of the evidence in this case, and of the witnesses, has been made more difficult by the dishonesty, first and foremost, of the children's mother. Again, I do not need to make findings of fact in relation to every issue that has arisen suggesting she has been untruthful, but the reality is that she has encouraged her children to be untruthful, to tell people what she wanted to be heard, and that has inevitably made an assessment of things said by the children challenging.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The incident that started the investigation by the police and by social services occurred on 26 July 2021. A was found on the porch roof in the front of the house by an employee of a business situated next door to the family's home. A told her that her &#8220;stepdad&#8221; had been touching her. A told the worker that her mother's response to what A had said was to call A a liar, and to say that she would have to go and live elsewhere.</p>

It shows A curled up in a chair, completely distraught, whilst her mother calmly explained to the police that A told lies, was emotionally unwell, that she, her mother, was a teacher, and that her partner, the man being accused by A, was an emergency services worker and the mother's carer. The police arrested D, and A was taken to her paternal grandparents&#8217; home, relatives she had not seen for three years as her mother had stopped contact to the paternal side of the family. </p>

Beyond issues of social stigma, perpetrating adults are often reluctant to make admissions in the context of family proceedings in circumstances where they face, or may face, criminal prosecution.&#160; The alleged victims of sexual abuse are often vulnerable children with other difficulties that can affect the credibility of their allegations, which allegations often emerge a considerable time after the alleged abuse has taken place, and therefore long after any physical evidence that may have existed has disappeared.&#160; The allegations may emerge in a piecemeal fashion, with children often not reporting events in a linear history, reporting them in a partial way and revisiting topics more than once. Such children may, whether by reason of their age, or the impact of the alleged sexual abuse or other difficulties, be idiosyncratic, inconsistent or unreliable historians.&#160; The age, psychological state and/or views of the child may mean, as in this case, that the court does not hear their accounts challenged forensically in cross examination and, accordingly, is deprived of one of the key forensic tools for testing the truth of a disputed account before the law.&#160; The child may suffer from psychological sequalae that may or may not be the product of sexual abuse but which, in any event, makes the assessment of their reliability even more difficult</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;color:#000000">.&#160; </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">It is not unknown for children to lie about having experienced sexual abuse or to fabricate allegations of the same.</span></p>

More generally, human memory is not a single, simple system. What is remembered of an experience by a child or young person will not be a complete picture akin to a photograph or CCTV recording and will vary depending on the age at which the experience took place.&#160; What an adult may consider to be a key element of a remembered experience, and therefore key to assessing the reliability of the memory, may not be significant from a child&#8217;s perspective.&#160; The physiological processes involved in the encoding, storage and retrieval of memories are susceptible to internal and external influences.&#160; Within this context, children&#8217;s accounts can be affected by their level of functioning, their emotional state and their levels of suggestibility.&#160; It is also possible for a child to &#8220;remember&#8221; an event that has not in fact occurred, or which has not occurred precisely in the way remembered. &#160;The child&#8217;s recollection of past experiences can be influenced by the process of questioning the child. &#160;I deal with this issue in detail at paragraphs [571] to [587] below.</span></p>

I have no difficulty in concluding that in combination, the absence of her mother, and the arrival at the house of G, left A feeling unwanted, unloved, and may well have been the immediate catalyst leading to her making her allegations at the time that she did. Does that necessarily mean that the allegations were false claims, or is it merely that the timing of her making those allegations was dictated by the rejection she was feeling? </p>

All that could be said was that E had sided with his mother, as might be expected. As I will deal with in due course, she had, by the time of the final hearing, distanced herself from D despite having his child, and despite having maintained a close relationship in the aftermath of A's allegations.</p>

Ultimately, however, the relationship cooled, and she stopped going round.

Nor am I persuaded that the convincing witness is necessarily the one telling the truth.  There is now a body of authority referred to by McDonald J in his judgment and set out extensively by the advocates in their closing submissions, about the way in which the Court needs to be acutely aware of the limitations of the reliability of oral evidence. However, the giving of evidence might have been an opportunity for A to over-elaborate and/or exaggerate, but she did not take that opportunity. When she was asked questions that had not previously been asked of her about the physical sensations involved in what she alleged, her answers were simple, to the point, and gave every appearance of being likely to be accurate. </p>

The concern is that once the proceedings end, she will begin to revert to some of the dishonest behaviours that have been evident in the past, and which are exemplified by the financial claim for benefits for Z on an entirely false premise. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The issue that arises is whether, in respect of the boys, I should be making Care Orders on the basis that they live at home with their mother. The Local Authority&#8217;s care plan proposes Supervision Orders. The Guardian promoted the need for Care Orders. The services available to the family under a Care order and a Supervision order are exactly the same. There are two differences. Firstly, a Supervision Order is limited in time, although it can be extended. Secondly, that there is no independent reviewing officer as there would be with a Care Order, although it is possible for the local authority to make provision for an independent reviewing officer to be appointed to the case under a supervision order. </p>

There is no one with oversight of a Supervision Order. The concern is that a Supervision Order would go to the bottom of the pile of cases being worked by the Local Authority, given the intolerable pressures currently upon them, and the limited resources available to try to meet those pressures. </p>

Miss V, the allocated social worker, told me that the plan is that under the Supervision Order it would remain with her team.

It will be limited in time, but it may well be that it will require extension, depending on how things develop. I anticipate the work with the children will be complex, and the work with the mother will be difficult, given her propensity to distance herself from the truth and to run a narrative that is not the truth but is adopted by her children. I think there would be considerable merit in the local authority appointing an independent reviewing officer to this case.</p>

One of the ironies of this case is that although he is no longer part of the case, by reason of his age, E will qualify as a care leaver which opens the door to support for several years to come. Given her age, A does not qualify but she is the one who needs it the most.  I am pleased that the Local Authority have agreed, and that there is appropriate authority in place to ensure it happens, that A will be treated as a care leaver, and that she will have available to her the support of the Local Authority, should she need it, as she goes through further education and on into adulthood. She is a bright girl, and I hope she is able to achieve her academic potential. There will undoubtedly be psychological consequences flowing from what has happened to her and her life experiences to date. They should not be underestimated. </p>
