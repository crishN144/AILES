	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is the final chapter in the litigation relating to Alessandra Pacchieri and her daughter P. The case has been the subject of much reporting and comment in the media, in this country, in Italy (of which the mother is a national) and indeed around the world. For that reason I am giving this judgment in open court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 December 2013 I gave a judgment, also in open court, in which I described events down to that date in some detail: <span style="font-style:italic">Re P (A Child) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/4048" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 4048 (Fam)</ref>, paras 2-32. There is no need for me to repeat it here. It suffices to recall that P was born in this country on 24 August 2012; that on 1 February 2013 His Honour Judge Newton sitting in the Chelmsford County Court made both a care order and a placement order in respect of P; that the mother&#8217;s last contact with P was on 22 May 2013; that on 25 October 2013 Judge Newton made an order giving the local authority, Essex County Council, leave to place P for adoption; and that not long after, in fact on 19 November 2013, P was placed with prospective adopters. She has remained with them ever since. I shall refer to them as Mr and Mrs X.</p>

It said that the writer had spoken &#8220;at length&#8221; with the mother on 11 and 12 December 2013. It enclosed what was described as a notice of acting &#8220;in respect of proposed proceedings concerning&#8221; P, though without elaborating further.

In accordance with directions given by the District Judge, both the mother and P&#8217;s father (who does not have parental responsibility) were sent written notice by the court and, on 7 March 2014, emailed notice by Essex County Council of the hearing fixed for 1 April 2014. The notice, dated 5 March 2014, contained the warning, drawn to their attention, that &#8220;Failure to attend my result in an order being made in your absence.&#8221; There has been no response from P&#8217;s father who, it should be noted, has never seen P.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As of 1 April 2014 the position remained as it had been on 17 December 2013. Despite what had been said in the correspondence from Brendan Fleming and Dawson Cornwell in December 2013, no application of any kind had been made on behalf of either the mother or the Italian authorities, whether to the Court of Protection, the Chelmsford County Court or the Family Division, nor had any application been made to the Court of Appeal. In particular, it is to be noted, neither the mother, nor for that matter the father, had made any application in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/47/5" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 47(5)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38" uk:canonical="2002 c. 38" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Adoption and Children Act 2002</ref> for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances the submission made on behalf of Mr and Mrs X by their solicitor was simple and compelling. The Annex A report was understood to be wholly positive about P&#8217;s placement with Mr and Mrs X &#8211; as indeed it is &#8211; and it being clear that the mother was fully aware of the hearing and had not indicated any intention to seek leave to oppose the making of the order, I should make an adoption order. I had no hesitation in do so. Accordingly on 1 April 2014 I made the adoption order.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Annex A report is a long, detailed and impressive document, running to some 70 pages. It is, of course, confidential to the court. I therefore say little about its contents. Two passages should, however, be highlighted. The first focuses on P:</p>

There is warmth and care in their relationship which is reciprocated from both prospective adoptive parents and [P]. They are very nurturing towards [P] and show her affection. </p>

P is obviously thriving in their care and doing very well.

Nothing else will do.</p>
