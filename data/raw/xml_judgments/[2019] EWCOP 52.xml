It was therefore judged preferable to keep to a factual description of the adult in need to protection. The text contains two factual elements. The first is that of 'impairment or insufficiency of [the] personal faculties' of the adult... The [second is that the] insufficiency or impairment of the personal faculties of the adult must be such that he or she is not 'in a position to protect [his or her] interests.' The second element in the definition must be understood broadly."</p>

First, I do not think that a decision to recognise or enforce can be properly described as a decision 'for and on behalf of MN'. She is clearly affected by the decision but it is a decision in respect of an order and not a person. Secondly, this rather technical reason is justified as reflecting the policy of the Schedule and of Part 4 namely ensuring that persons who lack capacity have their best interests and their affairs dealt with in the country of habitual residence; to decide otherwise would be to defeat that purpose. Thirdly, best interests in the implementation of an order clearly are relevant and are dealt with by para 12 which would otherwise not really be necessary.'<img src="image11.jpg" style="width:1.92pt;height:3.36pt"/></p>

The court asked to recognise a foreign order should work with the grain of that order, rather than raise procedural hurdles which may delay or impede the implementation of the order in a way that may cause harm to the interests of the individual. If the court to which the application for recognition is made has concerns as to whether the adult was properly heard before the court of origin, it should as a first step raise those concerns promptly with the court of origin, rather than simply refuse recognition.</p>

		  <p style="margin-left:0.92in;margin-right:0.03in"><img src="image13.jpg" style="width:5.04pt;height:3.36pt"/>. . .there is likely to be a wide variety in the decisions made under foreign laws that are put forward for recognition under Schedule 3. As the Ministry of Justice has observed, inevitably there may be concerns about some of the foreign jurisdictions from which orders might come. But as the Ministry also observes, taking account of such concerns is surely the pumose of the public policy review. Although no wide-ranging review as to the merits of the foreign measure is either necessary or appropriate, a limited review will always be required as indicated by the European court in Pellegrini. That will be sufficient to identify any cases where the content and the form of the foreign measure, and the process by which it was taken, are objectionable. It also seems to me that the circumstances in which Sch 3 is likely to be invoked, and the number of countries whose orders are presented for recognition, are likely to be limited. In oral submissions, Mr Rees pointed out that, in theory, the court could be faced with applications to recognise and enforce orders from any country in the world, including, for example, Nonh Korea or Iran. That may be right in theory, but common sense suggests it is, to say the least, unlikely in practice, at least in the foreseeable future. And if such orders were to be presented for recognition, the public policy review would surely lead swiftly to identifying grounds on which recognition would be refused. It is much more likely that the orders presented for recognition will be those of foreign countries whose legal systems, laws and procedures are closely aligned to our own. Concems of this nature can be addressed by admitting evidence of the process by which the foreign protective measures were made and general evidence relating to the legal system of the state that made the order."</p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.03in">The interplay between subparagraphs (1) and (2) is not spelled out. However, in order to be consistent with paragraph 13(5), in my judgment the two subparagraphs must together be interpreted as meaning that the court may disapply or modify a power so as to provide for its exercise in England and Wales to be no wider than the restrictions in the laws of England and Wales; and, in considering whether to disapply or modify the power, the court must have regard to the applicable law of the other state only to that extent.</p>

		<p style="margin-left:0.94in;margin-right:0.03in">The wording of paragraph 14(1) suggests that the jurisdiction to disapply or modify a power does not arise until the lasting power has actually been exercised in an insufficiently protective manner. However, in oral submissions Mr Rees agreed that it would "offend common sense and the protective nature of the court" if the court were made aware of an intention so to use the power, and stood by waiting for it to happen. The present tense in the paragraph must accommodate the court's ability to disapply or modify the power so that, when it is exercised, it is exercised in an appropriately protective manner.</p>

It may not be spelled out explicitly but the language of paragraph 19(3) in particular confirms that intention and understanding: each of the circumstances in which the mandatory requirement can be disapplied clearly envisages court proceedings. I have not found any authority which casts doubt on that understanding. JMK's Power of Attorney has been through no coult process at all. It is not even subject to a system of registration.

In addition, depending on the measures available in a Contracting State's domestic law, 'measures of protection' will not necessarily emanate from a formal judicial or administrative tribunal: eg, an official of a public authority, such as a police officer or social worker, may be empowered under domestic law to take a 'measure of protection' in respect of a child, usually in a situation of urgency.

In essence, a power of attomey is a private arrangement between a donor and his chosen attorney(s). The capacitous donor is making provision for his own affairs. That the arrangements may continue if the donor loses capacity is not sufficient to render them a measure directed to the protection of the person or property of an 'adult.' Therefore, a power of attorney is not susceptible to an application for recognition or enforcement. That conclusion was uncontroversial] <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3 </span>at least until 2017. Where there is no further step of registration of a power of attorney with either a court or an administrative body, it remains uncontroversial.</p>

As such it is suggested that registration or confirmation could only ever render a power of attorney a protective measure where the registration process is directly related to the adult's loss of capacity (and perhaps involves a formal consideration of this by the coun or tribunal undertaking the registration.) Where the confirmation or registration process is not directly related to the loss of capacity (such as happens with an English LPA), it is suggested that this would not be sufficient to transform the power into a 'protective measure.

The evidence is that, at the time of granting the power, TCM was habitually resident in Singapore. The power is therefore not within the requirements of Schedule 3 paragraph 13(1). However, the evidence also indicates that England was not 'a connected country': at the time of granting the power TCM was not a UK national, he was not habitually resident in England and Wales, and he had no property in England and Wales. Moreover, TCM has given no written specification that the law of England and Wales should apply. So the power is not within the requirements of Schedule 3 paragraph 13(2) either. It falls into the lacuna identified at paragraph 22.5 above: Schedule 3 paragraph 13 makes no provision for the law applicable to the "existence, extent, modification or extinction" of this power.</p>

In order to ensure that the exercise ofTCM's power in England and Wales is sufficient to guarantee the protection of his person in equal terms to those provided by the law of England and Wales, it is necessary in my judgment to modify the power so as to make clear specifically that it does not extend to giving or refusing consent to lifesustaining treatment.
