The parties agree that PG lacks capacity in the following respects &#8211; to conduct these proceedings and to enter into an occupancy agreement. The parties agree that she has capacity to make decisions about where she lives. However, the parties disagree about whether PG has capacity in respect of decisions about her care, including when she is within the home, when in the community, and at times of heightened anxiety. They also disagree as to whether she has capacity as to contact with others, including at times of heightened anxiety. </p>

They also illustrate why the LA is concerned about PG&#8217;s safety, and feel the need to be able to intervene, on the basis that she does not have capacity to make the relevant decisions.  I will not reproduce this in its entirety but will set out some parts that show the factual basis of the concerns.</p>

There was then an incident two days later where she got into an altercation with some boys over a beer. There are a series of records during April of her going out and approaching boys/young men. At times she seems to have been intoxicated. On one of these occasions the staff tried to persuade her to leave, but she refused and became increasingly agitated and abusive to staff. The staff called EG and she eventually persuaded PG to go home. On another occasion she called a young man a murderer and staff had to intervene to keep her safe. One time PG approached a young man and asked him to be her boyfriend, the staff had to call the Police to de-escalate the situation and keep PG safe and deter the male from further communications with her. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Jordan King, Highly Specialist Clinical Psychologist at the Intensive Support Team of the Adult Neurodevelopmental Services for the relevant NHS Trust, was involved in PG&#8217;s care between 2018 and the middle of 2022.  He prepared a report for <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/49" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.49</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Capacity Act 2005</ref> (&#8220;MCA&#8221;) purposes. Dr King then produced two further supplementary reports. Dr King has now left the Trust and his report is almost a year old. However, he knew PG well over a period of time, and as such he remained an appropriate witness to consider her capacity. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr King gave oral evidence to the Court and was cross examined. It was clear from his evidence that this is a complex case in respect of PG&#8217;s capacity and that the law&#8217;s desire for clear lines as to both what decisions she does and does not have capacity to make, and in what circumstances she loses capacity, does not fit with the reality of PG&#8217;s presentation. It might be said there was a lack of clarity in Dr King&#8217;s reports, and perhaps shifts in his oral evidence. However, in my view that was not because of any lack of expertise or careful consideration by Dr King, but rather because of the complex interactions in PG&#8217;s presentation and behaviours. It is important to note that Dr King had seen PG at times when she was in a heightened state, after some of the incidents referred to above. Therefore, his evidence was more based on actual observations of PG at critical moments, than is often the case with experts in these cases. </p>

There are more daily elements she had capacity to engage in at the time of the assessment&#8230;although [PG&#8217;s] propensity to become emotionally dysregulated as a consequence of her neurodevelopmental disorders may impact her decision-making ability in situations where she becomes highly anxious&#8230; However, she lacks capacity at all times to make decisions about the support she requires to maintain her safety (and that of others) in the community around traffic because of attentional deficits and/or heightened anxiety attributed to her Intellectual Disability and Autism.&#8221;</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his oral evidence Dr King said that PG would struggle to weigh and understand information when she became dysregulated, but when she is calm she can assess and weigh up risks. This causes an obvious problem for any capacity assessor, because when they are doing the assessment PG may well be calm and capacitous, but that is much less likely to be the case at the actual point of decision making at difficult moments in the community when her safety is at risk. </p>

Even in her placement there have been times when she has become very agitated and caused damage and been violent to staff, and in Dr King&#8217;s view she lacked capacity at those times. He thought that when in risky situations, such as around roads, she lost the ability to weigh and understand information and therefore to keep herself safe. Ultimately Dr King concluded that she did not have capacity in relation to her care at all times in relation to access to the community. </p>

He said that whether PG had capacity during these interactions depended in large part on the degree to which she was heightened. Sometimes her decisions were capacitous but unwise, and at other times she had lost the ability to weigh up the information and the risks. It would only be possible to differentiate if someone spoke to PG at those instances. Dr King said:</p>

It seems to me that the outcome of an anticipatory declaration would provide a proper legal framework for the care team, ensuring that any temporary periods of deprivation of liberty are duly authorised and thereby protecting them from civil liability. In these circumstances, I propose to convene formally a Court of Protection hearing to make an order in the following terms:</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is a complex case because of the nature of PG&#8217;s presentation. In respect of both care and contact with others there are times when the evidence suggests that she does have capacity to make decisions and others when she does not, therefore this is undoubtedly a case of fluctuating capacity. The fluctuations appear to depend on the level of PG&#8217;s anxiety and whether she feels under stress. The situation is made even more complicated by the fact that when PG is in the community, her decision making may also be influenced by the consumption of alcohol. This is, of course, not a ground for finding a lack of capacity under the MCA. However, her consumption of alcohol may itself be influenced by the degree to which she feels anxious and under pressure. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In respect of decisions about both her care and contact with the others, the issue about loss of capacity largely, if not solely, arises when she becomes highly anxious. In relation to contact with others, this will probably only arise when she is in the community because that is when such situations arise. However, in relation to decisions around her care, Dr King&#8217;s evidence is that loss of capacity may also be an issue when she is at home if she becomes agitated and anxious. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I am really faced with a choice between making orders that follow the line of Sir Mark Hedley in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">PWK</span>, and thus taking a &#8220;longitudinal view&#8221; of PG&#8217;s presentation, and which closely relates to Newton J&#8217;s &#8220;macro&#8221; decisions; or that of Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">DN</span> and making anticipatory declarations in respect of when PG has the equivalent of a &#8220;meltdown&#8221;. Having analysed the facts of those cases, and considered those of PG, I do not think that one or other is the correct or indeed better approach. How an individual P&#8217;s capacity is analysed will turn on their presentation, and how the loss of capacity arises and manifests itself.  Both the decisions in issue here are ones that arise on a regular basis and often not in planned or controlled situations. That will influence how decisions about capacity are approached. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In deciding this issue I must have regard to the importance of making orders that are workable and reflect the reality of PG&#8217;s &#8220;lived experience&#8221;, both for the sake of PG and those caring for her. This can be analysed in various difference ways. It is a fundamental principle of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Strasbourg jurisprudence that the Rights should be interpreted in a way which makes them real and practical, not theoretical and illusory. It is a principle of statutory construction that the Court must have regard to the &#8220;mischief&#8221; of the statute. One of the mischiefs of the MCA is to seek to preserve an individual&#8217;s autonomy, but in a way that ensures that when they do not have capacity, their best interests are protected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My concern about making an anticipatory declaration in a case such as this, is that it would in practice be unworkable for those caring for PG. Unlike DN, PG does not have capacity in relation to decisions around her care, both when at home and in the community. Although when calm, she does at times make capacitous decisions within the meaning of section 3(1), I accept Dr King&#8217;s evidence that even when at home, when she becomes anxious and emotionally dysregulated, she loses capacity. This seems to me to be a more fundamental part of her general presentation than was the case with DN. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The issue is even more pronounced in the community and around contact with others. The records suggest that she often makes very unwise decisions about contact with others when in the community. That fact alone naturally does not mean that she does not have capacity, see s.1(4). But the frequent reference to her approaching strange men, and sometimes trying to get into their cars, strongly indicates that she cannot understand or weigh information about those decisions. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It may well be that there are times when her decision making is impacted by alcohol consumption. However, the evidence is clear that her decision making is impacted by her mental impairment under s.2(1) and not simply by consuming excessive alcohol.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not possible to disentangle the influence of alcohol from the impact of her mental impairment. If the evidence was that PG only lacked capacity at times when she is intoxicated then the position would be different, but that is not the evidence. No party argued that the mental impairment has to be the sole cause for the person being unable to make a decision within the meaning of s.3(1). </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the basis of Dr King&#8217;s evidence, I conclude that the primary, though quite possibly not only reason, for PG not having capacity in relation to decisions about contact with others is her mental impairment. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the light of these findings, I consider that the appropriate approach is to take the &#8220;longitudinal view&#8221;. An anticipatory order would in practice be close to impossible for care workers to operate and would relate poorly to how her capacity fluctuates. The care workers would have to exercise a complicated decision making process in order to decide whether at any individual moment PG did or did not have capacity. This might well vary depending on the individual care worker, and how much of the particular episode they had witnessed or not. The result would fail to protect her, probably have minimal benefit in protecting her autonomy and in practice make the law unworkable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, the more practical and realistic approach is to make a declaration that PG lacks capacity in the two key respects, but also make clear that when being helped by the care workers they should so far as possible protect her autonomy and interfere to the minimum degree necessary to keep her safe. </p>
