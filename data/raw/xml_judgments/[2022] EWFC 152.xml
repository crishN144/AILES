I asked Mama to calm down and you were upset again, and I told Mama that it was her that was causing you to be upset.  Mama did not acknowledge this and said she wanted to take you to the hospital immediately.  As I had asked O to contact the police, I told Mama that officials would be arriving very soon, and we could look at how we get support for you and Mama too&#8221;.  </span></p>

British society is now multicultural.  Assessing parents and family members may, quite frequently does, involve considering individuals based anywhere in the world.  I do not believe that the obligation to explore the family option for a child is weakened in any way by geography, although it can provide real challenges to already overstretched resources.  The viability of these options must, from the outset, be evaluated rigorously and reviewed regularly.  The need for such assessments must be addressed at the very beginning of proceedings.  Late identification of potential family carers abroad may bring two fundamental principles of the Children Act into conflict, namely the desirability, if possible, of a child being brought up in its extended family (where parents are for some reason unable to care for the child themselves) and the need to avoid delay in planning for a child&#8217;s future.  Neither principle should be regarded as having greater weight.  The recent reforms to the family justice system have sought to emphasise why it was that the avoidance of delay was given statutory force by the Children Act and the real and lasting harm delay causes to children, particularly in public law care proceedings.  There will, in my judgement, be occasions when the obstacles to assessment of family members abroad create such delays that to pursue the option will be inconsistent with the child&#8217;s own timescales.  These are taxing and exacting decisions, but they require to be confronted with integrity and without sentimentality&#8217;&#8221;.</span></p>

It is proposed that in short course contact can increase to two-hourly sessions in the community progressing to longer activity-based contact, possibly supervised by A&#8217;s foster carer if willing to do so.  The mother&#8217;s contact will be monthly and can take place face-to-face if the mother signs the written agreement.  Until then it will continue by way of video.  The Local Authority should also take steps to encourage a relationship between A and his extended family in the Gabon.  </span></p>

If returned to his mother&#8217;s care then he is, in my judgment, likely to continue to suffer significant physical and emotional harm.  She is likely to continue to hit him too hard.  She is likely to pursue this campaign of trying to prove that he is the victim of sexual assault by F, the foster carer and various staff at after-school clubs and that may extend to others over time.  </span></p>

Having listened very carefully to his evidence and making all due allowances for the fact that his evidence was given through an interpreter; that he was sitting outside of his home using a mobile telephone; that he was given extremely short notice of the Court&#8217;s agreement to hear from him and he was unsupported, I am not able to find that he is a runner as a potential carer.</span></p>
