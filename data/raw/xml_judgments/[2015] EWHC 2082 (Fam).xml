	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Three applications brought on behalf of &#8216;M&#8217; (the Mother) provide the framework for the issues that I am being asked to determine.  The first is an application to discharge a Care Order in respect of &#8216;C2&#8217; granted on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2012.  The second, which is made in the alternative, is an application for contact with C2, she being the subject of an order permitting the Local Authority  to refuse contact with her mother pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">S34 (4)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>.  The Local Authority exercised the permission granted.  Finally, there is an application to discharge a Freeing Order in respect of C2 granted, now some nine and a half years ago, on the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2005.  </p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.49in">It is perhaps important to signal from the outset that Mr William Tyler QC and Mr Phillip Booth, on behalf of the mother, contemplate that a re-opening of the findings will involve &#8216;full re-litigation of the matters underlying the findings&#8217;.  Mr John Hayes QC and Mr. Guy Swiffen, who appear on behalf of &#8216;F2&#8217;, (see below), indicated, in the course of submissions, that a re-hearing would likely require a significant number of witnesses.  Mr Darren Howe QC, who appears on behalf of the children, observes in his Skeleton Argument &#8216;transcripts of the evidence of those witnesses as given to HHJ Dowse are available to be considered by the Court. A full transcript of all the evidence by HHJ Dowse would need to be obtained, there currently being a number of days of the evidence missing from the documents available.&#8217; Later he submits &#8216;if there is to be a review, it will need to be a full review taking into account all the evidence available and the sworn evidence available from the previous hearing&#8217;.  None of those contemplating a review therefore appear to envisage a narrow or tightly circumscribed inquiry.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">So scrupulously have the documents been pared down for the application before me, in compliance with the President&#8217;s Guidance, that it is not possible to track the evolution of these proceedings clearly from the papers filed.  Helpfully, that task has been undertaken by Ms Taryn Lee QC and Miss Fiona Clancy who appear on behalf of the Local Authority.  Ms Lee is particularly well equipped for the challenge here, having appeared in the case before HHJ Dowse.  No Party takes any issue with her summary of the background history and I draw from it extensively. </p>

Theory has it that generally Scottish judicial decisions are not binding on the English courts but have persuasive effect only.  But in actual practice, the weight of authority on this side of the border tends to suggest that certain Scottish judicial decisions, notably those concerned with the interpretation of statutes of common application on both sides of the border, are indeed binding on English courts.&#8221;</span></p>

In the Scottish case of S v D [2006] Fam LR 66 the Sheriff concluded that BIIR did apply when determining jurisdictional disputes between Scotland and England.  In Re ESJ [2008] NI Fam 6, Morgan J took the contrary view as to a jurisdictional dispute between Northern Ireland and England.

Accordingly, I conclude that, given no interpretive question of statute arises here, the Scottish judgment has no legal status.  My conclusion is slightly at variance with that contended for here on behalf of the Applicant mother but I very much doubt that the distinction between us has much, if any, relevance to the resolution of the substantive issue.

Rather, the LA's case against F2 is centred squarely on F2 being married to M combined with his view that she does not present any risk of sexual harm to the children.

The Article is intended to protect the individual and to respect autonomy in the face of arbitrary interference by the state in private and family life.  To be permissible, such interference must pursue one of the legitimate aims laid down in Article 8 (2) and, of course, must be &#8220;necessary in a democratic society&#8221;, that is to say proportionate to the aim pursued.

The criticisms of HHJ Dowse&#8217;s judgment though trenchant and sustained do not go that far.   I do not agree that this comparative exercise permits of a potential conclusion that one judgment should have greater weight than the other.  That is a flawed proposition.  Either one judgment is sustainable and the other is not or, alternatively, the question is whether the fact of the existence of judgments with such profoundly different consequences in and of itself is capable of amounting to a basis upon which to re-open the findings of the English court. </p>

Issues of public policy relating to the priority to be given to earlier court decisions is in play at &#8216;stage one&#8217; of an application to review a finding, when the question of estoppel is considered. Once that stage is passed, and the court is involved in evaluating the evidence itself, it would be wrong to afford some sort of priority to the evidence given and findings made at the earlier hearing that are to be considered within the review. Indeed it would be difficult to do so in any formal way.</span></p>

This means that it may on occasions decline to allow a full hearing of the evidence on certain matters even if the strict rules of issue estoppel would not cover them.  Although some might consider this approach to be a typical example of the lack of rigour which some critics discern in the family jurisdiction, it seems to me to encompass both the flexibility which is essential in children&#8217;s cases and the increased control exercised by the court rather than the parties which is already a feature of the court&#8217;s more inquisitorial role in children&#8217;s cases [&#8230;].&#8217;</span></p>

They are, so far as I am aware, unused in criminal proceedings in this country, and I see strong arguments for imposing restrictions on their use in family cases as well. &#8230; there is a danger that some courts, faced with these difficult decisions, will subconsciously defer to the apparent expert. That danger has been recognised in a number of cases in which the courts have emphasised the discrete roles of the expert and the court. In the case of the veracity expert, the danger is particularly acute. The ultimate judge of veracity, i.e. where the truth lies, is the judge and the judge alone. He cannot delegate that decision to any expert. I acknowledge that a child psychiatrist&#8230; may be able to point out some features of a child's account that add or detract from authenticity... But, in my experience, many of these features should be obvious to judges in any event. No expert, however experienced and however well briefed about the case, will be in a position to say where the truth lies. Only the judge sees and hears all the evidence."</span></p>

At some 323 paragraphs and 103 pages it is self-evidently detailed.  The Sheriff did not think it appropriate for him to read the English judgments at all and was fastidious only to take into account material introduced into evidence or otherwise agreed by the parties.  Accordingly, he was, as he declared, unaware of what material had been taken into account by the English court in reaching its decision.  He was aware however, as he put it, &#8216;that sexual abuse allegations had been the subject of child protection proceedings in England in 2007 which were proved.&#8217;  The inquiry, as I understand it, was reopened because it was agreed by all the parties that the English judgment had no legal status in Scotland.  It appeared to flow logically from that, in the face of the mother&#8217;s continued challenge to the findings of HHJ Dowse, that the findings were not admissible as proof of their contents in Scotland.  Indeed, the Sheriff observes &#8216;The reporter made no attempt to argue that any aspect of the English proceedings concerning the allegations that the mother and her then partner committed sexual abuse against the children was admissible&#8217;.</p>

Put another way, as he himself said, the probability that information attained through poor quality interviews is true is lower than it would be had the information been obtained through good quality interviews.

These are, as I have said, two very separate judgments, in different jurisdictions, applying approaches in law which are not the same and in which the advocates, during the course of the respective hearings, have conducted their cases with contradistinctive forensic emphasis.  In this latter respect I mean the lawyers in each jurisdiction have made their own professional decisions, along with their clients, as to how the case is presented in the courtroom and as to which evidence is put to the assay.    To my mind both judgments have equal validity and ultimately, to engage directly with the questions identified, equal weight and status.  Accordingly, &#8216;solid grounds&#8217; for challenging the findings must lie not within any identified weakness within the English judgment but extraneous to it.  </p>

There was, in that case, a systemic failure to recognise the concept of &#8216;legal status&#8217; as a welfare issue in itself.  The status of the child freed for adoption was intended to be a transitional arrangement confined to children for whom there was a reasonable prospect of adoption within a twelve month period.  It was a facilitative provision designed to expedite the process of adoption and minimise delay to the child.  It was never contemplated as an enduring arrangement.  Once it appeared that there was no reasonable prospect of adoption then the Freeing Order required to be discharged.  As Peter Jackson J observed in A and S v Lancashire:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C1&#8217;s particular circumstances within her placement have not been the subject here of forensic scrutiny, nor do they require any.  It is obvious both from the endurance of the placement and from everything that I have read about it within the papers and in the Guardian&#8217;s report of it, that it has proved to be a secure and loving home which has enabled C1 to begin to recover from a disadvantaged start to life.  Experience within the Family Justice System teaches all involved in it that traumatic experiences in childhood, particularly of the nature found by HHJ Dowse, leave scars which can reopen periodically in later life.  I continue to regard C1 as vulnerable.  In a very short time she will be entering adulthood and leaving care.  Neither she nor I know what that transitional period will hold.  For every child this can be a difficult time but for a child with C1&#8217;s experiences it may be particularly challenging.  By way of parenthesis I would add that the prospect of any further rehearing of her allegations at this time maybe wholly contrary to her welfare interests in a way that she, at 17 years of age, cannot be expected fully to appreciate.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">C1&#8217;s circumstances could not be further from those of A and S in the Lancashire case.  She has found a stability which eluded them.  It is also plain that she has lived in a household which has promoted her sense of independence and encouraged her spirit.  Moreover, far from being supportive of C1&#8217;s placement, the reasoning behind the mother&#8217;s application to discharge the Freeing Order reveals a lack of sensitivity and sound instinct.  It is said to be, in part, motivated by her desire for C1 &#8216;to know that the previous findings that she was involved in sexual abuse of her daughter were entirely wrong&#8217; and that C1 &#8216;has been severely damaged by a wrong belief that [she] abused her in this way&#8217;.  This, coupled with C1&#8217;s consistent and cogently articulated wish that her mother should play no part in her life leads me, with very little hesitation, to conclude that her wishes should be respected on this and are, effectively, determinative.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">My reasoning above however does not resolve the question of C1&#8217;s legal status.  It does not flow axiomatically from those conclusions that the Freeing Order should remain in place.  As I have emphasised, the Order itself has welfare implications.  As P Jackson J says, in the extracts I have quoted above, the involvement of family members, however limited or tightly proscribed, in the lives of children in public care &#8216;can act as a stimulus to good practice&#8217;, an active reminder that the State bears the obligation of doing better than the family could do.  Thus, parents who have significant deficiencies and who, as here, may in the past have caused their children significant harm, achieve a positive contribution merely by virtue of their existence, even if the power or reach of their own rights is all but extinguished.   </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, if there is a regime of statutory obligations imposed upon the Local Authority, in consequence of a Care Order made in their favour, then even if much of the material ordinarily required to be provided to parents is embargoed, restricted or redacted, it nonetheless requires the Local Authority to subject itself to the rigours of those obligations and effectively to monitor itself as a corporate parent.  This is not a mere technicality it is an important discipline to ensure that any child who finds herself in long term care is protected and reviewed in the way that she and the wider public is entitled to expect. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I recognise that all the indicators point to C1 thriving within her foster family, despite the vulnerability of her legal status.  Ultimately she has been lucky, largely I suspect, due to the commitment and love shown by the foster carers.  However, the significance of establishing the correct legal framework is that it should be that which most effectively diminishes risk and promotes welfare.  As C1 faces, in the next few years, the challenges of leaving the care system, the importance of the obligations imposed on a Local Authority under a Care Order are particularly acute.  Compliance with the regulations providing a pathway from the care system, beyond the age of 18 are of crucial importance.  Their very existence has come about as a result of recognition of the particular dangers to vulnerable young adults leaving the care system.</p>

In addition I make orders pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41/section/34/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s34 (4)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41" uk:canonical="1989 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Children Act 1989</ref>, permitting the Local Authority to refuse contact.

I do not contemplate a great deal of information being shared with the mother and I consider that C1&#8217;s views should be given significant weight.  I expect they will be determinative but I do not proscribe that they should be.  In this I am signalling to C1, that like any other young person of her age, responsible adults will continue to have the obligation to help and guide her.  There will be occasions when it is right for their judgement to prevail.  </p>
