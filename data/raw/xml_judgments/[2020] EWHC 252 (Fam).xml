The Claimant was represented before me by Mr Weale, the Defendant acted as a litigant in person. I explained to the Defendant at the start of the hearing that he had a right to be represented and a right to legal aid. He was entirely clear that he wished to proceed with the hearing, and was fully aware of his rights. The Defendant made submissions to me, and gave oral evidence on oath. </p>

The Company&#8217;s sole asset, subject to what I say below, is the Property. Until 2017 the parties were living in the Property and thus it generated no income. However, when they separated they agreed that the Property should be let, and they moved separately into cheaper rented accommodation. It was let, initially using a letting agent John D Wood. The Claimant argues he undertook work on the Property and that the salary was merely recompense for this. He says there was no salary before 2018 because the Company had no income.  </p>

The Company accounts which have been filed make no reference to a liability for any salary. This may not be determinative because it is not clear what the information requirements on the accounts would be, but it is another place where there is a lack of any reference to the salary. The Defendant accepts that the figure of &#163;8,500 per annum was fixed on to be &#8220;tax efficient&#8221; and there is nothing in writing in respect of the amount of the salary. He said in oral evidence that the liability to pay arose annually, but he could take the salary as he wished.  He says that as he was, in effect, contracting with himself he did </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Defendant is correct that a legal liability could arise without any written agreement or documentary evidence of the salary. Documentary evidence is however relevant to whether I accept that the liability did actually exist.  I note that no mention of the alleged right to a salary was made when the Order was made, or in the Defendant&#8217;s Form E. The Defendant said that he was &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; at the Freezing Order hearing and therefore agreed to the Order, but it is surprising that if the Company had a liability to pay him a salary he did not mention that. The first time the salary was mentioned was before Cobb J in December 2019, and the Defendant said he had not realised he could apply to vary the Order. I find this exceptionally difficult to believe, partly because the Defendant is an experienced businessman, but also because he was receiving legal advice on some matters throughout the period as the third issue shows. The correspondence shows that certainly by May 2019 he was aware that he could apply to vary the Order.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">Secondly, the Defendant argues that the payments out of the account was repayment of longstanding loans that he had made to the Company and which had been used to buy properties in the eastern part of Germany in the mid-2000s. Again, there is no documentation to support the argument that these were loans to the Company, when and in what sum they had taken place, and what the terms of repayment (if any) were. The first time the alleged loans were raised was on 12 January 2020. They are not mentioned in the Form E, although on the Defendant&#8217;s case now they plainly should have been.  </p>

However, the documentation from these firms is all directed personally to the Defendant, and makes no mention of being in respect of advice to the Company. The Defendant has not produced any client care letters, or letters of instruction, or any other documentation, that suggests that the Company was instructing these firms and incurring a liability to pay fees. </p>

I have referred above to Judge Meston&#8217;s findings on credibility in the Welfare Proceedings, and I entirely agree with them. The Defendant, in my view, was making matters up as he went along as excuses for using the money in the account as he wished and then hoping to persuade a court there was no breach of the Order. There is nothing to suggest there was ever an agreement for a salary, and importantly the suggestion of a salary was only raised in December 2019. I have no doubt that if there had been a liability for a salary the Defendant would have raised it when the Order was made. He is an intelligent man, who has considerable familiarity with law and with business affairs. In my view the alleged right to a salary was made up at the point when the Defendant wanted to draw money for his living expenses. There is no automatic right to a director getting a salary from a company, and I do not accept the Company had any liability to pay a salary. In any event, even if I am wrong on this, the payments out were well in excess of &#163;8,500. </p>

As I understood the Defendant, the loans were very longstanding, dating back to the 2000s when the German properties were purchased. There was nothing in writing to explain the terms of the alleged loans, whether interest was payable, and the terms of any repayment. It seems to me far more likely that the properties were bought as an investment and there was no agreement that the money invested would be repaid as a loan on demand. The intricacies of the </p>

However, I do not believe the story about there being loans which the Company had a liability to repay to the Defendant on demand. If the money had been paid as loans I would expect clarity on the terms of repayments, but also such loans should have been mentioned in the Form E. Again, in my view the evidence points inexorably to the Defendant having made up the loans to justify taking money from the Company account, in clear breach of the Order.  </p>

The documentation from the solicitors all refers to the Defendant and not the Company and I have seen nothing that suggests that the firms were instructed on behalf of the Company. The solicitors firms involved are major firms, doubtless with very careful invoicing procedures. If the bills were owed by a company then that would have been recorded.  </p>

	    <p style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0in">The Defendant&#8217;s argument about being impecunious and needing the money for he and Philipp to live are largely if not wholly irrelevant to the question before me today as to whether he knowingly breached the Freezing Order. He did not apply to vary the order, until he was before Cobb J.  In any event, I find it highly unlikely that he has a legally binding agreement to pay his new partner rent for living in her house. That appears to me to be the type of non-commercial arrangement which is well known in the world of housing benefit, and gives rise to no legal liability, if such an agreement existed at all. As for whether the Defendant has other sources of income I find that impossible to know. The Defendant&#8217;s finances are extremely opaque. There is the Citibank account which still has a large balance in it.  </p>

The application gives the range of the dates, and the allegation of breach is that throughout this period the Defendant withdrew sums of varying amounts in breach of the Order. The dates therefore cover a period, rather than one specific day, and there is therefore no defect in the application.  </p>
